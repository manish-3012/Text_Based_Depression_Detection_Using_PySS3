I'm really thinking about it this time [trigger warning. Duh.]I want to cry at the thought of leaving my baby (I have a bird, she's my life). But people are just... so fucked. I don't see an end. There isn't anything that really makes me want to commit suicide in particular. I just started thinking about it again a couple of weeks ago, and last night I was really sure I wanted to go through with it. I still am. 

I had hope three years ago - the last time I attempted -  when I started on medication and got a therapist and I thought, maybe it really will end. But it hasn't. I've had some ups, but mostly downs, and now that college is coming and no university will accept me because of this stupid disease, I realize that I can never escape depression. Unless I die. 

I can't tell my counselor. The words don't come out. I feel like I'm just attention-seeking. I've felt numb since last night. My limbs are heavy, and I'm resigned to the fact that I am going to die. You can't get guns here though, which means I'll have to do it a messy way. Probably by slitting my wrists or ODing, but maybe I could manage to jump in front of a bus or something. I don't know. 

I'm going to go home today and work on melting my shavers so I can get the razors out of them. I don't know that I could cut deep enough. I'm not very strong.
