There's nothing holding me back form dying so why aren't I dead yetIve been struggling with various mental illnesses, abusive situations and a basically shitty life since I was 9. Ive thought about suicide in depth, I know how to end it and the only thing stopping me is myself. I just want to overcome that feeling and finally be free.
