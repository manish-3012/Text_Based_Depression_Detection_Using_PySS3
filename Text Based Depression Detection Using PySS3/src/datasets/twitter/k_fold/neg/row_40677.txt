Self destructing.Im self destructing. Ate food fit for 10 people nonstop for the past 2 weeks. Fridge empty. I feel like an addict. Spending money i dont even have,im broke. I feel so guilty. Im jobless. I don't even have clothes or shoes to wear, theres no dish soap and im running out of toothpaste, and I spent what i did have on food, one of the sources of my depression. I could be giving what little i have left to help my mom pay for expenses for allowing my grown self to live rent/expense free. I dont know why she puts up with me. With good reason im being threatened with being put out. Shes not going to be around forever,i have to suuport myself. Im an adult still being supported, can't hold down a steady job. Cant go outside and no normal things from bad social anxiety. Worthless. No one to talk to. I don't have a friend or relative i can call to even say good morning. People alienate u when they sense your depression. Desperately lonely. I want therapy, desperately tried to get an appnt but when ur uninsured there's only so much help u can get. Just swallowing pills isn't helping me. I really want help. I want to get better. But I'm starting to feel tired from fighting for the will to live. I still want to though. I just need help.
