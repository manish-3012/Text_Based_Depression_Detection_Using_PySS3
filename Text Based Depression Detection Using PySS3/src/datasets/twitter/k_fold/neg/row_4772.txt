I want to die, but I don't know if I can go through with itIâ€™m posting this here because Iâ€™m not sure who I want to talk to, if anyone. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for a little while now, probably 2 months, though looking back I realise it was a pretty steady decline over more than a month. After a while I isolated myself and havenâ€™t seen many people. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore; everything seems like work. I keep thinking about suicide â€“ how would I do it, should I do it, how bad could it be? I have a plan but itâ€™s not very good, but today I came very close to going through with it. If my family didnâ€™t exist Iâ€™d probably not be here right now, but Iâ€™m not sure I could put them through that. Fundamentally I think Iâ€™ve realised that I just donâ€™t want to be in control of myself anymore, but I donâ€™t want to face the consequences for anything. I donâ€™t want to exist, but I donâ€™t want to do something that Iâ€™ll have to then explain. I just want to die peacefully, now.

I also donâ€™t really want to talk to anyone. Iâ€™m tired of talking to people. I want someone to drag these feelings out of me, to show they care. I donâ€™t want to burden someone with this if they donâ€™t want it. I went to the doctor yesterday and spoke about some of what I was feeling, but I wasnâ€™t very forthcoming and I donâ€™t want to go back and say that I didnâ€™t tell the whole truth about how I was feeling. A lot of places recommend calling some kind of service, and frankly that sounds terrible to me. I donâ€™t want to call anyone or speak to them on the phone. I guess some of it is that I donâ€™t want to help myself. I donâ€™t care, and trying to help myself just sounds like work.  It would be so much easier just to end my suffering. I donâ€™t really know what to do.

I donâ€™t want to talk to any of my friends because I worry that Iâ€™ll just get a barrage of questions and judgements that will just make me feel worse. Itâ€™s why I havenâ€™t spoken with all but one of them in weeks. I suppose I donâ€™t really know what I want, but maybe you can help.
