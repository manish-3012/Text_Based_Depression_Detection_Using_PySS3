Back in September last year I tried to kill myself because of social anxiety around girls which left me in coma for two weeks in a half and hospitalized for in total of a month and a half. And I'm already feeling suicidal again.Pretty much the title. I tried to kill myself using antidepressants, because of my social anxiety around girls which led to me commiting many faults and the fact that I commited many wrongdoing when I was in middle and high school which led to people who hated me to make contact with people from my university which led to many girs to be turned off by me as well. And since I feel so sorry and don't want to be remembered as that guy and I don't think there is a way for myself or my life to get better I think that the only way for me is suicide...
