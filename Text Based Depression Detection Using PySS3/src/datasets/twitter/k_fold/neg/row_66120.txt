I know how Iâ€™m going to kill myself.But Iâ€™m really fucking scared. Iâ€™ve debated forever if I kill myself what method I wanted to use, when I wanted to do it, and tons of other logistics- and I finally have it sorted out. But Iâ€™m just scared and I feel weak for being so cowardly. Iâ€™m scared of it going wrong, Iâ€™m scared of what will happen if it goes wrong, Iâ€™m scared of it going right and that Iâ€™ll be conscious for my death or thatâ€™ll be long and painful. I just scared. And I wish I wasnâ€™t scared. People who say that suicide is the easy way out have no fucking ability of putting themselves in other peopleâ€™s shoes. This is the hardest decision Iâ€™ve ever had to made. I just need to power through and I hate being scared. Why canâ€™t this actually be simple?
