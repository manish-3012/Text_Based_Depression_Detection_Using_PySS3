tiny rantsocial anxiety, depression, no goals, no apirations, no motivation no nothing. being forced to look for jobs, present what jobs I applied for, talk to companies in person etc. it's too much. especially when I don't know what I Want to do and I have no education(also I don't want a job it sounds like and is a pain until you die).

I have anxiety 24/7h now, if nothing sucks RIGHT NOW, there is something tomorrow. Or the day after that. Or at most next week. I'm in constant anxiety, if I have to go apply for a job or something I feel naseus can barely eat breakfast and shiver while I try to eat.
I just can't take it anymore. I'm too much of a pussy to actually kill myself especially when certain people are still alive. But I can't take it anymore. Each day is so hard. I want to stay in bed and cry all day(if I could bawl my eyes out and not just get two tears out).
I don't want to live. I am not fit to live. I pray for death every day. I can't take i anymore it's been 23 years. Life will never be better. And it's not worth living with constant anxiety. I wish I was dead so bad. I want to die. Please. I wish I had a gun. blow my fucking brains out
