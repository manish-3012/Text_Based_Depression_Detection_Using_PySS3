I don't want to really do it, but wish to do it.It may be stupid for some, not for me. I'm in my mid twenties and in my 9th semester of law school. One semester to go. I got my makes for an exam yesterday and it's horrible. Barely 50 percent. I just wonder why this happening. I put a lot of effort and this happens. For 8 semesters I did everything to do well but I'm still just above average. Yesterday's marks just makes me think is there any point in anything. All the hard work goes if a teacher thinks that has to happen. I broke up with my gf of a long distance relationship a few months ago. She never really helped. I would tell hermy problems and I'll know what she will say. She tries to be supportive. But her answers weren't enough. I don't have a lot of friends. I have a few friends from school I'm close to but I feel I'm in their circle just because ive been in their circle for so long and they don't want to say anything about it. My college friends suck. I got like two friends who talk to me. Im in too much pressure. The world is cruel. I don't wanna work hard anymore as I work and work and still don't get very good results. I think of dying but I don't think I have the courage to go through it all. I can't think what my family think and what everyone will think. An uncle of mine killed himself a few years ago. I'm so lonely. But I don't wanna see anyone. Everyone is busy to talk to me. I think I'm an embarrassment to my family. I don't have a goal. I just wanna survive. So I got no real friends, no love, no goal and I don't know what to do. I'm just tired of working. How will it feel to die I wonder. I'm anyway empty inside. Only thing wanting me to live is the fear of death. The fear of ending things.
