I don't know what to do. It feels like my world just ended.My girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me about 3 weeks ago.  She had told me a long time ago she knew I was the one she was going to marry.  I finally decided I would propose at Electric Forest this year, in 2 months.  It was something we always did together.  We still stay at the same place while we figure stuff out with the lease and our shared stuff. 

For a while recently, she's been hanging out with this guy from work. Since before we were broken up.  She spends a few hours with him every day.  Tonight, she told me she was staying at her parents.  On my way back from the bar, I see her car parked outside his place.

I couldn't stop thinking about it, i was going crazy.  It's 4 am, i just got back from driving by, her car is still there.

I don't know what to do. I've lost everything.  She's the only one I had to confide in, the one that supported me through my depression.  I don't want to feel like this anymore.

I don't know what to do.

I don't want to live anymore.
