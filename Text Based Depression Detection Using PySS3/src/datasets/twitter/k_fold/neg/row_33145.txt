Iâ€™m just confused(F15) Nothing has ever felt real or genuine to me. From a young age iâ€™ve had social anxiety because iâ€™ve always been nervous of how people were going to react to the things i say or do and i could always tell whether or not it was fake or not. This has forced me to grow into a mindset that labels every little positive interaction with myself as a lie. my boyfriend tells me they love me and i think itâ€™s a lie, my mom tells me sheâ€™s proud and i think itâ€™s a lie, etc. i donâ€™t even have enough motivation in me to get help for it. i donâ€™t want to accept any advice and i brush every ounce of encouragement off.

iâ€™m ready to die. if iâ€™m not going to accept or seek help, iâ€™m never gonna be helped. i put myself in an impossible situation. i abused my boyfriend and shattered his heart, i neglected my friends that didnâ€™t like me anyways, i have no supportive family, iâ€™m drowning in school, iâ€™m lazy, i have no future, blah. not to mention my undiagnosed and untreated mental problems that my parents donâ€™t believe in. itâ€™s just hard. iâ€™m just ready to go. i know im ready now because death doesnâ€™t scare me anymore. i always told myself that, the day before i killed myself, i would live my life to the ABSOLUTE fullest. i donâ€™t even have the urge to do that anymore, so i know now is the time to do it. thank you all for listening.
