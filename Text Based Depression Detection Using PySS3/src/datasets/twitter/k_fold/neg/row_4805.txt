Please Help a Fellow Redditer (Link In Description)I found and had a short comment thread with someone on r/self who is contemplating suicide. I'm doing my best to help talk to him but I feel like I'm out of my depth, and I'm not the best person for this job. If some of you guys could please talk to him, and help him that would be amazing. Here's a link to the post:
