Motivational content is too broad to actually motivate mePretty much every post on r/GetMotivated and the majority of replies I get when stating I myself always seem to make a lot of assumptions about me and my current situation that simply aren't true.

People will say "aw, you're not ugly, I bet you're really pretty" except no, I'm not. I hate the way I look and no amount of fake it till you make it can fix that. At this point it feels less compassionate and just plain condescending, like I can't make a reasonable judgement on how good I look. If only my opinion of myself is supposed to matter then why do people throw that idea out the window the moment I say I hate my body?
