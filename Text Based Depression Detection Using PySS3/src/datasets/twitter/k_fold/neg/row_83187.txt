I came to this page and cried, let me know if you need a shoulder Though I am no longer suicidal, I absolutely remember how it felt. Hopeless, like being stuck at the bottom of a well. I never knew about this subreddit before today, and I have mixed emotions. I am thrilled that something like this is provided for people who need it. I am horrified as to how many people are so close to doing something so drastic and final.. and I would love to know if anyone has been helped by something they saw here. What shocked me most was seeing all the posts with no comments, people desperately reaching out and finding nothing.. I want to help.. so please, if you need a friend or someone who has been there, message me. I want to help.
