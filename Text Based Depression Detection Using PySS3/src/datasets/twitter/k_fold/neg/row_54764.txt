everyone is the samewhat is the point? do you see all these fucking posts? in this sub? because i have read so many and i have posted so many over and over again. and it never gets better. we all want to die, some of us successfully do it and it never stops. 

a friend of mine killed himself about a week ago. i've ..ironically talked a lot of my friends out of suicide multiple times before. but i couldn't get to him. i never got the chance. and now he's dead. he is gone, for good. and that's fucking life i guess. and if that is what this world has come to, why even bother? i can't do this anymore. i feel like i don't recognize anyone and everyone gets on my nerves. i just want to be done with it all. my doctor wants to put me on prozac and i don't even want to bother with that shit. fuck. 

im sorry if this doesn't make much sense, i'm.. pretty baked right now. (i've been using weed to cope ha)
