I'm fucking up my kids.I have two boys, youngest is almost 3 &amp; eldest is almost 6.
Me &amp; their dad are together, I think.
We've been together for over 7 years but, by the way things have always been, I'm always fucking everything up. Tonight, I think he decided he doesn't want to put up with how I am anymore. I'm fucked up, I know I am &amp; I'm done.
I used to self harm to cope but tbh that just isn't enough anymore.
Since having our boys I just can't seem to stop thinking about how fucked up I'm making their lives. I try so hard, I really fucking do, I'm always told how great of a mum I am, but yet I KNOW I'm a completely horrible mum. 
I want to just let them live &amp; be happy without me but the fear of them feeling guilty &amp; thinking it's their fault really frightens me.
My dad left my mum when I was about 2 years old &amp; I still feel guilt, I still feel like if I wasn't here then my mum &amp; dad would still be happy.
FUCK!
I need to get out of this but
I need to know that my boys will be ok.
