Suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems.There is so much wisdom in that sentence.

No matter what your problems are, not matter how old or young you are, what your race or gender is, how successful or fucked-up you are, suicide is always an option. Knowing that you could end your own life whenever you wanted is so comforting feeling.

Suicide is permanent solution, because death is permanent.

All problems are temporary, because life itself is temporary.


I don't see suicide as inherently bad. If I saw it that way, I would have to agree that death is also bad.

Death isn't inherently bad. Life isn't inherently good either.

It's just a natural order of things in the Universe.

Universe isn't good. Universe isn't bad or evil either.

Universe is just cold and uncaring infinity.

The only thing that matters is reducing the suffering.
But any suffering, no matter how painful, cannot last forever. Because life is temporary.

We are all just temporary.

Everything will end one day. And I am grateful for that.
