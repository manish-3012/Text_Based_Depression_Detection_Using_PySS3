Recently saw a friend attempt. It's brought back a lot of memories of my own attempts and I'm back in that place again.I have a fairly long history of nearly constant suicidal ideation (ages 10 to 28) and a number of serious suicide attempts in that time. 
I survived all that, somehow and for the last 2 years, I've been actually "pretty good", it was about a year ago I realized that I hadn't thought of ending my life once in the prior week and that was an incredibly satisfying realization. 

I don't think I've ever been completely free of this, but there is a difference between "my life, sucks, I should end it" once a week and constantly planning / searching for methods that takes over my life. 

But a few weeks back, I saw a friend attempt, stopped it, took them to the ER, stayed with them during intake and visited them quite a bit while they were housed in inpatient. 

For most of it, I was thinking that I should be the one that was locked up and I kept on walking up to the nurse's station, wanting to tell them they should hold me, but I couldn't find the guts to do it. 

After we left the hospital, I had a bit of a breakdown. I kept a fairly decent "I'm ok" face on, but underneath, I'm a complete mess. The ideation and searching for methods has come back and there has been a fair amount very intense depersonalization as well, the strength of which is new - as well as immense issues with concentration and a feeling of falling if I'm not moving.  

Anyone else go through a similar experience? Any advice?
