How can I justify livingHonestly... I donâ€™t think I can anymore. I have no friends, nobody to be close to even remotely. Iâ€™m a ghost to everyone I interact with dailyâ€”or worse they just want me to go the fuck away. Iâ€™ve destroyed friendships recently beyond repair and I canâ€™t get over them (said friendships destructions also inhibiting new friendships). Iâ€™m going through a dry-spell and it doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m fucking disgusting to look at (and that I have a beige personality). I just got handed a huge fuck you career-wise, and Iâ€™m studying something in college now thatâ€™ll get me nowhere in life (acting? Really? Thought thatâ€™d be useful?). The whole climate of the world and the politics in the US leave me fucking disgusted. Whatâ€™s the point?

Iâ€™ve harassed people I really cared about. Iâ€™m trash of a human. I have literally no positive traits, Iâ€™m only negatives. I have one commitment left and when thatâ€™s done in two weeks Iâ€™m probably going to kill myself if I canâ€™t justify living. Iâ€™m just not a good person. I contribute nothing to society. Iâ€™m like an apathetic mole on the asscheek of society. Itâ€™s not that nobody would care that I was gone, theyâ€™d take it as a source of relief. Thank god that fuckâ€™s gone. He was a shithead.

Iâ€™m only cons. No pros. Canâ€™t wait until December
