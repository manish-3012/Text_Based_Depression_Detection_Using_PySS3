I'm not afraid to die just afraid of failing and painThis is by no means a plea for help. I've been thinking about suicide for a long time, intermittently of course with intensity following traumatic episodes. Truthfully, on a philosophical level I feel ready to die. I don't have motivation to live on as I view myself as an ethical problem in the first place, just by the fact that I'm alive and contributing to the suffering of others just by merit of that. Also, I have no true close friends and the man I have feelings for has been driven to exhaustion by me. Another reason. My family would do better financially and morally without me. There's no one who needs me or depends on me aside from my plants whom I can give to charity. Death is my choice and it's been calling for quite sometimes.

The problem is that non assisted suicide comes with a set of risks I'm very scared of. 1) ending up with brain damage 2) accidentally hurting others in the process. I feel trapped in my human body. I want to escape. I wish society made it easier to opt out instead of guilt tripping us that we should stay alive and that a life of misery is better than going out gracefully and leaving people the best version of yourself. Which is what I want.
