I cant anymoreEvery night all I can think about is downing a bottle of painkillers and just waiting for the fatal liver failure to kill me. Every night all I can do is just think about how lonely I am, and if I'll ever not feel lonely. At this point the only think that has kept me from doing it is the depression and existential dread. We only live to die, that's it, so is it even worth it to live at all if we will inevitably die.
