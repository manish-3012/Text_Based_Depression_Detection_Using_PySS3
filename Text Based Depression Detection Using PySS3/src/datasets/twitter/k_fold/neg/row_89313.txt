Willing myself to die...On December 13th, if net neutrality is overturned, I will will myself to die. No food, no drink, no sleep, until I slip away from this soulless and pathetic world. My video games are my life, and they are the only things that can break thru the SSRI's and make me feel again. Without them, my life is pointless. I'm a homeschooled ugly fat little coward with autism, so I'll never get ahead. I'm too sad to cry anymore. So if you can, try and stop the FCC for good. Of course they'll keep trying, but having net neutrality overturned would be the last straw...
