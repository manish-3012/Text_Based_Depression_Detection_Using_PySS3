I just don't want to do it anymore.There's so many people around me, but all I feel is alone. Nobody cares about who I am, they only see who they want me to be. Im tired of it. I don't sleep. And no matter how much I try Im just never good enough for anybody. I feel so isolated. I just want to sink into the ground and never be found. I don't even know why I'm here, like some how typing it out to a whole bunch of strangers is gonna help. I'm not suicidal I just need to tell someone.
