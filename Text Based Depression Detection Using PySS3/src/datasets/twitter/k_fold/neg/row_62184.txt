Lil help with medical rules?Depression is sorta a family thing, though I'm the only one in my imidiate family, yes I know I should talk to my parents about it but dad thinks he's a fuck up as a parent from just my sister's eating disorder so I'm not gunna. What I would like to know is if I went to my doc and asked him to keep it between us, as a minor, would he? Or would he just go to my parents about it? 
The things I've found on it have said both so could someone who actually knows say?
