Looking for help locating a suicide noteI have posted to this sub Reddit a few times in the past (but always) delete the post son after, but have found it to be helpful.

My father committed suicide while I was young, I was not living with him at the time as my parents were divorced. Years later I found out he left a suicide note which I would very much like to see. I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me any advice on how to locate this. I have been told that suicide notes would be kept along with coroner and police records. I live in the UK, I have tried contacting the police and the registry office but they have asked for more information than I have. All I have is his name and date of death, but they have stated they would need more information that could be found on his death certificate, like the location of death and name of coroner. I have no other family members I can ask for this information. If anyone would be able to give me any advice I would really appreciate it, it is something I have longed to see for a very long time.
