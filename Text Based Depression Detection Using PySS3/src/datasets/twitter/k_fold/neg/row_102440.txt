Alternative SuicideSuicide, the Off game button over the console. Many times I wished I just be brave and just do it. But there it was, the fear of not doing it successfully and getting myself living as a vegetable in a bed and looking at my relatives judge me for what Iâ€™ve tried to accomplish.

I found that there is a better alternative to suicide, is **Carelessness of life**: 

To be indifferent to any danger or threats. Nothing matters, if you kill me, great. If you donâ€™t well something will take me anyway. I want to be dead and to forget about this shitty existence but a better strategy is to wait for death to decide when. I donâ€™t care.

Better to be killed by something or someone than doing it yourself. Is a cleaner way to go.
