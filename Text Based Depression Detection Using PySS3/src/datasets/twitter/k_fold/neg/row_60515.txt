The End. Thanks for your concern but I am finished.Tonight the gears are finally in motion and life is interesting at last. I've been planning this for days and tonight is the night. I will overdose on heroin and be at peace. I'm tired of always being the second friend to people, I never receive any love or compassion and am generally dissatisfied with my life. I miss the times when I had fun with friends, walking around the city, smoking pot and just being a kid in his late teens. Now those times are gone and everyone has moved on, the girl I thought loved me shut me out of her life completely, which brought me in to a rebound relationship that lasted way too fucking long and now I'm done. Goodbye, everyone.
