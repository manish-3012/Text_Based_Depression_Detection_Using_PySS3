Grad school is killing meIâ€™m in the last year of grad school and Iâ€™m at a breaking point. My prof is the worst person Iâ€™ve ever met. He lied to me about my project and tricked me into taking something I never wanted to study. He destroyed my self esteem in my first year (every question I asked was â€œstupidâ€ and all he did was scream about how I was messing up the easiest things). Heâ€™s never around and then tells me not to waste his valuable time with my problems. He doesnâ€™t read studentsâ€™ thesis or papers. And now I just found out that, unless I want to pay $3000 for an extra semester, I have to take a class that is over an hour away on a topic that makes me physically ill (the practical work leaves me feeling so sick that I canâ€™t be work for the rest of the day). I canâ€™t drop out of the program since Iâ€™m 3/4 of the way done but Iâ€™m so miserable that itâ€™s ruining the rest of my life. I just feel trapped and only see one way out
