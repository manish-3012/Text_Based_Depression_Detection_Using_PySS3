I am so tired.I always disappoint people, and I think they deserve so much better without me. To be honest, I'm just afraid to do 'it' but I've thought about OD'ing. So many times. I don't know what to do. I can't sleep at night and if I ever do, it's because my eyes were so tired of crying. I just let down someone I love last night, not and never on purpose, but I believe I said something wrong and now I don't know how to make it up to him 'cause we're apart. His birthday's coming up in a week and I don't want to ruin it like the hurricane I am.
