I shouldnâ€™t sleep in this bedroomThere are guns in here. And Iâ€™m all alone because my significant other wants nothing to do with me. Itâ€™s not his fault. Heâ€™s not responsible for my mental health; I already know that and he has reminded me multiple times. I wish he at least gave a damn though, or would take my advice on things he could do to help. 

Itâ€™s not his fault. For some reason since age 10, Iâ€™ve had this voice in my head telling me to die. Telling me to kill myself. I donâ€™t know why or where it started, but Iâ€™ve heard it often. Itâ€™s fucked up, but I used to wish someone would touch me or hurt me just I would have a real excuse to do it. Just like some people canâ€™t even fathom taking their own lives, some of us have always been inclined to. I wish I didnâ€™t think it so often. I wish the normal stress of everyday life didnâ€™t cloud my vision and make that voice grow louder. I wish that it would stop being the first thing I think of when something gets hard. I wish I wasnâ€™t always looking for excuses and reasons to do it.

I canâ€™t tell him because heâ€™ll think Iâ€™m just trying to get attention. Heaven forbid I tell anyone I know and end up on a psych ward again. So here  I am telling you and typing and letting it out. I donâ€™t think tonight will be the night. I would  prefer pills or sticking a needle into my arm over a firearm, but by the time I got that figured out Iâ€™d be a bit stronger than I am right now. Maybe if I go to sleep with my back to the closet door, I can forget that they are there.
