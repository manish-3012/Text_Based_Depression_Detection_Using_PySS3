Regression imminent; hope is lost.A couple of weeks ago, I started to feel depressed. This wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary if it wasn't for the suicidal feelings along with the depression. I was extremely suicidal at one point. I wanted nothing more than to end my wretched existence. I received help and treatment, and with time got back on track. Now I feel like I've gone back to square one. All of my self-destructive habits are back in full force, and I'm not sure how long it'll be before I start attempting suicide again. I would seek treatment, but due to time and money constraints, I can not. My academic progress is essentially halted, and I have no desire to keep trying. I've been here before during my first battle with depression, and I received a lot of support. I appreciate any help I can get now. Thank you.
