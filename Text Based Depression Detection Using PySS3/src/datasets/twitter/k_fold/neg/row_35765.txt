im tiredit all hurts so much tonight. things have been getting worse but i know iâ€™m just the cause of it all and i donâ€™t have the capacity to fix it. nobody actually wants to believe that i feel how i do. im just trying to stay alive for my grandpa and thats proving harder than anything. there is never a time when im not in my head about everything and its separated me from my perception of it all and i just feel so lost. i donâ€™t think i can push on further. i donâ€™t even know whats wrong. but i hope everyones having an okayish morning, afternoon or evening, thank you for being a safe place for many.
