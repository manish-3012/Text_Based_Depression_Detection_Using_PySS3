I feel like I have no fight left in me.I'm not actively in crisis. I'm not upset. I'm not freaking out. I self-harmed earlier, but I'm fine now. 

I just feel empty. I feel dejected, alone, and hopeless.

I have survived through so much trauma and adversity in my life. I was called a warrior, a trooper, and to this day people praise me for my resilience. I can always rally, no matter what. I used to be called "sparkly" because that's what my personality was like. That spark has gone out.

I don't want to fight anymore. I just want everything to end. I need my brain to quiet down. There's situations in my life triggering the pain that triggers the suicidal feelings. It isn't the situations that are causing the suicidality. It's the resultant OCD, anxiety, depression, BPD, and eating disorder. And the overwhelming feeling of not being able to cope.

I don't want to kill myself. I know that isn't the answer. But I don't know what is. 

It just feels like all my will to live, to fight, to try and be strong, is gone. All I can do is cry intermittently, pick fights, and be subsumed by increasingly intense OCD and anxiety and my eating disorder voice.

Who else feels the same, or knows what I mean?

I am not in imminent danger. I just don't want to fight anymore.
