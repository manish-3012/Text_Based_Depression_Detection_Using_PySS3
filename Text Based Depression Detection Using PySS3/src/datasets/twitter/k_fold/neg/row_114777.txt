HiSo, i am 17 years old and i dont know whatâ€™s up with me basically. I am overall a pretty happy dude besides some times i feel really sad and lonely but the point is, im having this one fucking problem for about some years now, i feel like everyone thatâ€™s interested in me in any way and thatâ€™s giving me any sort of attention just does it because they feel bad for me, and not because they actually care about me and appreciate spending time with me. I think i might feel like this because i basically just hate myself, im not good at anything and i just keep destroying whatâ€™s good around me. To give you an example i have this one friend who i consider to be my best friend (btw i forgot to say this earlier but i am a very picky person with who i stay with, tbh i only really enjoy a few people and heâ€™s one of them, if not the only one) and since we dont live close to each other when weâ€™re out drinking or having fun we chat and send each other fun shit, i love the fact that even if heâ€™s having fun with his friends he still thinks about me and does not forget about me, but the point is that EVERYTIME he does this i feel like he meant to send those messages to someone else. The reason im posting this here itâ€™s because im starting to feel like this problem is not letting me live anymore, and if iâ€™ll ever kill myself iâ€™ll do it with a smile on my face cause this feeling , even though it sounds like â€œnot a big dealâ€, is making me feel like thereâ€™s nothing left to live for. Another thing i forgot to mention is that i rarely feel really connecting with someone , but when i do i become pretty obsessed with that person. I dont know if this thing is related to the problem but whatever.
