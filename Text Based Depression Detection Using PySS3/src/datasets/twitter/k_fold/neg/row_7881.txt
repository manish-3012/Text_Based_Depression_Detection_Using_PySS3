Breaking with my love becauseI dont feel like I have any choice. I feel like I make his life miserable and I hate that. I am so in love with him ( we are engaged) but maybe he is better without me. I bring him only problems and trouble. He is so amazing, smart, hot, caring, hardworking and I am stupid girl that brings him only pain. He once told me he isn't too perfect for me but honestly I feel he is.
