doing it on vacationI'm currently on a family trip in Cancun and I tried, I really did, but I  still just can't be fucking happy. I'm in a beautiful place surrounded by people who care but the feeling of loneliness, the creeping feeling of desolation never ceases. I guess that at the root of the problem is that I feel alone. It's stupid and ridiculous and there are people out there with real, tangible problems and here I am wallowing in despair because I can't find a fucking relationship. Just someone who loves me for who I am and not because I carry their family name. Someone who I can talk to and be honest with. It's not even about sex, I just wish I could find someone who I make happy. I'm only 19 but watching my friends and peers go on and form connections with others even though I know that for many of them it isn't easy. They're stronger than me. The dirge of anxiety rings in my head with every conversation, every passing glance. Goddamn I live in my head. I'm not good enough, not smart enough, not happy enough. Who wants to be with someone who's sad? Not me. No, not me. Not anymore.
