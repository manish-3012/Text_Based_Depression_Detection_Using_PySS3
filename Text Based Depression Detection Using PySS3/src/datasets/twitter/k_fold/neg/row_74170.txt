I hate SOCIETY and how easily life can get screwed up.I can get arrested for something I didn't do? I can have probation for it and be happy it gets dismissed when I didn't do it to begin with? I have to live with PTSD from the HORRIBLE police and their treatment of me, when they forgot it's innocent until proven guilty? I can have my face put in the paper? My friend can get shot and killed and the criminal who did it can get away with it? I can have all of MY YEARS of school down the drain and keep a 200k loan? I can keep a terrible marriage where the other person doesn't care? And I'm going to hell for doing anything stupid like ending my own life? Well, I suffer from passive suicide ideation and NO, I won't do anything, nor do I really want to do anything, I'm just sick of LIFE and wish things were different. I hate my situation. I'm absolutely depressed about it.
