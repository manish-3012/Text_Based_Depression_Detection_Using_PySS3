I am nothingFor the past month I have been very suicidal, I was very close to flipping my car on the highway today while going 110 mph. I have major depressive disorder and anxiety, and lately I have been burning and cutting myself. I am nothing but a burden and a waste of space. I am full of guilt for thinking about this selfish act and hurting my friends and family, but I feel that it is my only release. I've been giving away my possessions, I won't need them anymore. I'm 21 years old and I've never been in a relationship because I hate myself and I hate my body- I am ugly inside and out. I have amazing friends and family but I can't help but feel completely alone. Could I pay someone to kill me or is there a painless way I could do it myself? I've been planning to do it in two weeks so I can have time to say goodbye and get my affairs in order.
