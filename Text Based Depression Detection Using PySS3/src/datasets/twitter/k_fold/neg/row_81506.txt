Please someone help meI can feel myself getting worse and worse as the days, weeks, and years go on. Nowadays I cannot function independently. Sometimes I need help getting dressed and showering because I fall into such a deep trance. I am unemployed, friendless, afraid to leave the house unless I have my SO or it is a familiar destination/route. I have been obsessed with suicide and death. I feel worthless and sometimes numb. 

I have been battling with depression, anxiety, isolation, etc for so long... since I was a kid. I am now almost 30 years old and still have these problems. I am on a new medication and starting therapy in a few weeks, but it doesn't seem soon enough. 

Lately I have been self harming more and more, each time being more extreme. I don't cut but prefer to poke/scratch myself with needles and other pointy objects, pinch myself, pull my hair, etc. Today I was sitting in my silent house in the dark, feeling empty, and poking myself with a thick needle. It helped me refocus. I made myself bleed quite a bit and saw the blood, thinking how beautiful it was. The color and texture reminded me of a lovely red paint. I did it again and again a few times and began covering myself in it. It made me feel calm. I ended up falling asleep afterward. 

I don't want to die because I love my SO and want a life together. But I don't want to keep living this way. I feel as if there is no way out, that no amount of therapy, medication, reassurance from my SO, walks in the park, or whatever will cure me.
