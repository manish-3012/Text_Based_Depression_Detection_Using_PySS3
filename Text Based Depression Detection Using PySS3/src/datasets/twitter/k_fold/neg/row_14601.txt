College is making me want to dieThe past 3 weeks have been hell. Studying for midterms in the middle of my spiral back into my depression took a lot out of me. So much so I feel I have no energy left to do the two big assignments I have due on Thursday.

I've always had issues with depression, mainly self esteem/extreme self loathing but college has been bringing out the worst of it. I'm constantly berating myself for not being good enough. All the stress of being in a new place and all this pressure to do everything at once is making me seriously consider just ending it. 

A kid who graduated the same year as me has already committed suicide in college, and all I can think is how I wish I were him. Free from the constant self loathing and stress.

I know many would think this is typical whiney millennial bullshit and how I just need to power through but I seriously don't see any other way out. This is ruining my life and my future because I can't get my act together.
