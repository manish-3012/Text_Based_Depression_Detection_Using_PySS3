Fuck the Suicide Prevention HotlineI had a mental health crisis last night, so I did what everyone tells you to do if youâ€™re experiencing a crisis- I contacted a suicide prevention hotline.

What an absolute fucking joke of a system. First I texted the crisis hotline, and was left in the queue for an hour (theyâ€™re supposed to reach out to you in 5 minutes) so I opted out of the text line and actually called in. 

When I called in, I had a young woman pick up the other line. While Iâ€™m sure she meant well, she gave the most canned, unauthentic and unhelpful responses to what I was saying. 

â€œOh, that sounds difficult. Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re feeling that way, have you tried taking a bath? It sounds like youâ€™re experiencing anxiety, have you tried doing the 54321 grounding exercise? It would be highly advisable for you to seek counseling, therapy and/or medicationâ€. 

Like Jesus Christ, if things were that goddamn easy then I wouldnâ€™t be calling in the first place. Of course Iâ€™ve tried a bath and those stupid grousing exercises. Of course I want to find a therapist, itâ€™s hard finding someone that has openings and also takes my shitty state-funded insurance and Iâ€™d never be able to pay out of pocket because Iâ€™m just a lowly cashier barely scraping by. If it were that easy, Iâ€™d have this monster tackled by now. I have never felt worse than calling last night and have someone give me a scripted, robotic response back. 

I ended up getting frustrated and ending the call, slashed my leg open with a box knife to find some sort of mental relief, and cried myself to sleep. Fuck the suicide hotline, they donâ€™t help. They just throw a formulaic response at you to try and get you off the phone faster, they donâ€™t actually care.
