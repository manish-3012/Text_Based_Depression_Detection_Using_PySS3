Whiskey Dick every single timeCan't do it anymore guys. It's too embarrassing. 23 y/0 male still a virgin because everytime i get ready to sleep with a woman, my dick stops working. I've had some great, attractive looking girls who i would love to lose my virginty too, but, i go soft. I can't do it anymore. I've treid nofap, no porn, cialis, everything. I even thought i was gay for a little bit. I exercise regular, eat healthy, i've talked to doctors. I just can't deal with the embarrassment anymore. Idc if this is petty or not. This literally has been a huge issue for me since 18. I can't do it anymore. I want help. I want a way out.
