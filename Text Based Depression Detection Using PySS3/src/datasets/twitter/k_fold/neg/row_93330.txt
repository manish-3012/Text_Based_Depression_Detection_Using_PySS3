19 years old. I thought I would share my crappy life story before I leave earthReally there isn't much to say about my life except that I was always really shy and got made fun of during my childhood. Had two other outcast friends but then when highs school came around they became asses an ditched me so they could be cool, since then I have had no friends or had any conversation with a girl, I am so lonely and have tried all I can to try and meet new people but I am treated like an inferior retard, I don't like humans and I hate this earth, why should I live a life of pain and isolation, it's been three years of me trying to get a life and I've failed, everyday was spent at home, I am a ultra social retard, there is no hope, good bye.
