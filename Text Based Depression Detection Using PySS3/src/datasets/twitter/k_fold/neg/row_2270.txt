Suicide is an escape but it also shows us the way out of pain.28. Jobless. Due to wrong decisions in past, I had left 3 well paying jobs. I'm trying my best to get a job but it is not happening. Due to abusive nature of father, I had to left my previous job and home both.



I'm not mentally stable or happy since last 8 years. I'm in depression since then. I can't afford to sit idle now. The only thing which is making me live is my mother. I'm living, struggling only because I want to take care of her.


She always suggested me not to escape from any situations. But, now I'm sensing it is the only way out for me. I have almost no friends. I can't share my thoughts, regrets or anything with anyone, which I believe is killing me too. I had given 5-6 interviews in last 6 days but no affirmation. Only thing which is killing me is my pathetic sadistic and capricious nature. While I can think that I worth something, most of the times, I believe everyone is living their life perfectly, laughing, enjoying. I don't know what should I do now. It seems ending a life is the final option for me now.
