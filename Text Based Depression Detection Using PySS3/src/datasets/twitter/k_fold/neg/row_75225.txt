I am a ticking time bombI have been waking up daily with chest pains and physical sadness for over 2 years now. Before I lost some people in my life, but since losing my last connections in the past month I have regressed worse and worse. I can not see any light, I can only see death and dying in my future. My life has not been easy or privileged by any stretch of the imagination. I have gone through so much that I feel too broken inside to come back to my old personality and beyond recovery. I feel that my soul is expired and world weary. I feel no ties to life anymore, and distraction against my thoughts and depressive gut wrenching rumination tortures me for much of every day. I have nobody to talk to, no emotionally available adults in my life, and I feel no love in my life. There is a heavy sadness I have carried since a child, medication resistant sadness and a deep sense of not belonging to or in the world. I cry daily now and every night I fall into uncontrollable weeping. I don't know what to do anymore as I have reached out to 10+ therapists with no response. I have no social supports, no resources for help I can find that I have not already pursued, my friends have disconnected from me and I continue to fail in building new connections as my negative spiral downwards can be felt energetically. I have prayed to God, and wonder how I have served for my past faults but I have never inflicted any depth of the pain I am contesting with on anyone. It's beating me down to no return, and I feel like I am on the edge of life now. Emotionally numbed except for sadness, despair, anger and extreme loneliness. This disease has eaten me alive.
