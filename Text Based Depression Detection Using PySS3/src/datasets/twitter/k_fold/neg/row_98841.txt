a vent   today wasn't a good day, yet it was no different than other. a month ago i promised myself ill kill myself before 2021. i still want to do it, i even bought some cyanide pills. if they dont work - i always have the knife, though i beg you, god, dont make me use it.

   sleeping pills are useless, i failed 4 attempts. i saw a really cool documentary about spies and the tools they used and was sort of inspired to buy some cyanide. though, im doubting its really cyanide. my god i wish euthanasia was legal.

   do i think suicide is selfish? - it doesnt matter, it really doesnt. yes, it is selfish, but after being called narcissistic, selfish - it doesnt matter. just another selfish thing you will do. 

   i feel like a misfit. everywhere. among my friends, among depressed people, among lgbt people. how come i dont want to feel better, to seek help? if i had one wish - i wouldnt pick become happy, i would wish i never existed : everyone would forget me and even the invisible people that would be devastated by my death. i doubt im a part of lgbt, i just seem to be an attention seeker or atleast just a late bloomer.

   i wish i was smarter, kinder, more understanding, though my asshole-self really keeps people away, but there are always some people who get through and i dont want to be rude - i want to help, hug, appreciate. ive met so many intelligent and knowledgeable people and i really enjoy talking to them, though i believe they dont really enjoy talking to "failing school and having Fs all over the paper".

   i look up to independent, strong-willed, brave people. and i dont mean the "hero" type. the ones that fight every battle themselves and try to not involve other people. they resist the need of help. deep down they wish someone would help and let out a few screams for help, yet nobody notices. they dont complain about anything and just seem nicer. they may seem cold, but are the warmest people in the world.

   fighting for your own country is suicide, yet its considered brave.
  
   i feel emotionless - no panic attacks, no sadness, no happiness. the time when earth was creating itself - acid rain, eruptions, meteors. just chaos, though it seems like im all alone in space, slowly flying away from earth. an astronaut stranded in space.

   this is a rational choice, ill probably write a suicide note after a nap, since its 1.54 am. im an insomniac, but i feel a little lazy and might go out without a suicide note or a goodbye.
