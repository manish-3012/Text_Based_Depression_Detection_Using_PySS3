overdosingi overdosed on ferrous sulfate today, and my family didnâ€™t even care about my well-being. 
im not being hospitalized. my mother wonâ€™t allow it because she thinks the police will be involved, and iâ€™m confident iâ€™ll be dead in a couple of days. 
iâ€™ve just been insulted all day by my family today. no one has even asked if i was feeling ok, they just told me i was immature for trying to kill myself, again.
