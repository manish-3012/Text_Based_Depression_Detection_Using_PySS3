Time to die?I have a loving family and partner who have tried their best to be supportive but I am so broken down and have no hope left.  
I have been suicidal since I was under 10. Seen many therapists been on many medications. None of them really helped. The only thing that ever helped me was learning more about my heritage and becoming more involved in living from it (I am biracial). That is the only thing that ever gave me any happiness and peace.  

My life has been a series and disappointments, losses, misfortunes and varying levels of poverty. Last year I finally was in a place where I felt like I was getting somewhere and for the first time ever I had some hope. I quit an abusive but secure job at that time to pursue my dream job. Spent a year training. Then just as I finished my training this past March and was able to venture out on my own with it, covid hit and everything was ordered closed down.  

I had just signed a 1 year lease for my business and was stuck paying rent on a place I could earn no money at. Having already spent the money I spent years saving up for my startup costs, I had no choice but to go deep into debt to continue to pay the rent. I am now multiple thousands in debt.  

I am finally able to open, which would be great. But during the closure several people in the community decided I am not â€œenoughâ€ in my heritage and started gossiping and slandering me to others. Now Iâ€™m unable to get any business because people either donâ€™t trust me or donâ€™t want to be a part of the drama that I never even asked for.  

I am so deeply sad and devastated. There is no future left for me. All my years of hard work destroyed by a handful of people. Every day for months I have woken up crushed by the realization that there is no hope left. If I was young I might have a chance, but I am in my 40s and completely exhausted. My family is poor and unable to help me financially.  I am in therapy but itâ€™s not helping at all because fucking mindfulness exercises donâ€™t pay the bills and donâ€™t stop people from slandering me. I canâ€™t even afford to hire a lawyer to sue for the slander.

If anyone knows of the least painful ways to end it please tell me. I need to get out of this living hell now.
