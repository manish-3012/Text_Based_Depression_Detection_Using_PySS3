whats the fuckin pointmy grandma has ruined my life. i canâ€™t be trans, i canâ€™t be bi, i canâ€™t have a differing opinion, i canâ€™t be another religion. and i canâ€™t cut the bitch out of my life because â€œweâ€™re so good to you, we gave you money for college!â€ and my family would hate me. iâ€™m 18, i gotta go to college, but whats the point

ill prolly never see my fiance in real life, my grandma would do all she can to prevent that. weâ€™ve been waiting 10 months. 

only thing stopping me from hanging myself rn is that i donâ€™t wanna go to a psych ward for the 6th time. iâ€™m fuckin terrified of the places.
