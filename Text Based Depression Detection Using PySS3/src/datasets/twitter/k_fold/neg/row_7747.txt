brokenI donâ€™t know whats wrong with me. I know exactly whats wrong with me. I cant do anything. Im defeated before I start. Im going to fail my classes and have to drop out. If that happens I cant imagine not killing myself.  I really now realize how much people would miss me. But if I go out before ill be thought of as I am now not a college depressed dropout. â€œbe an engineer so we can be richâ€ just one more way im failing.    I tried to make myself throw up, but it didnâ€™t work. Its so hard to fake it anymore, I can barely sit in class without feeling overwhelmed and crying. It pisses me off when people say its selfish. FUCK YOU im selfish. Do you want to take this pain from me? Mental illness. That made me upset at first but now I realize thatâ€™s exactly what it is, im fucked up in the head and something is wrong with me.  My life is broken. No one knows it and I can fix it, but I wont. No day has meaning anymore, I get up so I can go back to sleep. Why not just sleep the whole thing away. People want me to live but I donâ€™t.  I have the window picked out. Im gonna start writing my will/note.
