I dunno where else I can post, but I don't feel okay.It has been about a month and a half of panic attacks and depression and talking myself out of suicidal thoughts.

I can't breathe anymore. I am having difficulty sleeping. My life is falling further and further apart and I do not see any way it can get better.

I have a child, and I don't think I could actually kill myself, but I have thought about trying to find someone on the web to kill me? I mean, there are all kinds of freaks out there, I'm sure some murderer would love a consenting victim?

I tried to set up an appoint for counseling but I do not have any way to get there, I am trying SO HARD to get my life together, and I keep telling myself that if I make it to the next step it will get better, but then I complete that thing and there are a million other things that I need to do and can't. I have no place to call home, I sleep on a couch at my mother's house, and am not even truly wanted there. Every time I ask for help, people ignore me or laugh at me or assume I am exaggerating my situation. 

What does the world want from me? How do I make things better? Why is everything so fucking hard? 

I just want to not wake up anymore.
