LostIm sitting in a bar right now as a freshman in college. Surrounded by the most beautiful women I've ever met and all I can think about is dying and trying to kill myself. I don't know how much longer I can fend off these thoughts. Like a shepherd defending his sheep in the night my torch is dying. When it does, I will be alone and I'm scared. I don't want fail.
