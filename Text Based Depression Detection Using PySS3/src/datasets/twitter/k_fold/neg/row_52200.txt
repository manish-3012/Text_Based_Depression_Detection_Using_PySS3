The anger and depression just seems to grow every dayWish I knew how to fill this void in myself. I have tried everything I can think of. Drugs helped for a while, but my body builds up a tolerance in just a day or two and then nothing. I can't sleep unless I drink myself to sleep or take any kind of sleeping drug. When I am sober I am always angry, it gets worse all the time. I can't remember the last day I did not hit myself repeatedly. Never felt so worthless. I need help, but can't find anyone that cares enough to help. I have tried looking on here before, maybe I used the wrong words or something, but never got any help. Won't be trying again after this. I am at the end of my rope.
