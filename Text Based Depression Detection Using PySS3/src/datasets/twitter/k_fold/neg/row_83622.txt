I'm a detriment to everyone jm around.I'm unstable and I'm unreliable. I'm trying to be better for them to make someone proud but I feel I only ever disappoint. I tryed to tell my mom I'm having suicidal thoughts but she just got upset. I hurt the only person I had left to talk today. I dont know what to do anymore. theres still away out I just dont want to try anymore.
