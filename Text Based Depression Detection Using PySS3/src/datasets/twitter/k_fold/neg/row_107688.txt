I told my friend to kill herself and I should just follow my own advice.Why do I always have to hurt everyone who was trying to help me? She said while we argued, she was only trying to help me get over my negativity and I pushed her away without any thought. I deserve her insults, and her hatred, and my remorse. Wait no, I don't even deserve that. I don't deserve to live, idiots like me shouldn't deserve to walk this earth. What was I thinking when I pushed her away? Just because she insulted my race didn't give me the right to do that. It's right for everyone to hate me now.
