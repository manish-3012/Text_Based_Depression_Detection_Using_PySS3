I made a permanent damage mistake to myselfHey everyone, because I can't find anyone I can really depend on to talk about it but here goes the bad memory lane trip.
When I was little, I 'like' to steal. I started off by saying to myself, "It will be the first and last time. I won't do it again" That phrase was repeated for the next 6 years and I have myself depressed with suicidal thoughts. Here's what happen:

-When I was first caught stealing, my parents let me off the hook and told me not to do it again, because I was 10. Second time they caught me, I was being caned.

-A few years passed and things have gone out of control. I started to steal money for personal belongings. One ultimate mistake I made was using their credit card to buy an iPod. My dad went off the roof and started to beat the shit out of me. Punches to the face , to the stomach, then a few belts. I was crying for mercy, begging for it but no. He beat me until he was satisfied then let me go back to my room. I was crying in pain and I keep asking myself why can't I just stop. I was 13.

-Few years passed, I was constantly being mistaken for things I didn't do because my parents will not believe me because of my stealing. A few times was okay then suddenly things got worse. One day, I was accused of something I swear to God I didn't do and I just did what almost people did, confess to it even though i was right. Given hard punishment, punches, belts, locked in my room with all hands and legs tied to a belt only to be released in the morning (I'm not shitting, it was the darkest moment in my life.) At that point, I was crying, not for mercy, beg to God to just let me die by injuries.

-Fast forward to today, I tried to fix my problem by asking school therapy to help, but they can't do shit. My brother took all the matters to his own hand and I was given something worst than hell (He's a body builder and beat me to a pulp). I had almost no friends (made a few kinda trust-able people), no relationship( don't wanna talk about it). And three suicidal attempts, two are chocked to death (blacked out), one is to cut my wrist (lost a lot of blood, sent to hospital).

After letting that typed out, I felt a little better but I will always fall back to depression and suicidal whenever I think these back and keep asking myself is it still worth living after I have hurt everyone around me.

Sorry for the long post, my first time.
