 I just want to vent a little bit.So it is going to be a little long story that i've never told anyone before, but before starting I apologize in advance if I have some grammar mistakes, English is not my first language, neither I use it daily or something.

So Here there is this 14 year old girl who gets pregnant and guess what it is me. My mom was 14 when she got pregnant. she wasnt living with my grandfathers since she escaped that year.my mom has 3 brothers, she is the youngest of them ,so when i was born she was 15 and she couldnt take care of me like someone should. I lived with her for a year and she just gave me to my grandma, now my grandma did love me but she didnt take care of me as well, so when I was 4 she gave me to one of her daughters, the older one. Now she was very happy because she recently found out that she couldnt have any of her own ,so yeah she was happy , she was recently married and deep inside I was happy because i thought i was going to have a real family now.and yes the 5 next years were really good to me,but then , my now newfather or as i just called him,father, started cheating on my mom on a 13 year old kid.this went on for another 4 years until my mom found out, so when I was 13 , my parents got divorced.
I will continiue later in an update if well anyone cares,because i just cant go on.
