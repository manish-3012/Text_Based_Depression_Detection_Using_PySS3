Feel like this COVID-19 is capable enough to end all my sufferingI am just waiting for people within 500m of me to infect me so that i can end it all quickly. I have no rope to hang myself or any other way to finish it. Just thought about writing something on here to make sure i wrote something while having these thoughts and it wasn't too late to acknowledge everything.
