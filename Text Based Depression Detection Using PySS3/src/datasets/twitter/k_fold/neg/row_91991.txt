Pretty SeriousHi Reddit. I've never posted in this subreddit before, but I've seen it mentioned many times. I've spent almost two decades of my life flirting with the idea of putting an end to all of this nonsense. I've been in the hospital for this four or five times. I'm never going into the hospital for this again. I feel almost completely resolved in my decision to no longer have to deal with this problem ever again. It's almost an exciting prospect. However, I have multiple dependents, both emotional and financial, that would seriously suffer from any option I choose to exit this ridiculousness. I don't know anybody else that I can pass the torch to. For this reason, and this reason alone, I would like some advice on how to proceed. I sincerely wish to die, as soon as possible, but I feel like I have obligations keeping me from proceeding. Nobody else will help my family, but the well-being of my family isn't going to keep me breathing a whole lot longer. I'm not committed to death, but I very much don't want to live. Do you have any advice?
