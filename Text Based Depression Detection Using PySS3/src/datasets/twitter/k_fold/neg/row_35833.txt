Failing my HSC year, Iâ€™ve got no hope and I really donâ€™t want to live if I donâ€™t go to universityIâ€™m so sick of this year. Iâ€™ve failed so many tests despite studying all the time and I know that my final marks for this year arenâ€™t going to be good enough to go to university. I just sat an exam today and didnâ€™t understand anything. My parents have stopped pushing me to do better and are just disappointed in me. Iâ€™ve got no friends and/or SOs to talk about these issues with. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ll do if I donâ€™t get into university and am entirely planning on killing myself when I get my results back.
