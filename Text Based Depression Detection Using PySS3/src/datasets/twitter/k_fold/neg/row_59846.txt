Am i suicidal?I don't know if i'm quite suicidal because i feel like its almost disrespectful to those who think and feel about it more than i do, but lately i feel like i cant stop hurting or being a burden to those i love, no matter what i do it always ends in me feeling like i don't deserve to be here or around them. Or maybe hurting them when i don't intend to.   


This tends to make me wonder why am i even here? Whats the point of me if all ill end up doing is hurting those i love  


Im not even sure if i have the constitution to end my life, and to think of the aftermath id leave behind, the people who would feel wrongfully responsible, hurts me so much that its enough to deter me from planning out any proper action.  


Are my thoughts relatively normal? Should i seek help at this point? Is this the start of becoming suicidal?  


I'm sorry if this half assed post is disrespectful to those here that are truely finding life to be too much for them, i don't mean to be i'm just currently so lost.
