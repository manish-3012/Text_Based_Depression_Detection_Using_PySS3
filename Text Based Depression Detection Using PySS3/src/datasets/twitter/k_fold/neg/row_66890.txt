I'm really confusedâ€¦..like really fucking confusedI don't even know. I hate but love life at the same time. Kinda like a game and I'm just a role. I also feel like my depression is fake. If I really wanted to I could snap out of it and I'm just overreacting. I'm finding humor in everything atm and constantly laughing my ass off. I don't take shit serious anymore. Unlike before I feel very light and frothy instead of emo and depressed. I don't feelâ€¦â€¦real anymore like everything is fake at this point and I'm kinda just going with the flow. It's like I'm going insane. But every once in a while I snap back into reality and it all breaks down and I get a rush of intense emotions and become really suicidal and miserable but the next day I'm totally fine. Like a zombie I feel like this day has been on repeat for the last 5 months (and it was like this before quarantine). Anyway my mental state is very inconsistent and I can't tell what I feel anymore. 

Did I mention that I let myself go this year and gained probably 20 pounds this year to my 5'4 self. To give you some background I was very much obsessed with my weight last year and lost a ton of weight unhealthily. I feel like shit about my body at the moment and that only causes me to stress eat and worsen the self hate cycle. I'm suicidal but at the same time I'm just chilling and enjoying lazying at home. But not very much enjoying since it's mostly self loathing (this was really repetitive but you get the gist)

The point of this was to kinda understand what I'm going through cause I can't get through anything right now and I'm in denial and am refusing to get therapy. If I keep going like this I think I'll mess up everything and end up in a hospital again if I go down this path and that inconveniences everyone because of my selfishness. I don't want to be fucked up the rest of my life.
