My explanation and justification for suicideI am a 24 year old male currently living with my parents. I have no job, no significant other, and essentially no obligations to fulfill. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social anxiety at age 14 and have seen little improvement in my mental health despite intensive psychotherapy (nonstop for the last ten years) and an eclectic array of psychopharmaceuticals (SSRIs, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, self-administered ketamine, etc). I was taking 60 mg duloxetine HCl (delayed release) b.i.d. up until a few days ago (I'd been on this medication for upwards of a year). I have attempted suicide twice and came close to dying once when I overdosed on butyrfentanyl, which left me with bilateral damage to my hippocampi. Due to this brain injury, I experience difficulty consolidating and retrieving memories.

I was accepted into a PhD program at a university somewhere on the East coast. Because of my mental health problems, my father lived with me while I was going to school. About a month into my summer rotation, I was informed by HR that they could not pay me a stipend because of a couple misdemeanor charges I acquired as an undergraduate student at a school on the West coast. Since paying out of pocket for a PhD is ridiculously expensive, I switched to a Masters degree program just before COVID started, hoping to graduate within 6 or 7 months. In mid-March, COVID shut down the lab I was working in and the lab did not reopen until early June. I did not cope well with the subsequent isolation, and slipped into a very deep depressive episode. I began using methamphetamine regularly to motivate myself to write the parts of my thesis that I could write and drinking heavily to come down from the meth. One day in May, I came across an irritating post on social media and got into an argument in the comments. For whatever reason, I lost it, got drunk, took approximately 25 mg of etizolam, downed nearly a full gram of my psychiatric medication (duloxetine), and proceeded to make cryptic posts about killing dirty cops. The overdose wasn't even close to fatal; I woke up on the floor with a very bad headache and poor recollection of what happened the previous night. Next thing I know, the police and the FBI were banging on my door announcing a search warrant. They seized my computer and my phone and then transported me to a psychiatric hospital for observation. There, I realized the stupidity of my actions, but was also unnerved by the fact that the police had taken possession of my laptop for an inexplicable reason. It just unnerved me. I had no explanation for it. Perhaps it was because I had an Onion window open in which there was a confirmation for an order for a gram of methamphetamine just as the police knocked on my door. Perhaps I knew subconsciously that they would find something unsavory on my laptop.

The apartment I was living in (with my father) decided to evict us. Usually by this point, I would have slipped into a bed-ridden depressive state due to the stress of the situation, but I was using meth frequently enough that I didn't experience much fatigue.... Just numbness. Nevertheless, we found a new apartment to stay in. This turned out to be a solitary stroke of luck because I was able to complete my thesis examination and was awarded my degree. Just after my thesis examination, I had a court hearing for the terroristic intimidation charge (due to the cryptic posts about killing dirty cops). Because COVID was ongoing I was not required to appear in court if my lawyer went in my place. To my surprise, he found that there were 9 felony warrants out for my arrest. We couldn't figure out exactly what these warrants were for, so he called the Sherriff's office. Apparently, these warrants were for possession of child pornography, which shocked me. I had no recollection of downloading child pornography, yet upwards of 30000 images and 150 videos were located on my laptop. Then I tried to piece together things, and it didn't shock me all that much.

 Earlier in the year or perhaps during the previous year, I was experiencing significant anorgasmia and sexual dysfunction while masturbating. Since I'm a pathetic and very isolated loser, I relied heavily on masturbation to derive some form of release. Regular pornography had lost its appeal and I began looking for more and more extreme pornography, within the limits of the law. Then my nihilistic mind combined with curiosity kicked in. If all laws are arbitrary social constructs intended to force people to behave in a certain manner, and if indeed the universe is a meaningless void in which there exist no pre-defined morals, then all is permitted (as Alyosha said in the Brothers Karamazov). I also wasn't sure exactly how child pornography...worked. Was it identical to regular pornography? What were the differences between CP and regular pornography? Was it true that large networks produce this material for profit or was it the case that, in reality, the preponderance of child pornography is distributed freely, without financial gain? So I did download some at the time, on a different computer (not the one that was seized). Did I find it arousing? Marginally. This shocked me. I thought I would at most be indifferent towards it, if not shocked and disgusted. But it seemed "better" than regular pornography at the time. It seemed more raw and real. Nevertheless, I immediatedly deleted that content using a file eraser application after consuming it, as only a true idiot would save that type of material to their HD and not remove it.

&amp;#x200B;

Given this prior experience, my guess is that I had amassed the large amount of content during binges on alcohol and methamphetamine. Methamphetamine promotes this obsessive "collector" behavior in which I constantly search for more content. Alcohol disinhibits my behavior and produces amnesia, which I am far more susceptible to due to my brain injury. Thus, it would be entirely plausible that I could have amassed all the content discovered on my computer within two or three night-long sessions. Even though in my sober state, I had no attraction to real, physically present children at all, in my intoxicated state, I became obsessed with images and videos portraying sexual activity of minors. That is my working theory. The level of blackout drunkenness produced some amnesia such that I could not really feel guilt after the fact (in fact, I usually feel kind of ashamed of myself every time I masturbate). This is my only explanation for why such a large amount of child pornography was found on my computer.

&amp;#x200B;

If all of this is indeed true, would that not make me a pedophile? And are pedophiles not the lowest of the low scum on the ladder of society? I already loathed myself before I came to this realization. I think most people here would agree with me that I need to be put to death. If I stayed alive and submitted to the justice system, I would not receive a satisfactory sentence (even though theoretically 59 counts of possession of child pornography should put me away for 59 years, given that it is a felony, it is unlikely that I will be convicted of all 59 counts). Therefore, I must kill myself to pay for my crimes and remove my debt to society. This is the inescapable truth. I must die. I've arrived to this conclusion with a clear mind and sound reasoning. Society tells us that pedophilia is not only wrong, but that pedophiles are filth that must be erased from Earth. Therefore I must be erased from Earth. I have heard this over and over in passing. It is a fundamental truth. I seek guidance in assuring my death. I know all of you wish for me to die as soon as possible, so I am posting here despite the fact that encouraging suicide is against the rules. I feel that my case justifies suicide.

I began preparing for my death last week. To purify myself, I have begun reading a holy text (Sai Satcharitra) and will complete it in a few days. At that point my plan is to ingest 7x5/325 hydrocodone tablets, 4 mg etizolam, and at least 200 mL of 50% ABV liquor. Will this cocktail work? I am a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer, so I do not efficiently metabolize hydrocodone to the active drug hydromorphone, particularly in the presence of a potent CYP2D6 substrate and inhibitor such as duloxetine. My hope is that the added depressants will decrease my respiration to the point that I will cease breathing and be dead. This is not unlike lethal injection with hydromorphone/midazolam which was at one point used to execute death row inmates in the state of Ohio. However, I am not sure whether such a combination would in reality be lethal due to the simple fact that I am a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. Should I wait until I can obtain an opioid of sufficient potency to carry out this execution? I was thinking of swallowing all 7 tablets at once and then 30 minutes later, consuming a large amount of bourbon whiskey plus 4 mg etizolam (delivered by a sublingual blotter). Is this sound reasoning, or should I consume everything at once? Should I add an additional method to this protocol, such as jumping from a bridge as well? The nearest bridge is a 2 hour walk from here through treacherous backroads in the hills, but this bridge is definitely high enough to guarantee death (there have been several successful suicide attempts from the bridge).

Lastly, please do not attempt to uncover my identity. I am using a throwaway account and VPN to post this. I have two days to live. Moreover, the conditions of my bail prohibit me from using electronic devices, so revealing my identity will undoubtedly result in incarceration. Let me retain my anonymity and let this serve as an explanation for my actions. I will not leave such a lengthy suicide note.
