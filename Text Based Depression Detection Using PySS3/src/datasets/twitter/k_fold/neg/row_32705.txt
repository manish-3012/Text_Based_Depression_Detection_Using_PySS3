I'm waiting my parents to die before I kill myselfMy parents are good people. They adopted me and raised me with their best efforts. I don't want to upset them. Especially my mother is very attached to me an would go insane if I kill myself. I'm almost 30 and I haven't had any lover in my life. Loneliness is unbearable right now and I don't want to live like this. But at the same time I don't want my parents to be sad. So I'm waiting.
