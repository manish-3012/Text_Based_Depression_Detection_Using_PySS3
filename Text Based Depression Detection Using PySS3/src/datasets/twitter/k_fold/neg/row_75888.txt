HiToday I have decided that my life will end by my own accord.

The moment someone reads this, IÂ´ve left precise instructions of what should be done with my goods, and with my body, a testament of sorts.

IÂ´ve been so broken, so alone, so sad for so many years now; itÂ´s time to end it all.

There is, unfortunately, no precise date for this event; as thatÂ´s not up to me; regardless, there is no more than two years left for me, from the time I post this, Â´till the day of my demise.

I wonÂ´t lie, itÂ´s been a good ride sometimes... just sometimes
