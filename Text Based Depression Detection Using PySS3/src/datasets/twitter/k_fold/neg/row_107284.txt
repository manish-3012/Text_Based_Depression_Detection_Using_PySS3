My antidepressant stopped working.I've been on it for 3 weeks and it was doing fine. I didn't want to kill myself anymore, but I was still... empty. I have nobody who loves me and nobody who even cares. 

Now, it just stopped working. This morning my mom just yelled at me, and I want to die. I can't stand being in this house. I hate my family and I haven't seen any of the people I really love in more than two weeks. I don't want to be blamed for everything and I don't want so much pressure on me. Who fucking cares about college right now? I just want to be with someone I care about right now. I can't even numb the pain with things like video games or just TALKING TO SOMEONE'S I CARE ABOUT, because my mom thinks it's bad for me. It's not *bad* for me to try to communicate with people who I actually fucking care about, it's bad for me to be locked up and alone and not ever see my friends. 


I don't see a reason not to kill myself now. I'll always be alone. It's a lie to say it will get better, because it just won't. If I die now it just makes it easier for me. And nobody would even care...
