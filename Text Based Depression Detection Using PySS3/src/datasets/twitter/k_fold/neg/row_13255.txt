...Iâ€™ve always had really bad mental health, but recently itâ€™s gotten so much worse. I found out about this disorder I have and itâ€™s a long story but itâ€™s really gotten to my head. on top of that, i started pushing all of my friends away and I HATE how I look. I really just want everything to stop. Especially now. I have absolutely no one. my dad left me when i was younger and my mom is mentally abusing and I pushed every single last one of my friends away. I just feel really hopeless right now. I know I could have it a lot worse... but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for life.
