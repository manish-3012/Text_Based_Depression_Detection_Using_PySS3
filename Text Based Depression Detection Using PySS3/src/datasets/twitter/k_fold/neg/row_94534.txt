I have very intrusive thoughts and they get worseSuicide has been on my mind for quite some time now, but recently all those thoughts became so intrusive and so present that I canâ€™t think of anything else. 

All day and night I feel the urge to just slit my wrists and Iâ€™m kinda scared. I feel miserable and trust me when I say no one cares and will care about me, ever. I feel like I failed at life and Iâ€™m just scared, I canâ€™t live with those thoughts much longer. I canâ€™t sleep at night and Iâ€™m afraid of being alone cause then the chances that I might actually kill myself get higher. Iâ€™m depressed, I want to hurt myself and eventually, kill myself. 

I wanna kill myself, yet I donâ€™t cause Iâ€™m so fucking young. Iâ€™m 17 years old, I have a whole life ahead of me and yet I donâ€™t really wanna live. I donâ€™t know what to do, please help me guys. Please.
