36 hrs later.It been about 36 hrs since I tried to commit suicide. (I'm not sure how to share my original post) I'm still in the hospital and I'll probably be doing 2 weeks in what they call "mentality resort" which I'm guessing is a nice padded white room.

I just want to thank you for all the support everyone has given me. Honestly I'm sure I would've succeeded if I didn't totally forget that I invited my sister over to talk. She saved my ass hands down. All i can really do now is hope I get better.... mentally at least....
