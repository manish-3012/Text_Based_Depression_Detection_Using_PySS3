I've tried multiple therapists, countless meds and med adjustments, hospitalization twice, group therapies, intensive outpatient, lifestyle changes, none of it works. I have the rope ready and I'm done.I just wanna kill myself. I've fought for 7 years and never gotten the slightest bit better. I've tried everything people suggest and it just didn't work. There isn't any hope for me. Not everybody recovers from depression and that's something we need to be more aware of. I tried the treatments, I fought and fought but like a cancer patient who exhausts every treatment method and still doesn't make it, I'm not gonna get any better. I've held on so much longer than I should've because I've only experienced more misery. Nothing has brought me joy for over 5 years and I'm only 21. I've been depressed since I was 13-14. It's made me ruin my life too, so that even if I wasn't depressed I wouldn't have a life worth living.



It's over. I tried, I fought, I did what I was supposed to and it didn't work. I have to end it.
