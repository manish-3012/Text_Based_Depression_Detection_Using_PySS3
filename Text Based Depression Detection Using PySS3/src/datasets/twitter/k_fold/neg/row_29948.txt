I fucked up and I hate myself more than anything right nowI've had depression for a long time, diagnosed about 5 years ago. I've been suicidal before. My depression has gotten worse recently. I just finished my first year of college and I'm on summer vacation. 

I've been reflecting on how I can't be in a relationship because of my depression worsening the past couple months. I told a friend who'd fallen for me this yesterday and now he hates me and this has pushed me over the edge. I've just possibly lost one of my best friends and I'm in a dark place right now. It's 4 am and I don't know what I might do
