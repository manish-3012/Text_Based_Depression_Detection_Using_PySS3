RevengeLosing someone makes you lose it.

Every day, you feel like shit.

Somehow, hurting someone feels the same,

Even though revenge should make you sane.

Because if they hurt you, you should have that right 

But the person that gives in to anger is always automatically the bad guy.

That's why you keep your cool,

Try to talk it out.

But when they throw attitude at you,

It makes you wanna shout.

But instead, you keep it bottled up

To the point of no return.

Revenge puts the person through pain

Crying is the thing that makes *you* hurt
