Why should I keep living?Ive been posting here for about a week on some shit that was going down in my life but this time its different. I was walking with my dad and uncle who having a conservation about getting me into a school by the start of the year and I realised something, I am tired of this fucking planet and all the evil on it. I have seen the horrible sides of so many people including my own and I learned that everyone has a horrible side. This planet has so much wrong with it that can't be fixed and I can't handle it. 

Everyone has flaws and mine are horrible. I keep having minor visual and auditory hallucinations and it is to much to handle. Whats the point in living? We wake up, Participate in an endless cycle and go to sleep. I can't keep living a lie and saying how everything is fine even though it is as far from that as you can get. I only feel comfortable opening up to one person but I think he gets a bit uncomfortable when we talk about it. Don't try and say "think about you family" because that won't help, so why should I live in such a horrible fucking planet
