I don't know why I should keep going at this point- 23 years old
- physical health fucked (slipped disc herniation)
- mentally ill (severe health anxiety)
- virgin, ugly, antisocial, no friends, no social life, nobody
- was bullied and rejected and fucked with all my life 

I'm basically at a point where I can't function normally anymore. I don't want to "go see a therapist", there's no reason for me to go on. I have nobody in this life and at this point I'm way too messed up to socialize or approach people.

I hate myself so much. I am a waste of space, waste of life.
