Iâ€™m fucked up.Iâ€™m seriously considering it. Iâ€™ve been close to hanging my self and running away multiple times. I have a fuckload of disorders, Aspergers, adhd, ocd, depression, spd, anxiety, etc. Iâ€™m sick and tired of this shit. My mom makes me feel worthless and my dad left before I was born. My adoptive dad nearly shot my mom, and my now step dad is always stressed. Iâ€™m a spoiled pile of shit. I only have 3 good friends. The others left me alone either because Iâ€™m bisexual or because Iâ€™m a furry. This shit is mad. I want to fucking smash my head until my skull explodes into bits and pieces. My grandmother is like an angel. She so kind, she takes care of me, but I donâ€™t see her too much. My best friends Javier Zayne and Derek have all been there for me, especially Derek, and Zayne. Theyâ€™re the only thing holding me back,
