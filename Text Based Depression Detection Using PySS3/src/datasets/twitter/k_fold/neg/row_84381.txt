i want to end it alli want to end it all. but i'm scared. i'm terrified of what comes next, of the pain i'll feel. i don't want to live but i'm to scared to die. i don't want to disappoint the ones that love me. i don't want them to hurt because they couldn't help me.

how do i stop this? how do i make this cycle end? i don't know if i can. i'm going to spiral deeper and deeper into this vat of self-loathing until i can't take it anymore. and then i'll probably fail. like i fail everything. who knows though? maybe i'll be happier. maybe killing half of my brain is exactly what i need. 

i don't know. i don't know anymore.
