I am all out of options.I graduated college in 2008 with a great well playing job. Made great connections and people were telling me I was "going places" it was a good time. In 2012, I get laid off and the company was cutting budgets. 2013, got laid off again. 

I was unemployed for a year looking for jobs, hitting up my connections, took an unpaid internship. Nothing. Nothing happened there were no jobs to be had, even as a receptionist. I had a break down and I went into therapy. It worked. Still went on interviews and I would come up as not exactly as what people wanted. Interviews would go well, great conversation about the job. I would back up my past experience.  Still nothing. I finally get a part time job working at a cafe. Nothing in my career. 

I said fuck this and moved to NY so I can have more opportunity. I've gotten a few things but nothing to pay the bills. My contacts all tell me the same thing, we like you but we have no open positions. I've been here for 6 months trying to change careers and I interview and I come up short everytime. I am never good enough and I don't know where to go from here. My connections will not talk to me, they all say they are worried about their jobs.  I am 31 and at this point I am only qualified for entry level where as a person I feel more than that. I don't portray that "I am better than this" in my interviews.  

I can not get a full time job. After therapists and job coaches I still can not get a job. At this point I see no other way out. I feel like I am worth more dead than I am alive and I feel like nothing that I do can change my situation. 

Now I am getting older and more and more further detached to the working world. My friends have no issues, but I cant and I just don't get it. They all tell me to "keep trying". Well I mean that has been my full time job for 3 years.

It's been 3 years since my layoffs and now I feel like I am at the point of no return that I am suppose to be jobless. But I need money to live.
