Ready To Give UpIn the last 2 months, I have lost everything and since I chose my SO,  I've lost everyone. I'm living in a motel and this is the last night I can afford to pay. I have nothing left. I see no reason to stay alive. I just cannot take this pain anymore and I'm ready to give up. I can't go through this summer being homeless. It's only June and we already are getting into triple digit weather. I'm a red head with fair and sensitive skin. I already have a second degree sunburn. I can't survive. If I don't kill myself, the elements will.
