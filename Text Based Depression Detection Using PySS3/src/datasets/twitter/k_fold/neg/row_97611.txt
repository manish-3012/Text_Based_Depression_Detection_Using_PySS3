I've made up my mind. I'm finally at peaceI would say I'm sorry, but I'm really not. I am finally doing something for me. Something to make me happy, something that I have wanted and needed to do...yes, call me selfish if you want to..but I am ready. As soon as I made this decision, I felt a calm come over me. My life is over. It is time for me to go. I am soooo ready for this. Thank you for letting me post this. Goodbye.
