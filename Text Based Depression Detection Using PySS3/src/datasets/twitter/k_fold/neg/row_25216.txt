Kids aren't meant to feel like thisAbout a year ago, I got over my suicidal thoughts. I destroyed my notes and felt a lot better. I got more outgoing, made new friends and reconnected with old ones.

But now, they've come back. It's a mixture of severe dysphoria and my dad. 

My dad is probably the main reason. He always blames things on  me. He tells me that I can talk to him, then if I do, he doesn't do anything, he just tells me I'm overreacting, it can't be that bad, ect. 

I don't know what else I can do to get better. I've tried counselling, online chats, helplines, everything I can think of.

There's only about 5 or so people who I think would care about my death, and they're all my friends. 

I feel like the only thing holding me back from just killing myself is that I probably wouldn't be able to get the right materials. 

If you read all the way through this, thanks. Thanks for just taking time out of your day to hear a 13 year old kid scream into the abyss.
