Is the risk of failure worth it?Iâ€™m currently unemployed and have no insurance. If I fail, Iâ€™ll be left with even more medical bills I canâ€™t afford plus the risk of being hospitalized again which equals more bills.

Is it worth trying if thereâ€™s a risk of worsening my life even more? I have a handgun, but knowing me I wonâ€™t do it right. Fuck, I canâ€™t even fucking trust myself enough to die.
