i feel worthless and alone.so many of us have died. so many that i have not known. i just can't do it anymore. i try to keep the act of being ok and  it seems like it worked for a while.

i have been on anti depps for a few years and everything feels wrong. i wanna die. my cPTSD is acting up and even though i can smoke weed and it will help a little i don't want to do it because i will still be so lonely and pathetic. 
i can not play this game any more. i want to do a lot of things in theory but when i get to doing them everything is stale.
i have sexual and romantic partners who love me and care for me but when i take another look at things i see how they are there because i am this way. this messed up way.
because i feel like i always have to serve people around me to find self worth then they will stick by and see how im doing all i can even while being considered a disabled person because of me mental state. 
and even if my gender dysphoria is no longer an issue i still have to live in a world with people who treat me as a teacher when i don't wanna teach and don't let me teach when i do. as if my experience is debatable.
im sick of this world. either i have set my expectations too high and now they are stuck there, or most people here are just a little too much ok with being immoral shits.

why do i have to be a burden on the people i love?
i can't live like this anymore.
