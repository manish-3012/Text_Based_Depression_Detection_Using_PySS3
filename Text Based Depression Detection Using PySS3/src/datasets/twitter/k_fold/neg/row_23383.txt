I felt any remains of my will to live leave my body 5 minutes ago.I feel empty and weak. I know I will not make it past tonight. 

My boyfriend has finally become regularly abusive and has hit me all day today, leading up to him pinning my arms to floor with his knees, sitting on my chest, and beating me.

After I started having a panic attack he got up, sat in his chair, and continued to play his video games. 
I do not have the strength to leave him and I know he is not a decent enough human to leave me, and even if he did it would break me because he has trained me to need him, to be so attached that being without him causes me to panic and break down. 

This is the only option. I have attempted suicide before and failed, but I will not stop until I succeed tonight. I do not want to live anymore, not just because of my boyfriend but because I do not see myself with a future. I am a disappointment, a high school dropout, a burden to my family and the few friends I have left. I will never be successful in life, I will have the same 9 to 5 job every day and I cant do it anymore.
