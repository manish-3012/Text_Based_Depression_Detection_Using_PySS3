No reason to feel this way.Hi everybody. Iâ€™ll give a short blurb about myself to explain who I am and what Iâ€™m struggling with I guess. Iâ€™ve kind of lost any will to move forward recently and donâ€™t really care about getting help anymore either. Iâ€™m in my late twenties, college graduate, work as an engineer, great job, home owner, great family life growing up and still to this day, decent friends, no girlfriend or anything like that anymore. Not much to complain about. I have hobbies like fishing, video games, cooking, playing music, building things in my garage, lifting weights, and cooking, as a few examples. 

Long story short, Iâ€™m miserable. Iâ€™m able to have fun and I go out with friends and stay active and enjoy things in life. Really like my job with a great income and being independent. But I share it with nobody. My family (parents and siblings) are very supportive and I continue on knowing that they care about me. But Iâ€™m losing faith in myself because I simply feel alone a lot. I donâ€™t have a family of my own and I have nobody to share my successes and life experiences with. Itâ€™s just me. By myself. In my little house.

I come home some nights during the week after the gym and will just stare at my wall for hours. Or read for a minute and stare at the same page for hours. I cry on a regular basis and am simply unhappy with my life. 

I could continue typing about things I do and feelings I have, but there are so many posts here that already explain similar symptoms so I donâ€™t see a point in doing so. Iâ€™m no different. Hopefully I convince myself to get help or find more joy in living. 

Thanks,
Me
