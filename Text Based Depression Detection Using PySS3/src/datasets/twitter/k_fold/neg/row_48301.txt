Convincing suicidal woman to take money.Dear Suicide Watch,

There is a woman I know who is suicidal but has been slowly turning her life around. However, she is behind on her bills/rent and could be kicked out before she has a chance to do so and I imagine this is making her more suicidal. I am more than happy to give her the money she needs. However, she is a very proud individual and I do not know how I will convince her to take the money. My plan so far is to give the money directly to pay off her bills/rent. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.
