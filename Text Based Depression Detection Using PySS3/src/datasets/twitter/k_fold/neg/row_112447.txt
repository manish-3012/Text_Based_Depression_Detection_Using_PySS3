(Not in immediate danger) It's my birthday tomorrow, and I'm feeling suicidal.I never thought I'd post here...but stuff happens. 

I thought my depression was over. I thought I beat it. It came back and smacked me in the face today. I'm suicidal. I need help. 

I'm sincerely sorry to the people who tried to help me in my depressed state. Thanks to my keyboard teacher, my physics teacher, my best friend. This feels horrible. You tried to help me. It's just that I'm too far gone.
