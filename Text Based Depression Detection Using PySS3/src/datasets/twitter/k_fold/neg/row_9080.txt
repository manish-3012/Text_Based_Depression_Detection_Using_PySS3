I want everyone here to know that you are loved by more than you can imagine.Recently, one of my friends took a jump and ended his life for who knows why. Maybe he was depressed or not satisfied and couldnâ€™t fill some void.. I really donâ€™t know. This kid was great. Star football player in high school, came from a good family, played college football, had tons of friends, got most girls.. seemingly had it all. He drank a lot, but always acted so upbeat and happy. Was so easy to make friends with, super outgoing, the whole nine. He must know how many people loved him and yet he still felt something inside that was eating away at him every day. (at least so I assume).. 25 years old, just got a great job as an elementary school teacher. He was so good with people. Itâ€™s really hard to wrap my head around honestly. Kid had such a great life. 

I just donâ€™t want this to happen to any of you. Regardless of what youâ€™ve gone through, good or bad, you have purpose here. I promise.

Everyone is truly special in their own way. All we have in this life is life itself. Perspective is everything. You can be happy. It may take time, but you can enjoy life. There is help. You are loved. You have people in this world who would be devastated to lose you and their lives wouldnâ€™t ever be the same without you.
