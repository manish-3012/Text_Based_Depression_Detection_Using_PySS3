Iâ€™m going to do itAs I write this I have approximately 15 minutes till I end it all. I wonâ€™t say how as it breaks reddit rules but I will make sure I go out in a way that no one has a sudden realisation I am gone. I will sleep for the last time tonight as tomorrow I will not be waking up.

Itâ€™s been a fun ride boys, not asking for advice just want to say good bye.

Itâ€™s strange. I look back and I feel nothing, no tears,  no sadness, no joy, nothing.

I feel no emotions, feel no pain on this earth, I feel nothing yet I am shackled down by the limited amount of possibilities on this earth. Growing up I had a nice family, good friends, everything, but i am sitting here, with my device in hand recollecting nothing and pondering nothing. My head is clear, my thoughts are dark. I withdrew the last of my money and put it in my motherâ€™s nightstand. Hopefully it can help her with her life.

13 minutes remaining, Iâ€™m signing out boys. Have a nice one.
