Thoughts I want to express.Somewhat recently, one of my really good friends, is falling hard. This kind of fall, though, hits me really hard, because itâ€™s like seeing someone receiving a Nobel Prize for making the biggest difference in the world, such as discovering a vaccine that can then be made low cost so everybody in the world can access it, then the next moment everything is falling apart for them. Iâ€™ve known this friend for almost a decade, and from the moment I met him, I knew there was something special about him. He was and still is one of the smartest people I know. I was rather silly in high school, but he taught me some life lessons that have helped me a lot. When I was preparing to take an important standardized exam for a professional school, he helped me a little bit and I think it was definitely helpful. I could list more and more about how he has helped me, but that isnâ€™t completely the point of this post.
I donâ€™t completely understand why he has gone down this path, but from certain experiences that he has told me that have happened in his life, they definitely play a major role. Iâ€™m not sure if there were any genetic predisposition, but anywaysâ€¦
He still acknowledges that Iâ€™m a good friend, so I donâ€™t think all is lost, but from interacting with him, and from things he has told me, heâ€™s falling hard mentally. I admit, I do not understand whatâ€™s going on inside his head, I do not understand why this is happening, I really wish I could really figure out the source of his lack of motivation, and I really wish he finds that motivation.
Iâ€™m still here to support him, Iâ€™m not sure what the future holds, he has gone through help (drugs, therapy, etc.) but none of it is working, and it hurts to see someone I admire and love, someone that has helped me to become the person I am today, go through this. I want to give back to him, maybe partly because of how much he has helped me in my life, but I really cannot see him, this amazing person with so much potential, fall this hard.
I have read a few other posts on this subreddit that have similar problems and aspects of what my friend is going through. Also, ever since I did find out about my friendâ€™s problem, I found out other friends have been diagnosed with depression, but have not fallen down this path.
Itâ€™s just not right for anybody, regardless of whether theyâ€™re geniuses or not (IMO, everybody has a special talent, so I apologize if I have offended anybody), to go down such a path. I know I havenâ€™t given details about the problems exactly, Iâ€™m still a bit uncomfortable expressing all of it.
Iâ€™m still in touch with my friend and still show my love and support no matter what for him, and he knows this and is thankful for it. Even though I have taken psych and neuro classes, learned about problems in the brain that can have a role in this, have watched videos of those talk about depression and other problems, I guess I never realized how hard someone can fall.
Iâ€™m going to keep supporting my friend, and if anybody has any suggestions, or any comments or anything, they are welcome. 
I donâ€™t know other people that are going down this path, but to those that are, I hope you do find a way out. I hope the best for you. I know I may sound a bit like Voltaire when I say that, and I know I do not know the backstories, nor completely understand the problems, but I believe things can get better, and that you have my support.
