Suicide hotlines are often unhelpful, anyone else feel this way?I'm not saying that they are 100% bad, but in my experience and in many others they have been absolutely useless or even detrimental.

Many hotline operators (not generalizing, I'm sure there are good ones) just keep repeating regurgitated platitudes, talk like robots, and are generally unhelpful. When I called one I legit thought I was talking to a bot, not even exaggerating. They also put me on hold for a rather long time, while I was about to kill myself. I ended up hanging up on them when I finally got connected because I realized they'd be no help to me.

They also have a tendency to call the police on people who aren't even actively suicidal. I just think that if you are having a crisis talking to someone else would be better, and it annoys me when people spam the hotline number over any talk of suicide thinking they are being helpful.
