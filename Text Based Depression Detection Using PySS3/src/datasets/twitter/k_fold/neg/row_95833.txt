Both of my kiddos tell me to go kill myself.I am a single mom by choice of a 14 year old and 7 year old with Autism for 7 + years.  I love them more than anything. I struggle financially  but I always put their needs before my own.  They are loved and taken care of.  They are the only good part of my life. I don't have family...separated myself from dysfunction long ago. I have a master degree and am in a helping position at a high school.  Last year I experienced  my first loss of a 14 year old boy to suicide and I had never grieved a loss so deeply.  My children remember the day I got the phone call.  These kids are like my family away from home.  On Monday I was faced with another 14 year old child that has also died by suicide.  My heart is breaking...I am reliving pain...I am consoling teachers and our kids.  I am in the helping role.  Kids feel safe with me telling me their stories and I know this is what my calling has always been.  We do family counseling to cope with autism in our home.  But I come home feeling so sad and have no room to hear my 14 year old put down my 7 year old. I know how fragile emotions can be.  So I talk to her about aggression and us needing to feel safe emotionally at home.  She says she is going to slit the dogs throat out of anger...i again confront it...she continues to the point that I am almost in tears. It hurts....I don't want my daughter to be so angry and feeling entitled with no empathy.  She acts out when she is told no....ni she cannot have money to go to a football game the next night because she isn't respectful and behaving like a part of our family.  She begins to mock me...ohhhhh I am soooooi sad....ohhhh.....someone killed themself.......how pathetic she says... and follows it up with well you are the one who chose this field... and it went on.  I told her she was being a bully...and she laughs and mocks more.  I shut down
 This is going no where.  My 7 year old says something to her and she tells him to go kill himself.  Tonight I tell my son that he cannot have more time on his Kindle...  he says ******was right....you should go kill yourself.  I send him to his room and later asked him whY he would do if I were gone...he says...live on my own.....I know that he is repeating what he hears.....but it hurts. I feel alone. I feel that my kids are the only reason I am alive today.  I had one attempt 20 years ago....and thoughts on and off of being gone...away from a life of pain.  I went to counseling and healed past wounds before my kids were born.  I am a survivor.  But I feel alone and soooo deeply sad.   I have two kids that need me but I cannot keep feeling this way. They are not old enough to understand.  I always forgive them and love them unconditionally because that is what it means to be a good momma...but I am sooooo sad and alone.  I need to get this out....I know it will pass...I just need......to feel better. Thank you for reading my story.
