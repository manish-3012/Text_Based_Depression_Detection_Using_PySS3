looking for a way to commit suicideI am 21 y/o and i am from india, so sorry if i make some mistakes. so the idea to commit suicide was in my mind for the last 1 year or so (since 3rd june 2017 to be exact). but yesterday it was enough for me and i have made up my mind now to kill myself. i dont have figured out the way to kill myself but i will figure it out today or best tomorrow.(if you have any suggestion please do share). 

now coming to my reason of committing suicide are my parents. so as i said previously, i am from india, so in india there is a thing called culture which grants basically infinite powers to parents to do whatever shit and get out by saying we are thinking the best about you. which means they can be verbally abusive, physically abusive, control whatever you do in life, whom you meet or not. and remember i said i am 21. yes i am still living with them even when i am 21 and not bcoz i am incompetent or a pussy but bcoz my elder brother is out in a different city to do job and they couldn't just let me go even when i had the life changing oppourtunities in the past but they just said no and guilt trapped me by saying i dont think about them or all i care about is me. also i have a brother and last time i saw him was a year and half ago and the thing i remember is me telling him all my problems and him saying just let it go bcoz they are my parents and i cant do anything about it. and my mother is also the same. whenever something happens, her answer son just forget about it and move on. even when my father verbally abuses me, when he call shits like disgrace, sisterfucker, a mistake, to forget about it, even when he beats me whenever he is angry, to forget about it. and if you still dont get it, my father is a verbal and a physical abuser. remember when i said i had a life changing oppourtunity and they guilt trapped me to give it up just bcoz it meant living in a different city. yeah the point my father made was that we are financially not viable enough to handle expenses of me living in a different city. basically we are poor. and we are. we are not a very wealthy, just barely getting food on the tables. so my dad had no money to sent me away. not enough to put food on the table but enough to buy a bottle of rum every single day and get drunk and then after shouting on me for no reason go to sleep. to give you an example yesterday and even today my father verbally abused me just bcoz i was going to the library to study. to give you a context, my father doesn't like me to go outside to libraries or other places to study bcoz he thinks i am making excuses to get out of the house to hang out with my friends. but in reality all i want is peace and in my house i just cant get it bcoz of all the things that happened. so coming back to the story, he did not want me to go. so what he would've *son dont go to the library* NO...... he said (and i am paraphrasing except the cussing and all the threats) * you motherfucker, piece of shit. what do you want to show by doing these things. you wanna teach us huh?!?! sisterfucker. huh?!!! i mean you never grow up. nobody is going anywhere!!!! and if i see you leave this house i am gonna break your legs!!!!* what was i trying to teach??? i dont know... it was my daily routine to get ready by 10 in the morning and then leave for the library but yesterday i dont know what happened but yes it was this. and today too he did the same thing on the same topic just adding a few new abuses and new more threats like bastard and he is gonna shoot me.

there are more things about my father and my family in a whole but i think this all sums up why i am doing this. bcoz this is just one incident. i have been going through these things my whole life. so yes i have decided to kill me. just dont know how?? as soon as that is figured out i will do it. (again if you have any ideas how to do it plz do share.)
