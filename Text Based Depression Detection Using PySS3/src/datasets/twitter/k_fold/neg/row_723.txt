I'm riding a rollercoasterSo I recently started taking meds and for a brief period I felt like I was going to be okay. But the only benifit of taking meds is in the fact that I can see clearly enough now to know that I can't make it anymore.

I've made my decision, I've made my final preparations and now its simply a matter of finding the courage to cut. I've stared at this blade everyday for the past two weeks, and now the fear is gone. Time, time comes to a standstill when the blade is against my skin, I know that if I cut it just right, I'll fall asleep and never wake in the world of the living again. It what I wanted, and now its real. Just one clean cut and a silent goodbye...
