would like some (any) response to my growing suicidal thoughtsfor the last 4-5 months i have felt a rather desperate longing to get back together with an ex girlfriend of mine (we stopped seeing eachother a year ago). she was my my first and only serious relationship. when i try to talk to her she often ignores me. i get extremely frustrated and anxious. it is obvious she has no interest in me anymore despite my strong feelings for her.

in this 4-5 month period i have been drinking much more heavily than usual.. in the morning, afternoon and night up to 5 days out of the week. whether or not i have class or am going to work. i have lost most of my social skills. my thinking is dark. even now in the spring following a long cold minnesota winter, i still feel hopeless. spring just seems ferociously alive and i am still very much the same person i was in the winter. i once thought i was charming. sex with other women does not make me feel better. in the last 2 months i have been having very serious thoughts of killing myself. i am nineteen and i love my family very much, and i do not want to hurt them. i have access to pistol. this how i imagine i will go.
