Trying to help a friend through a difficult time, feeling like I'm making it worse... I was talking to my friend who is very depressed and talking about suicide.  He has several factors that make him high risk, including a history of depression (although he was the one who brought up the topic to me so that does give me hope).  

We were talking about how he feels like the one thing that prevents him from actually doing it is not wanting to hurt his friends and family, and he said that he feels like he's not living life for himself, rather that he endures it for other people... and I didn't know what to say to that.  I still don't.  

I love him, and it would devastate me if he died.  I told him that. But that's about me and my wellbeing, not my friend's.  I want him to feel like things can get better and that there are reasons to live, but I also know that this is something he's been struggling with his entire life, and just the way he said it made me feel like I'm prolonging his suffering... and part of me believes that is not the case, but another part of me feels like ultimately I'm being very cruel and selfish.  There has to be a way to reframe this, for both of us, right?

He told me before he went to bed that he couldn't make any promises right now that nothing will happen, and I asked him to at least try his best to stay alive, which he agreed he would do.  I'm at a loss.
