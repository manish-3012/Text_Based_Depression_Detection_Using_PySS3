tonightno, i don't have a shitty life or bad circumstances. no, i'm not lazy or incompetent or unsuccessful. nothing's happened to me beyond the normal. 

i'm just done with living, and i don't want to anymore. 

i've been on a downward spiral since i was 13. i'm 18 now. 
i have my shit together. i'm well on my way to a 3.9 (ish) GPA this semester. i'm smart. i know where i'm going and how to get there. 

i'm not happy nor have i ever really been. i don't even care that i can make a difference in people's lives. i don't care that people love me. i know they do. i just don't give a shit because i'm not sure i've ever really loved anyone. 

i've been cutting since i was 14. i dont remember how it started except that i had 'this feeling' inside. this exact same feeling i have now, just milder. i dont know how i came up with the idea to cut. i cant remember ever having heard about it before. 

i've been thinking about suicide since i was 16; began considering a few months later, and planning over the past 3 months. i have a plan. i'm writing my note right now. 

tonight, though. i'm ready to go. i don't care about my abilities. i dont care about my family. all i see is death, in the background of every part of my life, waiting to welcome me home. 

you don't have to encourage me. also, fuck you if you say the words "please don't kill yourself"- all that says is that you didn't understand anything you just read... please won't save me. all i wanted is to show people that the reasons for suicide aren't always solvable. there is nothing in my life to be fixed. it's me that's broken. i don't belong here. so, farewell.
