Iâ€™m sorry, everyone.Iâ€™m just such a fucking failure. My mom spent hundreds of dollars on tutors on me and yet Iâ€™m still failing my Algebra class. I just betrayed my best friend, somebody whoâ€™s been supporting me for so long. Iâ€™m going to off myself before I hurt anybody else I care about. Iâ€™m usually talkative but today I was really quiet, and my grandmother kept on asking me if I was ok, she was instantly able to notice that something was wrong. I then went to the bathroom crying, thinking about how much Iâ€™d miss her and how sheâ€™d react after finding me dead. I canâ€™t stand letting everybody I care about down, and Iâ€™m too much of a failure to live, so today Iâ€™m doing it. Iâ€™m going to OD on pills. Iâ€™m so sorry, grandma.
