My friend is dealing with depression and is possibly suicidal, she has locked herself away from everyone. What can I do?Hey guys my best friend has been dealing with depression and she's also suicidal, due to the pandemic she lost her job and has become very depressed, she posted notes yesterday threatening to end her life, I tried calling, texting and even going by her place but she completely locked herself away from anyone, she deleted her social media accounts today since I tried reaching her from there.
I tried googling what to do but that wasn't of any help.
Guys please what can I do to help her, calling an emergency service isn't an option here since in my country our first responders don't deal with that.
Thank you for reading.
