Suicidal friend &amp; drinkingMy friend isnâ€™t in the best situation as of now and he is 17 and likes to abuse alcohol to forget. I understand how it seems like a good idea, but I know it wonâ€™t be good for him in the long run and it only makes things worse.

How do I tell him, but not make him feel so pressured, to stop drinking. I know I canâ€™t just act like itâ€™s easy because we have different lives so I donâ€™t know the proper way to go about it.
