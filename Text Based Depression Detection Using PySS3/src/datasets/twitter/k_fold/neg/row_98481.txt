So many thoughts racing in my head...Hello everyone...

Warning: This will not be coherent typing for the most part, Iâ€™m just typing as Iâ€™m thinking. My apologies. 

Iâ€™m a 19 year old college student currently in his sophomore year. This semester has been the hardest. It started off OK, but then I had a mental breakdown and withholding it for so long finally caught up to me. I ended up dropping two of my four courses, even though I told my parents I wanted to drop all of them so I could figure things out, they didnâ€™t support that and since I go to a community college and live with them I ended up regretfully doing what they told me to do. I just dropped my third class on the final day to drop and now I have three Ws on my transcript. So now I have one class left and Iâ€™m going to get a B in it when it wouldâ€™ve been an A had I just taken it next semester a as I originally wanted. Depression has been in my life for quite some time. As a kid I was obese and constantly bullied and never had any friends (still donâ€™t) I changed that my freshman year of high school and lost 127 pounds by the time I was in my junior year of high school. Well, I noticed something was wrong my senior year, I started eating like shit again and was gaining some weight back. I ignored it. Then came freshman year of college, I ended with a 3.5 even though I never let myself study and was invited to an honor society, scholastic leadership and honors classes. Then the problems got worse, I continued to gain weight and I did worse in school. The above mentioned programs I was in, I was kicked out because my gpa dropped to 3.241. Now weâ€™re to this semester and I feel Iâ€™ve fucked up so much and itâ€™s embarrassing. I gained all the weight back and Iâ€™m just a fat fucking piece of shit. I hate my life and I hate that Iâ€™ve allowed myself to fuck me over constantly. When I broke down I finally admitted my problems to my parents as I was worried what theyâ€™d feel like since their â€œgolden childâ€ is so fucked up mentally and Iâ€™m seeing a counselor but I ended up cancelling last week because I told her the last session I was doing better with eating and getting that on track (that was true) but I ended up fucking up big time and kept eating like shit after doing well for about two weeks. I feel trapped. I feel worthless. Iâ€™m going to see my counselor on Friday and talk about if sheâ€™s willing to provide documentation of my issue to my college so that I can have my withdrawals exempted, but Iâ€™m not sure how that all works and even if Iâ€™ll have mine be exempted. I knew I shouldâ€™ve just took a break from school but I allowed my parents to pressure me into â€œworking it outâ€. So now I may be permanently stuck with 3 Ws on my transcript. I didnâ€™t even want to go to community college but I decided to because I wanted to get into UT Austin, but thatâ€™s not ever happening so Iâ€™ve settled on UT Dallas but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s going to be possible either. Funny thing is... I was automatically accepted into UT Dallas out of high school, but no I was a fucking idiot and decided to go to community college because I wanted to go to UT Austin. Iâ€™ve fucked up so much and I just canâ€™t handle it anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel so lost. I want to finish my computer science degree but itâ€™s just so hard. I really wish my parents wouldâ€™ve been more supportive of my decision, but I understand why they were so hesitant since they both almost finished college but never did. Itâ€™s just I needed that time and I did get some time to reflect and get help, but not enough. Iâ€™m trying to get back to a normal course load next semester but Iâ€™m not sure if thatâ€™s going to be realistic. 

Iâ€™m sorry again for the incoherent wall of text.
