I almost jumped tonightI donâ€™t know what stopped me. I had gotten out of my car and I was looking over the edge of the elevated highway and I had already stopped crying and feeling sorry for myself. I felt empty looking at everything from high up on that highway. Idk why I stopped. Iâ€™m still breaking down rn thinking about it. Idk what I shouldâ€™ve done or if I made the right choice in getting back in my car and driving back home. Itâ€™s an endless cycle that starts new every day for me I guess. And idk where my mind or life is anymore. Iâ€™m just so lost and I hate myself for it.
