seems like the only optionmental illness runs in my family, and I've been depressed for a while. I used to self harm in my early teens just because I felt numb. I went to therapy and things were better for a long time. I haven't self harmed since therapy. It wasn't until recently that I've been feeling awful again. 

I continued to ask my parents for mental health assistance through therapy or even being diagnosed by a doctor. My father is very anti mental health and shunned me when I went to therapy. My mother doesn't want to accept the fact that I most likely have a mental illness, and discourages me from getting help.

I almost slit my wrists back in January. My mother told me a large fight (and almost divorce) between her and my father was my fault. When I told my father I tried to slit my wrists he told me "I'm glad you didn't do something so stupid". When I told my mom she said "Boo hoo, give me a fucking break". She continues to tell me I'm not really emotional and that I find reasons to be. She tells me I'm delusional and that I'm fine. 

I'm starting to think that the only liable option is to do it. It seems like the only way anyone will believe I'm hurting is if I try. I feel like I've tried so many times to ask for help. 

I think I'm insane. I'm scared to talk to someone because I don't want to be told I'm crazy. I just want to die. I'm struggling with the idea of suicide. I dont want to disappoint anyone, but everything hurts so much.
