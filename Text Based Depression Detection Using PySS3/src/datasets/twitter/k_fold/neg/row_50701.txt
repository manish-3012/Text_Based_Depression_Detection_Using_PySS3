I'm sorry but I needed to talkHi I have been on here before reading all the stuff and I was afraid to comment or anything so i made a throw away account I'm 13 I know teen years "it will get better" i'm aware but i just need somebody to talk to the person i usually talk to that I trust she has kinda kept me sane is off living the high school experience and doesn't talk to me i feel pretty abandoned but I also feel really guilty because i feel selfish. I'm holding it all because I don't trust anybody else and it's getting to me I had a drinking problem but my supply got cut off i cat for a while but I never really was into it . I also tried normal stuff life punching a wall but my knuckles got so swollen one of the teachers said something to the guidance counselor. So this kinda like a prevention post I just needed to talk to people who have felt what i have and know what it's like thanks
