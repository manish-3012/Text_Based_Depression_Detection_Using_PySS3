Should I do it?I have no confidence outside of people I already know. I have some friends and I know they care about me a lot but I really struggle with new people. I'm really bad at parties for example, I just can't talk to new people. This year I'll be going to uni and idk what to do because if I haven't found confidence by then I'll be unable to talk to anyone and I'll be alone which sounds awful. I'd rather not die but that sounds worse than death to me. Any advice anyone?
