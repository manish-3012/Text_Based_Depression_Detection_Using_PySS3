Anyone else waiting until their children can support themselves?I came the realization earlier as I was speaking with a friend of mine that I have little to no aspirations in life. I don't have any dreams that I feel I can realistically obtain. My only goal in life is to work to support my son until I die, by my own hands or otherwise. Work, pay bills, die. That's life in a nutshell. Sure, you may say that what happens before or after work is up to me, and that's the time to make memories to fill those spaces. And you'd be right. But, being as I am a self-loathing, overweight, lazy waste of a man, I don't do much. My fiance left me a few weeks ago, because she wasn't happy anymore. Now I don't get to see my son everyday like I used to. I look across the room and stare at an empty crib, sometimes imagining that I can hear his cooing or giggling from the other room. It's maddening. I miss him, I miss my ex-fiance, and all I can do to get past any of it is work, play video games (because that's really my only hobby) and eventually, once again, die. I apologize for dragging you through all of this. I'm not even sure why I'm posting it. I'm tempted to just delete it all and wait in the silence for sleep to take me. Oh well, here goes nothing.
