the academic year is closing to an end and the summer is coming, something that should of killed me last yearlast July, my depression which had always been stable had gone of the rails. I've seen too many doctors who don't understand and the pain of each minute is becoming too much. there is so much stress, and on top of that, I'm just so damn lonely. I can't tell people about my problems because no body ever gets it. maybe they will, but by then, I would have already been many years dead.
