I wish I could help y'allMaybe it doesnt matter to you but I really wish it. I'm trying to recover myself and I'm getting a lot of support to stay with my head up but I can't forget about you. Every post or comment saying how they feel and how hopeless they are, and especially those post that didn't get any attention, I wish I had time and strength to say something to lift you up.

I can't swear you nothing, probably I'm lucky of getting this much out of the depression hole and there is some others that hadn't that chance, and I'm sorry.

I'm a lot happier but I didn't change my mind, life is hard, unfair and sometimes straight evil, and you are victims of fate.

But please, wait more, just a little bit, just enough to something to happen, something to give you reasons to not give up.

And if you give up, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, I'm sorry no one that could help were there for you.
