So tiredJust before i was going to graduate high school, I drove to the nearest bridge and sat in my car, and the more i waited, the more afraid I became. I fruitlessly called the suicide hotline and explained everything and the only thing they did was " dont kill yourself youre only 18" like gee thanks bitch. I cant say you helped but i guess you calmed me down enough to where i could drive back home. Ever since then i keep having bad memories pop up and affect my daily life. Like when i was told my parents were abusive because they didnt accept me as transgender. I've been in a sort of purgatorial state ever since. At this the only thing keeping me from killing myself is just exhaustion.
