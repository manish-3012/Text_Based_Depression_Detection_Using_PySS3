If you were would you want to live ?If you were me** 
Ok I'm 29. I used to study medicine but that didn't work out.  Then I got a job in the city which I loved and a few months later everything changed. I was 25.

Basically I started hearing a voice (never did drugs or anything) and I had this voice control me ever since. I know it sounds like a bad movie but this voice can control everything I do and say. 

It made me lose my job. It stopped me going to the gym and being healthy. It makes me smoke every day. It doesn't let me get another job or talk to a girl or exercise.

My life is watching tv / twitter/ reddit all night until 8am in the morning. Then waking up at 3pm and going out to get a coffee alone. Then watching t.v. again until 8am the next day.

Medication has been tried and doesn't help. I saw a psychologist but I guess it was too much for her because she said she wasn't experienced enough lol.

So imagine right now you can no longer work , be in love, you have to smoke which you don't want to, and you can't exercise. Your life is tv. 

It's like a prison. Would you want to live like that ?   It's not enough for me. I have a loving family and a couple of friends but it's just not enough.  I want a job and my own place and love but I will never have it because this voice won't let me.  

*Btw thankfully this voice has never made me do anything illegal or dangerous*
