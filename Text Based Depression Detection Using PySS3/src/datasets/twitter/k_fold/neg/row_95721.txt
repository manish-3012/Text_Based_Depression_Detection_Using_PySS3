lost a ton of money on a stupid bet, have no job and dropped out of school, depressed and feeling trapped.I want to end it. I don't know how to keep going. I lost a lot of money on a stupid bet, and I've got so little left. It really finally hit me tonight that my money was really gone and I wasn't gonna win. I don't know what to do. All I can think is how hard i worked for months and months to get it and not i've wasted it all. I can't believe i was so stupid. I want to die I don't know how to keep living. I've got no job, and I dropped out of school and have no skills or talents. everything seems so overwhelming. I cry everyday and i don't feel happy doing anything anymore. there is no enjoyment left and everything is a chore. I want to lay in bed all day even though my body is sore from not moving. I've gained so much weight I can't even walk properly like I did before. I have to walk with my legs in a weird position so my thighs don't rub and its causing foot and knee pain. I am hopeless and so lonely. I'm a disappointment to everyone and the world will be better off without me.
