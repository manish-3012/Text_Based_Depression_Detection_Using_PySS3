I've just about had it.Life is short. Too short to be meaningful. Is the majority of the time being pain even worth it for the good times? I say no. I say it's all a sham. I was born into this world with no say in the matter and then I'm emotionally blackmailed into staying. I have a zip gun sitting in my lap ready for when I decide I'm ready. That may not be today. May not even be this week. I don't know. I just want to be at peace. My mind is a tumultuous and toxic place for me and I can't stand it anymore. Even if I don't use it now I have it for later. I've already decided I'm going out on my own terms, just a matter of when. I'm stuck living a life incapable of keeping a job due to disability but also incapable of making myself go get aid. I'm failing at every aspect of adult life and I don't know if I can succeed even if I try. It's highly unlikely. I'm so ready to just leave this place. At this point I can't go through with it until it just becomes too much. There are too many people who I will hurt in the process. I don't want to make people hurt but at the same time I also don't want to hurt.
