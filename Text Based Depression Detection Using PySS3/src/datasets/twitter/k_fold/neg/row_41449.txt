I just don't knowIt is almost 2 in the morning. I'm drunk at home alone. My wife is God knows where probably fucking someone. My daughter is at her grandmother's house. I just want to die. This is not the first time I've thought of this. The pain is so much. I have a family. A big one. Maybe I am selfish but I just want to be gone. I try so hard. I don't know what else to do. I just don't. Everything is so hard. I don't get why. I do my best. I try to do everything right. I work hard yet it always seems like no one is on my team. It's me against the world. I am just ready to give up. I don't think I can do this anymore. I know I should think about my baby my daughter I love her so much. It is what has been had me going. I don't know if that is enough anymore.
