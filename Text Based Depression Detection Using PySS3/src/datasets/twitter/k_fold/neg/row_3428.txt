I am finally ready to dieI've come to the realization that life just isn't for me. I'm not meant to find love and I'm not meant to have any meanigful friendships with anyone. I'm just not supposed to be alive. I don't enjoy anything anymore, nothing makes me happy, all people do is lie to you to make you feel better and nothing at all is genuine. there is ALWAYS someone better. I'm always the one left out, and i'm always the one who has to just deal with being alone, i just have to accept it. I'm tired of having to accept being fucking alone. Fuck everyone else. not passing blame onto anyone, but I tried and tried to meet people, for a very long time now. I've tried Daily. I can't do this shit anymore. I'm tired of fucking excuses, and I'm sick of overall life. Who gives a fuck anymore there isn't any hope left in my heart and i'm done torturing my self, therapy doesn't work, meds don't work, Extracurricular actives do not help. nothing helps, I've tried so much to cope and to feel better with my life, but at the end of the day, I'm alone. The one fucking person who was in my life just tosses me the fuck aside any chance she fucking gets and I'm tired of it. I'm Fucking tired of her lies as much as anyone elses. I dont care! iwant to fucking die! i dont care who i hurt in the fucking process
