Feeling kinda down todayI'm feeling sort of down today and I just been thinking about everything and these past few years of my life have really sucked. That lonliness that I dealt with gave me a really hard time and I felt like no one around me understood me. I started to get really angry and I still do sometimes but more rarely but all that stuff gave me a really hard time. I felt really lonely. Don't underestimate that feeling. It gave me a really terrible time and to me was the hardest thing to deal with emotionally. I'm not feeling everything as intensely or as often right now because at this point maybe I just don't care anymore. Sometimes I even wonder if I should go on living. But anyways I was just trying to talk about everything that just destroyed me because it just feels like I'm broken right now. So yeah I've just been feeling pretty down today and thinking about everything and thinking about how much of a loser I still am because I'm still not really going anywhere with my life all because I felt destroyed by everything.
