living on extra timei tried at 15 and survived, took all the meds in the house (including some neurological meds for my mom), called a friend  so he could accompany during my leaving and just passed out right 

my folks found me before i could depart and took me to the hospital to get my stomach washed, doctors told me i would be something like "high" for a long time, since it took a toll in my mental health, which wasnt so good to begin with (i mean i had a suicide attempt right)

because of that "high" i did a lot of stupid shit i regret deeply, it felt like i was constantly dreaming and cared about nothing, eventually the high gradually passed and i had to face the consequences of all that. i hate the person i was during that time.

ever since i feel im just on extra time here. 

i had some good times, i loved and im loved right now, im not alone. i know my life is worth living for.

but I dont want to live it, i would give it up. i'd like for some ghost that had a bad time or died too young to take on my body and just let him live my life. 

i just cant find any motivation to go forward, no meaning, no reason. i cant get help because i feel every little thing they say to me are "autohelp" bullshit, you cant help 

im 27 now, 12 years have passed and still think about doing it everyday, some days i just wake up with the "death mark" over my body, feeling like "this is the day i go".

right now im just here out of curiosity and consideration for the people that love me.
