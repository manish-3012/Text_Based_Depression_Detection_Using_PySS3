I have never felt as comfortable with the idea of killing myself as I do *right now*.I recently had a hospital visit (unrelated to suicide) where I was puking my guts out, and because of my condition they could not medicate me, just wait for it to run its course. So I was puking and puking and gagging on puke, getting to the brink of passing out and thinking I was going to die, then I would puke some more.

Last time I thought of killing myself I was afraid of being alone in whatever might come after, if something came after, so that's what stopped me. But this recent experience made me realize that I'm alone in life as well, any hell I go through here is solo, so why fear what might come after? Attempting suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning will likely be no worse than spending an hour puking in a hospital. If anything, it might be less terrifying and uncomfortable, because it'll be quicker.

I can't believe how little fear I am feeling towards this. I've finally achieved the state that other people must be in that allows them to make an attempt. It is time to try and die. For so many reasons, this makes me feel so happy. Such peace. I can choke. I can vomit. I can feel extremely nauseous. I can be brought to unconsciousness. I can handle it all.

I just hope it works.
