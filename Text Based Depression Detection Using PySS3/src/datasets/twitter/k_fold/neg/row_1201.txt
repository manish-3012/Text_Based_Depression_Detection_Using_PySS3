In the last 24 hours I've lost my 2 best friends. My depression is back and I don't have anyone to talk to about it.I'm all alone now. My best friends wont talk to me. One is upset because I pointed out to her that she's in an abusive relationship. The other just decided she doesn't like me anymore. She literally told me that. I don't have anyone to talk to. 

I was finally getting out of this pit. I'm going to fall in. Last time I was hanging off a bridge ready to let go, and she pulled me back up.
