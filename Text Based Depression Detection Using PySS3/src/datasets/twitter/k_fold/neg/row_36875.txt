I used to be suicidal until I realized that I can't die until I've seen everything. The longer you and I live the higher our chances of witnessing and experiencing mars landings, anarchist revolutions, jet packs, or whatever personally interests and excites you are.I can't help but think the day after I die, aliens are going to visit Earth and I will have missed that. I can't let that happen. I have to see everything I can before I let the world win. Fuck that.

Maybe this doesn't work for you, but I've started to think about it from a different point of view and it's been helpful. Think about it.
