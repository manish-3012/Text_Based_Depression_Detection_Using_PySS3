If I do it, I'll have the final word on everythingI'm tired of being treated like crap at work and in friendships, in spite of voicing my opinions and saying how it's wrong to treat someone this way. If I take my own life, at least I'll have the last word on this. Tired of feeling this way, I know it's irrational but can't help thinking about doing it every single day just to stop feeling like this.
