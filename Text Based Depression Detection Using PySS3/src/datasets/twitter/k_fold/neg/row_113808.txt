telling therapist about suicidal thoughtsim currently in a partial hospitalization program that i go to all day every day. so far its been helpful getting to have intensive therapy on the daily snd ive been really grateful to go. yet i still purge. im still self harming. im still suicidal. so suicidal. its all i can think about. they give us all these coping mechanisms but i just cant bring myself to try to control my impulses. im a shitty person with a bad future and no motivation. im wasting my parents money on all this treatment. i want to tell my therapists how bad im feeling but im scared of what theyâ€™ll do. im a disappointment. everyone is trying so hard to help me recover and i just cant. i have no more energy to give and its just not worth it. im debating whether or not to tell them tomorrow when i go in to my program. my mom already thinks im doing all this for attention and i feel like pure shit. my therapists already know im suicidal but if i tell them how strongly im feeling it right now it might be a different story.
