I need help for a friendhi, i have a friend who lives in the uk and just expressed some really suicidal thoughts. I don't know what to say, and he just wanted to give me my last message. I'm literally so freaked out right now, how can i help? he doesn't really have a great relationship with his family, so i can't contact them. is there a way i could connect him to a hotline?
