Tired of relentless intrusive thoughts (tw self harm, suicide mention, pedophilia and rape mention)I have intrusive thoughts. All day, everyday. It started in sixth grade and it never ends. The only way to stop them is when Iâ€™m asleep and sometimes it bleeds over into my dreams as well. Itâ€™s triggers me to engage in self harm, to vomit and sob. Iâ€™m so fucking tired

I hate that my brain at some point wired itself to fill my head with the most disgusting images imaginable. What is the evolutionary advantage of a brain constantly yelling out â€œkill yourselfâ€, â€œcrash the carâ€, â€œeveryone youâ€™ve ever cared about hates youâ€, â€œyouâ€™re a racist piece of shitâ€, â€œyouâ€™re a pedophileâ€, â€œyou deserve to dieâ€, â€œyour life is going nowhereâ€, â€œyouâ€™re incapable of feeling love or being lovedâ€, â€œall of your emotions and experiences are a lieâ€, â€œif you were raped youâ€™d deserve itâ€, â€œslit your wristsâ€ 

Iâ€™m so tired. I just want to not have these thoughts, to not picture myself being disemboweled or raped or worse. I want my brain to stop picturing terrible sexual acts like incest or scat or fucking pedophilia. 

I wish someone could just tell me that itâ€™s not my fault that I picture this stuff. I want to cry to someone and release these thoughts but I know that theyâ€™re disgusting and hard to understand. 

I want someone to tell me Iâ€™m a good person, and I want to believe it but at this point I think the only way it will end is if I kill myself. I just need to stop pussying out of it
