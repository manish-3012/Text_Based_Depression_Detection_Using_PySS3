PTSD is killing me.I have had PTSD for as long as I can remember. (Save one early memory of me in my car seat with my Dad.) My biological mother wasn't (isn't) a good person. She has had no contact with me for about 5 1/2 years now, it's quite peaceful without her. 

I'm just getting *really* frustrated. I do feel happy sometimes... Whole, free, all that stuff. Then something will trigger me. It can be anything, at anytime. At a pub with friends, at work, reading at home or just thinking when it'll happen. 

I'm almost 30 and I'm tired of it. If lobotomy's were legal I'd get one. I'm tired of always fighting the same fucking fight. I'm tired of being so hyperaware and high strung my whole body is stiff with anxiety.

I've been in therapy for years, I am doing a LOT better than I was. I haven't cut or attempted in a longass time. I came *really* close to attempting the other night again though. 

It just doesn't go away. It's in my head, I literally can't escape it any other way than death. I'm on meds, in the past I've been so over-medicated I was a zombie. It felt eerie. 

I don't even know what I'm doing writing this... Partially venting and seeing if anyone has any suggestions I guess. If it wouldn't kill some family members I love more than myself I'd be gone already. I just want to rest... I'm so exhausted.
