I tried and failedOn Saturday night I took approximately 50 gabapentin, I texted one of my friends to tell her I love her and she must have got suspicious so I woke up with her shaking me awake then the ambulance came.  I was treated like a waste of time.  I need someone to take me seriously.  I don't know how long i can go on.like this.
