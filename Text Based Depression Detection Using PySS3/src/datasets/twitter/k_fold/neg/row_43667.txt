Of course Iâ€™m suicidal. Whatever. Look around. Who wouldnâ€™t be?Every opportunity to get better is in front of me. Iâ€™m on Prozac, and Iâ€™m seeing a therapist... but I donâ€™t want to take my meds. I donâ€™t want to go to therapy. I donâ€™t want to get better. I just want to be done. This world is shit and shits just getting shittier. I donâ€™t wanna be apart of it.
