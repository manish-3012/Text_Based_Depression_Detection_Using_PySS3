May do it tomorrowIf I have the chance I will take every pill in the cabinet. I have to work tonight so it may be the last time I ever work. I absolutely hate working because my anxiety is so bad so I prefer one on ones because itâ€™s easier. If my final days on earth canâ€™t be made easier then by having one on one Iâ€™ll take it as another sign that I should end it. Thatâ€™s all :p
