Iâ€™m such a disappointment. Iâ€™m so done.(14F) Im currently a freshman and Iâ€™m failing two classes mainly because I canâ€™t fucking concentrate on my work because of my damn mental health. I bet my parents would be so fucking disappointed in me. I got straight Aâ€™s last quarter and now second quarter has just started and Iâ€™m starting to really want to give up. I cried twice earlier during school because of my grades and because of me feeling like shit but ten times worse. I donâ€™t even want to be here anymore at all. Killing myself would be better for the teachers and for everyone who thinks Iâ€™m such a bitch or a hurtful person. I cant even be in a relationship without fucking it up. Considering I am a huge fuck up. I genuinely donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t want to keep going. I have too many things on my mind. I fucking hate living so much.
