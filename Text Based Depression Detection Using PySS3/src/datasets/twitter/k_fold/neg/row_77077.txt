Well, it escalated quicklyIâ€™m the 15 year old girl from today morning who doesnt want to live anymore. My boyfriendâ€™s mother took his phone and read our messages. She says iâ€™m not good for him. Sheâ€™s fucking right. I love him more than i could describe in words, he is everything for me. But my problems fall hard onto his shoulders and i think it will become too much for him. I dont want him to be broken like me. He loves me too and it would be hard on him, but do you think i should tell him to take time without contacting me, just to think? I dont want to break up, but maybe heâ€™ll rething the relationship and take the right path for himself. I dont want him to go. I love him. Help.
