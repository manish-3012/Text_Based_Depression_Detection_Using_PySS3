my only optionitâ€™s kinda terrifying, realizing that after all these years of thinking about it, iâ€™m actually going to die. itâ€™s not some finite possibility, me killing myself. itâ€™s whatâ€™s going to happen, and soon. 

if i had another option, a choice i could live with, iâ€™d take it. but i have no options. my parents have made sure of that. iâ€™d rather die than keep failing. 

itâ€™s scary, but itâ€™s my only option. coal briquettes, a sealed off room, august first. 

tell me i did well.
