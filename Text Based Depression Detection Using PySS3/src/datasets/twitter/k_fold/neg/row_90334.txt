I want to cease to existHello, everyone. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this, I guess Iâ€™m just trying to understand what is happening. About 7 years ago I slowly started on my spiritual journey. I appeared always as a very happy, smiley, bubbly person, but deep inside I was scared and judgmental and hurt. I am an only child and my parents thought what makes you stronger in life is violence. My mom would lose it if I would get a -A in Elementary School and would beat me. Long story short, after all this work of discovering myself and trying to be a better person, I completely lost my purpose or interest in life. I am not numb anymore, but I am nervous all the time, I feel extremely stressed al the time. My body is always in fight or flight mode. Today, I feel I donâ€™t even want an afterlife. I want to not exist anymore, in any space, in any dimension (if they exist). I want to be nothing, a total void. As I tell these things to my husband he sits quietly on the couch looking in space, saying he heard this for too long and, he doesnâ€™t want to talk about himself but itâ€™s too hard for him. I know I victimize myself but I wish there would be a way to just make a movement with my hand and die for good. I wish there would be a non painful way but all I researched itâ€™s either too scary/has too many options to just get paralyzed/too painful.  Did anyone ever feel the same and recovered?
