Remembered the way my mom sexually abused me my whole childhood. My schoolwork is late and my girlfriend is pissed. I just want to fucking kill myself.Sorry for the bluntness in the title. But I was trying to sext and she made one comment and I just... froze. And it all came flooding back.

I dont even feel really suicidal. I just feel like it's the only way. I just cant deal with the missing schoolwork. Or my girlfriend who's off her meds and gets pissed at every little thing. Or the images of my mom making me stare at her naked.

I live in a nice house, dad has custody, I'm a rich white kid who has it all at her fingertips... But there's always been this anger in my heart. This "i'm going to quit, and then you'll all fucking see" anger.

It would be so satisfying to get drunk and order some razors tonight.
