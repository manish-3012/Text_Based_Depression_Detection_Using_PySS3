I can't trust my family and i have no one to talk about my problems.  I was raised mostly by my grandparents,all of my childhood is linked to them.My father was always kinda harsh to me,and we had many problems.I tried to help out my father whenever i had the chance,any type of help.Sometimes i helped only to win his favor.I tried to be the perfect son,i salute all my neighbors,i'm always polite and all(i learned that from my GP).But still,i can't make my father to help me with my daily stuff,or just to listen for a few seconds.He can't give me any kind of attention,he usually prefers to play  games on his phone.
  He owed my GPs some money and he didn't gave it back since this night,when i spoke with Grandma about my problems with him.My GM also,had problems with him.I think she is not ok though,she is a little bit unstable .Bc I told her,she got so upset that she felt very ill and called my father.I don't know very much from the conversation,but somehow my father payed his debt to her.
  But now he is madly upset to me,repeating words from our past clashes,mostly insults(no need for bad words).He always made me feel like i was nothing,like i was his biggest shame .He praised me only when i did what he wanted.Oh,and always made jokes about me in the front of his and my friends.
  Now i know that i can't trust my GPs bc they always told my father about my complaints and so on.I can't speak with my GPs,bc they are likely to speak with my father(my father is my main problem).The thing is,that my father always mistreated me and i always tried to love him,but i can't continue with this.I don't have any friends or other support.I feel like i'm all alone,and everything goes so bad that it buries me alive.I don't know if i want to live anymore bc i have nothing left,no family ,no friends.Only an asshole father who disappointed,lied and even tricked me in every way,on a daily basis for 18 years .He is the ruin of my life,my friend and my enemy.
