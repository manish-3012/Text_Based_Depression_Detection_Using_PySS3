{..} self-harm and where where that leads is madness for me...signed myself out of a locked psychiatric-ward AMA a week ago (after the meth wore off) and self-care is much harder than I thought it would be. I can't stop cleaning, tidying and doing personal-hygiene since The Incident Where I Tried Meth a Second Time... But I def cannot sit. still, I cannot/ relax. were it not for the government sleep-meds and cannabis there would be INSOMNIA.  yes, the cannabis may be contributing to the paranoia, but its worth the risk of just staring out the window like a goddamn antidepressant commercial. There's these paradoxical compulsive behaviors i've become locked into that I'm aware of happening autonomously. anything but ethanol and/or methamphetamines... I eat and/or fap until things hurt and... like... grow up already! All this cannabis! after another head-injury and OD? I cannot stop spending cash on electronics to kit-out my room for the apocalypse and try to repurpose the shame of relapse into something spite-fueled... Maybe I CAN, but there's an inertia to ACTING\_0ut thats inescapable once tugged. that thread in your favorite sweater you just had to pull on... 

Me ex got out of rehab and the texts are weird - I have my own problems now, and she shoulda listened to me about her ex and the twisted coparenting/codependent relationship they're still in... poor kid.
