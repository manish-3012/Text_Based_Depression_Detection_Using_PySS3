ive been thinking about killing myself more and more latelyi recently went through a really bad break just months before i was planning on asking this girl to marry. We had been together for 6 years and known each other for 4 years before that. She left me for another man just 14 days after our 6 year anniversary. i struggle with suicidal thoughts every day i have nightmares about her every night. the only thing that keeps me going is not wanting my family to suffer through my death but i don't know how long i can hold out.
