Realized todayI realized today that I am not sad, or depressed... I am fed up. I long for the connections I had with people when I was a teenager, the comradery. Now I have nothing. I spend 24 hrs everyday laying in my bed except for the one day that I go see my therapist. I have to go to court in the mourning to fight for my right to see my son. Honestly I am just sick of fighting for everything. If the rest of my life is going to be spent alone then I don't want to be there to see it.
