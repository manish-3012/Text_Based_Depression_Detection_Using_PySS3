I see no genuine reason to exist anymoreI donâ€™t want to exist. Every day consists of me either embarrassing myself or being reminded how truly inferior I am compared to those around me and I get more and more miserable with each passing day, oftentimes having to force myself to stay standing and not literally collapse from giving up entirely.

I canâ€™t find enjoyment in anything, and any hobby or pastime I have is to desperately distract myself long enough so I donâ€™t remember how absolutely fucking helpless I truly am.

Future-wise I have nothing to look forward to. I live in a bloated and egotistical country with a dying economy and am repeatedly told by every single person I know that I should be grateful and suck it up.

I only ever feel anger, often exploding at the smallest inconvenience. When I donâ€™t feel anger I feel either nothing at all or an all-consuming despair.

The longer I go on the worse I feel, and I would be doing myself a mercy if I died quietly in the corner of my dorm instead of forcing myself to stay awake. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and medication, but it never does anything. Frankly, I donâ€™t want it to do anything. I would be happier if I couldnâ€™t remember anything at all
