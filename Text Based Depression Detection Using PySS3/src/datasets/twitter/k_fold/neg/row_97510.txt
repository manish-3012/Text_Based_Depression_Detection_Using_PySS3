I feel broken.I fear I lost them. We were so close, we cared so much for each other's safety and well-being... but for a little over 3 whole weeks, I've been blocked everywhere by them. It was on such a sudden, uninformative note... with a promise of wanting to get back in contact, but not knowing when... 

It feels like it's all my fault. I fear that I did this myself... and for the third time in my life, I have to deal with losing someone I was close with. And I don't mean that in the sense of death... just that we're no longer friends.
