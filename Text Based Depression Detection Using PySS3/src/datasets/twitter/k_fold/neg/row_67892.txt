do I even count?????Iâ€™m not even sure I could call myself suicidal... Iâ€™m kind of a generally unhappy person, prone to anxiety and poor moods.... but whenever I do something wrong or hurtful or stupid my mind immediately goes there. I start thinking â€œmaybe you should just kill yourself.... youâ€™re a failure, youâ€™re such a fuck up... I want to die.â€ In the moment, those thoughts are so strong... but an hour later... I feel relatively normal.Sometimes it doesnâ€™t feel real. Maybe Iâ€™m doing it to myself on purpose. Idk. I truly do hate everything about myself. I hate my body, I hate my mind, I hate how worthless I am. I canâ€™t think of a single thing I like about myself. I think Iâ€™ve been dealing with undiagnosed mental illnesses for years. Trying to imagine the future is like looking into a dark, bottomless pit. Iâ€™m hopeless a lot of the time. I know deep down that I will never kill myself, but if it werenâ€™t for the pain that it would cause my family... I probably would have done it on impulse a long time ago.
