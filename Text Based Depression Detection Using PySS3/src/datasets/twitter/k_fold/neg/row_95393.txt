Seeking HelpIf I seek help for suicide idealisation, will I receive help? I mean I still need to figure the logistics (e.g. a fatal method, aftermath) but within that period I suppose I could also cease the action. If I was to seek help though, wouldn't it be the case that I actually didn't want to take my life and therefore not suicidal and not need help? It's something that I'm hesitant to bring up with my psychologist but I was hoping someone could enlighten me on whether reaching out will actually yield a positive result.
