I think my days are numbered.I mean, I guess everyone's are, but...

I don't know how numbered. I just know numbered.

I don't feel good.

I'm pushing everyone away. Everyone's leaving. Everyone hates me. I hate me.

I can't do this alone.

No matter who messages me, no matter who tells me I'm not alone, I'm alone. I'm just meant to always be alone.

I can't live this life. I hate it.
