TitleMy problem is, every time I feel ready to do it and imagine myself jumping off the bridge I shiver in terror and remind myself of the things I like doing. It's completely delusional but it's hard to overcome instincts, it's like I love myself too much to die. I have to find a way out. I can't escape the mazes of my mind but I need to work within them to die.
