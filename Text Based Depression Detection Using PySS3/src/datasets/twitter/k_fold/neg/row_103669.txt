I'm a twenty-one year old girl with nothing to live for.I just don't want to be here anymore.

I have been suicidal since I was about twelve years old. My family fell apart when I was fifteen. 

Now, I am 21. I live alone. I have no friends. My family is incredibly selfish, and none of them talk to me. 

When I say I have no friends, I mean that I legitimately do not have any friends. I can go days without speaking to another human being. I lock myself in the bedroom of my apartment and sleep unless I have something to do. 

I only do the bare minimum - going to classes when I have them (and never speaking to anyone) and going to work (which is super simple and mostly requires me sitting at a desk doing nothing for hours). I don't see anyone outside of these things.

I've held on for a while because I have stuff I want to do. I've always wanted to help other people struggling with mental health through writing, and I decided I wanted to get an MFA, but I took the GRE, and I had a panic attack and bombed it. I cannot get into grad school with the scores I received. 

It's seeming more and more likely that I will not be able to accomplish my dreams, despite my best efforts. With no friends or family, I don't know what I do. 

I desperately want a reason to continue living, but I have held on for this long, and I have absolutely nothing to show for it. It's exhausting. Bad things just always happen to me. Even this week, everything that could possibly go wrong has gone wrong. It would be fine if this didn't happen to me so much, but it just happens so often that I have lost the will to fight at all.

I don't know what it is like to have someone care about me. I don't know what it's like to have someone care whether I live or die. 

I don't know how to continue living.
