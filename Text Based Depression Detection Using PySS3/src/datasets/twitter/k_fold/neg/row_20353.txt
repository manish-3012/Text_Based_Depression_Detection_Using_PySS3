I'm not even mad......Just very numb.

I don't even know what to write here.  I guess I should start by saying that I have been mulling suicide over in my head for the last 4 years.  I just don't seem to fit in with this world and I have nothing to add to it.  It's just coming to the end of the road in terms of my options, it seems.  I have tried many avenues of personal advancement:  the Marine Corps (medical discharge in recruit training), employment (couldn't hold a job for more than 4 months), and college (failing classes will prevent me from re-applying in the spring).  I don't see much else for me to do here and I don't want to end up being a 40 year old man-child living in his parents basement.  If that's all that awaits me, then I'd rather just end it now.

I have mixed feelings about posting this.  On the one hand I do want SOMEONE to know what I'm thinking because no one I know asks how I am doing. On the other hand, this is a blatant cry for help and I hate to think that people are only talking to me because I end up gushing on an internet forum.  I realize that's what this is for, but it still doesn't make me feel any better about it.

I'm up for talking and I will answer any and all questions honestly.

EDIT:  I also upvote anyone that comments in here. If that makes a difference or not.
