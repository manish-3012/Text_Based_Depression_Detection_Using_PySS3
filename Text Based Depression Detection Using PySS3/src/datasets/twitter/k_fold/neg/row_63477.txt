I don't know what to do.17, gay (not out), few friends, anxiety, depression, failing school. No health insurance (see below) and it seems my school can't really do much to help for legal reasons I don't fully understand.

My mom also has very few friends and seems to be depressed and we have no money right now. She has a temp job that she couldn't go to last week because of a lack of gas money (which has been resolved for now) and no opportunity to get anything else. She's saying we won't have any money for at least 2 weeks and she doesn't know how I'm going to be able to eat or how she's going to be able to pay rent. She lost her previous job last year and they gave her a fairly nice deal on health insurance, but that expired at the beginning of this year.

My dad doesn't acknowledge me and my uncle shut the door in my mom's face so family isn't going to help. My mom has a few friends who have helped before but she doesn't want to ask them this time around.

I really don't know what to do. I know it'd be easy for me to get caught up on school but I can't concentrate at home. I've never been able to. I've basically wasted my teenage years and now I have no work ethic. Right now I'm not suicidal but I am afraid and I'm worried about my mom. Things were really bad in December, too, but I was seeing a therapist then. I can't now because of the health insurance issue.

I have one very close friend I've talked to a bit about this but I don't think I'm communicating it very well. The only thing that takes my mind off things is ultimately wasteful, e.g. playing video games or watching Youtube videos of video games.

I don't want to go to school tomorrow but that's not an option, I've already missed like a dozen days this semester and I'm at the point where the school district could take my mom to court if they wanted.

I don't know what to do. If you read all of this, thanks, I guess.
