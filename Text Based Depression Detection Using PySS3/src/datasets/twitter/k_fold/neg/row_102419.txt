Need help on just a little more than strategies, I need answersSorry about the corny title but it sums up my problems and I wanted something to catch eyes. I'm 16 and I have school tomorrow. Please don't think this is a pathetic high school drama rant, please stay long enough. I'll sum up just mostly my recent problems really quick enough for you to decide whether or not my issue is stupid.       

I've being awake for 20 hours without feeling fatigued.              
I have family issues; my mother married at young age and had an abusive controlling husband. She is not very properly adapted to reality as a result.        
One of the many examples of the above that happened just toda. My brother will have to take a mental disability test. I discussed this issue with my mother and she clearly does not understand the situation. She believes he will become famous or successful regardless.        

The **main problem ** I have is a lot of - I hope this does not sound pretentious - philosophical problems. I know, typical, 16 year old with philosophical problems but it's giving me major life issues. I would like answers but I can't get it from the friends I know (one of the main reasons why I feel isolated.) The psychologists I can afford (which is through free community clinics) clearly cannot give me more than false sympathy, clearly thought-on-the-spot, poorly thought out or strategies that are not very relevant. I do not wish go discuss my problems with anyone else who has not encountered these problems yet because I don't want to bring unnecessary distress. I want to find someone who I know can sympathise completely.         
       
Where would I be able to find someone that could help me with these issues?
I'm sorry about this hastily written and scattered post. This post has being condensed as possible so a lot of the context and reasoning that would make my post seem less dumb aren't there. Sorry about that.         
Thanks for reading.
