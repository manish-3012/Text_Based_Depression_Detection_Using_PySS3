Breakups are so much funSo I finally broke up with my ex today. I live with her unfortunately and it was a very messy breakup. I don't know if anyone else here has BPD but I do and I honestly ruined what could have been a mature breakup.

This morning I broke up with her and I was very civil and kind, as was she. Well of course I ruin that with my fear of abondment and ask to get back with her except she doesn't feel comfortable with it. She then calls me manipulative and we have a second round at the breakup but this time its nasty. I say some really horrible out of character things and she fights back. 

Now shes gone for good, and I'm here alone. I have extremely dark thoughts about why I should even continue existing. I lose control over myself and I say things I don't mean. I miss her a lot, and I really shouldn't because we were absolutely horrible together. I feel so bad for the things that I said to her. I hate myself so much. I hate who I am, I really don't deserve anything remotely happy in my life. No matter how far I progress I always go back to rock bottom. I can't do this anymore.
