I wish I used that gun.My mom's boyfriend left it out one night by complete accident over a month ago and every night I regret that I never used it to end my life. There was a full magazine and it would've just been so simple and quick. I'm so tired of trying and I'm so fucking tired of waking up. I regret it so much. Why didn't I have the fucking stones to do it back then.
