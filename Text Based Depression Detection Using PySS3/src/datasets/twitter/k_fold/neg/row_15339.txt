The reasons why I'm delaying my death.Sorry for posting so much, but I had to get this off my chest.

Today I was suposed to kill myself.I haven't done that though.I said a few days ago I would kill myself today, Wednesday 25th of May, but I couldn't do it because after the exam I've done this morning, I've been given the mark and it was a 9/10.So it was a fantastic mark.I could not kill myself without at least tell my parents how great the exam came out. 

Nonetheless, I don' t feel good.I feel terribly sad, mournful, devastated, really depressed.It was like if I lied or something because I didn't feel well despite the fact that I got a good mark.I consider my life a shit and something which I shouldn't have been given, ever. I feel like shit. I cried a while ago hidden in my room.I'll do it again before going to sleep, secretly and in silence as always.Me and my pillow. I hope all it ends this week.On Friday.Not really sure, because I have another exam.Let's see if I can fucking do the only thing I want from life for once.And let's see if I'm let alone so that I can finally do it.
