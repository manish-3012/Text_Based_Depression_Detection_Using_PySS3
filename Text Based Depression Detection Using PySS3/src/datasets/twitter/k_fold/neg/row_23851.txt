"Think about how it would make your family feel" is a terrible reason to keep someone aroundLike seriously, I'll see this sentiment pop up every now and again across reddit and it makes my blood boil. Honestly do these people think that guilting suicidal people into sticking around is really healthy for them? It puts even more stress on them that they dont need. 

Plus, it doesnt even hold up logically. Think of my family? I love my family very much but it wont matter how they feel when I'm dead, because I'm dead. I cant think of how it would affect them. Unless you wanna send me to the afterlife with crippling guilt, so thanks for that.

If you honestly tell people this to try and help, go fuck yourself. Seriously
