Love could save us allLove for my family keeps me going. The thought of them forever associating Christmas with my suicide stops me for now, but the more I think about it the more I just want to end this miserable existence. I don't want the things others seem happy with it's all ever unattainable or doesn't fufill me. Whats always stopped me for other people but the longer I go on the more I seem to think everyone is better off without me. Yes it will be pain for them but it's not as painful as the hurt I'll cause by being here I don't know how to function or look after myself I'm just a burden on everyone.
