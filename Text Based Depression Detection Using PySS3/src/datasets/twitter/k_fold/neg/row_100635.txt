I see no reason to go on.I met with everyone that matters to me.  There is nothing left for me.  I have it all planned out.  I am not posting here to plead for arguments against my actions.   I post here because sometimes thers IS NO OThER OPTION.  People who don't get to such a level don't understand due to that fact.  Neither do I encourage suicide.  If you have the willpower and fight in you to turn things around, that is amazing.  You have my respect.  I don't envy you, but I also don't possess those qualities.  Goodbye.
