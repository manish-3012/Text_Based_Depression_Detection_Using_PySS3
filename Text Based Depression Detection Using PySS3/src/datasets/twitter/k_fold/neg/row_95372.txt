Currently hospitalized. (trigger warning.)hi. I didn't think the first thing I was gonna do when I woke up was use reddit but here I am.

I'm (19F) &amp; I was diagnosed with depression when I was 12.

Yesterday night I finally snapped, snitched on myself and was taken to the hospital for trying to overdose on Roxicodone &amp; having a severe self harm incident. this all happened at about 4 in the morning &amp; ive been here since. I thought I was going to be institutionalized but I guess not. I'm being discharged in a few hours. I guess i can understand why they aren't keeping me here longer with the whole covid &amp; sickness thing going on but i'm just going to go home and feel the same.

i'll try and update when I leave.
