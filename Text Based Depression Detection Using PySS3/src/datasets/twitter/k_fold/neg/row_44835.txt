Every choice Iâ€™ve made feels like a mistakeIâ€™m 19 now and have been considering suicide for around a year and have been depressed since I was 14. Iâ€™ve lost all my friends and live with my parents. 

After 3 years I think theyâ€™re finally accepting that Iâ€™m gay but theyâ€™ve still left me hurting and still donâ€™t validate my feelings for other men and mostly ignore it(they talk about me going back to a conservative Christian college or moving to the Middle East) it makes me wonder if they donâ€™t really care about me and only care about this image of the son they are wanting. 

Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m surrounded by freaks, my roommate was a freak, my coworkers are freaks, grandparents, customers. Everywhere I look I see sickness, both mental and physical SO HOW SICK COULD I BE?

When I was still in High School I would get so depressed Iâ€™d have out of body experiences that WRECKED ME. For each one I had I would learn this knew and terrifying feeling of dread, bringing light to expressions that didnâ€™t belong in my head. If I could still leave my body now Iâ€™d be fine but I canâ€™t since, all itâ€™s left me is this feeling of pain that rips into my arm when I think of how much regret I have. Sometimes it gets bad enough to bloom inside of my chest.

I just regret nearly everything Iâ€™ve done, all the lost opportunities. Every option that wouldâ€™ve let the story continue, I avoided and now I feel like the shows over and Iâ€™ve missed all my trains. After all Iâ€™ve been through I canâ€™t ever go back to being a normal person.

Iâ€™m really disturbed about who I was as a kid between age 1-5. Thereâ€™s something not right about this little boy and I Ponder over what it could be when Iâ€™m dreaming. I was kept away. At the time I had asthma and autism and almost died from the asthma when I was 4. 

I donâ€™t like this experience and have considered ending my life many days but the idea of my mom wailing bothers me. I have memories of it in the past and itâ€™s not pleasant.
