I feel calm because I finally have a way outI've ended up in a place where i can't go back. I just tied up a loose end so I can do it with as little guilt as I'll ever have. I would cry when I thought of them finding out, but now I've done everything to make a lot of them hate me or resent me. I will not be one of those people who people describe as being so full of life before the end. No, it's been coming to a head for a while. I know I'm doing the right thing for most of them in the long run. I can only drain the positive energy from people for so long before the situation is forced to change itself.
Life is for the living.
