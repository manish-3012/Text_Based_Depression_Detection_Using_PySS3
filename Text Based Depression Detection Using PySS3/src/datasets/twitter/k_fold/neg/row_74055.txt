Writing here because I feel everyone else abandoned meYesterday I laid in bed weeping and bleeding into my sheets from my wrists. I didnâ€™t cut for a very long time...
My room is a mess from looking for a sharp object...I found my friend in the shards of broken glass

I really donâ€™t know how to survive the day, living hurts so much..
