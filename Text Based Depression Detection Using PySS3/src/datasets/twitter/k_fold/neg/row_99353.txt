UPDATE: Today is my BirthdayI posted about 2 weeks ago on my birthday and got so many nice comments and messages that I wanted to post an update to say iâ€™m still alive, iâ€™m doing better, and thank you all so much. My mom found me when she got home from work and took me to the hospital where I spent about a week, but things have been pretty good since I got out. One of my friends flew out to see me and we just got back from camping and I had so much fun, and I know where I want to go to school and what to study next year. For the first time in months iâ€™m feeling hopeful and excited for the future and I thought I should share it with all of you. Thank you
