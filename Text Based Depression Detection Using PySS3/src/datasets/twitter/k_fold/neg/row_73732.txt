I'm sorry....I'm sorry that I must go. I'm sorry that I am a waste of space. I'm sorry that I cannot be there for anyone. I'm sorry that no one trust me. I'm sorry that everyone hates me. I must go and carry on , leave this life behind and make everyone happy by going away. I'm sorry I wont be there and graduate from college. I'm sorry I have been a person that people look up too. I'm I have been a jackass. I'm sorry that life is too short for people like me. I'm sorry for wasting the world resources. I'm sorry to be living. I just here wasting away m. Today is the day for me to go. No one can stop me from doing it today, well be leaving in the morning. I might change my mind but I highly doubt that now cause everyone hates me. Goodbye everyone i must go on and live somewhere else good night
