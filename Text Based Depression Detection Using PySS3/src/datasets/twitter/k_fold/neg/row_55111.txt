Anyone want to make a new friend?I know some subs for that exist, but I find way more like minded, and people who understand a lot of what I feel on this one.

A lot of people on this sub are lonely and obviously depressed, and I think it'd be nice to try to actually get to know people here, since I feel the same.

Posted on /r/depression earlier as well.
