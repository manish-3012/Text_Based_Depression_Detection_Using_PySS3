Confessed to my boss that I wanted to kill myself and he laughed...I have been stand in my in the back of the store for nearly 2 hours before my shift starts. I came in in a very upset mood, seeing how yesterday was the day I had a breakdown after I got home from work and passed out. I never showered, never changed from my previous clothes, have not eaten, and I feel like my whole body is vibrating.

I came in and went to get a drink, then went to the back. My assistant manager asked me if I was okay, but I ignored her, to avoid conversation. I walk into the back and shortly after, she comes in asking me what's wrong and why I didn't say anything. Naturally, I stare at her blankly and say, "I want to kill myself, and this is not a joke".

She and I go into VERY little conversation, and my manager comes in the back and is staring at me. I look at him and he says "What's wrong with you this time?". So I proceed to reply with exactly what I said to the AM.

He scoffs, tries to play it off by saying some dumb shit, then carries that into his life experiences. As soon as he laughed, I drown him out and stared blankly at the boxes on the floor. At this point, after about 10 minutes of rambling, "Well I cant have you being a liability so I'll be back.".

I haven't seen him since, and I'm supposed to clock in to work in less than 20 minutes. I've yet to make progress and I still want to die. I really hate putting myself out here, being this low and weak, but I'm at my wits  end with everything and done want to go on anymore.
