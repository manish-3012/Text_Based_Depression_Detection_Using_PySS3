All day every dayI think of killing myself all day every day. The pain I have brought into our family by betraying my wife is torturing her and killing me from the inside out. The o lay thing I am hanging on to is the hope that she can forgive me and move forward with me. I fucking hate myself so much for this disgusting fucking act. I hate the pain I caused and the pain I feel. I canâ€™t deal with it any longer. I just want them to be happy and I canâ€™t see that happening as long as I exist. My heart bleeds for her and our children and the pain I brought to their lives. Please forgive me. Please donâ€™t hate me like I hate myself. I love you all.
