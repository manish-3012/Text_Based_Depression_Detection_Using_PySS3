I do not know what to do...Let me start off by saying that I am trans, 32 and I live in Texas, I moved from PA in February after my family and I split ways. I've not spoken to most of them between 8 months to 2 years. I've spent 26 days total in a Psych unit at the end of last year. When I moved I had nothing left in PA and I have so little here. I came because of a good job offer and one of my few friends left.

My break downs are becoming much more frequent now. I have so little desire to do anything else. From the time one employers insurance ended and this new employers started all my medicines ran out. I've gone through Health Advocate in attempt to get a reference soon. Even if I get in next week most medicine won't start to have an effect for 3 to 6 weeks. I don't know if I can hold on any more.

I've also started an hour check in system with my one roommate who I adore, but even that I don't think will be effective for much longer. I am so tired of fighting. When I was in the hospital the first time I was diagnosed with BPD type 1, severe depression and debilitating anxiety. I can really no longer function in most normal environments.

I don't know what to do and I am so close to just laying my head down to rest 1 more time.
