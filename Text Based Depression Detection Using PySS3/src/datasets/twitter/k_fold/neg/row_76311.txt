Why am i like this?Ive been like this for a long time. I go back and forth between bouts of extreme anxiety and depression. For the past 3 or so months ive relapsed back to drinking, cutting, sleeping way too much, and generally wishing for death. 

Im 17, so i feel like anything i feel is invalid. People always say things like "youre young, you have your whole life ahead of you" or "teenagers are so dramatic". It just makes me feel worse. 

Im so tired. I dont want to be like this anymore. Why am I like this?
