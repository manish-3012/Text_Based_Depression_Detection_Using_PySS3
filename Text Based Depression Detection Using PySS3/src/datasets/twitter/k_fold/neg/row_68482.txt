Does anyone else have these few things in life that prevent you from killing yourself?For me that's beautiful moments with cool people, that I mostly always end up not having contact with anymore, so that's like a few times a year if at all, playing the drums and listening to music, playing with a band. And lastly watching movies and series' playing video games, I just started Dragon Quest 11, and I just don't want to not use the opportunity to play all these amazing stories and being invested in these storylines and playing new amazing games, that I wouldn't even know about. 
On the other side are my parents, who raised me to be an incompetent fuck when it comes to actual physical work, my father being a highly nicotine addicted sociopath, who screamed at my mom and especially me ever since I was like 7 or 8, and my mom, who I always liked, who is now pissed about everything and screams at me and my sister about every little thing we say and do, my sister especially screaming back and my father often joining in too, so while I am avoiding screaming back and forth with my family members within my possibilities, I still have to listen to this shit every day. I also struggle at school, not being liked by a lot of teachers and other students, and also don't really have the motivation to work, often also thinking in class or when having to do homework or Learning for a test that I'll hopefully be ready to kill myself when I have my Finals. To all of that comes a deeply rooted porn addiction, that started when I was a young child already, which is not really the cause of my problems, but by dependence of it makes it way harder to cope with it. I have battled it, and it went well often, but when I'm really low it just somehow always comes back and I think it has never been worse than it is right now. 

So theres all this bullshit to life, which I don't really expect to get better over the next decade or maybe even ever, and the little things that I don't wanna miss out on and use my opportunity for and I'm not sure weather it's worthy living for and having to hate every time you wake up for or not...
