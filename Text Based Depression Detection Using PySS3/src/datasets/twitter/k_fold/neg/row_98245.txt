My parents aren't taking me seriously (M17)So I've been planning my suicide for past couple of days now. A friend reached out to me and showed up to unannounced. He made sure I didnt do it. Yet the next day my parents sat me down and talking about why my friend showed up/was worried about me. Some how they knew that what I told him I was thinking about doing. The surprising fact is that they confronted it to me like I did something bad. They kinda got angry at me and kept asking why I'm not talking to them. Now they are forcing new rules on me and 'parenting' me even more. They know I hate them already and taking control away from me makes me hate my life even more. I'm really regretting telling my friend that I was suicidal(even though it helped me realize some positive in my life)  because now my parents are involved and making shit more difficult.
