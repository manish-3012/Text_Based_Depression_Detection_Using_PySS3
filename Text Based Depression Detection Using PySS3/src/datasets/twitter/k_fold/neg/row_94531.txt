My DNA has destroyed my teeth and I am no longer humanI am 100% English and due to this (combined with very bad luck) my teeth are dark brown and crooked to the point that other English people's teeth look way better.

I have stopped brushing them a year ago because what is the point.  Everyone from other countries have perfect straight white teeth and even my sister, who hasn't brushed her teeth for years, has better teeth than me.  There are British people who have far better teeth than me but still brown and rotten by global standards.

I am also beginning to take out me jealousy and self hate on other people.  I must die now.  I am too subhuman to cope with being deformed in a mature way.  I have screamed bigoted things at people with straight white teeth.  Even if I never did stuff like that again, I really hurt people so the only justice is to kill myself.

Sorry for the bad English, I am illiterate with low functioning autism and a very low IQ
