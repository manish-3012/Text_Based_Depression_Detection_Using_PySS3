Honestly what keeps you going, if you still are.I really don't know what keeps me going, my life just keeps going to shit no matter what I do, my SO says in time things will get better, it's been like fucking 2 years and things just keep fucking my path for my future, so like what's the point ya know? I'm trying so damn hard to improve my self but all that ever happens is that I get judged for doing so, going to the gym, eat better, just be a better me. But like I said with things keep going south and people judging me and now I have no motivation anymore, I'm so fucking close to just dropping it all and ending everything.
