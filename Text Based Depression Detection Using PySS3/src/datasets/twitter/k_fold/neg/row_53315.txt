I am a disappointmentI think I should kill myself. I can't seem to get my life together. I just left a good job without giving a 2 week notice. My parents are extremely disappointed in me. I also lied about not going in to work before putting in my resignation. I told my supervisor my grandma was in the hospital but in reality, I was too depressed to leave the house.

I can only think of one solution: suicide.

I'm 25. I should not be acting like this.

7500 mg of benadryl is sitting on my dresser. I think that's a fatal dose.
