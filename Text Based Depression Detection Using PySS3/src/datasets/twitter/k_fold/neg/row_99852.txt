I just don't want to be hereI wasted my whole life, I have nothing to show for it, I've had anything meaningful in my life. I was supposed to be "smart", but I could never do anything responsible because of anxiety and depression. I haven't even finished my degree. I'm on disability for it, when I first applied I felt that I should just muddle through, that I wasn't disabled enough to actually deserve it. Now I realize that I was, which is even more shameful.  I had to stop paying my credit card bills this month, I actually had good credit, for the first time since I left my job. But I have had so many medical bills recently that I don't have any money left at the end of the month. My cats need to go to the vet, I don't have money for that. If my car breaks down I am stuck. I have to have surgery in a month, it is because I had complications from another surgery last year. That's when everything came crashing down. I have cried everyday for the last ten months. I am on three different medications and it doesn't help. Before last year, I felt I deserved my fucked up life. Last year I realized that I didn't, and that I could have had what I wanted in life, but I fucked it all up. Now I am 53, and it's too late. There is nothing left except to get old and bitter. I just want to have never existed. I don't want to hurt myself. Maybe before, when I hated myself, but not now. I just don't want to live like this. I don't want to watch myself get old. I never got to be young. I just don't know how I could have been so stupid.
