i am no onemy mom was the only one who i had always felt was right there and always on my side, until i did what i always do best and fucked everything up. i wont go into detail because i dont want to waste your time, but she told me she wanted to throw up when she looks at me and that ive lost all of her trust. 

it may have been a few weeks ago now and she may be over what i did, but what she said still leaves an aching pit in my stomach.

i was just put on an antidepressant and i was doing so so well, but after everything thats going on... i just feel empty and worthless. my suicidal thoughts are back and i cant stop them. these thoughts and my anxieties wear my down and are slowly drowning me. 

i dont know what to do anymore, i dont know how to handle myself. im such a worthless, disgusting, poor excuse of a daughter and im so unbelievably sorry. i just want to end myself, ive fucked up so much that i dont know how much i care anymore.

im addicted to self harm, its my crutch whenever im feeling numb and i hate it. self harm makes me feel even more worthless and shitty, but its the only thing that makes me feel anything anymore.
