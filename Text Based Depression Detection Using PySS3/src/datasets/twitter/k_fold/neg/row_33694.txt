Life may not be worth it after allI'm young and there's not been a single time I haven't been thinking about blowing my brains out. 

Nobody ever loved me. Except the girl that somehow appeared in my life, and filled it with joy.

She's gone now. And she took all my happiness on her way out the door.

I'm alone. Worthless. Unloved. A waste of air. I'm a piece of shit.

I want to end it all, because life is not worth it after all of this. Love is a lie, it will dissapear eventually and leave you heartbroken.

I don't even know if I want help.

I just want to sleep. And if I can, never awake.

edit

made up my mind about it, that was quick.

see ya, reddit. i hope i was strong enough to see things get better
