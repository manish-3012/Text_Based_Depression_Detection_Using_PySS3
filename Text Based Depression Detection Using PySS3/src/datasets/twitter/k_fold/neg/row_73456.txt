Goodbye worldGoodbye world,

Iâ€™ve had enough of this shit. Ever since my youth Iâ€™ve been horribly depressed. I grew up without friends from constantly moving around. People always looked at me as an outsiderâ€”an outcast. The depression started around 6th grade. I stopped eating my lunches. The cause? Moving from Florida to Virginia. That fucked me up. Then Virginia was a nightmare. Prejudice and just painful shit happened there. But something good came out of it allâ€¦Figure Skating. Figure skating became my passion. It helped me when I had no one and no friends. It gave me a sense of purpose. The sport made me feel like I could do anything and be anything I wanted. I reached levels I never dreamed of. I was happy for a while. 

Shit got real the moment I switched coaches. I became anorexic andâ€¦.it was too cold to skate anymore. I was too weak and fragile. I ruined and took away from myself the only thing that made me happy. 
Fast forward. On the verge of suicide. Lets just say that life sucks right now. I have never been so depressed in my life. I just canâ€™t do this anymore. 

My boyfriend is the hugest disappointment. He has no time for me anymore and I feel like I have no real support system. No one does or ever will love me. Who was I kidding? I never can get married or have beautiful babies. Someone like me isnâ€™t meant to be loved or have a relationship. I really wish the cards fell another way. I wish I didnâ€™t have to suffer so much and try to be happy. Iâ€™m sad and I hate that I feel this way all the time. So tonight I am going to end my life. How? I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t think taking Tylenol is the best idea. Iâ€™ll think of  something. 

Iâ€™m just so sorry this whole â€œlife thingâ€ didnâ€™t work out. It really has the ability to make some people happy. Just not me. Definitely not me.
