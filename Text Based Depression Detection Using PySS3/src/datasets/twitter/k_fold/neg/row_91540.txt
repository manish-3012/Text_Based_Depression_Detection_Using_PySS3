FreedomI thought I was going to end it all about a month ago. Guess I missed out on that. Honestly I don't see things getting any better. So I guess I'm just waiting for the next emotional spike to happen so that I may do the deed. So long as I can be free of the isolation, judgement, jealousy and anguish, I don't care when it comes. 

This feeling has been around for 6+ years now. So here's to hoping that it comes soon.
