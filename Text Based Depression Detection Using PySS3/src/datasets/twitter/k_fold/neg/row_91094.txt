6 april 2019, 5h09pmIâ€™m halfway inbetween " I really missed that feeling " and wanting to stab my fucking throat with a knife. 
Thatâ€™s all I will ever be, a drag, a loser and an addict. There is no fucking end to this. 

At this point, withdrawing from others is an act of mercy. 
My self-destruction knows no boudaries, I can never make any real progress and I will never heal from the guilt and the shame. 

Death is the only way out
I do not have the power to turn my life around, I am weak and rotten to the core. 

Life is so, so far away.
Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m already a part of the dead and trying to fight it feels so wrong, like trying to fight against fate itself. 

Itâ€™s pointless, EVERYTHING is so pointless, and nothing ever gets to me anymore. 

I am one of the damned.
So, so far away...

Nothing will save me. 
There is nothing left to be saved.

I am getting so annoyed just at writing this. 

I am one of the demons and the ghosts now.
