Just someone- please...Hello great people of reddit, I hope you don't mind my posting here with a bad english, since it's not my native language.

  
To be honest, this post is actually a cry for help.

I don't know if I could have the luxury of to be expect something to fix me from the people I don't know. For a long time, I'm telling of jokes about me killing myself to my friends around me, but the reactions I get "don't do it, get your shit together, are you stupid." Obviously they don't take me seriously. But, I'm telling myself that I will definitely not kill myself for a long time, but I have been thinking about suicide every day for the last year, and I cannot help thinking about it will bring me peace.

I am sending this message from one of the third world countries and yes it is a muslim country. I can't say its name. We have a dictator on our heads and he destroyed my whole family and our lives. A year ago, one morning the police raided our home and took my father. Since I was a lawyer (for two months at that time), I prepared for every possible scenarios and I saved my father for the day. But they were coming after us. Our phones were listened, we were followed, we were repeatedly interrogated, my father was constantly having to go to the police station and one day he could not stand anymore and said that he wanted to run away (illegally). He made the right decision because he would eventually reveal that he was lying and would be arrested and sentenced to a minimum of 15 years in prison. Not that he is a bad person, he's the kindest person I've known. He even get angry at me even when I accidentally step on an ant when I was a kid. He valued all kinds of lives. But he was against the govertment.   


There was a ban off going abroad. As someone who just graduated from college, I found thousands of dollars and found human traffickers and started a long journey with my father. Driving the car in the dark of the night for hours in silence. Like I'm taking my father to his death.

I handed it him over to the traffickers and luckily my father successfully fled to Europe and went to Norway after a terrible journey and there he applied for asylum.

If anyone from Norway reading this,, you are the most perfect and kindest people in the world. Although you have no obligation, you look after my father in the best way possible, you are truly an angel in your hearts, and I can't thank you enough for this. 

One of my brothers is now at the university and by washing dishes he's trying to live in America. He was one of the most successful students in our country. He was in top 100. But now he is washing dishes not that I despise. It just saddens me. My father lives alone in Norway, all day he's sitting alone with no one to talk and he is old and very sick. My mom and my 5-year-old brother stay together and my strong mother, whom I have not seen crying once in her life, now cries every day. And my little brother was the most cheerful child in the world, he closed in and doesn't even speak with us. I try to make money by working 15 hours a day in order to maintain the whole system. Giving money to my brother and and mother and myself...

Those who do this to us are a government that uses religion and its followers. And it's all in the name of ALLAH(GOD). Soon my mom and little brother will go from here and I will be all alone. I would have killed myself long time ago, but despite such bad things happening to my family, they have never lost their hopes, but killing myself would destroy all their hopes. Maybe that's why I couldn't kill myself, yet, but at the age of 25, my life has come to an end. I am neither in joy nor excitement nor have a dream anymore. 

I had a dream of being a writer since my childhood, and now I was published in a book but I couldn't even be happy. I don't care anymore. I have left this dream to rot now I'm just writing stories for nothing. Just to write. In the new story I'm telling a story of a child (that is me) and in one sentence I wrote it says, One goes to North to keep going forward, and one goes to South for his death. 

So this summer I'll go to North/Norway, there I'll try to find a reason to live, and if I can't find it, I'll go to South/New Zealand, just to kill myself. No matter what happens in my life, I can't stop being a stupid romantic. I don't wanna kill myself at home or in my bathroom. If I'm gonna die, at least it should be something that deserves to be in my stories.

I had one of the scariest and saddest experiences that a 24-year-old could experience, and now the whole family's burden is on my shoulders and I can't take it any more. I just wish to die and find peace. 

I hope someone reads this, not to reply but just to read and have a good day..
