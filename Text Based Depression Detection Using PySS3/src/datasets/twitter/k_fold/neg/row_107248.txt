Social exclusion and why I don't want to be alive anymoreHow can emptiness be so consuming? I have nothing anymore, not a single person in my life that doesn't hate me and doesn't hurt me. I've been lonely my entire life, but not completely alone. Now I am. And it's deafening. The centre of my torso has this deep tired feeling, like I have a bag of stones weighing me down. It's sort of in my head too. I'm trying my best to describe everything but I just can't. It's like a huge black scribble that's finally eaten up every last part of me. But to begin with, I don't think a me existed. Just this outline of a person, but I never really got to develop that person because of all the trauma I've experienced, starting from me being 1 year old. From that point, I became my trauma. It's the only thing I have. It's so deeply apart of me, and with that slowly killing me, it just was piled on with more and more trauma. I feel angry at people, for hurting, when they have so much more than I do. And I know that's cruel. But fucking hell, they all have the people around them, they're loved and cared for! I can only fucking dream of that, because I'm shunned and excluded and hated and left alone. So fucking alone. I don't want this. It hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts it hurts. I never intended at any point in my life to harm another person or another thing. Not even mildly. And I swear that to God. So why, fucking why can't I have a happy life! I don't want to be dead. I want to be alive and I want to be happy and I want to love and I want to be loved. But, living my life and being me, it's painful. I just don't want to be in pain anymore. My only options are to keep living and keep being in pain and to die and for the pain to finally stop. I just want the pain to stop at this point.
