I'm a FailureOkay let's get some stuff out of the way to better give some perspective on me. I'm 17, I'm ugly as shit, I'm 99% sure I might be autistic, I'm constantly depressed, I have no friends because I'm so scared to interact with anybody because I don't want to make them uncomfortable by making them talk to me, I have no professional skills or hobbies, and I'm failing school because I can't get motivated to improve myself. Oh and I'm so desperate for somebody to validate my own existence online because I have nobody to reach out to my life. 

I've socially ostracized myself from all of my peers, I've been isolated for my entire life from everyone since I was young for a lot of bad circumstance that left me socially awkward and unable to even do basic interaction, I don't have money to pursue any form of higher education, I want friends but I know I won't get any because I'm physically unpleasant to look at and can make anybody instantly regret just being close to me cause I look like a fucking goblin, I'm gay and my parents would flip their shit if they found out, I'm getting unhealthy and I can't walk outside my house to actually exercise cause I'm scared as shit somebody will call the cops on me because they don't want their kids seeing my ugly ass walking down the street, I have no motivation or driving force in my life, I can't get a better job cause seriously who would want somebody as disgusting and pathetic as me being anywhere near their coworkers. Not to mention just on my appearance alone I'd probably scare off any customers.

I already got my suicide planned out but I'm so scared of losing my consciousness. Idfk what to do...
