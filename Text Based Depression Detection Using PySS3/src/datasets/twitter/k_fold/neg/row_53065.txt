Suicidal even when I'm happyI've reached a point in my depression where I constantly think about CTB, even when I'm having a good day. Today was a good day, I spent it with family, nothing ruined my day, and yet I still want to ctb at the end of the day. 

I try to function and be strong in my daily life, no one realizes how close to ctb I feel at times. If they had any idea of how weak I am inside, they would think twice about their harsh treatment of me. Ultimately it doesn't matter. People don't want you to ctb, but then they will literally never take the time in life to listen to you or care about how you feel, or about how their actions and words affect you. They will never change, whether you live or die. So you can either constantly be mistreated in life, or you can be at peace in death. 

I want to die so badly. I wish I could ctb tonight but I'm trying to live for my family. 100% my children are why I'm here typing this right now.
