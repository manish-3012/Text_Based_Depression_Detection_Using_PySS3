Guys, Iâ€™m done being so fucking miserable. I want out of this fucking hell holeIâ€™m over being so fucking unhappy and everyday dreaming of killing myself. I WANT TO GET BETTET DAMMIT. I want to feel warmth, happiness and love. I want to be able to sleep as soon as my head hits the pillow(or realistically 10 minutes after). I want to wake up feeling energized and looking forward to the day. Iâ€™m tired of spending every day thinking of every mistake I have ever made and feeling guilty and like a worthless piece of shit. I am fucking 23 years old I WANT TO ENJOY LIFE FOR FUCKSAKE. I want to get better. Therapy/psychiatry isnâ€™t an option right now  but I will do everything else in my power to make progress if you guys or anyone can just please help me a bit. Can anyone recommend me some good books, YouTube channels or anything else that could help me get better on my own until I can afford help? I specifically struggle with being haunted by my past and I want to be able to face things I have done and move forward from them instead of letting them eat me fucking alive. I am done with all this pain I want to get better. I need to get better.
