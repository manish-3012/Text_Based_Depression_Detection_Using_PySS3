Need help NOW...So, I'm at a point in my life where suicide is an option now.  I just graduated college and had to move back in with my parents.  Stayed with my parents for two weeks, but the fighting got so bad that I stayed with an uncle for a week out of state.  Problem though is my uncle is super cheap and won't run the A/C, cook dinner, etc. so its miserable there to.  I just showed back up to my parents house, but fighting already started and can't stay here for another week.

I actually now have thought out how I'm going to kill myself.  I'm either shooting myself or taking tons of Tylenol.  

My only real option to getting a job super fast would be to join the military, but thanks to my decision to try to help myself transition out of my dysfunctional family and taking medication I can't join for another year (medication wasn't for suicidal things btw).

So, what I want is a way to prevent this.  I don't want responses of "hope and change", it will get better, or any other thing that is suppose to cheer me up.

I want solutions.  Solutions are the only way I will live.  All I want to do is move out west and get a job out there.  I was hoping to work in the customer service industry or management type job.  It's what I have experience in (customer service jobs) and it's all I can realistically get with my major (psychology and business minor).

Everyone in my family lives out east.  And I have been turned down multiple times by companies only for the fact that I don't live in the area.  I went to college out west and it was probably the only time in a while I was happy.  I loved the culture out there, the people, and I felt happy out there.  I hate the east and especially where I am right now (the southeast).

Again, if you can come up with realistic solutions to this (how can I move out west and get a job without knowing anyone out there to live with and no money for rent) than a response on that would be helpful.  If you can only say something like "I'm going through something similar" or "cheer up", then it might be best to not even respond.  Not to be rude, but if I get a bunch of responses like that, then I'm pretty sure there is no way of accomplishing the above and I may as well end it now.

**TL;DR:** Read the rant to know where I'm coming from first.  Other than that, I want to get a job and live out west.  Can't because I don't live out there and have no one to stay with out there (got turned down multiple times over this).  If you have ideas on how to accomplish the above, please help.  

**PS:** Sorry for the sloppy writing.  I'm just not exactly in the best of moods right now (as you can tell).

**PPS:**  I'm sorry for being extremely negative in my responses.  But unless I get some hard evidence its doable what is being suggested, I'm going to be skeptical.  I need to be, as this is my life (or what is left of it).
