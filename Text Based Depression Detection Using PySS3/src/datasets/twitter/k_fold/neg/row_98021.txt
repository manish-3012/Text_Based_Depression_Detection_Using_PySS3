I've been considering this for 11 years. 18 years old now, and I think it's finally time to go.Since I was seven years old I've just wanted to end my life.
I suffered at home with drug-addict parents, and a heavily emotionally abusive father who didn't contribute financially or emotionally to my life. School has always been worse. Despite being a straight A student I spent every day of my life cowering from classmates who beat me up, excluded me, and threatened to kill me. I was always overweight even though I ate healthy foods and took martial arts, which resulted in severe criticism from my family and friends, and severe self-loathing on my part.

Depression is nothing new to me. The only think keeping me alive this whole time was my little half brother, who was my closest and dearest friend in life. He backed me up and defended me through everything, and looked up to me despite me being a tortured child.

Now I'm 18. Never has a month gone by where suicide hasn't been at the surface of my thoughts, and never have I had the courage to tell a single soul. I am too insecure. I've recently been seeing doctors after dropping out from college (my 4.0GPA quickly became a 1.6 GPA after a semester-long severely depressive episode.) My grades are much too low for me to be accepted into any school, and all my scholarships have been revoked. I've been diagnosed with a severe thyroid problem which is the reason I've been fat my whole life, and I can never have children.

My (first) boyfriend of the past 4 years has been taking advantage of me emotionally our entire relationship. He threatens to break up with me every few months and loses his temper with me due to my crippling insecurities. Today he broke up with me again. I don't want to be with anyone else, but I can't help but feel he can't stand me sometimes. I'm set to move out of my hellish home and live with him, but now I feel I have nowhere to go.

Was prescribed Prozac but couldn't take it because of my phobia of taking medication.

I don't want to live anymore. I don't even want to be happy and get better. I want to go to bed, and I don't want to wake up. I've felt this way for the better half of eleven years and I've lost all my optimism. I want everything to end.
