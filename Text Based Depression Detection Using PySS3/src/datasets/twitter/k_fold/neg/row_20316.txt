I can't live like thisI'm 27 f and I live florida and I live with my dad and grandma, I was on ssi for bi polar and we'll I have severe emotional issues, I don't know how to cope with anything. Well its like I don't even exist here, they both hate me, and I'm here rotting away. My step mom had a severe drug problem and put me and my dad through it. She went on to steal everything that wasnt bolted down so now and now shes in prison. And I have nothing not even a pair of pants. I just am letting myself waste away. And I don't care anymore.
