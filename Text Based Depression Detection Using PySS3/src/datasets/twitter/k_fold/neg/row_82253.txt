Idk even how to say itI've never been one to even consider this method. I always thought I was stronger. I am clearly not. 

I guess I should write this as a goodbye but have never really been that capable of a writer. 

I guess I'll just explain my story. I had someone I cared about more than anything. Due to circumstances I still do not understand she left me. I guess I was not good enough but I always tried my best. I can atleast rest easy knowing everyday I did my best to love her and the others around me. Even if I wasn't good enough for her that is besides the point. It's been almost 6 months now and I have made many friends. These people have showed me so much love and have been there for me throughout it all. I'm so thankful that good people exist. However even with all the goodness poured into me this hole inside has not been filled. I do not want to hurt anyone but I cannot keep fighting the battle, it is to strong for me. Life is just to hard and this battle that never ends, seems pointless. I will be waiting for all those people that mean the world to me on the other side wherever that may be. 

Peace love and happiness.

PS 

I hope everyone I discussed the dreams with will live them out and let me know about it when we meet again.
