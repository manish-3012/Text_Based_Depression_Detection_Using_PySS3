Ex-fiancÃ© on a dateMy fiancÃ© of 4 years left me a week after my birthday.  We live together and she decided to go out on a date with someone she went to highschool with. She wants time to be â€œsingleâ€ to find herself. She was my first true love and I donâ€™t know how to handle it. She is moving out soon and I know there is nothing I can do to convince her to stay. 
We were both overweight and she got into tremendous shape in a short amount of time. I have always loved her no matter what and now she enjoys the attention of other men. I canâ€™t even get a match on tinder. I know without her I will never find love again and just wish I could make the pain stop. I could never do anything to hurt myself but looking at this revolver it is nice to imagine all of my problems going away. I am truly lost without her and I donâ€™t know what to do.
