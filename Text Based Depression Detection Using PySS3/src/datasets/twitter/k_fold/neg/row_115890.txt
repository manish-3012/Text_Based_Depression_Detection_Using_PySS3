Sigh.I just need to talk. I'm a gay teenager in America (not going to divulge age for personal reasons) and I just don't want to live anymore. I have a small group of friends but we're not really close, I can't tell any of them about how I'm feeling inside. I have to put on a mask every day and pretend like it's all okay, when it's not.

My parents love me, my family loves me, but I can't help but feel really, really lonely. I don't talk to anyone I know in real life, they don't want to talk to me. I'm overweight, I'm not attractive, and I can't help but think that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life. That's just too much to bear.

Am I just being selfish? I just don't know anymore.
