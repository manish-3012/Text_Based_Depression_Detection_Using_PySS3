My life is a wreck.I havenâ€™t felt this hopeless in a really long time. My boyfriend (who I genuinely thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with) left me in the middle of this pandemic and got back with his ex, I donâ€™t feel close to any of my friends, my father is emotionally abusive, and my life is going nowhere. Iâ€™m 23 years old, Iâ€™ve had mental health problems for as long as I can remember, and I see no real future for myself. I fight so hard every day to keep moving forward, but I just canâ€™t stop thinking about how good it would feel to swallow an entire bottle of pain pills right now.
