When I lost my self, I lost my fight. I am still here, I will not give up.A quick glance through my comment history would tell you that my mind is all over the place. One week I'm a psychopath, the next I'm alone and isolated, the next I'm a social bee. I can't put my finger on who I am, or who I was. I kind of know where I want to be in 5 years time. I am not sure I'll make it. But I need to. How can I break this cycle of depression and sadness. I have a mentality that makes me not want to give up. But I just can't shake this feeling, these emotions that are dragging me down.
