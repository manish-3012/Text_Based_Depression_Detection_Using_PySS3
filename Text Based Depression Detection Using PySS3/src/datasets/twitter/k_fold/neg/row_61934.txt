My sister wants to commit Suicide, Help 

I live in Latin America, my life was not easy but I'm tring to do my best. since 2 years ago until now my sister tell me that she don't wanna live because she doesn't interested in anything. she is taking medicine for depression and for sleep, she was in a mental hospital for 2 months, and actually she had a treatment in Psychologic and other inPhysiquiatric. but I don't see any change, yesterday I saw to my sister doing a letter for my, when I saw her, she was crying and she hid the letter.

I know that she going to commit suicide soon and I feel sad, I don't know what can I do. I wish and wait for anything that permmit she have new life, hopefully far away of here because in this context, with this family, in the middle of a poor country, we can't do anything more or I don't Know

She is very intelligent and expressive, she could change the world if she wanted, is a gigant sleeped, maybe very sensitive for this place in the world

What do you think that I can do for help her?

Thanks for read me

I'm very sad :c
