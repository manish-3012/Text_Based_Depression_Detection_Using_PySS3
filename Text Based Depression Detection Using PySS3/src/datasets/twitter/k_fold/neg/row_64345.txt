If this the life I'm destined to walk then I'd rather kill myself.I can't talk to anyone but my parents. I just can't do it. Now I'm living alone and the isolation is taking its toll. I can go weeks without talking to a single human being. The only person I talk to is myself for hours and hours just so I don't forget how to talk.

This isn't living. It's just existing, and I think I'm tired of existing.

Please say something. I think I'm just about done with this world, it's obvious I wasn't cut out for it. My parents should have aborted me to save them such a disappointment.
