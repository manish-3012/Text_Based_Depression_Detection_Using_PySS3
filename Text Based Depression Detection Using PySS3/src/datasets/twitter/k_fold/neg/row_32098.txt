Thankyou.(13f) Hi. Earlier i posted that i had overdosed and cut my arms and legs really bad. Thankyou to the people that helped me because im now in hospital and they made the pain go away and they are making me feel better. I had fainted 2 times when the paramedics were at my house and before they were. I broke my hand when i fell apparently. I also cut a vein when i hurt my arms. I have had my tummy flushed and now some of the pain has gone away and i need stiches on my arms and legs and they are going to do that tomorow and im going to be asleep for it. Im kinda scared to do it. I have a cast on my hand now and im in a bed and waiting for a doctor to see how i am doing and i think he is bringing my medication. 

Thankyou so much to the people that helped me i really mean it thankyou.
