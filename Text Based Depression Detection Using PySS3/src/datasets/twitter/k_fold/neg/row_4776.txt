I'm sick of all of itI really am sick of all of it. Every time things start to look up everything falls apart and I end up in a worse spot than I was in before. Ive survived 3 attempts in my life and last week I went to the hospital because of how bad it got. I just want to lay in bed until everything happens naturally. At least that is something that I can control right? I don't see it getting better
