I find strange safety in knowing when it's gonna enddon't know how to explain this, but the fact that i have a solid plan, place and date just makes me feel safe? it's like oh it's okay i'll try to make something out of the time that i have left before passing

deleting this later before i get yeeted into oblivion by daring to post something
