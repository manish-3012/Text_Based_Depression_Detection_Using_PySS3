Talk to me first.I know what it is like to be suicidal. I had an attempt a couple years ago, and have lived through some pretty extreme circumstances. I know that some of you feel useless, under appreciated or that no one is there for you. It is a tough time in life, yet I can guarantee that is not true. I'm making this post is the hopes that I can help even one person.

So send me a message, let me hear your story - and more importantly get some shit off your mind.

One more thing; you have proved you have doubts as to whether being dead would be better just by posting on r/sw. Let me prove it is better to live.
