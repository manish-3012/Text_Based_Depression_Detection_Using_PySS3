I don't think I can keep this up anymoreRight now, I don't know what to do anymore. I just want to smoke my lungs out and die. I don't have the will or any point to keep this shit up, I think I'll just end it in a few days. I don't know how or when I just want myself gone. All this schoolwork, all this pressure all of these Expectations are just so hard to live up to them.  I don't want to struggle anymore I don't want to fight this weight on my chest. I don't know.
I don't want to be here anymore. I will just take some pills and sleep. That will do it. I hope.
