I just can't get out of the loop.You can say I'm a puny little pussy bitch scared of life, but if you look it my way, i find myself in a dark tunnel with no light at the end. How i survived this long? I tried "mind vacation", the way to not get out of control is to stay in hibernation, where i sit all day on the bed, watching videos, playing games, eating junk, masturbate and not for a single moment  get into trigger zone. Tried this recklessly and got myself into more worse situation, hence more anxiety,hence the mind vacation again. This cycle, is what I can't seem to get out and now I'm starting to believe ending it all, maybe, is the destined option afterall. Lonely 21 year old only child here with mom and dad and a dog. Always believed i have been a burden to them, a disappointment. Studying in a college that i later found was not for me but i didn't have the capacity to quit because of how much of a more disappointment i would be considering all the money spent in college. During the mind vacation when i often went for a piss, kept seeing glimpses a metal blade besides the sink. Casually thought of it laughingly as maybe an option to cut myself when things go wrong, and now i cant get my eyes off of it. I brought it to my room from the bathroom, and i have it feets away on a desk and seriously thinking of loosing myself to sleep on a blood soaked bed with a picture of me, mom and dad by my side.
