My chronic illnesses make me even more suicidalI have hashimotos disease, polycystic ovarian syndrome, SjÃ¶grenâ€™s syndrome, and bone spurs on top of all my mental illness shit. The fact that I cannot lose weight regardless of what I eat or donâ€™t eat or how much or how little I work out makes me want to die more. Iâ€™ve always hated my body. &amp; the amount of pain I am in all the time is ridiculous. Iâ€™m 22 and itâ€™s just going to get worse as I get older. So whatâ€™s the point? 
Doc said I have other autoimmune diseases forming but canâ€™t get a diagnosis yet because my bloodwork is good at the moment. I am so tired of this. I hate my body. I feel cursed. I am ugly. And anxious and depressed all the time. Iâ€™m lonely too, I have no friends. I donâ€™t want to be here. I hate it here. Not to mention my bad financials. I know Iâ€™m rambling but I canâ€™t get my head on straight to write something better.
