I am weak, I deserve, and want, to die.I am 16 years old, and I have always been weak.  Easily manipulated, spineless, pathetic.  I feel I was partially molded this way buy my grandmother and father.  They both say that they had a rough childhood.  What they describe is very similar to what I have experienced with them; a powerful sense of confusion, frustration and hopelessness.  I was picked on in elementary school.  I didn't understand why they felt the need to treat me the way they did.  One of the first times that I remember feeling truly horrified by the cruelty of someone, was in fifth grade.  I wasn't beat up or anything; it was emotional abuse. (which is precisely what my father and grandmother excel at)  A girl was antagonizing me in front of a group of others about people that I was accused of "liking".  She wouldn't stop, and I felt completely defeated.

I realize now why people treat me this way: for the same reason that a pack of wolves would attack a sick member of their pack.  They sense that I fear them, so they fear me.

There is no place for me in this world.  I am that kid who gets picked last in gym class.  Who has very few friends.  Who is so afraid of other people that they simply ignore him.  Being ignored is so much worse than being bullied.  Let me put it to you this way: solitary confinement vs. being with the rest of the inmates.  On one hand you are safer from any sort of violent act, but on the other, it won't take you long to go insane.

So, I consider suicide.  The first thing that I think of when I do this, is how everyone who knows me would react.  I don't know.  Maybe this is just a cry for help.  I feel like wherever I go I will just be inevitably running from myself.  I am lonely.  I'm neurotic.  I want to be accepted, and yet, I can't stand the Idea that I am going to lead a life that will consist of trying to be accepted by people I hate.
