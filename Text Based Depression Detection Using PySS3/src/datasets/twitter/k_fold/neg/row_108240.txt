I wish I had the courageI don't see the point to this shit.   I work, I gain nothing.  I seek out love and affection and I'm denied.   With the exception of maybe a business handshake, I haven't had actual physical contact with another human being in months.   My female friends tell me you gotta "be confident"...great, in order to be confident, doesn't one need something to draw confidence from??   Wtf do I have?  I'm nearly blind and could with all honesty lose my sight completely one day, already totally blind in 1 eye, and my favorite hobby is gaming (surprise!)...nothing like a blind gamer!  Eventually everything I still do have to bring me any kind of joy will be taken from me.   I just want to go to sleep and not wake up.
