After being astronomically closed off and shell of my former self I finally cried tonightOver and over again. Iâ€™m better than Iâ€™ve ever been but everything just gets harder. Iâ€™m so exhausted, yet people demand a lot from me. They donâ€™t understand what Iâ€™m going through or what Iâ€™ve been through. Iâ€™m really hurting right now. Iâ€™ve been very lonely, lacking relationships since me and my ex split last July, and Iâ€™ve not had much interest to pursue someone new. 

Iâ€™m not going to delve to deep, but holy shit my life is a shit show. I have a rather long record of suicidal tendencies but I praised myself on the fact that Iâ€™ve not seriously considered for over a year. But, tonight I drove and drove, hoping Iâ€™d have the will to just crash my fucking car into something. Iâ€™m so over this shit. If tomorrow isnâ€™t better, I will try again...

Iâ€™m absolutely hating where I am right now. Im not religious but Iâ€™m praying that the universe shows me my significance in this world. ASAP.
