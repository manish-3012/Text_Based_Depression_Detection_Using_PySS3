I have literally desire to live anymoreIâ€™ve always been severely depressed but now itâ€™s the worst itâ€™s ever been. Iâ€™m even medicated now and Iâ€™m disappointed every day I wake up. I donâ€™t believe in a god, but I hope and pray every night that I finally just go to sleep and not wake up. I wonâ€™t do anything intentionally because it would devastate my family and I could never do something so horrible to them. I just want this pain to end.
