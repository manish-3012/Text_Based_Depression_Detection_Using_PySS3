Y'know there was a post hereBut I realized that there's really no reason to express my agony anymore 

Said it once and it's echoed all over this place 

It's no more helpful than staring up at the ceiling watching the fan turn around 

Even this post is a waste of my breath. But I know I'll never be brave enough to kill myself so I guess here we go, echoing again and again

Still staring up at the ceiling waiting for nothing. About 60 more years of life to go

Maybe I'll see how far I can starve myself until it hurts too bad or maybe just relapse all together
