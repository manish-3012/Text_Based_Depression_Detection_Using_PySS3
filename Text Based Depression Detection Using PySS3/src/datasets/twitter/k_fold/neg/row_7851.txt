Thereâ€™s no point.Iâ€™m 16, homeschooled, and fucking done with this shit. My life is so lonely you donâ€™t even understand. My only outlets that help are self harming and drinking (I would smoke but can find anyone to buy them for me). My life has been in this rut for about 3 years and Iâ€™m so fucking done bc I know it will keep going. Iâ€™m worthless, hopeless, stupid, guilty, and fucking irritated. The worst part is I canâ€™t muster up the courage to kill my fucking self! Itâ€™s so damn hard omg. Iâ€™ve tried taking too many pills and drinking but I always wake up. Worst part is my family doesnâ€™t believe Iâ€™m depressed and have anxiety and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to... Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t know what to do itâ€™s so fucking confusing.. sorry for the rant.
