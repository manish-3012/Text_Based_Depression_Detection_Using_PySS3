There are only two things stopping me from killing myself1. I don't have anything that can do it quickly and painlessly (a gun).
2. I'm a pussy.

I've been dancing around with the thought of suicide, and I have mixed feelings about it. Sometimes, it's the only solution I can see to my problems and my bleak, pointless, fruitless future, yet I'm too scared to just drop everything and end it. I'm scared of pain and I'm scared of death, but I can't see myself digging myself out of this whole I've dug.
