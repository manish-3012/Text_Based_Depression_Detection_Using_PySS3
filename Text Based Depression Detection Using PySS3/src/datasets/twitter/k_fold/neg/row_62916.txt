I just want to give upThe title says it. I want to give up, I donâ€™t know who I am, or what Iâ€™m doing. the one thing I felt like I was good at is impossible to find work in and doesnâ€™t look like there is much of a future for, I donâ€™t have any dreams for my future anymore, or any motivation,or any education, i just know that I want it all to end. 
I found out this morning, that my wife has been planning to leave for the last 6 months, and is now just probably just waiting for after Christmas. Which probably isnâ€™t even happening this year, itâ€™s been so rough financially that weâ€™ve barely kept our bills paid, never mind buying gifts. Recently lost work again because of covid restrictions. So finances are even worse, no idea how Iâ€™ll make it in the new year. I have 300/1600$ for what I need for the end of the month no idea what to do for the rest.  Because we barely cover everything together, when she leaves I will lose everything, Iâ€™ve already lost my job, and my wife has been emotionally gone, when she leaves she wants to take our baby to her parents where I will almost never be able to see her (because of the distance), because she has family support and has been the primary guardian while Iâ€™ve worked full time. I donâ€™t have any family left, and have lost all my friends over the course of this relationship. Then Iâ€™m going to lose my house because I wonâ€™t be able to keep up with rent/ bills. Iâ€™ve lost and am going to continue to lose everything. Including my hope, hope that things would get better.. hope for a future for myself. now when I think about the future, I see nothing for me.
Iâ€™ve just felt hopeless all year, and Iâ€™m tired, I really just canâ€™t see a future where Iâ€™m ever okay again, and Iâ€™m just ready to give up.
