I don't even feel sad I just don't see a point.Life feels so pointless. I have almost no skills or talents. I lose interest in things so easily. I always give up on projects I start. I have ambitions but I'm never motivated enough to pursue them. I feel like all I even enjoy anymore is caffeine and porn. I think about just ending it almost every day now.
