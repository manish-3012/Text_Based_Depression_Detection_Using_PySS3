I'm overwhelmed and I'll do anything to make it stopI can't handle my life; I am so stressed out and nervous that nothing makes me happy anymore. 

I've been depressed forever and I try so hard to be positive and do things that help me. Started journaling and running to help with my eating disorder and weight issues. Go out with friends and be social to help with my loneliness. Schedule time in my day to specifically destress and help with my gen. anxiety. Budget my money and look for jobs so I can fix my financial issues and feel better. It isn't working.

My life is a constant roller coaster of emotions. I try to change my life for the better, but eventually crash and revert back to my old ways. Then the cycle repeats itself. Over and over and over again. Nothing is working. And it will never work.
