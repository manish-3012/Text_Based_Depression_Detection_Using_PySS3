Help reading a covered nameMy girlfriend recently made a suicide attempt, and I've learned this wasn't the first. She's only speaking to two people about this - me and someone whose name I don't know.

In that screenshot there she didn't cover it completely - I can look at her Snapchat and Facebook lists of followers/friends to try to find out who this is, so I can speak to them.

I plan to message them "did you speak to (her name) earlier this afternoon?", and then if they say yes say "do we need to speak about anything important?"

I need help identifying what the name could say. I think it's three letters, or two?

Thank you so much, Reddit. If there's any other way I can help her, please tell me or PM me. I don't know what I'm doing but I will do anything in my power to help her.
