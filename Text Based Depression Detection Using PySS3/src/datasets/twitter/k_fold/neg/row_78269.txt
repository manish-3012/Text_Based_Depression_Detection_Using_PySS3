I'm so fucking angry. I can't fucking deal with life anymore, I can't take it. Nothing will help me I'm just gonna die.Despair turned to apathy and now apparently to rage. Burning, breaking and throwing things and kicking the walls and screaming until I physically can't. Nothing gets the anger out at how fucked up my life is. There's nothing I or anyone else can do about it. One of these times when I freak out I really just need to kill myself
