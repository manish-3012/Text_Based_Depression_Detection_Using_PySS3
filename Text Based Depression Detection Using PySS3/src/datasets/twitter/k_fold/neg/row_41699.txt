My girlfriend wants to commit suicide and that i come with herLong post so read if interested also apologies for spelling mistakes english is not my first language.
Title pretty much says it all.
I met this girl during a strange moment in my life i was around 16 with a self harm addiction and pretty bad drug problems.
After being arrested at school with a friend i was sent to the psychiatric ward after the cops found the scars on my body.
There i was diagnosed and bla bla bla this isnâ€™t about me.
Point is i met her there,and we instantly clicked me and her.
She lived like 45 minutes from my town but we stayed in contact trough messenger and would see each other almost every 2 weeks so we decided to get in a long distance relationship.
Now fast forward 3 years later my life is going great and im finally getting better and i thought she was also doing better even tho every once in a while we talked about suicide.
When we first met in the psychiatric ward i told her if we were gonna commit suicide we were gonna do it togheter.
But this just happened we saw each other today and had a good time.
Now sheâ€™s texting me telling me sheâ€™s planning on killing herself during winter i think i did a good job at talking her out of it this time but i know itâ€™s a matter of time before she makes me take the big decision i donâ€™t wanna die no more but i love this girl i never felt like this about a girl she makes me feel so good and if she were to just you know go thru with it i would be all alone and i donâ€™t think ill ever experience a relationship with this much passion and actual respect and this type of loyalty.
Im just so lost idfk what to do.
