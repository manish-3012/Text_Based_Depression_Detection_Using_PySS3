I have a good life but I don't feel happy. Can't laughThis is my first time ever posting on reddit so I'm not quite sure what I'm doing, sorry

I'm currently a freshman in high school and I have a lot of friends, and a decent family. I am very very sad though and consider killing myself every day. I wish I could gather the courage to actually execute it, because I am not happy/contempt with my life at all. I have chronic pain in my chest and arms also.   


Also, I can't laugh. I haven't genuinely laughed at something in years, does this have to do with depression? I just want to be able to laugh and be happy again. I feel crazy because I have to fake my laugh every single time. It's tiring.
