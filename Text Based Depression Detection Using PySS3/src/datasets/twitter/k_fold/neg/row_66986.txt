It gets stronger every day.I was with a girl for 6 years that left me, we lived together for 4 months and I fucked everything up, I didn't meet some of her needs and she left for another guy within a week of us breaking up. 

I seriously don't know how to live right now and everyday it just builds on how I will never find anyone again, I wanted to be with this girl forever and now I am here. 

I am 26 and I feel as if I am just too damn old or everyone else is not wanting of me at this point, maybe delusional, but it is how I feel. 

It just feels so crippling and gripping, my partner, best friend is just... gone.
