How do thoughts about suicide start?When I was a teen I used to think, I hate myself but I'd never kill myself.

Then I thought, if I killed myself nobody would care.

Then as an adult I thought, if I killed myself it would affect everybody who knows me, my family and friends. It would change their lives forever.

But now the thoughts of doing it creep into my head as some kind of viable option, as if doing it would make all of the worthlessness I feel go away.

Is this how it started for others? I just want to know that other people who feel this way didn't just wake up one morning and feel like this was the only option left.
