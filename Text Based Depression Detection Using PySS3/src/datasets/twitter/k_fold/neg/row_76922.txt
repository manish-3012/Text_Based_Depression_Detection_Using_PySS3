Hotlines that do not call emergency services.I want to volunteer to give suicidal people someone safe to talk to. However all the ones that I have e looked at will call emergency services in the US. Is there a legal reason for this? Does anyone know of a good hotline or service that's looking for volunteers that doesn't call emergency services?
