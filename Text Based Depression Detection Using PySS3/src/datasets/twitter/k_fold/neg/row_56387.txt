Depressed forever, finally over the brinkSo I recently graduated college. Something I only did because my parents wanted me to. And they said they would pay for it. I got an academic scholarship to a top 70 school, but instead went to a top 20 school because my parents wanted me to. I got some aid, but over the course 4 years I accumulated $40K in student loans. 

Now my parents are saying they will not pay for it. I know it sounds selfish and greedy of me, but if it wasn't for their forcing me to go to a better school and telling me that they would pay for it, I would have made different decisions. I probably wouldn't have even gone to college because I hated every minute of it; or I would have just gone to the other college for free. 

My only motivation for the last 4 years was that I would get a job (biomedical engineering) and be able to be somewhat free. In school you are never free because there is always an assignment to be completed. But when you have a job, you are basically free on the hours you are not working.

I would rather die than pay for this education I never wanted. I've never liked school (elementary, middle, high school, college); and now it's officially taken the best years of my youth and wants to take the rest of my adulthood through debt. 

I wish I had a better reason to kill myself, but I feel like my past has been wasted and my future is ruined.
