1 month in and I'm at my limitJust moved back to Germany from the US.

Are things better for me now? FUCK no.
I am SO fucking overwhelmed and I can't take it anymore.

I'm homeless and have nowhere to properly turn to.

Food is inconsistent and I have no direct access to water.

I don't have wifi except for mobile data sim cards I've been buying month to month. 
Won't have one after this month.

My fucking headphones broke (I'm autistic and desperately need them for sound reduction, also music is one of the only things that helps me destress)

I don't have my peace &amp; quiet at all. I NEED this (again, autistic)

I can't speak this fucking language properly. 
It sucks anyway.

I wish I could just speak English.
Everyone misunderstands this girl even more than usual.

I lost access to both an amazing social worker and a close friend, who'd both always help me out a ton.

I broke a relationship with the person I love most on the planet that is the only one that's ever come close to truly understanding me. why.

I have absolutely nothing to truly look forward to in the future. 
I'm 21, would turn 22 this year. 
For what though?
I'm so fucking lonely. No friends. Family is garbage, except for my brother, who doesn't understand me at all.


What a fucking mistake. 
I should've fucking stayed. I should've stayed.
I should've stayed... 

I need to find what I need for my preferred suicide method asap.


I miss you, Portland. Even at your worst, you always somehow exceeded Germany........
