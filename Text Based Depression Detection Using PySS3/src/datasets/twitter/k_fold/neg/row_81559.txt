I am insecure about posting this.It sucks but I feel like I'm a burden or too dramatic by posting this, but here goes.

I am incredibly apathetic and empty right now, and I don't really see much of a point to continue.  My girlfriend that I loved and gave everything to ripped my heart out a few days ago and I haven't eaten since.  It was so sudden.   I just sit here and cry when I can, and wallow when I can't.  She was my everything, and there is such a void that no one else can fill. I honestly don't blame her for doing what she wanted, it just doesn't help me to think that.  I feel sick but I'm not, I can't go to classes anymore, and I just can't get away. Everywhere I go I remember going there with her, and I have honestly become so numb that I'd rather not be alive.  I just don't want to be here anymore, and I can't shake the thought of how peaceful death would be.  It would all just stop, and none of it would matter anymore, I wouldn't have to deal with this anymore.  The thoughts of her being with others, I will never get over it.  I am a fucking shell of someone who once was so strong and happy. I just want to be him again. Thanks to anyone who read this.
