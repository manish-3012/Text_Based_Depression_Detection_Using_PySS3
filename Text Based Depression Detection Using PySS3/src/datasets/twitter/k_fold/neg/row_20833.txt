Link between the meaninglessness of gaming and real life.I want to be completely upfront that this isnâ€™t a call for help and suicidal thoughts do not cross my mind. A few years ago my then GF left me and it shattered me, I tried to take my life shortly after. I lost my job and distanced myself from friends and all that were close to me. I moved back in with my parents, I didnâ€™t try to find work and just gamed all day for about a year straight, my parents were fine with it because they knew I was safe. I then worked for about a year until COVID hit and I lost my job as a result. When I was playing games I had a massive realisation that the games I was playing were meaningless, whatâ€™s it all for. When I was working I couldnâ€™t help but feel the same way. Whatâ€™s it all for. I have no desire to be married or have kids so I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m living for and I donâ€™t know how to reconnect with the idea that living has value and that things are to come. I feel like I might be alone in feeling this and have come back to a place that helped me when I was first stuck in a rut so to speak.
