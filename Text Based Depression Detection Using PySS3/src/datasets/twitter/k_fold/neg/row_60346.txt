My decision to call it quits forever, will be made within the hourI am sooo done; the world is going through a pandemic; all that needs to be done is for a vaccine to be created. Issued resolved world is happy again. Minus all the people who have died from it and hurting families.

My problem of depression; chronic loneliness and self hatred does not get solved or go away. Hurts like hell...WTF!!!

I wrote on here 2 days ago, felt a little better; now I am hurting bad again.

I have been strong for a very long time, canâ€™t take it anymore.
