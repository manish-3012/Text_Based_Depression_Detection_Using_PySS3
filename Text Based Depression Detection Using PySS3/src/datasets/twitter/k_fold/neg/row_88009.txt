I'll never have the courage to commit suicide, but I wish someone would shoot meI'm from Illinois, and I'm sure some of you know about the shooting that happened on Friday in Aurora. I'm sad for the victims, but at the same time I'm jealous of them. I'm sad for them because from the victims that I've read about, they wanted to live. They had things that I wish I had such as a relationship and a job. (Yes I'm aware that the shooter did what he did because he lost his job, and no, if I were in his situation I wouldn't shoot my colleagues.) At the same time, I'm jealous of victims because they got what I want, which is death.

 I wish that there was a shooting SOMEWHERE that I'm at. I've decided to stay out in public more often since a shooter is less likely to storm into my home.
