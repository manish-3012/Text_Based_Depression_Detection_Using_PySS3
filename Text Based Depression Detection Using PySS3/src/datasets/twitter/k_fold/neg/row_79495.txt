On my mind.I am aware of that I never behave as I should. Or have the feelings I should have. 

I am not even acting the correct way for someone who is suicidal. It doesnt count, if there are tears. I am sorry, for not being able to be suicidal the right way. 

Even though I might be happy for one day or two, this is not worth it. It is not worth all this pain. And I know that I am just annoying. For everyone I ever wanted to be friends with. I know you just called because you felt like you had to. I know that I was boring. I know that I wasnâ€™t good enough. 

And to everyone who has met me, who has talked to me, who has seen me. I am sorry. 

 All my life I have been restisting the fact that I am not supposed to be here. That I am in the way. That I take too much space. That I should move. That I am not there for anyone (truly) and that no one is here for me (truly). 

I am so stupid, for not understanding. So fucking stupid. 
I am sorry, world, for not understanding who I am. 
And to Kim, I am sorry. I know I just pull you down. I know you will make it without me. 

I am an emotionally dull monster. No matter what I will do, I will cause pain. I will hurt. I can see it in your eyes, in the way you speak to me, a silent â€please be quietâ€. I know that you are polite, that you listen because you have to, that you speak because you have to. 

I am sorry. 
I am sorry. 
 I wish I could say sorry to everyone. 
I am so stupid. 
Everything hurts. 
Everything is dark. 
I guess itâ€™s time soon. 
I feel pain for every breath I take. 
I canâ€™t live anymore. 

I am sorry, mom and dad. 
I am sorry, Johan. 
I am sorry, Gabriel (I know I ruined things for you) 
I am sorry, Kim. My beloved Kim. You made things easier for me. I am really, truly, sorry, and I know you are upset. I am sorry Kim, for being upset with you. 

I think that my last goodbye will be soon. I am sorry.
