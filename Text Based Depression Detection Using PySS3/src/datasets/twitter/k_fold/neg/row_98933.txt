Iâ€™ve romanticized myself and my own death for years. I hope it turns out well.The other day I was playing piano at work and a coworker sat down and he started singing and I played the song he sang... it was like a movie. We were both grinning at each other.

Then my mind goes â€œthis is it. this is his own little moment in time of you that he can have to himself. And maybe, one day, when my name comes up again, heâ€™ll get a glimpse of me sitting down at that piano and smiling up at him.â€

I think that a lot. No matter who Iâ€™m with. I wonder what image of me theyâ€™ll keep after Iâ€™m gone.

I just pray to god that itâ€™s a good one.
