I think I'm going to kill myself in two daysWhy two days? I have family over for Thanksgiving and I don't want them to be here when I do it. 

I've been extremely depressed before, and this isn't really it. I'm just kind of done. I don't usually post on redit, or anywhere really, just posting because I need to get it off my chest because I can't talk to any of my friends about it because they might try to stop me. 

I think I had a chance at a great life once, but becoming depressed really ruined who I was and I haven't been the same since. I know I'm just a disappointment to everyone, including myself. I really don't deserve to live, because I'm too lazy and useless to do anything properly.

I don't really know what else to say. I don't really want anyone to talk me out of it, I guess I just wanted someone to know.
