Confused Thoughts.Itâ€™s 2:25 in the morning. I canâ€™t sleep. I have too much on my mind. Like why no one remembers my name. Why Iâ€™m a shadow around other people. I feel like a burden at work. At home. With my bf. I am upset at this money driven world we live in and the lack of power I have because I donâ€™t have money. My parents paid for my online classes this semester and I didnâ€™t even do one assignment but Iâ€™m too afraid to tell them . 


Edit: I started writing that last night, itâ€™s now 12 in the afternoon. Iâ€™m laying in bed watching hostile
Planet, the desert episode. I wish I had a purpose like the animals in this show. A designated routine. Something I knew I was good at and could do with excellency. 

I feel so trapped and low. I question my existence when I have nothing to offer this world or myself or the people around me.
