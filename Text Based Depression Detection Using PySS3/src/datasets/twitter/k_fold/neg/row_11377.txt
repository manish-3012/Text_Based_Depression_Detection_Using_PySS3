It's stupid.I come on here and see so many posts with people with problems way worse than my own. I'm 19 but basically twenty so I know I'm more at risk for suicide than other age groups. But still I'm almost ready to kill myself.
I'm posting because I need encouragement, to vent, and maybe it will be good therapy.
I have a few things that are causing my depression, but primarily it's my ex. We were together for two years and split July 22nd. I know it doesn't compare to 5 years or 15 years but I believe I was past infatuation, I believe I loved her and still might. Communication with her has been on and off, always ending when my emotions finally catch up to me. I've tried to move on, dated other people. But I'm not over her, not even close.
When we broke up it was because she was moving for college, and I know that there was more to it. I'm an underachiever and her dad was in the middle of a divorce so her faith in relationships went away. But now she's about to transfer to a university much closer to me but instead of us reconnecting she's seeing someone even tho she is about to move. I just can't get her out of my head.
Family is what's tying me to life right now so odds are the only time I'm at risk for suicide is now during a emotional breakdown.
My mom attempted suicide last year, I have Â shitty job, I am a drop out, I plan to go to college but have no motivation, I spend my life in video games to escape, I've been accidentally pushing friends away to the point I don't have any.
I don't have it bad, it's stupid but I'm so ready to end it. Suicide is so unfair to my family and will ruin their lives so currently I can't go through with it.
I just deleted my ex's number and blocked her facebook(again) and am hoping for improvement.
Just any help you can give me heroes.

TL:DR
Not over ex two years.
Problems in all other parts of my life.
Ready to take my life but family is preventing it at the moment
