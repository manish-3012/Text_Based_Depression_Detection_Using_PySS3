I have never had anything going for me in my life.I am 17. I have never had any friends and still don't, I spend all day on my computer, I have no job, I have no girlfriend, I am not smart. I am lazy, I am average looking.

It has been this way my entire life, but I have been feeling even more depressed especially this past couple weeks... lets see what's been going on.

My internet is basically my entire life, the only "friends" I have are on it and I've been being ddos'd every damn day for a week now so I can't even talk to anyone to help me through this.


I just broke my keyboard and headset out of rage from the ddos, and I won't have money for new ones cause I'm 17 and poor, so that's cool.

My mother doesn't live with us cause she's suicidal and crazy, so I live alone with dad and he never wants to help me, he'd rather just call me crazy and stupid everytime I ask for help.

I just sit in my room all day wishing I could die but I can't think of any effective ways to do it. I want out of this so bad I have nothing to do and no one likes me. I'm an asshole.. no one should like me actually... I wake up, I go to school, I come home.. I browse reddit... repeat... hmmm... I am crazy... whatever... good bye.
