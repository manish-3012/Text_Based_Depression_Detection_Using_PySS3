dying seems normalitâ€™s 2020 and i donâ€™t think anyone would be that surprised since all my close friends and family know ive struggled with mental health issues majority of my life. waking up everyday is as hard as going to sleep at night because of the acute insomnia i go through like once a month. i find it sad that i now live for media because itâ€™s the only thing putting me through the day, and is the only way how im still able to connect with the world. i live in an abusive household with a toxic grandma and grand uncle who runs the house. there is nothing but bad news about the covid situation in my country, with our governmentâ€™s failed system and corruption making matters worse. i am triggered by these things everyday because i also share a room with my toxic grandma, who makes me so anxious everytime im in her presence. my relationship with my friends and family is so jaded that i donâ€™t even know where they lie. all of them are religious except for me, theyâ€™d probably think iâ€™d end up in hell or sum bc â€œsuicide is a sinâ€. and to be honest, itâ€™s embedded in me like i donâ€™t even know what happens in the afterlife. 
earlier this year a high-school batchmate of mine fell from her condo unit. me having periods of suicidal thoughts, since then i think to myself, 2020 is the year of death being so normal, people are dying left and right, would it even be a shock to anyone if it was me? is now the time?
as stupid as this may sound, i manifest my death all the time. if i live all my life as a coward, why donâ€™t i ask the universe to do it for me?
