Why bother?Everybody says "it gets better" -- but then they turn around and say that life's not fair, everyone hurts, nothing lasts.

If all those things are true, then... really? Why bother, if all you can look forward to is more pain, no matter what you do about it?

I've thought about this extensively. I've planned out a way, in a few years, in which I can vanish before I go -- so none of my friends or family have to deal with it. Won't detail it here, obviously.

Also, don't mistake this for what it's not. I really, really do want help, I want to think that there are some good things that actually last, that I won't have to deal with losing everything I love at some point or another. But I'm not naive, I know that's not how things work.

I dunno. I'm probably still mourning for a long lost love, so perhaps this is about that. But really, I'd just rather live some kind of life where I had at least one real, stable source of happiness. Can I find that, or should I just give up?
