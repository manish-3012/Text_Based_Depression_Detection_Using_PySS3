My Therapist Hates MeI just wanted to share this somewhere before I kill myself in a few days.

I worked with a therapist for a year and they kicked me out of therapy because I was seemingly getting worse and they feared for their safety. I learned a lot about why I was the way I was. I wasnâ€™t even able to hold eye contact before, but now I suddenly can, because Iâ€™m using mindfulness to alleviate dissociation. But I canâ€™t handle being treated like Iâ€™m a monster to be feared, so Iâ€™m just gonna kill myself.

Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re all gonna call me a menace to society, so thatâ€™s fine. I already know the world will be better without me.
