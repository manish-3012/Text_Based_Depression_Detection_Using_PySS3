I Fight For My Life On A Daily BasisI make sure I don't get murdered. By my own hand.  
First attempt-7 years old
First mental health stay-7 years old
It was when it all begun. I was adopted and it wasn't a secret. They let me know my parents didn't want me, and when I was naughty, they let me know this was why. 
I would get called a piece of shit by my father when I would throw agonizing tantrums. He would also spit in my face. I had a phobia of vomit. When I would have tantrums my mom would stick her finger in my throat to make me gag. 

When I got to be 10 years old, I cut myself for the first time with a broken razor blade. 

All the days of no talking and only yelling, after severe fights with my parents were soothed by the razor dragging across my skin. Then I would come out of my room, bleeding down my arms. I wanted them to know I was hurt. I WASN'T a bad kid. No matter how much they told me I would be the reason for their divorce. 

I just wanted someone. Anyone. I would accept any positive attention I received. I got pregnant at 14. My mom took my baby. 

I had started a new family with my partner, and we have 4 children. Day in day out I'm constantly triggered by my PTSD from my abuse, and it causes me to act in ways that I would not act normally, like yelling, swearing, and even being violent. After episodes like this I feel severe guilt and I feel that since I've been through every type of therapy and that I'm still messed up, that it would honestly be best for me to go.  Like to leave the world. This is a serious consideration. I just don't want my children feeling abused like I did. Someone help?
