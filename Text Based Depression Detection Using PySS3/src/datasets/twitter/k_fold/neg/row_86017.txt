Single parent committing suicide after their only child going No Contact?I was wondering if it's common for Asian single parents to commit suicide after their only child cuts them out and stops interacting with them (i.e. goes No Contact)? 

I'm considering going No Contact with my mother, but I'm afraid she'd try to attempt suicide if I do that. 

On the other hand I'm not sure I can survive living with her either.
