Things Add UpIâ€™m stuck in bed because Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll relapse with hurting myself if I get up. Iâ€™ve thought about jumping out windows and in front of cars all day today. Everything is piling up and I donâ€™t have outlets to release it. I donâ€™t even know if this is where I should be posting this. I just know that Iâ€™m scared of adding more scars or another attempt under my belt. I donâ€™t know what to do. Even my stress relief has started adding stress to my life. I just canâ€™t see why Iâ€™m still here.
