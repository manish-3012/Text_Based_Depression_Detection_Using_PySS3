Love letter goodbyeDear harper,
   I love you. You know that I do. We all know Iâ€™ve made a whole lot of mistakes but I was learning. Iâ€™m for forever with you but the isnâ€™t going to happen. Thatâ€™s okay you have to look out for yourself, I understand. You are my soul mate trust me, there isnâ€™t a doubt in my mind. I know you will be okay without me. You are the strongest person Iâ€™ve ever met. Most beautiful too. I know after this you are gonna cry a lot. I never wanted to hurt you. You are going to make an amazing mother and make some lucky soul the happiest man in the world. Promise me one thing will you? Never settle, never let someone in who isnâ€™t deserving of you because you are the most amazing girl in the world. Never let that beautiful smile run from your face. 
   After Iâ€™m gone there is gonna be a lot of people talking, saying they loved me but you know the truth. You were the only person who loved me. Please look after my little brother for me, I donâ€™t want to leave him alone but you know I was never meant for this world. You know I donâ€™t believe in an afterlife but I hope there is one so Iâ€™ll get to see you again. My soul belongs to you. In time I will be forgotten and thatâ€™s okay. I hope you wonâ€™t let the memory of me die with me. Tell the world of our love because it truly is special, it is like nothing on this earth. During my last breath on this earth Iâ€™ll have one thing on my mind and thatâ€™s you. You, Harper Gray are the one for me. I canâ€™t even imagine living without you and thankfully I wonâ€™t have to. I love you but you already know that.
