Is this considered Suicide? I wan't it to happen, I wish to die alone.I've been having a lot of symptoms lately, it's been going on for a year now so maybe it's not heart related, but what ever it is I have shortness of breath, barely any energy late every day, jaw pain, and recently this month my left arm starts to feel numb and tingly, followed by my back chest and foot. I'm not obese or anything and I'm 23 years old, but this has been going on for a year. It got so bad my friend tried to call 911 on me once because I seriously couldn't breath well one night. Well, maybe I'm depressed who knows, but I sure hope it's a heart attack or some lung issue and can pass away in sleep. Thanks for reading, wanted to vent somewhere, sorry if not allowed
