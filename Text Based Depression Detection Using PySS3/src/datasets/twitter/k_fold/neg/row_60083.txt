I come here to see people who have it worse than me (read the caption I didn't know hot to phrase this better)That sounds awful I know but I feel like my problems are so pathetic to some others and things people have been through on here I just need to read through this sometimes just so I don't kill myself from my own insignificant problems so thank you everyone for sharing
