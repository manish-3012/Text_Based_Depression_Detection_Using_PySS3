So. I feel like I want to end it; soon.I'm 14.  Bipolar.  OCD.  Social Anxiety.  I just feel like life is dull.. And I don't want it anymore.  My social life has dropped greatly.  It feels like everything I do has no emotion in it.  I cut myself.. But it feels like it isn't enough of a release.  I have thought about Over Dosing several times.  I want to check into a psych ward but I have exams june 6th in seventh.  The pain I feel on the inside is unbearable and I can't stand it.  I don't even know how to get into a hospital.  I.. Just don't know anymore.
