Autistic and sick of it allI'm 17 and live in a well off family, have a few friends, and have a beautiful girlfriend, but i feel absolutely miserable and pathetic. I'm autistic and i hate everything about myself. I cant do anything right, im babied in almost everything in life, and im sick of having someone always holding my hand. I say i dont need help, but nobody listens. And deep down, i really do. When i do something stupid like usual, i get so many people telling me im fucking retarded, and making me a laughing stock of my school. And people think its funny when i try to be involved, but i cant without making myself feel even worse in the process. I have no purpose here, and i would never be able to work and be successful. Theres no point in any of it. My friends and girlfriend are only there for me out of pity. I dont want to deal with this anymore. Im not normal and never will be, and i cant even do anything about it. Im done. I just dont know what to do anymore
