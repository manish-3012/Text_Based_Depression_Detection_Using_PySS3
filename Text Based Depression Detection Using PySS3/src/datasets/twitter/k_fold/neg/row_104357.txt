Help friend in dangerOk so a friend recently has confessed to a friend that he has been struggling and has never seem to fit in in our group even though we consider him as a friend. He also confessed that he has had suicide thoughts.

We cant confront him since we supposedly dont know. A friend will talk tomorrow with his psychologist and ask him what to do but still I want to help him as much as i can. Please help
