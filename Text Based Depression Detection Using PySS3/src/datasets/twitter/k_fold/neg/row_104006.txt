Woke up wanting to die Well, I woke up and drove to the city I live to grab clothes because I'm staying at my, now dead, friend parents house trying to confort them and myself. If you want to know more about my friends death and how it is affecting me and averyone he loves i posted here https://redd.it/7pcl54 .

 So, when i arrived at my house i grabbed a knife and sat in my bed looking at some old photos i have with my friend. I called my local suicide hotline, they weren't helpful at all, they informed the local police but they didn't show up. Tomorrow morning I will be traveling to my friend's city because his family still needs help, thats the only thing keeping me away from killing myself.

 I've never thought that a friend's death would make such a huge impact in my life. I don't know what to do.
