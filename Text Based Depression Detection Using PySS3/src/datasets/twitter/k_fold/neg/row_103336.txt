Im readyI have the noose in my room,i will spend this last weekend with my mum and when she goes  back to work on Monday im going to hang myself. Sick of being FA and having no one..



Sick of being told on the internet all these cliches when i try and reach out for help that never fucking work because im not a normal person.


Crippled by social anxiety and depression life isnt worth living for me. the longer i live the longer i will be lonely and hate myself for not being good enough for anybody.


Im excited to finally be at peace.
