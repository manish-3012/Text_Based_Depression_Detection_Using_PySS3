I'm planning to kill myself in a few weeksI've tried it 2 months ago my third time and it failed miserably and I was sent to a mental hospital. I want to think this one thoroughly this time and not fuck it up. This girl I really like is sneaking into this guy's house that I really hate at night and I'm really scared that he's going to making a move on her but I'm done at this point I can't have her I can't be happy everything hurts. I can't keep faking my retarded smile anymore I fucking hate it I just want out of this world. No one understands me but her. I hate it, I hate it all I just want to sit down and smoke a joint without feeling like I'm getting screamed at in the face. I'm scared, I'm so scared I don't want to die I'm scared of dying but I don't want to be alive I don't want this anymore I hate school I hate it so much it feels like I'm suffocating. More and more it gets worse and worse everything hates me and I hate it I hate it all. If this world doesn't want me here then so be it.
