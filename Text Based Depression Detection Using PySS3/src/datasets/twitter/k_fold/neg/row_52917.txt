Have you ever felt like you are not human?I don't understand people, I don't know how to make friends or what does it mean to be in a relationship. My friends have an insincere aura around them, they pity me.  dogs are my only friends, they don't judge, they don't give you that look. 

God I just hate being inside this human shell, I didn't ask to be like this, I don't have anyone to talk, everyone thinks that I'm an idiot. Even my mother threats me like an Idiot, And no one would probably get the way I feel.

Maybe I should break the shell and be free. at least I wouldn't have to deal with the alien concept of  being a human.
