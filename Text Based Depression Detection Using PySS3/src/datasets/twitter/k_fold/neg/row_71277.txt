People only give me more reasonsMy sister has been a bitch to me for the past few days and her reason has been that Iâ€™ve been that way to her which I havenâ€™t at all. I have literally said nothing rude to her whatsoever. Iâ€™ve been more quiet and less engaging in conversation because I feel shitty physically and mentally so I canâ€™t make myself pretend to be happy and excited about everything but Iâ€™ve said nothing mean unless sheâ€™s said something to me first.

Other than that, everyone else has been short tempered and exhausting to be around. I am running out of patience and I just want to fucking die.
