Can I get in trouble if I just sit in A&amp;E?Kind of one for UK people, sorry.

Can I get in trouble if I go and just sit in A&amp;E but haven't actively swallowed any pills etc? I feel like I need to be around people but I don't know anyone in my new city. Would I get sent away for wasting NHS time if haven't actively attempted but have come dangerously close to doing so instead? 

(I feel like my whole brain is in a fog and nothing's quite real right now, so I'm kind of worried they might think I'm on drugs or something too.)
