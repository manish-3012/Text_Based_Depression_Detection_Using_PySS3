Made up my mind. But actually doing it is hard.I don't really know what I'm doing on this sub, as it's less for help, but more for 'being talked out of it', but here goes. I just need to rant somewhere. The note in my pocket ain't enough.

I'm basically really fucking done. I tried for nearly thirty years, and I never felt like I belonged here. I was doing okay the last few years because I spent so much time running away from everything by keeping busy. Started an acting career and everything. But with this COVID-19 outbreak, I was pretty much forced to spend time with myself. 

I knew that I avoid spending time with myself because I'm scared where my mind will go. 

I've followed a few self-help and self-love programs, done yoga, had 'friends' FUCKING FRIENDS MORE LIKE BULLSHIT FRIENDS WHO KEEP ON GHOSTING AND IGNORING ME AND KEEP THEMSELVES FROM SHOWING LOVE FUCK THEM. I've now realised that **me wanting to put an end to this is a form of self-love**. I'm just setting boundaries. I'm done with the world, as it was never ready to fully embrace me, give me the attention or love I needed.

Why is it so fucking difficult though!? 

Why are the substances that would make it easy SO HARD to get by, and cost so much?? I'm too broke to off myself in a simple, reliable way. I'm thinking trains. I was thinking river, but the survival chance is too high.

Yeah, you can try to talk me out of it, and yeah I'll read the comments. Maybe it'll even make me be fine for tonight. But we're on day 2 of this lockdown, 19 more days to go, so I'll definitely do it sometime soon.
