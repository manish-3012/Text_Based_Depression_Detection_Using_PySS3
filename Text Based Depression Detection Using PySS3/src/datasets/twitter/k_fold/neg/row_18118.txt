I'm committed to changing, but I'm losing motivation.So I made a post yesterday explaining the situation and got a little bit of feedback and I decided to tackle my stress problem head on and got in touch with my teacher and set up a schedule to work with him so I wouldn't fail my exam in 2 weeks. I'm proud that I'm taking these steps to feel confident about the class but this suicide thing has just been weighing on me so much. I've been dealing with depression on and off for 4 years, and this has been by far the worst year (Around Christmas time was pretty abysmal). 


I just want someone to talk to, since it feels like none of my friends take me seriously at this point or they just guilt me into thinking about how much I'd hurt them if i did end up killing myself and it makes me feel that much worse. I'm not blaming them, I know they're not professionals and they probably don't know what to say, I just imagine a lot of people on this sub can be more helpful and I want to find positive influences to talk to.
