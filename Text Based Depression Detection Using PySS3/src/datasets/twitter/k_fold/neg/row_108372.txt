I want to end my relationship with my boyfriend, but I'm worried he'll kill himself.I tried posting this on /r/relationships, but they told me to post it here. I hope that's okay. If this doesn't fit the mods can remove it. This is the post.

My boyfriend and I have been in a long distance relationship for about a year and a half. We met online when we were both in a really bad mental state. He was the first man I ever truly loved, he's my best friend, and this is the longest relationship either of us have been in.

For reasons I don't entirely understand, I'm not happy as his romantic partner. I worry I jumped the gun on a relationship when I really just wanted a friend. No matter how hard I try, I just can't be content with how things are. I care about my boyfriend still. I care about him so much. I just don't want to be his girlfriend anymore. Ideally, I'd want to remain his best friend and he my best friend. But my past experience with relationships tells me that probably wont happen.

Over the past year and a half our relationship has become extremely codependent. We're in nearly constant contact and neither of us have a particularly large circle of friends outside of each other. I've tried addressing this with him in the past, but he doesn't see a problem with how close we are. How we're basically each others only friends. I've been trying to widen my circle of friends lately, and I'm encouraging him to do the same, but he doesn't have much interest.

He's an incredibly sweet guy. Someone I know will find other girls to be with. But he has very little self esteem and doesn't get out much. There was a point in our relationship where anxiety and depression really hit him hard. I did all I could to be there for him, support him, help him get through the battle he was fighting, and luckily he did. Over the course of a few months he was back to his normal self. I worry a lot about what would have happened if I wasnt there for him those few months. He has a history with depression and he hasn't really developed the ability to talk with people about it. It's a rough situation, because when he's feeling good, he doesn't feel the need to have a support network, but when he's feeling bad, he doesn't have the motivation to get help. He's a great guy, but incredibly stubborn. Basically since we met I've been trying to convince him to see a therapist, have one on standby in case he gets bad, or at least talk with his family about therapy. But I can't get him to budge or do anything and I don't know what to do to help him.

There was a point in our relationship where we did break up. For about a month. I hate to say it, but I was happier during that month than the last several of our relationship. But my boyfriend was miserable. I don't want to go over all the details, but my breaking up with him and the sadness from it consumed his life. He talked multiple times about self harm and suicide. There were a handful of nights where I was really worried he'd try something and it terrified me. I was scared he'd hurt himself and I'd lose my best friend forever. This fear and some loneliness of my own drove me to get back together with him. I know that was a bad decision. That it was stupid and undid any progress I'd made, but I was just so scared he'd hurt himself. I tried to encourage him to see a therapist, and when he got bad, check himself into a hospital, but he'd never listen. I really didn't have any control over the situation. It was the only thing I could do.

I don't know what to do with our relationship or my life now. I fucked up and I'm too scared of losing my best friend to even begin to fix it. Please, I need help.

TL;DR: I don't want to be in a relationship with my BF anymore, but I have reason to worry he'll hurt or kill himself if we break up and I don't know how to help him.

Thank you for reading this.
