Well that is it. I am ending my life today and all because of the US healthcare system. I am done living life.I hate living in poverty with little to no help and am to the end of my rope with it and thinking death is a lot better  

Well I am better off ending my life now than I am trying to survive it.  I am on disability and with it comes bad health insurance and no dental insurance. I just found out that I  have a small black mass under my tooth and the dentist doesn't know what it is. 

Said it could be an infection, it could be cancer, it could be anything. he doesn't know. he wants me to see a specialist. a specialist I can't afford that will cost me 300 dollars just for the visit alone and the longer I wait to see them the worse it gets and if it is cancer then the longer it goes without being treated and if it is an infection the longer it goes without being treated and the worse it gets and eating my jaw bone away. 

I have that care credit card but my monthly payments are 83 a month because of the 1500 already spent on it. I literally can't do any more charges to it or the minimum payment will go higher into the 100's a month which I can't afford I can barely afford the 83 a month as it is. 

I am better just ending my life and saving myself the issues and troubles financially and the pain and suffering I am going through over this.
