I need help, but there is noneI'm depressed, constantly tired, I haven't submitted any coursework for an entire month and now I only have 5 weeks left to finish a two year course. I hate myself as well, I'm fat, ugly, barely have a social life and I don't even leave the house anymore. My life is falling apart, and there's no one to help me, I'm on medication but that doesn't help, I don't have any therapy or even anyone useful to even talk to. I'm on the edge of just ending it all here and now. I feel like I'm trying to climb Mount Everest with no limbs. My life is impossible and I feel like I'm better off dead.
