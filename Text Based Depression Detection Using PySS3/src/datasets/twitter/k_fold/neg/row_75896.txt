Are the police going to be involved?I plan to drive to my local hardware store pick up some ductape and a hose, take my dad's car up into a nature reserve and drive to never never land. I will have a visible suicide note and will probably text a family member where to meet me via a scheduled sms system.

Will the police have to be involved? I hate to think my family will be subject to such an invasive procedure.
