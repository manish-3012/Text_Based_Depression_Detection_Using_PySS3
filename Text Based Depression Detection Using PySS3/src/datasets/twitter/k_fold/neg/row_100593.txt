Enough pillsFrom what I've gathered online for my age and weight I could hospitalise myself with the amount of pills I have in front of me. Not certain death, but could at least get into hospital and maybe skip work and maybe speak to a mental health professional. But I guess I want to die, but with my boyfriend keeping watch on me I can't get to the train station. So having an attempt  would probably be the best right now.
