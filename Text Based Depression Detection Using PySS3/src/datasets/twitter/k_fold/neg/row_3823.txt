Just a question if someone else is going through the same thingI dont know if I am depressed, as much as that word is overused I think, or suicidal. If anything this'll help me vent out frustration, at least. But I dont know, everytime I go home, I feel like my parents hate me. I feel like everyone at my work hates me. And I feel I never do a good enough job at anything, even in personal hobbies, like I'll be a loser forever. And I take tons of sleeping pills almost every night for sleep, but also hope I kind of "accidentally" take to many one night. And I have so much on my shoulders that it gets to a point that I just don't care about anything anymore. Its been one thing after another the past couple of years and I get so angry over everything. 

And I can't talk to parents or anything because all they say is " oh you're sad, just cheer up. You have nothing to be depressed about". I always tell myself I wouldn't purposely kill myself or anything but if something else was to do the job, I wouldn't care. I really only care about my cats, as dumb as that sounds. I've had an extremely low point in my life that I did try to un-alive myself because there was just no way out, I thought. I never told anyone I tried just because I feel no one would've believed me or cared. Then it kind of snowballs because I thought to myself, "man, you suck so bad at life that you can't kill yourself properly".

Anyway, yeah, thats the end of this ted talk. Feels good to get this off my chest even if its here
