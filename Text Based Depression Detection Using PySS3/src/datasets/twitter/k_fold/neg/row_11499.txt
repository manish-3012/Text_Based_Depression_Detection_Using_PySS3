Considering hospitalization TW: Self-harm, Suicide and ManiaIâ€™m considering hospitalization and Iâ€™m very nervous. My meds arenâ€™t helping and I feel so blah. Iâ€™m getting my meds adjusted next Thursday, should I wait to see how it goes? I think I can stay safe until then. My worst fear is falling back into my self harm and suicidal thoughts. But I also donâ€™t want to slip into mania, (pretty sure I was mis-diagnosed with MDD and not bipolar) Any one ever been to a psych ward? Any tips for packing, telling my parents, things know about the ward? Literally any info helps.
