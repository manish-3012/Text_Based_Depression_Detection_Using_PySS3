I wish I could leave myselfDoes anyone ever wish you could leave yourself behind? Like I hate who I am so much I wish I could just drive away and never see that person again. 

I'm terrible company, and I even find myself annoying. I hate what I do, what I say, how I say it. I'm a disappointment to my family, my friends, and myself. The rest of my life will just be stress on myself and anyone I know. It would be selfish to not kill myself since people can't stand me.
