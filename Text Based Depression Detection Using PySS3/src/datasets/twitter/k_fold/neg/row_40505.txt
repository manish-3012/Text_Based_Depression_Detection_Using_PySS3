Need info/help for SO.My SO has been expressing to me for a while the desire to not exist anymore after a long battle with depression, anxiety, and recent health issues. This person will soon lose their job and insurance (very soon) if I am not able to get them the proper attention. My SO has told me several times that they plan to kill themselves if they lose their job, but will not go into work to keep their job because of their issues. Any information on programs or treatment options, preferably in the Chicagoland area, would be greatly appreciated.
