Last call for help21/female

I have been seeing my campus therapist for a few months, but now that I finished university, I have nobody to talk to. I talked with my older sister about my struggles, and she laughed it off. I talked with my only girl friend about my depression and suicidal thoughts, she stopped responding to me. My boyfriend is happy and successful, I am afraid he'll run when he founds out exactly how unstable I currently am. He says he loves me, but it's hard for me to feel it and believe it when I hate myself so much. I spent my New Years Eve planning out my suicide, and now I am just looking for reasons to not go through with it. My motivation to leave is not fueled by a specific event, but rather 10+ years of self-hatred and self-disgust. I managed to fuck things up with each friend I had, developed social anxiety, spent 18 hours a day playing video games to distract myself, and recently quit video games in an attempt to live a more wholesome life - which led to wallowing even more in my depressive and suicidal thoughts. I am not sure where else to go for help, and I can't afford a therapist since I'm an unemployed college grad with a huge collection of rejection letters.
