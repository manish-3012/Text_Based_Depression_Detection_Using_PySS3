tiredmy mom died when i was young and it messed my head and my dad isnt around either he is living overseas , he as also not been apart of my life from the beginning because he went away before my mom died i am currently living with my granparents ..... sometimes i just feel desserted , like i have one to turn to ,no one to explain my fears to..... i often cry myself to sleep i always ask god if he could just give me one day with my mom just to feel her touch ,her warmth i just want my mom to be here with me .......... each time i ask my relatives how she died everyone has a different story ....i am a straight A+ &amp; B+ student now my grades are no a toll i think that its because i am getting older my eager is getting greater each day .... i often feel like to just end my life and be with here
