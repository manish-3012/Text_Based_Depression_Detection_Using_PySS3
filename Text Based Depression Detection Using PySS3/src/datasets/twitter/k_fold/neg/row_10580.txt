If you are depressed please for the love of god stay off twitter.Its the most toxic place to ever exist .. i hate to be the "i was born in the wrong generation guy" and as much as i appreciate my generstion (gen z) for being somewhat more accepting than generations before, i would've loved to be a teen in the early 2000s or the 2000s in general it just seemed less stressful.
Maybe im looking at it with rose tinted glasses but i dont think teen culture or people on social media have ever been this bad.
