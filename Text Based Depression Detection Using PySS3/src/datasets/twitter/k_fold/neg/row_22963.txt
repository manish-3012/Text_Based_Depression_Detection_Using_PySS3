At the end of my ropeI'm mere weeks away from graduating college, but I've somehow managed to set myself on the brink of academic disaster. But I can't bring myself to do the work. It all feels so futile, and failure seems inevitable. And if I don't fail, then what? On to working out in the real world, living an unfulfilled, disappointing, and forlorn life where the only thing I'm sincerely looking forward to is the day when there's no one left on Earth who cares about me and I can just let myself die without feeling bad about myself?

I just don't want to go on like this anymore. I don't know what I'm expecting to get out of posting this, but here I am. I don't have the heart to actually hurt myself... But there's nothing I want more in this moment than to end it all.
