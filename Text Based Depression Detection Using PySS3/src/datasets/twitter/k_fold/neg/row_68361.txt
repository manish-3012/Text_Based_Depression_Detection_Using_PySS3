Does anyone else just like doing dangerous stuff just hoping to die.I am not killing myself yet, am going to buy a new gun because husband took the gun out and I have no clue what he did with it. I want to get legal documents settled first, like will, car title bank info, stuff like that. In the mean time I have enjoyed doing things like not wearing my seat belt, tailgating semi-trucks and mixing alcohol and Xanax before going to sleep. ( have prescription for it). I guess I just keep hoping to die with out doing it myself, I am not really sure why this is.
