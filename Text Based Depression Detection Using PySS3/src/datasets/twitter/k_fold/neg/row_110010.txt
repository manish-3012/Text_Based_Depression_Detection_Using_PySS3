Should I break up and "return" to my home country first so I can pack my stuff up/have a buffer?The thinking is that I'd break up with him and pack my stuff up (more convenient cleanup for after) as if I'm leaving to stay at a hotel for a few days before heading back to my home country.

Like full-on fake a flight itinerary with dates/times of an actual flight and not let him send me off (since we've broken up) at the airport.

Also to tell him that I don't want any contact with him for 6 months or something - and then I "check out of the hotel" (and the rest is planned out and I'm not allowed to talk about that here). 

The good thing about being a "planner" suicidal person is that I have all the things I need; after that I just need a few days alone for the impulse to strike.

He's just going through a really freaking tough time - deaths of close family members/financial/career issues/health issues...

If it delays him finding out then at least some of that other stuff will have been resolved before then.

Has anyone else had plans along these lines?
