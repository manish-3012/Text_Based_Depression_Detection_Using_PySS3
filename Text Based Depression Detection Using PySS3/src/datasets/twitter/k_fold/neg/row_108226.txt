Give me one reason not toYesterday it took me 5 hours to get out of bed. I spent the last hour on my floor crying and bleeding, and I just can't take it anymore. Day after day after day after day. I don't know what to do. I'm so scared. Nothing seems to ever go right, and if it does, something fucks it up the next minute. I just don't want to do this anymore_x000D_

EDIT: Thank you everyone with your time, and it seems like a generalized response but I mean it. I haven't had a breakdown like this in a long time, just got a lot on my plate right now. I have a big exam in an hour and a half that I need to finish studying for, so I'm going to try and focus on that. I stopped cutting for now, the bleeding stopped and I managed to get off the floor. Guess I just needed someone to tell it to, at school I don't really talk to anyone about this...Thank you
