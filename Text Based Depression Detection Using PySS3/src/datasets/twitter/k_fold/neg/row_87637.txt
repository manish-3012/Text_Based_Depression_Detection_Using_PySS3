Thinking about overdosing on my sleeping pills...I have prescription sleep meds.... I'm thinking about just going out, having some random sex, drink some alcohol, and then just take all my pills after. 

Lately, I've been getting dizzy and my pupils are dilating. I don't feel like myself. I'm a normal young professional... but I seem to slip out of my world sometimes.
