Feeling like it's the 4th quarter...I'm 30. I see this beautiful vibrance in my peers as they enter this amazing era of their lives. Engagements. Marriages. Amazing new careers. Opening up the new chapter of bringing children into this world. I see futures spread out before them. If life was a football game, they are a few minutes away from half-time, trying to gather momentum for the long haul. There's still a long way for them to go - new journeys to initiate, love to share, time to ponder.

Not me. I have this inexplicable, consuming sense that I'm in the middle of the 4th quarter. Not a whole lot of time left. It's a depressing thought - but it ISN'T a depressing thought. It more just feels like I'm quitting my job, and am in the last few weeks of my job and have to clean my desk/tie up the loose ends. I'm not even convinced that I'll go by my own hand. Just feeling like my purpose for being here is coming to a close and God will find some way to take me. Hoping my wishes to NOT go by my own hand will be honored.

It's really not that sad. The impermanence of life is very obvious to me. But it can be a bit jarring to feel like I never accomplished the one thing that I thought was my purpose.
