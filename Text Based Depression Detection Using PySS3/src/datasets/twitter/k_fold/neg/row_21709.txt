Why is suicide considered a bad option?I mean if I've been in pain for years and still more to come, why should i stay and live and deal with it all?

 I lurked here for so long and felt bad for those who are  depressed / want to kill themselves,  but i was never able to tell them not to do it, or talk them out of it.

 Why isn't it an actual thing? Some peaceful way accepted by everyone to end the suffering of those people who have given up? 

Since this is the first time i post, i dont want it to go to waste. It might sound stupid but seriously,  why not? I actually need answeres
