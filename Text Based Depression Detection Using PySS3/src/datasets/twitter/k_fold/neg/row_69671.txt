I donâ€™t want to live this yearSo much of me hurts. I graduated college again with a second degree and feel empty. Just woke up to a significantly higher pay rate due to a big raise in my long term job. My partner and I are better and learning. But I feel dead. I feel empty. I havenâ€™t harmed myself in almost a year but idk if I want to keep going. I see so many people celebrating this new year and all I can care about is how theyâ€™re smiling while Iâ€™m hurting. So I bought a knife. I want to feel something other than mental pain. I want to feel I am alive. For now. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m lost.
