Another face in the seaSo here I am..again. I will try to get to the point.

Life sucks. It's a constant struggle. There are things you have no choice but to do. There are so many responsibilities and things that NEED to be done. 

I don't want that. None of it. I want zero responsibilities. I don't want to HAVE to do anything. I don't want to support myself. I don't want to work for fifty years so I can afford food and shelter. I don't want to constantly be alone.

This is the conflict. Being alive means you HAVE TO address these problems. Doing nothing is not an option. But that's what I want. I want do do nothing.

There is no choice. If I'm alive then I'm going to have to do things that I don't want to do. That's how life just is.

And I don't want that. To connect those ideas, I don't want life.

The amount of pain that I am experiencing is immeasurable. I can't take it. 

I think it's fair to say that getting what I truly want and be alive is impossible.

And these urges...the urge to slash my wrists open is SO INTENSE...it's painful... Fuck these problems..I don't want to have them I don't want to fuckin solve them I want them to stop.

I didn't ask for this. I didn't choose this. I don't want this. I don't care. I don't care. Make. It. Stop.
