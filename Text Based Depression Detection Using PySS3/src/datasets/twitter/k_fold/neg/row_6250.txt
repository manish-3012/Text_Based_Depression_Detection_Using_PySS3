I want to kill myself because of my stupid ass body.I am transgender, and I came out 2 years ago. Nobody accepts me, and itâ€™s taking too long to get on hormones because I have to travel a lot to get the help I need (2 hours by car) and I just canâ€™t deal with it anymore. I just want to slit my wrists because I canâ€™t stand my life as it is.
