Help meOne day I can be so positive and the next I feel suicidal... my moods are so all over the place ever since cps took my son for selling drugs. I am not getting him back my sister has him and he is starting to become more attached to her than me, Sometimes I just want to end it. I have been child sex trafficked, domestically abused and lost my mother to cancer at 16 after my father left her because she was sick when I was 12.... life keeps throwing me stones and I just don't know how much more i can take. My heart is so big i am so empathetic and compassionate towards human beings but my PTSD and anxiety have made me isolate myself because it seems like i always get the same results from people. Hurt and pain. I was an alcoholic for some of my teenage years i stopped that and now all I do is fret and worry unless I smoke marijuana which obviously just masks the underlying issue which is I am extremely depressed. I have never been very suicidal but thinking of how many times I thought about killing myself since my son was taken away makes me think I should maybe be concerned it has gotten to be multiple times per week now... the marijuana seems like it is actually my saving grace. I'm too much of a coward to go through with suicide because unless I get to go somewhere better which I can't be sure of I guess deep down I crave life. Just a better one than I've had. The only good memories I have are before my mom was sick, early childhood. I'm damaged I know I am a good person but I feel so out of place and hurt. I just try not to cry. Even now i feel like i shouldn't be complaining because some people have it worse but it is my reality. I'm fishing for kind words or advice.
