Getting really close to doing it. Looking for help finding actually good residential treatment.I've struggled with mental health my whole life. Crippling depression and anxiety, PTSD, etc. I've been on and off suicidal for about a decade. Lately it is worse than ever, and I've lost my ability to see any hope for getting out of this hole. I'm medicated and in therapy, but it's not enough. None of my reasons for living matter much to me anymore. It feels like I'm getting close to giving in and dying.

I guess some tiny part of me hasn't fully given up yet, and wants me to try checking myself in to full-time residential care. I'm not very optimistic that it'll help, but hey, what do I have to lose? If it doesn't work I can just kill myself afterward.

But I know a lot about residential care--I actually used to write about treatment facilities for my work. In my experience, they tend to be run-down, poorly managed, understaffed people warehouses that are a lot more interested in insurer money than they are in the actual people they're supposed to be treating. You get some group therapy and the occasional one-on-one session from an inexperienced and overworked staffer, plus meds from a psychiatrist who sees you for less than five minutes. Even the fancy places, with equine therapy and lakes and whatever, are much the same.

Are there exceptions? Is there somewhere I could go that's better than that, where I would be treated like a real human being? I would travel just about anywhere for that, and pull together whatever money it takes. I just can't find a single good option. Maybe you all can help. Thank you.
