Just why...Why does my you wear the necklace that was given to you by your ex boyfriend when I gave you a new one? You claimed it wasn't your style. I gave you at least four. All different styles. You showed me something to get you on amazon. I bought it! You say it's not how you thought it was. I bought you another one. You say you don't like the material and that it's too cheap. It's a $300 aquamarine necklace(YOUR BIRTHSTONE) while the necklace you love is plastic and has a plastic ruby. 

You text to your ex boyfriend when you know it makes me upset!! I'm not saying don't talk to him, I'm just saying that you don't need to text him. You see him Monday through Friday on the bus and you talk to him after the last class of the day before I drop you off to your bus stop!!

Why don't I say things like "Don't talk to him?" I don't say it because I don't want our relationship to end up like it did before.

You broke up with me to go out with him and you say it didn't work out with him. We're back together.

You don't let me touch your phone and you can search mine all you want. I don't even care if you do! I'm not hiding anything! Why can't I to your phone if you can to mine!

Why are you so obsessed with you stupid ex boyfriend?! Am I not enough for you?!

Why don't I break up with you?! I can't. I've been with you for at least 7 years and you're everything to me!!! Plus, you're the only person who accepted me for me!!! Nobody else has no matter how much I tried.

I have many problems psychologically and physically. You helped me and been with me during when all those things were diagnosed and I wanted to kill myself! And now you're not. 

I hate my life. My family. My "friends". You... But I love you too... I hate you so much... But I love you...

I wish I never met you... I want to kill myself... But I don't... I don't know what to do...
