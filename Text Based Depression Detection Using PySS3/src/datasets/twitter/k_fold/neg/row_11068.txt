Tonight is the night I end it allIt's been a fun ride bois. Been meaning to do it for years, wanted to go ahead with it about 3 months ago, but I just had a feeling that I shouldn't. Nothing to lose, right? It didn't get better, but it definitely went downhill. Not much, although enough to make me understand that I just really don't want to be here anymore. I've been living just to not hurt others for the past few years despite all my suicidal tendencies. It was pretty tough, but I made it work. In the past year or so I've ripped through all my possible ways of life, of getting a career, ostracized myself hoping I could take care of my mind and just set it right, couldn't do it. I hurt people that maybe genuinely cared about me, but it was unintentional. I guess this is the letter I'll never leave to the people that know me. If you aren't 100% sure you want death, don't do it, it does get better sometimes. And you don't want to not be around when it happens. Maybe I get to meet y'all motherfuckers in the next life, if there is one. Take care of yourselves and keep rolling if you can. You aren't death's bitch, death is your bitch. Fuck this world, make it your own.
