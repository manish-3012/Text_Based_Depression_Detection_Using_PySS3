how does one find the time to get better?Between dropping out of my dream program finding a new life, getting a job, and trying to finish out my aa, where do I find time to find the balance I need? I feel like dropping out just traded one struggle for another. I thought about government help but that takes time. Time I do not have. I have no skills don't know what to do job wise. I need a lighter load of life and can't afford it. What do I do?
