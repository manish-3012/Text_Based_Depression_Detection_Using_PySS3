AlmostIve been in a really dark place for the past few months and two nights ago I was going to end it, because I don't want others to try I'm not going into detail, I was about to try and then I turned on my blinker to switch lanes. I almost sideswiped a police crusier and they pulled me over. I got off on a warning, I have no idea what actually happened, I keep going through it in my head. If I hadn't had a break down in my works parking lot then I would have left sooner, I wouldn't have almost hit a cop car and I might have gone through with it. I'm doing better now but it was so weird I wanted to share.
