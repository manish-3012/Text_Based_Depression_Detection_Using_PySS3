This ends now.Iâ€™m really gonna kill myself. Im alone in my dorm and I have the means. Iâ€™m realizing that I donâ€™t act like people my age. I cant relate to the stuff I see on social media and I feel so alone. I realize I have no friends, and that thatâ€™s not normal. I donâ€™t have a great relationship with my family. Iâ€™m humiliated by things Iâ€™ve done in my past, and my on and off relationship with social media probably sends red flags to others that Iâ€™m unstable and crazy. I know that no one will care or notice if Iâ€™m gone. I have no direction in my life and Iâ€™m overwhelmed. Iâ€™m afraid of so many things lately. Iâ€™m in such an extremely dark place right now. I cant live with the way I look. I cant. I cant do it. I feel so disgusting when I see myself in photos that I havenâ€™t carefully angled and edited. I hate how I look and I cant stand it a minute longer. That alone, even without the other things, is enough. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost any progress I made tonight. I feel like Iâ€™m going backwards. I tried so hard and now Iâ€™m slipping and I cant stop it. And for that Iâ€™m also ashamed. Iâ€™m sad and disappointed because I realize Iâ€™ll never actually get better.
