HelpMy fiance inadvertently killed my baby cat. I yelled at him and he said he was tired of my shit and packed up his stuff and left.

I dont know what to do with myself.

My dead baby is sitting in a box by the door, and im all alone. I have bi polar depression and constantly think of suicide. I need some support please.
