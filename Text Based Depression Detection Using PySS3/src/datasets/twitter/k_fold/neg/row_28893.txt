Ohoohoo am I dramatic or depressed?This feels like a place to look for answers. 

So, I've been dawdling through my school life already planning for this to be the last year of my life. Jeez sounds dismal but yeah I guess that's my mindset right now. I often find myself thinking of ending sometimes everything just feels too much and I don't if it's something like hypersensitivity or I'm just dramatic. So to keep myself in check I promised myself at the end of the year, rather like when someone is running and they think "just to that tree I can make it" and they look to the next tree and think "I can do it". 

There are times, really bad times, where I'm imagining the mess it'll leave behind. I keeping thinking that I never want to hurt any of the people who still care but even though it's stupid and messed up them feeling pain because they lost me. Well that makes me feel like I did something right, but how fxcked is that because I'll be gone so it wont matter. Writing this is really making me think rather than avoid. 

I stumbled in and out of this mindset and find, which never was the case before the events of last year, that being alone up late seals me in my dumbass head where I can't seem to see anything worth it in the future. I don't know whether I'm depressed or just dramatic but this is becoming an issue, could it be mild bi-polar? God I don't know. I just don't want to be here living anymore. I feel weak but seeking help would make me feel as if I were seeking attention. ANd I definitely don't want to be that over sharer that brings everyone else down. I'd rather suffer than bring them down. 

Am I dramatic, suicidal and depressed, both or just an idiot?
