Chose a dateMy friend always told me if someone is suffering as I am, that they should end it. Not that they wanted to encourage me, but just telling me their thoughts on relieving the misery.

I finally planned a date. Iâ€™ve known how I was going to end it for a long time now, been planning it for years. I know how Iâ€™m going to say goodbye. Iâ€™ve never been good at goodbyes, but this time Iâ€™ll make it a proper one. I canâ€™t wait to spend time with friends, and even drive 16 hours to visit a friend next month.

After being in the ICU I knew to never let myself go back to the hospital. I have made this decision out of self-respect for myself. I donâ€™t owe it to anyone else, the pain and grief of others shouldnâ€™t determine the happiness for myself.
