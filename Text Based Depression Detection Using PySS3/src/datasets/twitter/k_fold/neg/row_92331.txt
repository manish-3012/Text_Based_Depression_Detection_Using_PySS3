I'm tired of things getting better only to get shitty again; all happiness I've ever had has been false or extremely temporary and I just want to end it, I am just used up trashI don't know how to handle everything that I have had to go through.

My cousin molested me when I was four. I was too young to know what was happening, so I liked it. I liked kissing (the taste of cigarettes in his mouth is how I know it wasn't just a weird dream), but him touching me hurt. I can still remember and feel the pain.

My dad molested me on occasion until I was old enough to know how to stop it. He would have me sleep in his bed and he would reach over to see if I was still there. If I slid over far enough he couldn't reach, or if I fell out of the bed "in my sleep" it would be enough to remove his hand.

When I was 13 I fell in love with an 18 year old. He would sneak into my house and we would do things. He was stealing from me the entire time. When he got my iPod, I never saw him again. I met his 21 year old brother and started stealing my parent's cigarettes to give to him. I went to his house one night. We fooled around. I told him I didn't want to have sex. He put it in anyway. My virginity was stolen. He wasn't wearing a condom. I never saw him again.

I worked for my mom that summer too. We had to pick up some of the other workers in the van we were taking to the worksite. I was in the middle of the van, next to the only open seat. My two cousins were in the front seats. Two other workers were in the back. We picked up the sixth worker, he was wasted. I could smell the vodka as soon as he got in the car. He made me hug him for a very long time, and kept patting me all over my side. I pretended to sleep and he put his disgusting jacket over me. We stopped at a gas station and he got out; my cousins asked me what I wanted them to do and I said I didn't know and so they just had me switch with one of the workers in the back. I was then diagonal to the drunk. When he returned, he turned around to grab my bare knee and ask me if I was ticklish. When I told my parents, they didn't care and did nothing.

My mom died when I was 15. I used to tell her all the time that I wished she would die and she told me I'd regret. I found her. I didn't know she was dead till it was too late, I sat in a room with her dead body eating a sticky bun. It was exactly a week before Christmas.

She was an agoraphobe. She stopped going outside when I was ten or so. She was also extremely sick, often defecating in her pants because she drank nothing except beer and took diet pills (caffeine laxative type pills). She ruined her clothing so much she would steal mine and ruin it.

Both of my parents were/are severe alcoholics. Working from home, my mother was much, much worse. She would hide the beer cans around the house, and at least one large black garbage bag full would leave her office per week. My dad got a DUI charge a few months ago and had to install a breathalyzer in his car. They had to instruct me to breath into it so I could drive him home. There have been many times where he can't take me anywhere, even in an emergency, because he's been drinking. Even before this, he was too drunk to pick me up from the school after I'd been on a trip for three weeks. He pawned me off on my grandfather, who pawned me off on my aunt. I hadn't seen either of those two people in years. I called my other aunt to come pick me up, where the teachers had to wait with me alone for about twenty minutes after loving parents picked up the rest of the kids. On my 17th birthday he got so trashed that we got kicked out of the restaurant while yelling at me about how much my suicide attempt hospital bill had cost.

My family is extremely volatile. They fought constantly, before my brother ran away and my mother died. All holidays have been terrible. There was one time when I was 11 that my dad went into my brothers room on Christmas Eve to stop him from playing the Xbox at around midnight, and the Xbox power adapter ended up going through the window. I had to drag my screaming mother out of the room because I thought they were going to push each other out of the big glass hole. When I was 12 I was called home by my mother at 3 AM from a sleepover because my dad was spending a night in the police station, after getting so drunk and aggressive that he tore a door down trying to get to my mom hiding in the bathroom. My brother was not my dad's son and they always hated each other for it.

I have had extremely terrible experiences with all of my relationships. My first one was when I was 12, ending around the time I turned 13. We smoked weed together all the time, with his older brother too. This boyfriend is how I met the 18 and 21 year old brothers. It was a fine relationship at first; then he started breaking up with me and then taking me back all the time. He made fun of me with his friends. He told me I was annoying before I went to give a speech about bullying.

When I was 16-17 I was sort of with one of my childhood friends. We fooled around in my car a lot. But he wouldn't date me. He would disappear for weeks out of nowhere. He would use me and then leave. We never had sex, but it was all enough to make me feel grossly used. Our "relationship" started in June,  and when I told him I loved him on New Years he said he loved me and then blocked me for three months. I was dating another friend that I had no feelings for when he came back. He kissed me, and I kissed him back and cheated on my sweet, kind friend with him because I thought he finally really loved me. He didn't. I broke up with the friend.

I met a boy I would then start dating in April of that year through the boy who wouldn't love me, as I had finally had the gall to block him so he went through his friends. We started talking, and I wanted to forget the other boy so I started dating this guy. On our first meeting he bit my neck so hard and aggressively that I cried on my way home. I had marks for days. He had taken his dick out and rubbed it all over me even though I said no. I would go on to date him for ten months. He lied to my face about not talking to the boy who hurt me terribly so I tried to break up with him repeatedly, he refused. He then started breaking up with me in November, 11 days before my birthday, then two days after, then two weeks after. My heart was broken. We had sex consistently throughout this time. I would ask him to stop and he wouldn't. If I said no to sex ever he would get very mad and whine till I said yes. I agreed to anal just so I could lay on my side while he just did what he wanted. One breakup was because I didn't have my license and couldn't buy him cigarettes. The last one was because I was too sick to drive half an hour to spend one hour with him before driving back. I also did all the driving in the relationship. He didn't bother trying to find a way to get to me. 

I went on tinder a few weeks after our final breakup and met someone who I thought was great (end of January, this year). We talked for a long time before meeting, then went on many dates before having sex a few weeks later. Two weeks after that he would have to leave college and go back to his house permanently, which was 5 hours away. I drove up the first time to spend two nights, at the end of which he said he wanted us to not romantically see each other anymore. He called me when I got home and said he wanted to keep seeing me. We saw each other on the weekends after that. About a month and a half ago we agreed to be in a real, exclusive relationship. He drove down three days ago and broke up with me, giving me no warning at all. He said he didn't and couldn't love me. I thought he was coming to stay with me. He left after that. We had sent nudes and sexted only days before that, with him being very dismissive otherwise. I thought he was just having a stressful time. He admitted tonight that he knew he didn't love me when we sexted. I told him I felt used, he said my emotions and reactions are not his responsibility. He said we shouldn't talk for a while. He's already updated his tinder profile. I thought he loved me. My heart is in splinters.

At the end of March, my very sweet friend and ex boyfriend died. He was only 18. I had seen him the Friday before the Sunday he died. He looked so swollen and gray in his coffin. We had had a small argument that night, and the last time I had seen him was driving away in my car while he smoked.

I've had two suicide attempts. The first was because I actually wanted to die (December of 2015, didn't know how to cope with two years of losing my mom); the second was because my father was so kind to me the first time since he couldn't drink in the hospital (November of 2016). I wanted that kindness again, since I had nobody.

I don't think there's any getting past this. I hate my two high school friends (ones I've had since 5th grade, from a much larger group of people that have all lost interest in me). I'm terrible. Nobody wants to love me or be around me. I can't be loved. I am just something to be used. Things only get slightly better, then everything gets worse again. The happiness is false. There's no way to get past all of these things that have happened to me. I don't recover. I am an emotional mess every time something bad happens. I am so, so so alone. I will have nobody this summer, and it's three months till my college orientation. All I want is love. It doesn't exist. I don't want to live anymore. There's no way to make progress. Nobody will even read this.
