Loneliness and Suicide.I'm so tired of being alone, and yet I don't want to be around people. I can't be around people, and yet I have to deal with the negative psychological effects of it because I'm a social creature. I don't really want to live. I don't enjoy being alive, and I don't have any hope for the future. I'm... just. In torture right now. My mind is torture. I think about suicide every day. Now it seems like a legitimate option to me. Why not? Going from a negative to 0 isn't a bad thing... it's good. Isn't it a reasonable choice when you have no possible hope of happiness?
