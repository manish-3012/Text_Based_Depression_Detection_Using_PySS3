I Love Nightmares.Nightmares, horror films .. you name it.

The more terrifying, the better. Then you wake up in the morning and think to yourself .. "well, at least the real world isn't THAT shitty" .. and it feels great ... ...

Until you suddenly realize .. well, actually .. I did have friends and people to talk to in my last nightmare, so maybe the nightmares really ARE preferable to the real world, after all.

See.. the internet is just like the sea; People, people everywhere .. but not a soul to speak to. I've been living on the internet for the past 5 years, ever since I graduated high school.

I honestly don't know how people make friends. I've done voluntary work, paid work .. I've been to bars, nightclubs .. everywhere. Even been on Tinder and dating sites. The Facebook generation is so lifeless and fake .. it's disgusting, I'm glad I deleted my Facebook accounts. 

The only place where people will talk to me is on YouTube, it seems.. but only because they like my videos. It really does seem like Fame is the only antidote to all of my ills. I might even discover my Soulmate, if my videos go viral.. 1,000,000 million views + at least.

But if they don't, then I'm doomed to fade away into oblivion. It's like I don't even Exist. 

That's part of the reason I'm not scared of the government spying on me on the internet, you know .. when I download torrents and all that. If the government really is spying on me .. then at least SOMEBODY, surely .. knows that I exist. I would actually be very happy to be in the shoes of Edward Snowden and Julian Assange, and the likes. Even though they're in so much legal trouble, at the very least .. they are WANTED. I'd love to be Wanted. ^^
