What do I do?My boyfriend is drinking alcohol then immediately vomitting it. He says he doesn't want the alcohol. He is trying to poison himself with it. He wants to die. I got him to admit yesterday its for attention but my attention isn't stopping him from trying.  He is trying this way because he is "too much a coward" for any other way.

I call for help he will have me legally removed from house which would be within his rights to do and I lose him forever and he will be completely alone. He says he loves me but I don't think it goes this far when he has this idea in his head.  If I don't... 

To explain my situation, I have no other place to go. Small town. No friends or family.   But my boyfriend doesn't have anyone either.

I'm in bad situation. I don't know what to do. Need advice. I love this man.
