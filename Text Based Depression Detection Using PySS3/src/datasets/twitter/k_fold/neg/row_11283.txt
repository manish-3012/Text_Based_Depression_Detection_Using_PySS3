16M No friends, social anxiety, can't concentrate in school.I'm broken, have no one to turn to. I have no real friends, they're all fake. I am always alone, I barely talk. I get bullied, I've been made to feel like nothing my whole school life. The one girl I like doesn't even want to talk to me. What good am I in this world. I can never seem to fit in anywhere.
