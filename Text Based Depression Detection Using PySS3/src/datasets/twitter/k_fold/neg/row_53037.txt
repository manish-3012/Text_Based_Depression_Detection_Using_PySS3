Suicide is and has always been an option. ANYONE who says otherwise has never been at a point where one would kill themselvesIt genuinely pisses me off everyte a person comes up to me, or stands in front of a room, or even when a guy comes on the radio, and starts spatting about the time that they, "realized it wasn't worth it". Saying that ," There's always someone out there who cares about you and will miss you 

If that's true, THEN WHERE WERE THEY WHEN I NEEDED THEM??!!!

WHY DIDN'T THEY SAY THAT THEY DID??!!! 

WHY WEREN'T THEY THERE TO SUPPORT ME IF THEY CARED SO MUCH???!!!!


For anyone who "has" gone through tough times and "realized what they were doing", please just hear me out. 

I am NOT saying that what happened to you wasn't as NESSCERILLY as bad as what we are going through. Its just different people are weaker, and are more prone to depression and suicidal thoughts to other things and others.

I'm done, I've had it. I'm tired of dealing with a world that puts profit other people's life, a world that judges a book by its cover, a world that exploits the will of a poor woman trying to feed her family...

... a world that wants everyone to fit in.

I'm done trying to fit in. I'm done with everything

The rich have won, and I have lost.

Thank you.. for the few that cared.
