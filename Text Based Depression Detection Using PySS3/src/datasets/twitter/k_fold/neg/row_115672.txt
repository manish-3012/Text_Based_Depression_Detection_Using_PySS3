the only reason i haven't killed myself is because i don't wanna hurt my parents. im 16(m)as much as we don't get along, i know they care about me. i know how much my mom has been through, and i just don't want to hurt her anymore. her mom fucked up and got addicted to drugs, and so is my moms son (my brother). just last night my brother OD'd on heroin the second time in just two weeks. he's getting kicked out now. i was just watching my dad pump on my brothers chest trying to wake him up as my mom watches panicking with tears in her eyes. 

I feel like i should be more sad about the whole situation, but at this point i think im just numb to everything. i don't feel happy most the time, nowadays most of the time i just want to die.

i feel like im a burden. i just can't meet anyone's expectations. im fucking up in school. im constantly reminded about my bad grades, and how i just can't do anything right.

i only have one REAL friend, and even then, we're not that close with eachother. everyone else i know are just acquaintances. no one genuinely wants to hang out with me. the girl i thought i loved doesn't love me back. im no ones number one. there's no point

and with school around the corner, im getting more and more stressed about the tests, grades, people, teachers, and failing classes... im nothing like my sister. she's really good with school (she gets anxiety though) and im not. i fail almost all my classes as i just don't have any motivation, and can't concentrate in class at all.

i need help. im severely depressed and really anxious, but i can't bring myself to ask my parents. they think that im fine. they ask if im okay, i instinctively lie and they believe me

i would end my shit, but im afraid how my mom/dad would react to losing their son. I just don't want to hurt anybody, just myself
