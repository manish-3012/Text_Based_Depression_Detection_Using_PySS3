Done. Over. Why should I give a shit?Couple months ago, boyfriend cheated on me. I thought we could work past it. We've been together forever. Surprise, I just found out he did it again. 

Shock.

A*fucking*mazement.

Rejected for the job I wanted. That's big. Huge. It was The Job. The one I should have gotten without breaking a sweat. The one that would have put me on financial easy street for life. The one I'd someday maybe support a family on. (Fucking hilarious idea, I know. Me, have a family? Right. Sure.)

Got a volunteer job and can barely keep up even with that. Too dumb to be functional.

Got a 3.95 GPA, which gives people the delusion that I'm competent in anything. I'm not. When I'm listening to people my mind just zones out at times. Miss a lot of information that way.

I'm boring. So boring.

Literally have zero friends. That's part of why I'm so unwilling to break up with boyfriend, I think. My personality is very abrasive. Very awkward. Too me-me-me all the time. Most people piss me off anyway and regularly being around people stresses me out, so I usually don't mind, but it's a little lonely sometimes.

I don't know what's wrong with me. Who gets stressed by having a good time with friends? My last batch, I chilled with about once a month, times were good, but even though it was only once a month I would have to force myself to go.

I've only ever had one job over one summer, and that was pure dumb luck--was for a company that hired via lottery. I've never had an interview before, except for the volunteer job, despite sending out FSM-knows how many resumes and cover letters.

And people say, it's so hard to get a job. You have to stand out beat out win over everyone, absolutely everyone else. I can't do that. I can't beat anyone. I don't know what success is. I've never felt it, not in anything, once, ever.

If something is hard I put on the brakes.

I can't even summon up enough will to study, and I take courses I actually enjoy. I just

don't

care

and I don't know why I should. I'm entirely dysfunctional. Tried counselling regarding that once, did shit-all. Of course.

I'm just so worthless. I'm a horrible friend, I'm a horrible lover--another reason I can't break up with him is that he's the only person who's ever been able to stand me, and likely ever will, that's how bad I am--I'm utterly unemployable and a waste of resources in a desperately overcrowded world. A waste of my parents' money as I get this worthless degree. A waste of more of their money as if I graduate I'll have to move in with them again since I sure as fuck won't be getting a job.

I can't live.

I don't want to have to kill myself, but I really can't be alive anymore. This is not living. My life has completely failed.

I mean, how fucked are you when Tim-fucking-Hortons is actively hiring and won't even give you an interview?

No one would even miss me. How could they? No friends. My family, sure, but I know that deep down they'd be relieved that the burden is gone.

I don't want to live for the end of the world anyway. We're all so fucked. The economy, fucked, society, fucked, the environment, fucked. Everything is just fucked. Why do I have to stick around? I'll probably be murdered on day one anyway. All the shit I see on Reddit, even though I unsubscribed from practically everything, it just makes everything worse.

I don't know. Just typing into empty space, I guess. I feel so frozen. Nothing I've tried, not eating better, not exercising, not counselling, not smiling more, nothing has helped. I'm coasting, sleepwalking, leaden. Cliche, but I feel numb. My brain can't think anymore, only suck up information and then regurgitate it. How do people come up with new things? It's beyond me. I'm firmly planted in the box, have been my whole life. Can't get anywhere if you're not creative, and beyond not being creative these days I really can't think about anything I haven't read, can barely even connect two related concepts anymore. I just don't know.
