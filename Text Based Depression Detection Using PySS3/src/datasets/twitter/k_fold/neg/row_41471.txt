Genuinely the only thing keeping me alive is my fear of dying.Please tell me your reasons to keep going, I really need something. I have nothing left to look forward to this year, I just need something positive.
I have no friends, I have no family I can rely on. please don't mention it. 
I think about doing it every second of every day. I just need something positive to latch onto
