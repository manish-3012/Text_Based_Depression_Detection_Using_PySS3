The little things are just to much.It feels like every tiny detail is wrong. Everything in the last few days is just a mess. Every time I try to make plans everything falls apart to matter who those plans are with, witch means it's me that's wrong right? 

I'm supposed to go see a friend in a few months, they quit talking to me. I'm supposed to go see a friend in a month and they can't do our plans now. Christmas was a mess. I was so excited to celebrate the new year and things are crashing down and I'm to sick to make dinner. My phone quit working half the time and I can't replace it for months. It's getting really tense with the people I live with and I can't afford to move. I cracked a tooth, probably can't afford it fix it even with gov Assistance. I can't sleep lately because things are wrong, but that just stresses me more.  I can handle one problem at a time, but not everything having a problem at the same time, even the little things so look forward to and that help me keep going are fucked up.
