I fear this is the end, and I'm damn ready for it to be.So this situation has been brewing for a long time probably since about a month or two. Our roommates up and abandoned us while we were getting our things from Illinois, it's just been two of us in a 4-person home and my other half wants to bring someone who's going to invite insane amounts of drama and financial hardship into our home when we're already tight but we don't even know if we're going to have a place to live in a week, and quite frankly I'm about two steps away from just going into my car and starting it, not opening the garage door just taking both the dog and myself out just so I can finally end the fucking misery with that we've been going through for the past 2 weeks. 

There are other options our prospective roommate has given us options on responsible people that she knows that could move in with us and pay their share of the rent, but that doesn't seem to be an option according to my other half, as the mooch as I'm going to call her I will not pay her share of the rent she is already stated that she wants to move in rent-free and I'm just I'm done Reddit I really am.

Just Give Me a Reason.

I lost my best friend the last man who is a brother to me, ans the person who we would always joke that we were the other half of the same coin, and I'm now down to nothing.
