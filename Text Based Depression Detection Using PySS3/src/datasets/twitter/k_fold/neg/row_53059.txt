SuicidalI've been suicidal for a better part of my life started treatment when i was 8 ever since then i've made some progress but not much. I feel like  a total loser my depression is so bad that i'm on ssi and just idk being on ssi makes me feel like i'll never be "normal" have very few friends and or family connections. My birthday is coming up and it's just making everything worse thinking back this past year i've done absolutely nothing and just i've been burning bridges anyways so if i was going to ever get lucky enough to commit without much interference from life it would be now i have very little to live for.I keep deluding myself to think that i'm young enough to turn my situation around but that's just wishful if not delusional thinking these years of my life are meant to build a foundation for the rest of your life and right now i'm depressed barely leave my apartment and on disability not much of a foundation to build off of. idk i've never really reached out to strangers on the internet but it's late where i'm at and i've already called the crisis line and it didn't help much so here i am yelling out to the void.
