Im ending my life soon, but I don't know whenIm 13m and i have severe depression and anxiety, my parents are extremly strict and Ive lost all my friends. My self esteem is at a zero and I can't handle the pain anymore. I tried to talk to my parents but they both said that this isn't the way I feel, Ive just convinced myself it was. I almost ended it last year but a friend helped me keep going, but this time is different. I have no one to stop me.
