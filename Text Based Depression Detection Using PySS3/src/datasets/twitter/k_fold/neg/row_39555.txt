To have such strong conviction that you will kill yourself...Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t give a crap anymore. I feel a calm sadness in which I wish it could have ended any other way, and some fear obviously, but I donâ€™t dread it no longer. If things work out great, if they donâ€™t Iâ€™ve already accepted it as the only other way. Like I donâ€™t have the motivation to care that much anymore. It just is I guess.
