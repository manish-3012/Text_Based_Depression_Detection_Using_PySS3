I just want human interactionIt's been months since I've even touched another human and days since I've spoken face to face with one outside of work.

The most interaction I get is texting people on occasion and it's not the same.

I want to interact with a person, I want a fucking hug, I'm so lonely and it's so hard to stay alive.

I'm already struggling I just wish I had someone in real life that loved me or cared about me that would talk to me and I could see for real and talk to when I wanted to.

I feel like I'll just die from lonliness at this point which sounds dramatic I guess but it's true, I'm so lonely maybe I'll just kill myself to spare me the pain of that mixed with everything else.
