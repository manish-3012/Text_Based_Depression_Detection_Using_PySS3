I sexually harassed a girl when I was a teen and I feel like I don't deserve happiness or lifeI was either 14 or 15 I don't remember exactly. She was a friend and we would walk home together a short distance. Then one day I started getting turned on by the idea of touching her so a few times I would touch hand and arm very subtly. She didn't seem to react at all. Then I took it to the next level as started touching her waist. This clearly made her feel uncomfortable and would kind of push my hand off, but she never said anything and I continued to do it for a few walks. I remember touching her waist, I don't know if I ever touched her butt, I really hope I didn't. Eventually she told me to stop and I just stopped. I am in my late 20s now. After high school she moved to another state and we didn't really see each other anymore but we were still friends on facebook and we saw each other a few times when she would come visit her family. She has never ever brought it up and she is so nice and warm to me, one of the nicest people I know. In recent years I've started thinking about this and with recent events even more so. It is weighing on me heavily. I had never said anything about it either because I was too afraid to bring it up but I finally decided to message her apologizing and telling her how I feel. She hasn't responded to my message, I am afraid I made her uncomfortable. I feel like what I did was so predatory and that I don't deserve her kindness and don't deserve happiness and don't deserve to live. And it is not just this, I am generally just a worthless person and my life has been nothing but misery since my teen years. I have started looking up the most painless ways to end it, I don't have a gun so I think either hanging myself or sleeping pills will be the easiest way. I am actually scared of death but I can't take this anymore it is becoming to painful.
