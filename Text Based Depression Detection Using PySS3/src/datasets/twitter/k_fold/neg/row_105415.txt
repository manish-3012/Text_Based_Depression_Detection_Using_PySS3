I hope I don't break any rules with this  

Hello, Iâ€™m here to tell you about the step I took away from suicide. I hide it reasonably well in my life so I canâ€™t really share the good news with anyone.  Iâ€™m a med student in his last year, near the exit in both senses. I have struggled with anxiety and depression for a long time and high pressure didnâ€™t really help. I lost total of 3.5 years during my education. From outside I look perfectly well and I have ridiculous amount of trust from everyone I know. I have been entrusted things that no one in my age should be at times since childhood. For med school, they reacted to my every failure that something must have happened, I must have done everything I could, proffesor must have failed me on purposeâ€¦ etc. Me being anything less than perfectly fine in any situation doesnâ€™t seem to be considered. It really took it's toll for quite a while.



So I finally had enough and said I have one more chance, no more. Only one more chance to betray expectations, only one more chance to betray their support. I put together a travel bag. In the bag I had 3 methods I could use to commit suicide and enough money to travel if I want to do it somewhere away. I had access to so much information on case reports, forensic medicine lectures, autophsies of successful attempts etcâ€¦ I settled for 1 general way and two medical drugs of my choices, working at a hospital made it easy to get acquire them. So, I prepared that bag and carried to every single oral exams I had in front of professors. It was unhealthy but also calming to always have an option. Every month I opened the bag and checked the valvesâ€™s pressure against leak, checked the drugs for expiration or heat-moisture damage. I felt relieved when everything checked out. Then I would put it back only to check it open it a month later. During this time I manage to get through without failing so the bag stayed unused.    



Good news I want to share is that at the beginning of this month, I threw the bag away and destroyed everything inside apart from the money. I think that I can contiunue without having it as a cructh. Sorry for writing here to brag about it but I really have no one to tell about it. I'm not completely free of suicidal ideation, I still think about it everyday but I'm safer without that bag. Also sorry fort he long text I didnâ€™t know how to cut it down to managable size. Also sorry about the possible grammer mistakes, english is not my natice tongue. Also sorry for being a coward and writing this with a throwaway account.
