Nothing gets any betterMade the move to another state and haven't been able to find work yet. Asked my mom for help cause I exhausted all my monies till I get paid fr my unemployment Tuesday and she told me no. I shouldn't be surprised at all. If I was home it would be the same thing. She and everyone else would let me starve just to keep money in their pockets. Not like I ask for the world, just a little help. Pleaded with her to just add a few bucks to my paypal, but no. 
It's not like I'm a druggie or alcoholic, although my elder sister is and she gets everything she wants from my mom and family. No one has every had to bail me out of jail or constantly pay my rent or give me a place to live. Yet, I ask for one thing its always the same answer, NO! Especially since I stopped going out of my way for them. When I was in the hospital, no one came and saw me, yet she goes to jail everyone is there and signing their life over to get her out. I worked hard everyday damn day of my life and for what? For nothing that's what. If I died, it is obvious no one I know would care one bit. FML
