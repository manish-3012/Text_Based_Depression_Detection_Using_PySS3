I need to get it together or I will lose my wife Â° /r/depressionI may have lost her already. Is there a term for constantly getting in the way of yourself? I'm sorry but I'm forced to be vague even on my alt. 

Do I feel like I don't deserve happiness? Why am I screwing up this perfect marriage? I haven't talked to my wife in days. She's in China and I'm supposed to do Visa paperwork for her to immigrate here to the US but I keep putting it off. It'll be 3 years soon. I feel like such a dirtbag. 

Everything could be fixed if I'd just asked my aunt to help, she offered. But no I was raised to never ask for help, it was "shameful". Now I can't afford the fees to get her here. My pride be damned. I know how to fix it but why can't I go through with it?? 

My wife does make me so happy. I'm very much in love with her. Jesus I feel so stupid writing this. I'll probably never be able to fix this. 

Is this even depression?? I feel killing myself just to be rid of this. Everyone deserves a life without me. I am a worthless human being, scum of the earth. I think that I was a full to think I was ever good or noble. 

I want to blame this on the death of my brother and grandparents a few years ago but that feels stupid. I wish sometimes that something terrible would happen to me so that I could confess on my hospital bed and every won't be so angry at me. Fuck my mind. I wish I could be normal and just do it, man up or just kill myself. 

I wish I had something to talk to about this. My dad said I was dumb. Bring the flaming arrows.
