Deeply concerned for a friendhello SW - let me start off by saying im completely new to reddit. i browse occasionally, and a lot of my friends have accounts; however, i made an account today because a) i want to and b) i found this subreddit and i thought it'd help me with a rather large problem. my best friend has manic depression, bipolar, probably schizophrenia, etc. and above all, she's extremely suicidal. she's easily triggered, and i try my best to be there for her all the time. i think i do a pretty good job of it. she has (had?) a boyfriend. they were in love, i swear. big age gap, but that's beside the point. today, they got into a really big fight and she was triggered. she said a zillion times that she wants to die, but this time she was really explicit about it. she was screaming at the top of her lungs, she couldn't even breathe at times. she was saying specifically how she'd do it, all that. i'm one of the only people (besides her boyfriend) that can knock some sense into her. i feel like today, though, i couldn't. i just can't convince her anymore. she's basically set. thank god im close with her family because i told her mom to keep a real close watch on her. i feel like i can't help her anymore, and i don't know what to do. any advice? thanks in advance.
