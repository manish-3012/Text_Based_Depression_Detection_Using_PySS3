My life is pointlessI can't get a job due to mental illness and physical illness, I live in an abusive household that I can't escape, I have no friends or anyone to turn to. I don't have the energy for anything anymore. I pass out multiple times a day because I'm so damn exhausted and no one even cares. My own partner even told me to get over it, like it's something I can just...stop. I just wanna give up, I'm so tired of fighting this losing fight. I know I have no future like everyone else so what's the point in fighting? I'm worthless and can't do anything right. The right thing I can do would be killing myself because then everyone would be happier.
