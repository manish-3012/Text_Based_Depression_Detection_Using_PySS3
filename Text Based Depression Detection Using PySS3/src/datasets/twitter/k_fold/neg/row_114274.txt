I'm currently ruining my own birthday by being downI'm just out of energy and one of friends is screaming at me because I'm not really taking part in what they do. Mostly because he os drunk probably but it probably is deserved. When I am not there nobody cares. I really don't know what to write about this. I just feel awful and ruin even more of my social life.

I really want to take my life but I am too much of a pussy and this didn't really help this feeling.
