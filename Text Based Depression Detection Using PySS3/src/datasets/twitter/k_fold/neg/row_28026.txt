mentally drainedposted this yesterday: [https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g6u12q/just\_lost\_a\_friend\_because\_of\_how\_i\_am\_doing/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/g6u12q/just_lost_a_friend_because_of_how_i_am_doing/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)   
someone i knew broke the contact between us because he couldn't deal with it anymore.  


needed to write some stuff off my mind again.  


to be honest, i feel like absolute shit. i feel like a horrible and worthless person. i can't even keep one person in my life. i called the nurse around 1 pm today, crying and told her what had happened. i wasn't prepared at all he would do this. i understand him but still. it was out of the blue. it's not his fault but when i had just arrived to the psychiatric hospital he wrote on Snapchat that he couldn't deal with it anymore. felt like bad timing. i got angry towards myself, went to the bathroom and did some stuff.   


i've had some issues with crying for a while now. guessing because i feel numb. i either feel everything or nothing. (borderline.) somehow cried when calling the nurse. been crying on and off since. i feel so fucking horrible and terrible. i knew i shouldn't had said too much or been too opened with this friend, but i trusted him. i feel sorry for him. had to deal with such a horrible and depressed person as me. i know it can be very weightdowned(?) for other people and i know how it feels. i've been in both situations. when you're the one being depressed and being the one trying to help.   


i have chronic suicidal thoughts. borderline personality disorder. two other things i don't know how to translate from swedish to english, sorry!   
i talk to a nurse once a week. there are two women from the community that comes twice a week and we take walks.   
i'm suppose to follow a schedule the psychiatric hospital gave me when i was there 17th. i can't really do it for some reason. no energy and it feel pointless, because it's not helping. it suppose to make time go and try to distract these thoughts i have. but they don't understand that it doesn't help. that nothing helps or distracts.   
now i'm getting extremely mentally drained and this thing happened with my friend didn't help either and it feels like it's all my fault. now i feel like that i shouldn't be opened to anyone anymore as much. i do feel like a horrible person and friend. it just hurts other people or worry them and i'm not about that. i never want to hurt anyone on purpose, it hurts inside you and inside your heart.   


i don't know what to do anymore. tired of these thoughts that never goes away. i'm trying and trying and trying. i'm not sure if i'll be able to handle it for much longer.
