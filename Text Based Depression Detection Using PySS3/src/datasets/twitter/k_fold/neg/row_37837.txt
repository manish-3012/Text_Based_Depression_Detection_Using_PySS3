Existential Panic &amp; Self HarmI am a worthless and irredeemable failure. Everyday is another failure. I am an unemployed, uneducated, and immature 28y/o dependent. The guilt, shame, and despair I feel in regards to my self is overwhelming. I have recurrent major depression and general anxiety disorder as well as gender and body image issues. 
I have been considering escalating my self harm to mutilation or suicide.
