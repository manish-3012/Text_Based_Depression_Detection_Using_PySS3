Not getting any betterI really believe some people were born just to have shitty lives. Thereâ€™s people who are happy all their life, people who came from nothing or had shitty childhoods then their lives get turned around. Then thereâ€™s people like me who just live a shitty life full stop. I didnâ€™t have a great child hood, Iâ€™m 23 now but still every day is a new issue. I think when you have depression to some degree you want validation and for people to care, I know I wouldnâ€™t feel as bad as I do if I had people who cared. After people show you they donâ€™t care you go from wanting the attention to just wanting to die. Iâ€™ve had limited good things happen in my life and each of those things were ruined. I also think thereâ€™s 2 sides to suicide- wanting to die and needing to die. Iâ€™m at the needing stage where the only thing holding me back is the pain from it and if someone was to find me before I was fully dead and end up with brain damage and alive.
