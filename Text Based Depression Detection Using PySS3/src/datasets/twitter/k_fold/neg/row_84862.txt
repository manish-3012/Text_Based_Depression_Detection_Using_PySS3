I want to die over school.It sounds stupid. Because Iâ€™m 14. This is probably going to be all over the place. Here we go. Starting this year I think Iâ€™ve been crying at night and mornings about not going to school and trying to get out of it. Sometimes it works. Sometimes I get in trouble. Iâ€™ve been so unmotivated for everything. I hate that school with all my heart. The people are trash, the teachers are trash, the environment is trash. Iâ€™ve been telling my parents that I hate it and they just get more annoyed with it every time I say something. I even worked up the courage to actually tell my mom I wanted to kill myself. She was very nice about it, but it was forgotten about it the next day. My mom also suggested me talking to someone, but never went through with it. I have school tomorrow morning and I hate knowing I canâ€™t do anything. Iâ€™m not getting bullied or anything like that. I donâ€™t know why I started feeling like this. I feel like I only have two options. 1. Suffering each and every day until it is over and keeping everyone else happy. 2. Killing myself, but hurting others. I have absolutely no one to talk to. I tried the crisis text line, but it only worked for a bit. My â€œfriendsâ€ are so surprised when Iâ€™m mad or sad like the only emotion I can express is happiness around them. Iâ€™m also sick of hearing school will be over soon or that I canâ€™t do anything because itâ€™s something everyone has to do. I hate feeling powerless and hopeless. Iâ€™m just hoping somebody who has felt what I feel can give me some encouraging advice.
