I feel like this weekend Iâ€™m gonna just end it allIâ€™ve been sad for a long time almost 3 years and things kind of seem pointless 
My girlfriend recently just been treating poorly my friends have all
Moved away or donâ€™t like me anymore and thereâ€™s a bridge by my house and I think this weekend Iâ€™ll jump off and see my girlfriend one last time tomorrow and I think thatâ€™s the deciding factor
