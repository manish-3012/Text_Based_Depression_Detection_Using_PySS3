If I have to return to school, I can't guarantee I'm going to stay alive.I'm in year 10, but currently not doing school. I've done homeschool since the start of last year, and before that, 'normal' school.

I have severe depression and anxiety and an array of issues, yada yada. Basically, if I drop out now and don't return to school, apparently I'm going to have a shitty time finding a job in the future. I'm already trying to find work, desperately. So I can move out (home problems). I honestly wouldn't mind living outside of home but with very little food. I would still rather that than living here. I've been suicidal for 2 and a half years, but surprisingly, I've never fully gone through with it. But I can't promise that I won't if I have to go back to school again. I'm trying to pick up my life and move on, the last thing I want is to go back to the place that put me in this state. I don't mean the same school, just school in general.

I have problems sleeping. There's no way I'd be able get full nights sleeps before school. It'd be more realistic to stay awake all night, stay awake at school, and then sleep that night. Ohh boy the thought of doing two more years of school. Haha, no fucking thanks.

Anyway, what do I do? I live in Australia.
