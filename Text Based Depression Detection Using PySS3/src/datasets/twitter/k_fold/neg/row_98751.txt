Scared and aloneStruggling big again. I have gone to my parents. I am going to tell them for the first time. I am terrified and anxious. Not sure how they will take t. And what I will do to myself if they donâ€™t understand or take it badly. It maybe the day. I hope this works. If not I hope someone is around to talk when I need them.
