I can't see myself as an adultIt's like 5 am right now, sorry if this sounds like a confusing ass long ramble and is hard to read, I just need to get stuff out I guess.

My entire life has been nothing but shit, I can't think of one good memory that can stand out from the bad. Everytime I try to picture my future self, it's always bad. I'm constantly told the exact same shit of "you can do anything you want to" by people who just don't fucking get it. I'm constantly told that people understand me as if they know anything about me or what's in my damn head.
I'm overall a disgusting person, I'm afraid to even be around most people because of who I am. I try to talk about this shit sometimes but I just get the "you're a teenager" line before I even explain what's going on. Nobody gives a shit or takes me seriously and I've decided to come to terms with that fact today. 
I'm a part of a DID system, diagnosed even, and my own family makes jokes about me "role-playing" or they ask shit like "who's the evil personality?" Or whatever the fuck else. It's kinda funny when I see that an alter has a better social life than me, and I'm the damn host. I've thought about going dormant but I don't know.
Life just doesn't seem like it'll have a good outcome for me so I'm thinking I'll go for my 7th attempt and hope it actually fuckin works, my solid plan is I will be dead at 18 no matter what. 
I just wanna go back to sleep. 
I'm sorry.
