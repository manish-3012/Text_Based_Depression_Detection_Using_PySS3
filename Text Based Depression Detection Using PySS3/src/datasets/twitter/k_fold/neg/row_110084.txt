I feel useless and Iâ€™m contemplating suicideI feel like I might just be rambling and I have no reason to be making a post like this. 
Iâ€™ve attempted suicide once before in the past but Iâ€™ve been in therapy and working on myself since then. 
The therapy has been working, without a doubt, my depression doesnâ€™t feel so crippling like it did when I was in high school or early adulthood which makes me feel even guiltiest about feeling like this. 
I feel like I donâ€™t have a purpose in life, I feel really mediocre at everything that I do even if I put the maximum amount of effort into it and itâ€™s like Iâ€™m just disappointing my family and the people I care about by wandering aimlessly. 
In all honesty, suicide feels like the best option for me. And that sucks. I donâ€™t feel the urgent need to do so but thinking about the outcome makes me feel better than thinking about how useless and lost I feel on a day to day basis.
