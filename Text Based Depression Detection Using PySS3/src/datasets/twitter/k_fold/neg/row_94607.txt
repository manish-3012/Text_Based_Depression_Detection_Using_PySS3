Going to do it today.So, I have made the decisions to kill myself today. I cannot be saved by God. He lost patience with me. I learned that everythingâ€™s was a lie, and that the truth, the truth could not even transform me, in minutes, in weeks, in years. I am ready. I have no purpose on this earth anymore. I wish I was never born. Bye, and Iâ€™m sorry.
