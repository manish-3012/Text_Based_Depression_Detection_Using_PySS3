It's been a really hard year for me so far.I have history of self harm, I've been suffering from bipolar disorder, I lost my grandfather to hepatocellular carcinoma amidst covid time, I grew up in his house, my parents weren't really around; my boyfriend and I broke up, we were together for 3 years, had to move cities because we lived together and I couldn't be there anymore, I finished my MBBS this year, I'm preparing for my pg entrance, but because of all this I have lost a lot of time, as exam draws closer and I feel more and more miserable, one of those nights where I couldn't think of anything else but to end this, I wrote this poem, 
I fight everynight
It all starts okay, getting ready to sleep, laying down in bed, 
I close my eyes and here they are, ready to devour my peace
My very own demons,
I fight everynight...

Stay in the dark long enough, and you start seeing things,
Believing in them, 
Somewhere deep down I know it's not true, 
It can't be, but what can I do?
I see them, right in front me, ready for a bite.
I fight them. Yes, I fight everynight.

Lay there silently,. wondering if all of this is worth it?
If I should just surrender to them
Wouldn't that be easier?
I don't want to let this thought consume me..So..
I fight... everynight

If I could give in into this, just for a second
Rest my eyes; breathe...
Breathe till it all goes away...
Drift away into the dark with them..
Just be passive, let it happen, 
I think, wouldn't that be quicker?
I fight everynight...

Has it ever happened to you? You're scared of falling asleep..
Scared of your own dreams..
Scared of what lies beyond..
Scared of where it ends...
I am.
It's just a dream they say, it happens
I fight that very dream everynight
I fight....
