I donâ€™t want to end my life, I want to end my painI want to feel happy. I want to smile an actual smile, not a fake one. I want to laugh so hard my stomach hurts. I want to feel again. 
Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way. Tired of wanting to die. Just tired. 

But Iâ€™m so lost. Iâ€™m in this dark pit with no way out. Iâ€™m running out of air. I canâ€™t breathe. My heart aches. My head hurts. Everything hurts. 
I just want it all to stop.
