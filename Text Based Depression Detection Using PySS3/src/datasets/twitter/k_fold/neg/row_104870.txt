I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be alive until the end of this monthThe thing is: Iâ€™ve been suicidal since my teen years, however, it was always manageable.

I mean, whenever I had thoughts of killing myself, Iâ€™d make myself sleep and â€œforget about itâ€, you know?

Last year was different tho, I stopped eating for a while, then I started to solve all my financial problems and donate clothes and books I had around. I truly had a plan. I donâ€™t even know why I didnâ€™t do it.

Since New Yearâ€™s Eve I donâ€™t leave my house, I have no energy to get out of bed and I feel like it wouldnâ€™t matter if Iâ€™m alive or dead at this point. I mean, Iâ€™m in this house for 22 days now and no one noticed.

None of my friends came up to me and asked me how I was, none of my family reached out either. I feel like my existence is nothing. The only time they notice Iâ€™m alive is when they need something.

Money, favors... The only time I spoke to my sister this month was when she called me because she needed money. She didnâ€™t ask how I was.

I tried to call my countryâ€™s suicide watch line, however they have a HUGE waiting line. I also tried this last year and I was also frustrated.

Yesterday I mad a list of pros and cons of saying alive and I have never had gotten to this point.

To be very honest, I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing all of this. Sometimes I feel like this 28 years Iâ€™ve been living is a wasted time.

I came here, I failed to reach every single goal I made for myself, I failed to make any meaningful connection to anyone and now Iâ€™m here.

Why am I here? What is the purpose of this?

I mean, my organs are healthy. Many people who want to live and would live a better, more loveful and meaningful life are expecting to get a transplant so why the hell am I still here?

I donâ€™t know what to do.
