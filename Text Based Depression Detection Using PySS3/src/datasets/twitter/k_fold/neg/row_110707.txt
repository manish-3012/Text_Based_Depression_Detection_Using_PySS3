My parents call me an embarrassment to their family.I am an 18 year old fat girl. And my parents hate me. They call me an embarrassment.  They never take me with them to anywhere..because I bring shame to the family. They don't care what I feel..how hurt I am. They call me Worthless, ugly, fat, embarrassment, useless, talentless, hopeless, shame. They treat me worst than anyone. They never introduce me to their friends.. or never take me to the relatives with themselves ..because I am a shame and disgrace to the family. They torture me mentally. Calls me names which hurts. My heart aches everytime they abuse me. My body shivers every time they beat me. They never let me do what I want. They just order me. Evey single minute I get abused. They call me a load on their heads and that I should never have been borned. I have got 0 respects.  I am a 2nd ranker in studies but still they call  me a failure. Because of them.. even my younger brother treats me like this..doesn't respect me. He does nothing.. he fails in every subject.. still he gets more respect and lavish life than me. PERKS OF BEING AN UNPLANNED CHILD I GUESS. OR IT IS JUST TO ME? listening to them calling me names  since the time I could understand and speak.. it's enough.. I just cant take it anymore. I have no motivation confidence anything left in me just my fatness. I cant even share my feelings how hurt I am to anyone because I have no friends.. because no one wants a fat girl in their good looking slim group. When a person is loner and has no friends..he has his family.. When someone does not has a good family..has good friends but guess what I have none. No friends no family. No friends love no family love and support. I now really hope that I shouldn't have been borned. I should just die I think..atleast my family would be much more happier and the world would be much more happier if I am not alive Any more if I don't live anymore. As it is I have not received love till now and will never receive for sure..lost all faith in love and my life. I have tried loossing weight ..I have tried all ways..but they just demotivate me in that too..THATS why I have never been successful in loosing weight. I have no one to share my feelings with and I got to know about this site.. so I thought I should share some of my hurtful feelings. I feel 1% better sharing here but the rest 99% of my feelings are hurt as usual. Really not here to earn sympathy but to feel a lil good after sharing my hurt.
