Iâ€™ve always knownIâ€™ve always know how my life will end, some people are born to be painters some basketball players but Iâ€™ve seem to be born to commit suicide, every day I think about it and everyday I ponder when it will happen. Iâ€™m only posting this because Iâ€™ve found peace in this world and just await the day my dad dies. He is the only person who I truly care about. This Isnâ€™t something to be sad about it, but rather ceremony  in that Iâ€™ve found something that is truly mine.
