I see no reason to continue my lifeI've lived 30 years in suffering with no daylight in sight.

I was tasked with the impossible at work, everyday, and work until every muscle protested in pain. While those whom give the task sits comfortably at their air-conditioned office.

At home living with my elderly parents, I have no privacy, no personal space.

I have no one to tell my pain. I was raised to shut the fuck up.

I have no girlfriend and no sex experience.

My dice rolls playing at anything sucks worst.

Why am I living?

I don't know why I even bother to post here.
