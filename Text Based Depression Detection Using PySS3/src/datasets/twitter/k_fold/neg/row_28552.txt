ocd strugglesMy OCD has gotten bad again. Constant disturbing and disgusting intrusive thoughts of the sexual kind. Thereâ€™s never any peace, even when I sleep. I had such a triggering dream tonight. My biggest relief in life is that itâ€™ll all end someday. Thereâ€™s just to much guilt and shame and disgust and fear, all the damn time. 

Iâ€™m moving to a new city and starting a new chapter in my life next month. Iâ€™m just holding on until then and hoping a change of scenery will improve. If not, I can always die.
