FUCK ITI have google "i want to die", "i'm lonely and want to die", "I'm never getting laid and i want to kill myself ", and "I'm killing myself slowly" and every single time i get a suicide hotline. I scroll the pages but never find something that helps. I hate the word(s) "hopeful" "reasons to live" or "you should get help". Just hearing of those words or someone giving me advice to get the help i need or i should be on medication "because it helps. Its boils my blood to the point where im too angry and now i want to destroy something but im too much of a pussy to do anything. I feel like a constant limbo of anger and depression. But can't do anything. Anyone else?
