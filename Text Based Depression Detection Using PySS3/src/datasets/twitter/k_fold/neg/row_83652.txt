Fall semester starts next weekI still haven't told my parents that I dropped out in the spring, and I don't plan on enrolling again. When i dropped out of hs a few years prior that was the first time ive ever seen my father cry. I just don't want to keep disappointing them over and over again. I've barely left the house all summer and I stayed home during much of the spring, occasionally visiting the library during my class times so they wouldn't start questioning things. I dont want to keep giving them false hope for a future for myself that is pretty much nonexistant. Next week I'm going to get up and pretend to get dressed for school again and I hope its the very last time I ever leave my house again.
