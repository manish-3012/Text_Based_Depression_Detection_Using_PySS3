I miss her so muchI lost my wife to cancer 2 years, 3 months, and 21 days ago. I was a widower before I turned 30. She had brain cancer and it destroyed her ability to communicate and was a slow way to go. We were married for 2 years and 7 months, she battled cancer for 2 years, 6 months and 3 weeks of that marriage. I took care of her the entire time but I felt so alone since she couldn't really communicate with me. 

I just can't get the thought of suicide out of my head. I've already written notes to family and friends. I see a therapist twice a month but I just can't stop missing her. I feel so alone and it hurts so much with out her. I'm afraid it will never stop hurting like this and it's getting so bad. I just want to it to stop. I'm not ready to do it yet but it's starting to seem like the only option I have left.
