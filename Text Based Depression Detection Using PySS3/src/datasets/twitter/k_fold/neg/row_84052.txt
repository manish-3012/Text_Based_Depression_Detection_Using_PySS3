I canâ€™t cope with thisHow am I meant to deal with this?

How am I meant to have a normal life? I canâ€™t hold down a 9-5 job if the idea of an interview has me planning ways of killing myself to get out of it.

Like. My brain just goes to suicide as a way to get out of doing things I donâ€™t want to do. Itâ€™s violent and itâ€™s graphic and it scares me. I donâ€™t want it in my head. But the temptation is so fucking strong and Iâ€™m sick of fighting if. I know Iâ€™m not going to be able to cope with this world. I hate myself for being so pathetic. I hate myself for being so annoying. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do to stop it Iâ€™m just a burden on everyone and I get so excited over stupid creative things that no one gives a shit about and I annoy everyone I talk to. Iâ€™m a fat disgusting blob who canâ€™t stop eating and I should probably kill myself before I put on any more weight lol. Itâ€™s just the longer I let this drag on the more I feel like I canâ€™t do this.

Itâ€™s no one elseâ€™s job to fucking babysit me. Iâ€™m responsible for my own actions.

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to be able to live without this whooshing anxiety in my ears.

This world is not a kind place.

I canâ€™t stand it.
