The scariest posts here are the ones that don't respondI've been debating posting here off and on for three months now. 
I don't know if it's paranoia. or depression. or anxiety. but I just gave up. It just hit me like a load of bricks a few hours ago. I just give up. I don't want to do this. I know it's selfish. I know it's going to hurt people. but I just can't do it anymore. 

disregard the rest. it's a deadman's switch. so don't get all conspiracy on it.
