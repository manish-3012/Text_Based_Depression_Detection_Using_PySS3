My mom and I just told each other we have been considering suicide the past week.My parents have been divorced for 21 years.  My dad has always been an emotional bully.  He never hit us or physically hurt us, but since I was three he has been telling me that I'll never see my mom again.  In the divorce papers, he agreed to Child and Spousal support.  He is now threatening to take away my mom's support and cut me off as well.  He mentioned this to her 3 weeks ago and me last week.  We have both tried to communicate with him, but instead, he has decided not to respond and to keep us waiting.  This is causing intense stress on both of us.  

This sort of stuff has been happening for 21 years.  We're both run down.  We spend our nights in tears and don't sleep. I had a brother (not my mom's son) commit suicide a little over a year ago.  Today, I told her that I am "considering going the way of [my brother]".  She told me that she as also considered it.  As hard as it is to know I've considered suicide, it is even harder to know that my mom has thought about it.  She is my rock, I could not live in a world where she was dead.

I don't know why I'm posting this.  To get it out I guess... for advice, if you have it?
