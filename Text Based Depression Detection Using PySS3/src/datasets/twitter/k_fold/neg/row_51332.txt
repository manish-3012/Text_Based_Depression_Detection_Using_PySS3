It never gets better. Killing myself in February ðŸ˜ŠIt never gets better.
I was back tracking on my suicide date in February because I knew other people in my life weren't moving fast enough.
Well too fucking bad.
I'm sorry for the trauma I'm about to cause.
But there is no healing &amp; peace for us.
I want just 1 thing to go well.

If only my suicide.
