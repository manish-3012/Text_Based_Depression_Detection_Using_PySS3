I think I'mjust going to sleepI can't do this anymore, I'm crying so hard it hurts, it all just hurts all the time. I ruin everything for everyone around me, my friends probably don't even want to be my friends. My family sees me as a burden, my life is going nowhere, there is no point in sticking around any longer. The medication I'm on isn't working, even after adjusting the dosage, nothing is helping, it just gets more painful. I can't breathe anymore
