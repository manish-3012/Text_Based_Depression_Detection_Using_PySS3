Raised by schizophrenic father. Now i'm 23 years old male and suicidal.Hello everyone. Please read and give me advice because i feel stuck and i don't want to kill myself.

My father has paranoid schizophrenia and his parenting was REALLY bad. He beat me almost every week over nothing, didn't care about my opinions at all and yelled me when i said anything. Getting beaten because of saying my opinions killed my confidence. I became one of those quiet guys.

My mother didn't do any parenting too besides cooking and cleaning the house. They didn't teach me anything. I learned all the things from tv, school and internet. The only thing they teached me was " study school".

They have zero hobbies and zero friends. We never went to a vacation. We never visited someone or people visiting us. I never saw another city in my life other than the city i borned. Because of this things i didn't know to do anything beside study. I never knew what "social" was. When i was in high school i got bullied because of my ugliness and made zero friends. In college for 4 years i didn't talk to anyone and again made zero friends.

I don't know how to be "human". Damn writing this made me cry so much. I don't know how to connect with people. I don't know where to start. I feel like i'm done. I feel i will never overcame this shitty situation. I have zero friends and i never had a relationship with a girl. I'm really ugly too. I feel so unlovable. I just bought a gun yesterday. Like for 5 years i'm thinking about suicide almost everyday. I really hate my parents. Wish i had another family.
