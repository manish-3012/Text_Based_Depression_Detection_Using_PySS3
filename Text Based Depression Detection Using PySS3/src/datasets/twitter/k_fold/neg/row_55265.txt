I don't want to die but my brain keeps telling me toEvery time I'm alone after a little bit I'll have these thoughts telling me to kill myself and that I'm not worth it, but I dont want to die and I hate admit it but I've started listening. I've started hurting myself (I have to post this off my phone because I smashed my keyboard on my head). I'm not happy and I hate myself but I dont wanna die I dont know what to do
