Every time I try to turn around on an issue, it always, for someway, bites me in the ass.For real It seriously feels like I'm not to be loved, what the fuck did I do wrong? What in gods name do people have against me? I won't be surprised if I see people not giving less of a shit about me here in this subreddit because I am just THAT worthless.
