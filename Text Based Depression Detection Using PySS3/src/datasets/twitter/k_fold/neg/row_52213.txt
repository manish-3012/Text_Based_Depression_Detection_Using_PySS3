Marking things off my listI finally decided on how I'm going to go. Now I just have to wait until the dust settles and I'll be clear for take off. Things have only gotten worse and now all I feel is numbness, and I crave to feel something. I'm ready. I would go right now, but I have to wait for something. After it happens... I am so gone.
