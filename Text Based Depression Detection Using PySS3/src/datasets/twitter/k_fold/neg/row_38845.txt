I feel petty because I already lost hopeI want help, I do... but I feel horrible because I feel like it wonâ€™t work. I feel like no matter what Iâ€™ll still feel like killing myself. I already forced my mom to try and get a doctor to help... I already have councilors but I feel like Iâ€™m wasting everyoneâ€™s time by existing. I feel like even my parents donâ€™t care about me living. My mom already shows signs of irritation when I ask her to call the doctor for me and my family mock me about needing help. I just donâ€™t want to live anymore and not even my boyfriend is helping. I donâ€™t blame any of them I am a nuisance... I feel like... I just donâ€™t want to get better... I donâ€™t want to seek help. I just want to curl up and die a young disgusting husk and watch other people love their life happier knowing Iâ€™m gone.
