Thinking of killing myself over medical debtI am basically being punished for being mentally ill. I was involuntary hospitalized twice during the past 3 months and the bills came out to be $9000. WTF? I canâ€™t afford to pay that. Is death the only option?

Also, Iâ€™m a broke and poor college student. I do have Medicaid but itâ€™s my secondary insurance. My primary insurance is blue cross blue shield.
