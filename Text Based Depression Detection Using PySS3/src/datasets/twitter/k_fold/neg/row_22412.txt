I DON'T WANT TO IMPROVE MY LIFE.I'm sick of it. I never got my driver's license, I never got a job, I never have any money. What's the point of living if I can't get a job? Why the fuck should I not just kill myself right now. 'Oh things will get better' you say? No they won't. My life has literally only gone downhill. I'm only 18 but I can tell you now that nothing in my life will improve. I don't want to spend any more time looking for jobs that instantly reject me. A driver's license costs thousands to even get. I'm not going out and begging on the streets. I'm just going to fucking kill myself as soon as I possibly can. I'm done. Fuck this world and fuck being as poor as I am. Nobody seems to understand that no matter how much they think things will get better for me, even if they did. It's not worth what's going on right now. I'll come back in half an hour to check the replies on this. I want convincing. I really do, but I can't find a single reason to live. Don't bring up family or friends. My family is the reason I am poor because their shitty spending habits. They spend literally hundreds per fortnight on cigarettes, all of my friends have jobs. So I don't want to hear them brought up, they don't change anything.
