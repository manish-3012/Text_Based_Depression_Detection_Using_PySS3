I wanted another child and so much more in lifeI have  2 kids with my ex. She wanted another one  ididnt for the longest time but as time went on my clock started ticking. Now a year since has past since she has left and I still want another child but I dot want multiple baby mommas. I dont wamy kids having half brothers and sisters. I wanted them to have a normal life with a normal mom and dad living together. That dream is shattered. My life is shattered. I am crying as I type this. Every night I feel like I am getting closer to finally getting the ablity to ignore fear and end my own life.I hurt mentally physically and emotionally. My right lower leg has been hurting for weeks. To the point where I lay on the couch crying. My heart hurts so much from her hurting me so bad I think I maybe having miniature heart attacks. I hope every day I have a heart attack. I wont call 911. My feelings are in the trash.  I try to meet other women and force myself to like someone else but its not real. I wish she would talk to me. But she wont. I hate my life and what she has done to it. Every day I slip closer into ending my life.  I want to end it.  I keep thinking about committing a crime just to be killed by a cop.  I dont want to be on this Earth anymore. Sad part is the thought of dying makes me happy. I will finally get to be happy. I think about the times I skirted death and wonder why. Survived the ramstein airshow crash,  caught myself falling off a cliff while checking out Castles in Germany, barely missing car wrecks.. why? SO I can live my life in such pain. I dont want to live in pain. I want happiness.  I am watching smaillville as I type this. Watching marriage and couples scripted TV of course.. Id kill for a fake relationship with her. I dont and I cant be with anyone else. Its not right. Ill die alone. Ill die without my true and only love. I will die thinking about her.
