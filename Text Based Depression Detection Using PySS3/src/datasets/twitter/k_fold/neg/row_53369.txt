No one would miss meIâ€™m thinking about my life and my relationships and theyâ€™ve always been one sided. Iâ€™ve always loved harder and cared more. Iâ€™m thinking about my ex who took and took and abused me. My mom, who never took my pain seriously and denied that my depression was real for years. I canâ€™t actually have a functioning relationship or even just a fucking moment of peace. The meds donâ€™t work, therapy hurts.  I donâ€™t want to be here
