I donâ€™t really feel anything. I just want to die.I canâ€™t do anything I need to do and I think itâ€™s more practical to give my body back to the earth than to live on hurting it more and fighting off the inevitability of death. I crack smiles and I participate in meaningless conversations with my parents and people at school but itâ€™s not me itâ€™s just the shell of the human Iâ€™m keeping alive when the actual person inside me wants to die. I cried when I first considered seriously killing myself again but I cried for maybe 30 seconds and then I went numb and now Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™ve already attempted to take my life once. In the year following i has motivation to live. I had emotions that made me feel warm and strong and now itâ€™s all gone and I just feel like a void. Iâ€™m losing weight because I have no desire to eat and no motivation to get help from family or friends or medical professionals. I donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™d bother to kill myself because Iâ€™m in such an apathetic state.
