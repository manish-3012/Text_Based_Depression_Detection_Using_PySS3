Iâ€™ve realized the only reason Iâ€™m still alive is the hope I will be a mother and wife...but even those arenâ€™t promisedIâ€™m very young but watching everyone else fall in love and babies being born around me is just torture. I wish I could skip it all and have the life I want to live... but honestly that life isnâ€™t something I can make, I could easily have miscarriages or be infertile or take forever to find love and be too old to carry children. I donâ€™t want to adopt, I want my own, I want to carry them. Just a little vent, I wonder if any of you feel similarly.
