I wish someone would kill me or that I had a deadly diseaseAll Iâ€™ve done for the past two weeks is cry multiple times a day and try to keep a straight face at work. Iâ€™m 17 years old, and a trans man. My mom is COMPLETELY unsupportive and has suspicions that I am trans, she tore a bandage I was binding with off of my body and told me that if I ever binded again I would never be able to see my best friend (heâ€™s trans and my only strong support). My dad doesnâ€™t support anything LGBTQ+ because heâ€™s â€œold schoolâ€ and calls trans kids â€œthe new punk who are just rebelling to their parentsâ€. Neither of them support me getting mental health help despite them birth having mental illnesses (my dad literally takes pills, my mom refuses to admit her issues). My mom is narcissistic as well, and verbally abusive (â€œyouâ€™re fat, ugly, why are you trying to be a boy, etc.). I have expressed to my mom that I was suicidal (not that I still am), however she refused to get me help. I told her I was still depressed, she told me that I was just trying to be like my friends (some of which have depression). This is especially ridiculous because Iâ€™ve been suicidal for way before I met any of them. Anyways, I just want to die. Every single damn time I see myself in the mirror I feel like puking. I took my mirror down, but now I canâ€™t stop looking down at my breasts and crying in response. I hate my body so much that it affects every single aspect of my life. I canâ€™t sleep, eat, or even socialize properly because all I can do is think about how much I wish I was born male or not at all. I just wish someone or something besides myself would kill me so my few friends wouldnâ€™t be too devastated.
