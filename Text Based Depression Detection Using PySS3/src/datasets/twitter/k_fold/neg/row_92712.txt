Losing the battleI'm losing the battle to depression. I can't take it anymore.

I have no friends. People hate me, make fun of me, gossip about me, celebrate the fact that I'm no longer in their life. I have no real skills or talents, and no one respects me. I don't have value. I don't have a purpose. I have no future.

I want to end it. I have to end it. It just isn't worth it anymore.
