HelpI canâ€™t function. I am out of work for my mental health and yesterday I was told a coworker killed himself. He was such a smart and amazing guy. I am struggling to understand why I am here and he isnâ€™t. Itâ€™s not fair. I feel so guilty. I didnâ€™t help him. I had to distance myself to keep myself on the right track. I feel so selfish and undeserving of life. Nothing matters anymore. Nothing. I canâ€™t see a point to holding on. I canâ€™t. I think I need to be done here
