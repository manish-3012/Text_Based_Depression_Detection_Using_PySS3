should i kill my self? what other option do i have?the search for mental health care is doing nothing but driving me deeper into depression. i hate having to ask my mom for rides to therapy or asking her to call a new list of psychiatrists i found that take our insurance. 

even so, i failed her because i donâ€™t succeed like other kids do. a mix of depression, anxiety, and an eating disorder is causing me to skip school and cry while doing homework. i torment myself by looking at things from her perspective. she works tirelessly to feed her kid. but what if that kid isnâ€™t worth feeding? what if they have an equal amount of worth buried in the ground? 

the truth is, i want to be alive. iâ€™ve went though every reason not to die, but none of them apply to me. i would be less of a burden, emotionally and financially, to mom if i were dead. i have no friends who will miss me. i have enough money in my bank account for a decent funeral. my method would be harmless to anyone else. 

please give me a reason to continue.
