Yay. I don't feel anythingEveryone keeps reminding me that school is my life and I should be studying 

I wish I lived somewhere else. I'd even be fine with the US. My country's shit system is gonna kill me

I'm lacking in everything. I only have 2 years to get better. 

My dad called me lazy. He said that I won't be anything if I keep sleeping all evening.

Blah blah blah. Does it even matter.

My parents don't care. I don't think they even know mental illnesses exist. I don't give a shit about them tbh

There's so much to talk about. So many things I repeat to myself every fucking day. 

I want to die but I'm lazy. I don't have the balls to try it and then not die. God that would be a fucking disaster 

Fuck my life
I have nothing 
I can't eat
I don't feel physical pain lol
Haha
