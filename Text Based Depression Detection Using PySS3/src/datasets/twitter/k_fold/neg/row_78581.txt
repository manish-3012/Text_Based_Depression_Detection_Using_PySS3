I feel empty almost all the timeI've had suicidal thoughts for most of my life. When I was a kid I didn't have any friends because I was a nerd, and back then I thought I wouldn't last long enough to go into a career because I'd end it before that happened.

About three years ago, I became an atheist and a skeptic, and a few months ago my spiral of skepticism finally ended on existential and moral nihilism. Even before I gave up on religion, though, I felt empty inside. I've never really had a passion or a cause to live for. It all just feels like suffering and struggling against life and all its pain for no reason at all.

About two years ago I had a great relationship that I've never gotten over. A mutual friend convinced her that I had been seeing someone else (false), and when I hit rock bottom a few weeks ago and contacted her again, she still believed him. I keep obsessing over having a relationship. But I'm an atheist in a massively religious area, and even in my intellectual circles most people have values and morals that seem completely irrational to me, so finding someone I can respect enough to fall in love with is very difficult.

I get bored all the time, and lose interest in my favorite shows and games, and everything seems worthless. Ultimately happiness isn't really attainable; everything has to be a means to a goal, and there doesn't seem to be any goal I can strive for. It'd all just be swept away by time. I feel trapped in my loneliness and boredom.

It's just gotten to the point where I don't believe in much of anything and don't really care. Nowadays I have suicidal thoughts almost every day, and I'm constantly pondering what I'd write in the note and who would even care. It wouldn't matter much if I disappeared.
