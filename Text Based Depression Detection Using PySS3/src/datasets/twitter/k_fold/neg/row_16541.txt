All I can think about is how little I want to be hereI would love to log out of life right now.


I don't think I'll kill myself, but I'm not thinking straight. I'm just tired honestly. I'm tired of being alone, living in an abusive situation, having no family or friends, feeling like a failure.


It's cathartic to think about hurting myself for some reason. It feels like everyone I've ever met treats me like I'm a different kind of human. Maybe it's all in my head. Maybe it's my mannerisms. I've never known how to interact around others. I'm tired of thinking about it.

I think everybody ends up hating me in the end. I would do anything to be somebody else. I want to kill myself, and wake up as another person, healthy and with lots of energy, ready to tackle the world. I want to separate from everything that I am. This hell that I am in.


Every time somebody insults me or looks at me weird I wish I could contort into somethimg else. Maybe tree, a bird. People were nice when I was a kid, I miss that. I want to make it stop. I want to be treated like everyone else for once in my life. What did I do to never deserve any kind of love. 

Im going to try to sleep, but a big part of me doesn't want to wake up tomorrow
