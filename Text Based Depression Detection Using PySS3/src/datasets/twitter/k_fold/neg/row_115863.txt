My life is awful and I don't know how to cope. I am 22 and I dropped out of college and moved back in with my parents last year. I hate living with my parents because they are very stressed (a lot of this is because of how my life is going). I just feel like a burden and I feel guilty. I feel like the only honorable thing to do is to kill myself. I am just so tired all the time and my living environment is so negative. Everyone tries to help but words are just so meaningless and have been for so long. Platitudes and cliches just make me angry now..idk I just want to feel better now or die nothing else is acceptable to me.
