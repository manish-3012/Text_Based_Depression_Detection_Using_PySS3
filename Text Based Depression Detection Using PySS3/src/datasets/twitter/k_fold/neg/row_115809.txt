Happy BirthdayI just went through my first real adult breakup with a girl i went to elementary school with. Needless to say i didn't take it well. I never really knew what true honest to god heartbreak felt like until last
Thursday when she said she doesn't love me anymore. After going through the absolute worst weekend of my life surrounding myself with friends and family even strangers, nothing helped. 

I planned it all out on Tuesday. I was going to drive to the park i work at, sit at the overlook where she told me she loved me, go through old screenshots of the especially beautiful texts she used to send me when we were together, listen to "Slow it Down" by the Lumineers and shoot myself in the head. 

Todays my birthday. My mom came into the living room and gave me a beautiful card, and when i read it i started crying and hugged her tighter than i ever have in my life. I went into the kitchen and hugged my dad and my brother and tried not to break down. Im still struggling. Every day. Some are especially awful. But im still here. There are people that want me here. I can do this.
