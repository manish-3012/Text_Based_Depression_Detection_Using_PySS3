Im so closeIâ€™ve self harmed off and on for 6 years now. Itâ€™s started when I was 13 and it felt so great. Iâ€™ve been clean for a few weeks now and feeling pretty great and so proud of myself. That was until 5 minutes ago. I find myself now holding a razor and staring at me wrists like an old friend. I have no one to turn to and I just want to feel my pain leak out of my wrists until I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. No one will notice and they certainly wonâ€™t care.
