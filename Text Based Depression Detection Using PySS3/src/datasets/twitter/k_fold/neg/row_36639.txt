fk you and i fking hate you.[rant to myself]English is my second language.

fk you. lazy piece of shit. unlucky bitch. you are supposed to life like this in this hell. Bitch you were supposed to get into competitive schools even after coming to US only 2 years ago. no one gives a fuck about how hard you tried, how many times you stayed late till 4AM studying, how much you struggled with english, and how much you struggled fitting in. Fuk your feeling. You were supposed to master english in 2 year and go from not knowing how to construct a proper sentence to a level where you speak as fluently as a native speaker, and get into top schools coz your parents never let you do shit other than your schoolwork. Shame on you cunt! your cousins, and siblings are all better, smarter, and more productive than you like our parents, and relatives all say. everyone wishes bad things on you for no reason. i fucking hate you. 

i wanna just fkin hang myself. the only thing that is holding me back is my fear of failing and my brother. I cannot imagine how much it will impact him, and i cannot leave him with my shitty parents. fuck. i am stuck.
