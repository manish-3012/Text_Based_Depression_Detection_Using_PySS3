Today...a new me is bornNovember 10.....today....I attempted suicide....by cutting wrists and taking large amounts of pills 



But something really strange struck my head....
It a both happy and sad feeling....this feeling made me decide to live....even with the pain and even with the relief....if I'm destined to live .....I'll fucking live....
What's the point of anything anymore ?
So I'll fucking live....I know for sure now that it's better to fail at life than to fail at death
I'm already in so much pain...why do I cause myself more pain?....I'll fucking live until my had health will give up....until this fucked body will finally give up surviving
