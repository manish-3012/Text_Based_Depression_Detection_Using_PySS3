i need to restarti'm 19 years old , and i've been through alot since i was a little kid: abuse, rejection, depression, i used to hate myself and always thought of suicide. but when i reached 16 i wanted to restart i stopped being negative and always said that it's going to be better .it never did tho! but i was always positive because i thought that someday i will leave this country and go live somewhere were i can refresh. each day, each fight i had with my "family" each time i get bullied in school i just say it will all fade away . but now i'm certain it won't! i can't leave and i won't be able to. it's because it will cost me alot of money which i don't have and the only and fastest way to get the money is to keep studying which will cost me at least 10 years of my life (finishing college , getting a job , and collecting the money i'll need to leave) so knowing that, i'm no longer positive in fact i am more depressed and desperate and what is making it worse is that i've been sexually confused, not knowing what i really am, since i never went on a date and that in it self is the a reason to suicide since i'm in an arabic country where lgbt is a taboo. i'm now out of solutions and i'm fully aware that it won't get better. i'm no longer thinking of a way to leave since it's out of reach instead i'm thinking of a way to end.
