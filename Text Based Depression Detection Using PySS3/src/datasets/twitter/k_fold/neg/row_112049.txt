Thoughts on losing someoneThink about how many times a day you verbalize your true inner most feelings to all the people around you. Probably not that often if you're like me. Nobody just goes around saying "the world would suck with you gone!" but it sure might be nice to hear. I'm not telling you to be an optimist. I'm not saying you should be a pessimist either. Just know there are more people thinking about you than you think there are. Nature decided you were lit enough to keep around for a bit, so just accept that fact and turn it in to something useful or cool.
