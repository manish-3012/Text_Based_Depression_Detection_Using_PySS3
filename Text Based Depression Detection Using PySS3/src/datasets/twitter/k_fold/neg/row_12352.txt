I'm about to pull my eff it card.My medication hasn't been working for a little while now and I've been feeling all over the place emotionally. Couple that with me being sexually assualted 3 weeks ago and you'll get why I'm feeling helpless. Oh what's more is that since I'm pre everything transgender mtf and don't have breasts the guy who pinned me down and forced his tongue in my mouth while he was groping me he won't be charged with anything serious. If they catch him. I can't get him out of my head nor that night. Why did it happen? I want the memories to stop. I already have ptsd from sexual abuse I received growing up and now this. Fantastic. If I just go back to partying and take oxycontin and mix it with alcohol like I did last time maybe I'll die. Since I've burned almost all of my bridges I won't have someone to call 911 to rescue me this time. I should stop listening to the voices in my head before they I end up dead. Shoot if I posted this on facebook I'd get no response because I was dubbed the drama queen after my last suicide attempt. Idk what I accpect to get from this I just needed to get this out because I'm feeling bad again.
