Is Suicide Inevitable for Me?I've thought about suicide a lot, and I can't help feeling like it's inevitable for me. I've had depression since I was around 11 or 12, and I'm 21 now. I have no energy, no willpower, no desire to do anything other than sit on my ass doing nothing. I failed every one of my classes from 6th grade to 11th grade, which is when I finally dropped out.

My living space is a complete mess; there's trash and dirty clothes all over the place, and I probably haven't cleaned at all this year. I shower once every couple weeks, and leave my house maybe once or twice a year. I self harm regularly. 

The best part is, I have no reason to be depressed. I have a loving family, and while we don't have the most money, we aren't in abject poverty or anything. I've never been abused, as far as I can remember.

My depression is entirely internal. Every problem I have is my fault. The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that there's no easy way that's guaranteed to work. I wish I was never born. I'm completely devoid of hope.
