Anyone with good personal tips?For me the worst are the thoughts like "You will die anyways, sooner or later, you dont have a decision anyways."

To think that iam going to die no matter what is the worst but there are many more thoughts like this. 

The last time i was seriously thinking about suicide was like 8 years ago. And there was one good thought coming up: "You can do it now, or tomorrow or you look how things evolve and know you can always do it whenever you want."

Not really the most positive thing but it helped me get out of a hole. But now 8 years later my life didnt changed. I can pinpoint the moment i started to fall back in the hole. Was like 2 month ago. It was when i saw someone i went to Kindergarten with on Facebook. How he changed and i didnt. And now i dont know what to do anymore.
