So stupidI can't cope with being ugly. I can't enjoy films or books because I feel so different. I don't want people to see me. I'm too embarrassed about my appearance to go to school or work. I've read posts by men who feel ugly, but most replies are "it's okay, ugly guys get hot chicks all the time because looks don't even matter to them!" and it just makes me feel worse, like my existence is invalidated or something. I just don't enjoy life. I don't know. I can't write properly, I'm really tired.
