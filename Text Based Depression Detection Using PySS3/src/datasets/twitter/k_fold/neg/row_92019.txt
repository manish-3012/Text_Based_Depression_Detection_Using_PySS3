it's gotten worse.I feel like I am cornering myself. It gets worse and worse every day. I cannot control my thoughts and actions. I do stuff that I regret immediately, but it keeps happening. I have been crying all day long. Trying to distract myself. But it feels like I am burning from the inside. I can't talk to anyone. I want to lie and listen to silence. I'd be so happy to go to a therapist, but I have no money at the moment. 

I feel like I am rotting. Like there is no tomorrow for me. Nothing.
