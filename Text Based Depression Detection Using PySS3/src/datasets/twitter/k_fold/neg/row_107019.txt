Frustrated with a failed attemptI finally felt I had completed my family duty by attending the Christmas party on the 25th, so I thought the midnight of 26th might be a good time to leave this world behind. 

I went to a meaningful place to my deceased partner. I sat on the bench with a sky full of stars then I took a very high dose of opioid and drank alcohol to maximize the effdct. I waited and waited but nothing was happening. Why wouldn't my body just let itself die and snap out of it? I felt so frustrated having to come back home alive and pretending nothing ever happened. I am even more depressed now since the drugs can't kill me.
