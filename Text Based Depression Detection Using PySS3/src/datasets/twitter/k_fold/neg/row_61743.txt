Tipping Over the EdgeItâ€™ll get better. 
It will absolutely get better. 
Just have faith and things are bound to improve.
It canâ€™t stay this bad forever. ðŸ˜ž

I hate all of the above platitudes. Fuck, now that the roles are reversed, Iâ€™m dripping with contempt for myself for ever trying to push them on someone whose world was falling apart and soul was somewhere in a dark corner of their mind, trying to hide and whimpering because the screaming and crying took their voice and the tears were all gone...for the moment. 

The woman who I share a home and a bed with is supposed to be the one who opens her arms to hold me while I cry and to whisper those stupid platitudes to me. To soothe me and tell me it will be ok. Even if it is a lie. 

But she has long since passed giving a half-pence of a fuck about how things are in my head. Sheâ€™s focused on herself and where her life and her career are going. In her mind, sheâ€™s done the holding and soothing thing a few times over the last five years and that should be enough for me to man up, shut the fuck up, and get on with life. â€œThe world keeps moving with or without you!â€ is what she tells me. Is it any shock that we havenâ€™t been intimate for at least five years?

Itâ€™s the odd and/or shiny objects that get my attention. And keep it. For too long. I shouldnâ€™t linger in my gaze at a fresh pack of utility knife blades, or at the 12 feet of concrete in the upcoming bridge abutment off to my left as I drive. I definitely shouldnâ€™t look so intently at the lugs on one of the 480V feeds in an open cabinet while we service a piece of equipment at work. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever go that direction for the electrocution would be quick as it stops my heart but I canâ€™t chance my clothes catching fire and causing me to let go before my heart gives up. I canâ€™t burn. Itâ€™s my worst fear and it haunts me. ðŸ¥º

Iâ€™m 42 and I have no fucking right to be complaining. SO many people have it SO much worse than I do! I have a good job that pays great. I have a family who loves me (except for the one I live with) and yet all I think about are ways to escape. To find a way to get away from it all. To find a place where I canâ€™t fall in love with someone and to know they love me back but to also know that, as soon as a younger, hotter, more chiseled, farther ahead in life or even just rocking a third leg, that love will dissipate like it never existed and the loneliness will swallow me whole again. 

I desperately want to believe that thereâ€™s something better and I just havenâ€™t found it yet. 

Maybe there is......but I donâ€™t think I have enough left in me to make it that long. I only have a few â€œIâ€™m sorry. Youâ€™re cute and all but...look at how cut he is.â€  and â€œYeah, sorry, dude. You just arenâ€™t quite good enough.â€ Left in me. 

Thanks for anyone who read all of that drivel. 

TL/DR: Iâ€™m not worth the full version or even a recap. 

Goodnight, all. Time to lay down and let the nightmares take me away. xo
