Last Trip (?)Well, in about 3 or 4 days Iâ€™ll be traveling to the US for a 20 day trip. Iâ€™m going alone. The void feeling in my chest has reached its peak. Iâ€™m thinking of taking my life while Iâ€™m there, because there will be no family members to stop me. I donâ€™t know, my parents think that this trip could turn my life around, but I simply donâ€™t believe so anymore. Iâ€™m not even excited for it. The only thing I kinda want to do is find some girl to hookup, as I never had the chance to do so here, not once a girl were interested in me. After that, I plan on ending everything on the last day of the trip.
