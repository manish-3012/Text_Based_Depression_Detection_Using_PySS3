I want to want to live for myselfI spent all day crying and crying, I've been taking medication and doing therapy and listening to helpful podcasts about self compassion, trauma, forgiveness, everything I need to practice and work on. And still today I ended up just a total mess because I feel like it's all a fraud. I have struggled my whole life to just be happy and every time I get close it's only because there are people around me that deserve better than to have this miserable person to be around. Through this process I've opened up to my best friend and my parents in ways I haven't before, but when I'm this upset crying all I want is for someone to hold me. I tried holding myself, I said nice things to myself (something I almost never did), but it continued. So I called my parents, but it ended up with them being frustrated, because I've been a mess for 2 months and I guess they're getting sick of it. Neither of them, for as long as I can remember, have ever held me when I cried. I told them that's all I wanted, and I know they're not close enough to physically do it, but I could still stand for some sort of words to fill the void.

I know they love me, and so I feel incredibly guilty that it's not enough. I started hating myself for how I've made them feel through all this. I thought they wanted to be part of the process, but I've only upset them, worry them, make them annoyed, you name it. And I can't stand doing this to people. I want to be gone before I have a chance to do it to anyone else.
