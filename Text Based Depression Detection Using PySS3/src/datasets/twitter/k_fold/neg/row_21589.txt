I need to help my friend, this is urgentI have A very close friend of mine who iâ€™ve known for well over a year now, ever since she started opening up to me iâ€™ve tried to help her and iâ€™ve tried to make her a happy person and months later i still dont know how to make that happen. She says i made her feel really happy at times but the sadness was always there and no matter how much that hurt me to hear i didnt react to it because i knew she would be hurt. I dont know how to help her more than what i already did, she battles md or mdd ( maladaptive daydreaming ) amongst many other issues that are deep seeded, family doesnt treat her well, constant sadness, she doesnt accept who she is as a person although she is the nicest and most kind hearted girl iâ€™ve ever met. Please help me help her because i dont want to lose the only person thatâ€™s keeping me here and the only person i love, she means more to me than myself. I know this isnt descriptive enough but i hope anyone can help out, iâ€™d appreciate it tons. 

If not, thank you for reading
