i dont even care anymoreALL WORK AND NO PLAY ALL WORK AND NO PLAY ALL WORK AND NO PLAY. im 5 steps away from death and i feel comfortable. i finally feel like i can control something in my life. death. death is the only thing that matters. death comforts me. i swear if i had the ammo i would shoot up this fucking school and have fun while doing it. im just writing this right now to complain. fuck off with the dont do it. im gonna fucking kill myself and enjoy it. what a fucking ass of a world we live in. was i just born to play the role of the failure that got molested by his "better" brother. am i supposed to just shut the fuck up and not tell my dad what really is going on. OH MY FUCKING DAD. HE DOESNT EVEN KNOW ANYTHING AND HE MAKES EVERYTHING WORSE. the only reason i didnt fucking kill myself back in 10th was because i have a younger sister i have to fucking protect from that fucking monster molester and i cant bare to see my sister crying because of my death. WHAT DO I FUCKING DO?! AM I INSANE?! AM I JUST BEING A LITTLE BITCH BECAUSE PEOPLE IN AFRICA ARE STARVING? AND THIS FUCKING COUNTRY DOESNT HELP. MY MOTHER IS SO BRAINWASHED FROM ISLAM. I STILL LOVE HER EVEN THOUGH THE CANCER CHANGED HER AND PTSD AND DEPRESSION GOT TO HER. shes my mom i fucking love her. but it doesnt calm me down that if i suicide my mom will blame it on me not being relegious enough and she is gonna think im going to hell for life. I DONT EVEN KNOW WHAT TO THINK ANYMORE. I CANT TRUST MYSELF. I AFRAID OF MYSELF AND I DONT KNOW WHAT IM SAYING ANYMORE. ALL WORK AND NO PLAY.
