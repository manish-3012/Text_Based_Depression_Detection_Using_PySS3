I donâ€™t know what to say, Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m feeling utterly useless right now, This is definitely the lowest Iâ€™ve felt in a while. 

The only reason why Iâ€™m not doing anything is because of two things, My mother and my friends. 

I canâ€™t leave them, I will not hurt them. They deserve the best. So I try to be the best, but pretending to be something youâ€™re not for awhile leaves you empty.
I donâ€™t know what my real purpose in life is other than entertaining my friends and taking care of my mom. This has became me, Without them I am truly nothing. 

Now the reason why Iâ€™m feeling useless, is because Iâ€™m failing. 

I think my friends are getting tired of me, and my mom who is getting more sick by the day is slowly slipping away from me. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m losing the things that make me whole.
