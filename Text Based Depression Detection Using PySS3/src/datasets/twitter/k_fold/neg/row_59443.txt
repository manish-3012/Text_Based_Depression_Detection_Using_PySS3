The woman I love is chronically ill and suicidalI recently fell in love with a woman, and she fell in love with me right back. She has lupus, and its killing her, not only that but because of the fact that she is chronically ill, she doesnt see much point in continuing. She is my reason to live. The only reason I didnt down an entire bottle pills and drink myself into an early grave on christmas eve was because of her. If she kills herself, I won't be able to stop myself. This feels like the appropriate forum to leave this. Share your opinions if you wish, but i dont think theres anything anyone can say that will make me feel differently. Shes my best friend and my lover, and I dont want to go on living without her. Shes everything to me, and without her I have nothing.
