i felt ecstasy and fearI tried it out, sort of. The way I want to go. I quit before I could do anything harmful - I don't want to be found if it goes to plan. I'll try in a few hours. I don't know if I want it to work. I'm pretty sure I do. Maybe I'll have the choice taken away from me. I don't know.

When I started to feel the immense pressure on my windpipe, I was scared. Not as scared as I have been in other situations; I knew that I could easily get myself out. It was a tester, after all. But a split second after that - I was so gloriously ecstatic. I was going to be free.

Now I can't stop coughing, because it still feels like there's such pressure in my throat. But I also feel relief.

I don't have to long for him anymore. 
I don't have to feel like I've been stabbed in the heart every time he's out with somebody else.
I won't have to deal with this terrible obsessive personality of mine anymore.
I don't have to deal with my intense longing and desire for love that will never be.
I won't have to deal with my intense sessions of highs and lows - fine for a week, then writing notes the next.
I don't even have notes this time.
I just want to go.

At least he'll attend my funeral. I hope.
I'm 17. This rollercoaster started when I was 14. Now it's been started up again by him, and I don't know if it's ever going to stop. 

I can't do this forever.
It's too much.
I'm done.
