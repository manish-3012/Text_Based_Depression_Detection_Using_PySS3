Seven months, like yesterdayItâ€™s seven months since Iâ€™ve created this anonymous account to share my desire to kill myself, and Iâ€™m still here reading about the others and not being able to do it myself. We are pathetic, triumphantly useless at either doing what weâ€™re writing about, or to put our shit together and get on with our lives.

Itâ€™s funny that my greatest ambition today is for some major illness to get the job done for me.
