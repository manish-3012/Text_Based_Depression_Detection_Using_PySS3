16 is a sad age to be doing this shit so lateEvery word I hear makes me stressed. Every person I see makes me sad. Nothing is worth it. Not anymore. Iâ€™ve been fighting chronic depression for four years now. Iâ€™ve had about enough. Itâ€™s to the point that I donâ€™t care if my girlfriend is hurt. The girlfriend of two years who I love so fucking much. But Iâ€™m done. Goodbye.
