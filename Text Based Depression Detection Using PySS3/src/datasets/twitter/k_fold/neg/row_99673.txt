I know thereâ€™s a lot of you who feel the same way...I wanna die but I donâ€™t want to at the same timeâ€¦ I donâ€™t wanna be In pain but itâ€™s what I really hate to feel but I like it... I really wish I could just end it right now and not have to worry for feel this way for another second but whatâ€™s stopping me? 

Hell I donâ€™t even know at this point but I keep on goingâ€¦ despite that Everything Iâ€™ve gone through.. Iâ€™m still alive and I say too people that no Iâ€™m gonna kms but I canâ€™t do it... something is stopping meâ€¦ 

Why do I keep going? I mean itâ€™s basically a form of torture and yet Iâ€™m okay with it and down play it? 

Yeah Iâ€™m hurting and I hate myself but I donâ€™t know what to doâ€¦ I wanna cryâ€¦ I personally have no one beside me, and if one day If I somehow I meet that special someone, I pray I wonâ€™t hurt themâ€¦

Tbh I donâ€™t why Iâ€™m alive, I donâ€™t wanna be but I keep on living.

Much love
