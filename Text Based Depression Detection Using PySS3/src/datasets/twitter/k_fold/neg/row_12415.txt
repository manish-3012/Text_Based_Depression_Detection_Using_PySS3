Dying insideWhen I try something, I just collapse as I am trying to work on my things. I am 22 but im soon turning 23 and I dont wanna be a failure by the time I am in my 30s or 40s. I just get scared of failing. I never got my High School degree or even a college degree. But i seem to know lots about computers and IT, but since I have so little experience I cant work with the big companies. I even tried to sign up for Upwork but they declined my application. I have seen many psychologists, but no use since they couldnt help me. I am in my turning point towards doing something drastic in life (Which i dont want to) but it always seems like an option. I never had friends, just a fake lovers who used me to their advantage. Most people dont see me as their choice. I got declined in my entrance to the US military because of my horrible eye sight (something i hate about myself). I can't count on anyone,. al little help here?
