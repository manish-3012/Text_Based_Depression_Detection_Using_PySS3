I wish I could have someone shoot me or push me out a window or poison me or something.I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t just do it myself. I need to stop thinking about it. I need to just put myself on auto pilot and do it. It would be so easy to go lay down on the train tracks here or jump off a roof or drink bleach. But iâ€™m thinking too much and I canâ€™t bring myself to do any of that. I really just want to die. I wish I could just stop waking up.
