Theres way too many people subscribed here...I came here because I too, am finding myself in such a dark place I cant even understand the level of this depression. But it breaks my heart to see Just how many people are subscribed to this sub. So I hope to see everyone pull out of it. I hope everyone finds some light in this darkness and makes it another day.
