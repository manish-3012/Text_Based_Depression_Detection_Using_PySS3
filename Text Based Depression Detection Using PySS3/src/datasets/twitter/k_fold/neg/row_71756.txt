I don't get itI have hated myself how I look and everything about me and I sit alone in my room just contemplating life and why I'm still living it. Ik people have had harder life's than me but I just hate everything and bad at everything. And I have no confidence to talk to a women. Nor do I feel interesting enough to hold a conversation. It's not just women that's got me down but it's one of the main things atm. I just wish I could end up with someone who actually cares if something. I hate that I just don't have the capacity to look nice enough or be good enough to get with a nice girl. I don't hate women nor blame them. I just blame myself for everything about it. I don't know if I have depression of anxiety but most of my friends believe I have it and severely. But I do not know because my parents refuse to let me talk to a therapist and my dad just calls me a bitch or something like that. But every night I consider suicide and I just want it to stop. And to stop thinking I am incapable of finding someone to care. Ik posting this won't help because all I'll hear is probably a "you'll find someone"  "you will get that confidence one-day"  "that girl will come" but I have and I've been trying for a while. I do not hold myself great in most social interactions because I'm just very bad at talking to people I don't even know what to say to a women a "hey what's up" is apparently "to dry", and I feel like a pickup line is either cheesy or make me sound weird af. I just don't see why I'm even trying this shit anymore knowing it won't work. Most people say you have to work on yourself before you should to for a women but that hasn't worked and I don't know what to do Im just never happy, there are plenty of people with someone so just why can't I get one person in my life to even act like they like me?
