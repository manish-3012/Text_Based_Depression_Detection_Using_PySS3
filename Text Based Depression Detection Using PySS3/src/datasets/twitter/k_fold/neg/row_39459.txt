The only good thing that depression has taught me is that I donâ€™t have to be tied to anythingThe beauty of life is that you can go wherever you want, do whatever you want, and be whatever you want. I want to take advantage of that and just live life just moving onto the next thing. Before I was depressed, I would take things too seriously and thought I had to do everything in a linear way with my life planned out. That way of thinking is too tiring. I rather just go with the flow now. I like to do spontaneous and impromptu things now. It makes me realize how things can happen just like that, without planning. I live for those unexpected moments in life.
