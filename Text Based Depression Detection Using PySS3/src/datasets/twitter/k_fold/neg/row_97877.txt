Doing great, then everything crashesAnyone else feel like life would be going great, then all of a sudden depression hits you like a category 5 hurricane? I just want to be happy, and I was doing great for this year until the beginning of this month. I just hate myself and I hate how ruined and horrible I am. I havenâ€™t been diagnosed with depression or anything, because I come from a family that doesnâ€™t believe in it. I tried overdosing one night and they ended up mad at me for it, instead of trying to help. My mom threatened to get me into a psych ward, but Iâ€™ve heard horrible stories about them. I just donâ€™t know what to do, I suppose Iâ€™ll seek a psychiatrist
