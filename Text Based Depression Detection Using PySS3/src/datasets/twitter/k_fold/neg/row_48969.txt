It's overI'm 24 years old. I'm alone. I have no friends. No family. I am in a homeless shelter. I am treated with disrespect and contempt everyday. I can't find a job. I don't have anything to eat. I am a total fucking failure who shouldn't exist. I'm a waste of space. It's over. I'm done trying. Done pretending. Done caring. Bye.
