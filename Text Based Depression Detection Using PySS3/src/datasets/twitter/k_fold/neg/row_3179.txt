I'm starting to give up all hope :(I'm been very depressed and upset in last weeks and even worse now. It's been a nightmare and I feel that I have no options left. I'm starting to giving up on my life. Less than 12 hours ago, I was cyber bullied by others. After this, I was crying, depressed and I want to die. I really feel worthless and I feel like nobody loves me. It hurts so much right now.
