i canâ€™t take it anymorei have this feeling that my girlfriend doesnâ€™t love me. sheâ€™s the last thing i have in life, if i lose her iâ€™m taking my own life. sheâ€™s been ignoring me for the past week, and only talks about work when we do talk, we were getting real serious, but shits been falling down, and sheâ€™s talking to our mutual friend, and i assume more that i donâ€™t know about, she tells me how if i donâ€™t give her enough attention, she might catch feelings for someone else, but i canâ€™t prevent that if i canâ€™t fucking talk to her.
iâ€™ve had depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time, i canâ€™t handle all the stress my school gives me, nor other people. i just think itâ€™s best to take the pussy way out so i donâ€™t have to feel all this pain.
