I give up. I can't fight anymore. I'm going through with it.This weekend I am taking a trip to the coast.  I was supposed to go with my mom, but she bailed on me like she usually does.  I'm her oldest, and she's never liked me.  She's told me to my face that "her kids" are my siblings, not me.

So I'm going alone.  Which is fine.  Alone is better.  She won't hurt me that way.  

But I am so tired.  My life is going nowhere and I am completely and utterly alone.  I've wondered so many times how long it would take anyone to find me if I just died in my apartment.  I really don't think anyone would notice.  Once I was found, I'm sure my family would put on a big show to get any sympathy or money they could out of my death, and then happily go one with their lives, knowing I'm finally gone.  I'm only in my thirties, and my whole family has just been waiting and hoping for me to die my entire life.

I've been waiting and hoping too.  But life is unfair, and people with loving families and futures end up with cancer while defective parasites like me survive one unlikely catastrophe after another.  Not this time.  Not anymore.

I won't say how.  I know there are worthwhile people on this sub who are just struggling and actually are good people who are worthy of affection and love and life.  But the method is taken care of, and as long as all goes according to plan, I'll be asleep on a beach or even comatose before the pain starts.  

The last thing I'll ever see is the ocean that I've always loved so much.  My only regret is leaving my cat.  I love my little kitty.  I hope the people who promised to take her long ago are good and sweet to her.  She's the only creature on this earth that loves me.  She has been my reason for living since she found me.  But I can't fight anymore.  I'm tired.  I'm sorry, sweet little kitty.

It's time.  I should have done this a very long time ago.
