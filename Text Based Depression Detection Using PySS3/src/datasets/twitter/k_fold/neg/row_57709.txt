Deal to end my life.I'm a good student. Very passionate, very serious when it comes to my studies. I went through a very hard scholarship and I managed it. Yet i now have to change of university to continue my studies. Basically I'm supposed to have my place there automatically, but with the covid 19 crisis the french educational system fucked up badly badly, so I'm left stranded without any informations related with my registration there. I have a very shitty life, I am at a very bad place right now. With some positive sides, but there are more negative ones. My only way out is to pursue my studies. If for some reasons I wasn't accepted to the university, or was accepted but asked to work from home, I'll end my life. I keep holding onto my responsibilities. I don't think about myself first. Probably why I'm still alive. I'm fighting my everyday struggles and my shitty depression for other people's sake mostly. But if I had to be caged, I'll think of myself at last and choose death. I refuse to be kept away anymore. Family life feels like a kidnapping. I might be an adult but the further I can go is where I throw the trashes. No friends to visit me, I am not able to visit friends. Stuck in the middle of the countryside, I love the view but it feels like prison when being isolated there for months and months. I just want to live my own life at times. I just want to be able to choose for myself. To choose to go to a park. To a shop. To a coffee... I'm not going to accept staying there an extra year. And my only way out is studies. Otherwise they'll not allow me to go anywhere and I won't allow myself to disobey. I want to go a peaceful way. Not within humiliation and violence.
