nobody caresDid anyone ever tried to tell their parents they are suicidal? If so how did they react? I feel like I told my whole family mutliple times how I'm feeling and not to say they don't care at all but they definitely don't take it seriously too much. To be fair I talk about it a lot for years and I'm still here so I guess they have no reason to take it serious too much but in my head lately it's been the only thing on my mind and I just be looking up how to kill myself everyday.. I don't even know what I'm expecting from them but it just kinda makes me sad that not even my family would miss me. I mean I would probably make their live a lot easier if I did die.
