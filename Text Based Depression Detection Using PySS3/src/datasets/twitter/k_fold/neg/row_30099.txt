I just admitted I was suicidal to my fatherIâ€™ve been in denial about my feeling for a while now but Iâ€™m too pussy to actually kill myself. I stopped going to class for literally no reason and even after telling him I have no reason I just blurted it out I want to die in a fit of anger. My dad got angry back and told me to do it, I then drank what ever was left of NyQuil and took 2 or 3 melatonin pills. I donâ€™t know I told him I shouldâ€™ve just said I was tired or it was work but idk. Iâ€™m just writing this to vent I was trying to hide it because I donâ€™t want to be committed like my cousin was. Iâ€™ve just wanted to die for about a decade now and I wanted to find a way to go without hurting anyone and now my whole family probably knows about my suicidal thoughts.
