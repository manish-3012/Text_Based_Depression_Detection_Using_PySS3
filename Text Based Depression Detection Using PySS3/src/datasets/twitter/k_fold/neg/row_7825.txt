Iâ€™m a gay teen, and Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll make it to the end of high school.Everything feels heavy. I want to be alone all the time, but I also want someone to be there to comfort me. I canâ€™t take compliments, I always think the person giving them is lying. 
Donâ€™t get me wrong, I have things worth living for. Iâ€™m still very young. I like drawing and I want to become a cartoonist. I have a close friend whoâ€™s also LGBT, and we vent to each other a lot. We keep each other alive. I just got to know my ex-love interestâ€™s boyfriend, and heâ€™s bisexual. Heâ€™s hilarious, too. 
But the negatives outweigh the positives. My family is conservative. I can only reach for acceptance, never grasp it. There are people who donâ€™t even know me that want me dead. I treated my last love interest poorly. Iâ€™m ugly. Iâ€™ve been lying my whole life, and Iâ€™m a good liar. No one would believe me. I donâ€™t feel safe anywhere. Iâ€™m a woman. 
Iâ€™ve been cutting myself since I was 12, and no one has noticed. I guess Iâ€™m grateful for that. 
Iâ€™m supposed to be going somewhere with 3 friends tomorrow, but Iâ€™m considering cancelling so I can lay in bed and cry.
