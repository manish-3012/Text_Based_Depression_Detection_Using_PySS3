Someone please respondSomeone please respond and tell me my life isnâ€™t over. 

I cry all day, Iâ€™m fat, I have no future. I just quit my internship because Iâ€™m incompetent. 

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll ever get a job and support myself. I feel like the most stupid, ugly, disgusting person to exist. 

I wish I had the motivation to hang myself. I just canâ€™t be in the hospital psych ward so I can only do it if itâ€™ll work.

Iâ€™m so terrified of everything. Iâ€™m so sad. 

Please write a comment so I have something to read, and something to think about besides how dismal my future is.
