I have a theory(just a rant)I've always theorized that this world needs balance. In order for there to be happy people, you need people who will never gain happiness. I'm 36, (37 next month), female and a virgin. I've never been on a date, never went clubbing or hung out with friends as an adult. I have been fat, ugly and depressed probably since middle school but up until college because I was in the same grade as my sister I still had "friends"(made by her). After that, I've been alone, because I was never supposed to have happiness. Every time I get a taste of it, it goes stripped away and worse things happen.I'm so tired, so tired struggling to live. Why? Why can't I take my own life? Why is it bad to give up? Why? Is it just so the happy people can have their happiness? Without misery happiness, cant exist so some people have to just suffer? Well, I'm tired of suffering, I'm so tired and it's too late for me to change anything. I don't know how much longer I can take this pain. I'm so tired.
