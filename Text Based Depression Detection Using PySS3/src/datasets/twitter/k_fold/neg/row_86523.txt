paying for being a sexual devianti m a man and have been cheating on my fiancee with a gay couple. it's an s&amp;m thing that has crossed boundaries and i'm forever worried they'll reveal what i do with them to her. I am very selfish i both want it and can't handle the fact that I am doing this to my fiancee whom i want too.

i don't see how I can get out of this situation, i don't have any dignity and i wonder if i should just. you know. I find it tough to voice it but I have been thinking of it.

Edit editt: please pm instead of commenting...even though this is a throwaway i would rather only discuss it privately with anyone...
