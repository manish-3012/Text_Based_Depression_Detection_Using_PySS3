It all ends the same.I see options but I can't see anything but death beyond them.

My mother has cancer. I am a teenager and still live with my family. I fake a personality whenever they are around - all of the time, really. I'm homeschooled and not allowed to be social. I know if I run away I'll kill myself from guilt of leaving my mom. If I stay here I'll kill myself from how awful I feel. My parents don't believe in mental diseases and I can't go to a therapist. I don't have a phone I can use to call anyone. I don't have anyone to talk to and the internet can't really help.

I don't see an option besides suicide. I first tried to kill myself when I was 9. Life hasn't got any better but I lied to myself about being happy for a while.

I don't know what else I can do. I don't think there is anything. I think about it constantly.
