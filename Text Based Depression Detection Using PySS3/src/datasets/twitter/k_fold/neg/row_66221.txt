MTHFRDeplin has started to wear off.  No more magic bullet for my broken krebs cycle.  Norepinephrine ("fight or flight neurotransmitter") has far too much influence over how I present myself to others.  And I'm getting tunnel vision of the worst sort.

About to go to a job fair tomorrow.  The collective voice of everyone in the room will agree on one thing:

*No matter your grades, no matter your credentials, no matter who you know or what you know or what you have to offer, your genetics are ultimately what make you noncompetitive.  MTHFR has made you depressed and unrelatable, while everyone else in this room is chipper, energetic, and outgoing.  A guy with a head full of norepinephrine is a liability to our image and is very bad for our bottom line.  Just stay away from us.*

I'm not considering suicide in the sense of physical death, just the solitary outcome of being alive with shit genetics:  "reputational death."

If you have nothing to offer anyone, count yourself lucky.  
An enterprise that has not been attempted cannot fail.
A loan that has not been withdrawn cannot be owed.
A reputation that has not been born cannot die.
Yet here I dwell in this tunnel.
