In hospital after a serious suicide attempt. It only recently just hit meThat of I had used a better belt, I would be dead. It was so weird. I tried hanging myself, blacked out in like five or ten seconds and suddenly found myself on the floor unable to move. Was very confused at first and took me a lot of time to realise that the belt's buckle gave in. If it hadn't, I would be dead. I have no idea how long I had already been hanging there but they found no brain damage and despite some awful bruising my neck is ok.
Somewhat alright now, I'm going to be moved to the psych ward in the next few days after they're sure my liver works fine because I also overdosed on paracetamol.
I don't know what to think. You'd think that I'd feel regret for not dying, but instead I don't feel anything. I don't mind that I'm alive but I wouldn't mind being dead either you know.
