I hate college, I hate my major, and I hate life.I am a first-semester freshman at some shitty state school in buttfuck nowhere and I am failing. I'm failing all of my mathematics and CS courses and it took me about 20 hours to do a single CS project (which is still not done but who gives a fuck at this point). I also failed the CS midterm I had recently, where I frittered away 2 hours, wrote code that didn't even run, and left the closest to killing myself I have ever been. I also have started cutting myself since coming here, and the emergency help line has been less than helpful. I'm constantly tired, have to lie to the therapy center to avoid hospitalization (again), and am flunking out of my classes. My parents don't say it but I know they're very disappointed in both my college and myself. The intro CS course isn't even hard, I just can't do it. The professor literally said he isn't meaning for it to be a weedout-course. If I can't do fucking CS 101 and trying makes me cut myself, how will I handle upper division courses? I have a meeting with the disabilities office but honestly at this point I don't even fucking care. I'm too far in the hole and I can't pass at this point. And for everyone who says that I can just retake, I can't: I have the hubris to imagine myself at grad school, and they will see my transcript and failed courses, and will be drawn to failing the easiest CS course offered by the school. Even then I don't even know if I want to fucking continue with CS, but there is nothing else I could see myself doing, outside of killing myself. Oh and the medication I'm taking isnt fucking working, so I'm fucked.
