I am in love with a fictional character and its killing me.I am working at the bank as teller after I graduate from uni. financially it is good job to have and I thought that this is everyone was searching for. 10 years later I must confess that it is eating away my soul. The work hours are long and extremely boring and eating my personality bit by bit. I used to like to play video games and watching anime and reading manga and now I don't but hey! i am financial secured. The movie theater was only source entertainment that I still haven't stopped enjoying it. I saw this movie years ago and...I had this crush with a character and i know its silly but I told myself everybody has a fictional lover. but years later that feeling grew to be an actual love and obsession. I cant stop thinking about the character. I want to be with the Character, its world, everything. I just woke up right now from having this fucking awesome vivid dream with it. Now I am literally crying as I writing this for knowing it was just a dream. I don't wanna wake up, I don't wanna go to work. whats the point of waking up.
