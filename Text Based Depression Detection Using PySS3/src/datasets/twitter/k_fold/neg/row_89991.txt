Im so lonelyI feel all of my feelings wouldnt matter to anyone if i got them off my chest based on the fact that im only 15. Im finishing my freshman year, and things got better this year. Ive been by myself since 7th grade. 

No friends at all. Ive made some friends this year, but still, I feel the same. My childhood was awful. My dad was verbally abusive to my siblings and they took it out on me. Things are better now, my parents got divorced. Im the youngest of 5 and all my siblings have a different dad. My mom immediatley brought in a new guy as soon as my dad and her split. In fact, he was LIVING IN THE HOUSE LONG BEFORE MY DAD WAS ABLE TO MOVE OUT. Him and my mom lived in the basement, my dad came home and ran to his bedroom. The new guy isnt bad but hes fucking annoying, doesnt work, and is "disabled".

I hate everything. The only person im really close with is my sister, and she doesnt even know. Fuck my life. I want to die so bad.
