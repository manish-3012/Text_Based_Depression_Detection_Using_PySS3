Help? My post is a bit whiny, but fuck it.&amp;nbsp;

I don't know why I'm posting again. I've been here under a few different names and it has never helped. 

&amp;nbsp;

I've been depressed for years and I don't want to live anymore. I don't have the energy to try and get better. **I just want to die so i can stop feeling so badly.**

&amp;nbsp;

This is the end of the road. I feel like I've missed out on so much and squandered so many opportunities. I'm sick of the failures and disappointments. I'm tired of being alone all the time.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't have any goals and i don't have anything going on in my life. No money, no job, no friends, no relationship(ever), hardly any life experiences. No goals or dreams. Failed out of college. Debt.

&amp;nbsp;

I don't know, maybe I'll play a few lottery games as a last ditch effort. i don't really care about much. I think I'm mourning my own death right now. The past few months, actually. 

&amp;nbsp;

I wish I wasn't mentally fucked up. I wish I had a close family that I could turn to for help. I wish I had a friend. Unfortunately, wishes won't help any...
