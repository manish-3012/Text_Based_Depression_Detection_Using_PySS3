I don't wanna die but it's an option if things keep going this wayI hate 2018. This has literally been the worst year of the 27 I've been here, and that's after having a fucked up abusive childhood with barely any family value or anything. I've tried to commit suicide before, 20 or more times at least. And I did at the beginning of the year. It almost worked and at this point I'm mad that it didnt. I had literally everything taken away from me this year. My girlfriend of 3 years dumped me for another guy after cheating on me, became a bdsm pet and I lost my kids, my apartment, my stability. My hope. I had my own place and lost that because I made stupid fucking choices. I've lost 5 people close to me. One from a shooting, one from health, 2 from suicide and one from an overdose. I envy them. I'm homeless living with friends but I can't get ahead in anything I do, no matter how hard I try or how little I dont. I dont see a reason to keep doing this. If I dont find a place in the next month, I'll be kicked out and I've decided if that happens, I'm gonna fucking kill myself. I am so exhausted from life...I can't continue to live in this chaotic bullshit. I'm so tired of shit never going the way I work so hard for it to go. I'm nothing close to who I used to be. I've failed at everything I've put my time into. What remains?
