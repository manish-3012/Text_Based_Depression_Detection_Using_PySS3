ajor cutting &amp; self harm; Lost all hope; More info insideI'm out of hope &amp; don't know what to do. I've been in the hospital 3 times the past 2 months &amp; have the majority of feeling in [my left arm](http://imgur.com/a/Axl5i) from cutting so badly. I've been trying to get by for so long &amp;  I just can't take it anymore. I can't even think anymore because all I hear in my head is myself screaming to escape.

I'm just curious as to what happens when someone becomes a long term threat to themselves if anyone here knows.
