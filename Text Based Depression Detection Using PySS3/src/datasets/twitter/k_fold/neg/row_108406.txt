Pregnant and suicidal.Pregnancy! Yay happy, excited, canâ€™t wait... I can wait, and I donâ€™t want this baby but itâ€™s too late to do anything now, and everyone is so excited except me... everyone talked me into keeping it and I honestly wanted it at first and I really thought about it, Iâ€™m going to be going to college, working, and trying to find a place to stay with my boyfriend. It all stresses me so much and I already know Iâ€™m going to be a terrible mother for this baby. I donâ€™t wanna be here anymore and Iâ€™ve always wanted to end my life.. but everyone would say itâ€™s selfish and it is, but I canâ€™t help how I feel every single day of my life. This babyâ€™s life is going to be awful if Iâ€™m the mother and everyone disagrees with adoption and itâ€™d break my boyfriends heart, as he loves the baby. I just know it will be way too difficult to handle and I donâ€™t wanna live to see it. I cry every night because of my depression and how Iâ€™m not happy with being pregnant. I just wanna end it...
