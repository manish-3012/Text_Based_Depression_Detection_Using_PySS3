Been thinking to jump off my balcony.So, this is new.

I've never actually imagined to do anything to actually harm myself, it was just fleeting thoughts of "what if I don't wake up tomorrow?".

I don't think there's really any intention to jump, I just... think about it, repeatedly. Not the fall, or the  impact to the ground, just the jump on loop, kinda like in a third person POV videogame. I see someone from behind jumping and I know it's me.

I can't sleep. I don't think I will tonight. It will be the second night in under a week, I think. I'm not sure, time is fuzzy.
