I hate myselfI hate myself. Iâ€™m constantly hurting someone without meaning to and it really bothers me because I do by best to be good, but it just goes out the window when I do something wrong.

Iâ€™m really angry, and I donâ€™t know why. I feel like Iâ€™m taking it out on other people, but I donâ€™t know how to stop.

Iâ€™m and older sister, but am told I have to teach my younger sister to be better because sheâ€™s like me n my twin. But idky I have to teach her this, when I never asked to be a sister and when Iâ€™m not even a good person to begin with. 

I just feel like a massive burden, and donâ€™t want to be her anymore ig
