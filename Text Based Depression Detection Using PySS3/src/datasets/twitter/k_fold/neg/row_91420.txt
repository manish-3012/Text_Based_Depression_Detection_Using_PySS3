I need help again.My last posts were 3 years ago, see them for some background info.

I quit my job 2 years ago, and pursued something i cared about. I finally had some me time. I finally found someone whose company i enjoyed, and i love her. I was happy, or at least i thought so.

I realize now that idea of happiness is only a dream. One i can never achieve. I realize that all i tried to do these 3 years has no meaning. I am fighting a losing battle. I just want someone to talk to about anything. Please.
