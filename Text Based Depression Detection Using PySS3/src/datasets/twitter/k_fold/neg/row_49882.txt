How terrible and insignificant of a person must I beIgnoring vague and existential morality in suicide for a minute.

How terrible a person or how meaningless a person must I be for the person who knows me most in the world, to know I'm suicidal and for her to respond to my seeking help with not wanting me to confide in her. She must of known how much better the world would be without me because all I do is spread misery now. 

That was before I had gotten this bad, where the best thing I do each day is not making someone miserable with this garabage or longing or victimizing myself. I hadn't destroyed myself and gotten more slotheful and terrible, so what hope do I have now of anyone ever finding that connection with me again. I'll dump my feelings here because I don't care to be helped. 

Likely, you guys will blame her, but you are so removed from the situation for me to tell you your wrong is very time consuming, and fuck off with your blame.


I'm really trying to hang on until I can stop being an active person in peoples lives before I kill myself, but that seems like far too long to not make another attempt. I'm such a god damn burden, who won't help but want and destroy myself over anything that shows kindness.

I don't even know what had happened, and I keep hoping I'll either wake up with not this life, or crazy enough to believe in another.

I'm really sorry that you had to read this. I had to get it out of my head before a job interview, and I'm out of lying happy pills
