Need someone to talk to. Need to be talked out of extitensial dread at 2 am.My grandmother died a week ago. While this has no direct bearing on my mental health, it does mean that I won't be home until the 24th.

I haven't sought councilling but intended start to the week she died. I am going mad here without having someone to talk to. A common line of thought for me is that life is pointless and I *should* (censored to comply with the "main" rule of the sub)

Need someone to talk to. Need someone with whom I don't need to pretend that I am not suicidal. (also don't worry. I live in GMT+ 5:30 so 2 am is *probably* a sane time where you live)
