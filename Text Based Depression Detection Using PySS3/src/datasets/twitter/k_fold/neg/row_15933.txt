I planned my suicide today.I have no idea if anybody's actually going to read this. I don't know why I'm posting. 

I've tried everything. Medication doesn't help, therapy doesn't help. I thought being in a relationship would make me happy, I thought getting a dog would make me happy, I thought moving out would make me happy. Nothing has changed, with the exception of brief periods of not actively wanting to die. 

I just don't feel like I can live with everything I've done to others, or what others have done to me. I've made so many mistakes. I knew if I could start over, I would in a heartbeat. But I can't. There's no changing what I've done and I don't think I can shoulder that burden anymore. 

I went through every option available to me - overdose, asphyxiation, even just shooting myself. Honestly, I put more thought into what I had for dinner on Friday. I don't deserve something quick, or something painless. It needs to hurt. I deserve for it to hurt. 

If you happen to read this, thank you. I hope you're in a better spot than I am right now.
