Suicide doesn't seem that scary anymoreI feel like it'll be more worth it than being stuck in the endless cycle I've been going through

I get over whelmed, I want to hurt myself, I don't, I feel more over wheeled, I start thinking about killing myself, I hurt myself, I feel fine. 

Its so fucking awful. I can't keep living like this.
