Im done.Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand i'm back. I am once again posting for the quadrillionth time because i am too scared to off myself but see no point in continuing my life. Basically, I am a fat and ugly guy with a limp. I have the worlds worst facial hair and a stupidly shaped body. I once had a very simple dream of having a wife I love and she loves me. Thats all I really wanted. But now that I am 19 and have tried numerous times to get to know a girl I have come to realize that I am just a pawn in their eyes. Every single woman I have met in my life has either used me, either to get back at their old bfs or because i'm kind of smart, or they just outright made fun of me. I used to be nice once upon a time but now i am just bitter and cold. All I have experienced in my life tells me that there is no love on this earth and you can not trust anyone but yourself. I am sad, alone and in constant mental pain. I am at my wits end. My last tether to this world is my religion. I am probably just going to go to a priest and tell him my plans and then take all my pills at once. I can only hope God sees the pain I am in everyday and forgives me.
