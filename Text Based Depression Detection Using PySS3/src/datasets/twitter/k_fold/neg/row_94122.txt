I just really donâ€™t want to be alive anymore itâ€™s that simpleNot in the mood to be grammatically correct so excuse this clusterfuck of a post......Iâ€™m 21 years old , behind everybody in life,  have no car no money, no skills/credentials Iâ€™ve become stupid and inept due to lack or participation in my own life , kicked out of the navy for having a lung condition depressive thoughts, and suicidal ideation, my girlfriend left me because Iâ€™m dead weight and just embarrassing to be with I donâ€™t blame her, my friends want nothing to do with me because Iâ€™m boring/miserable to be around, I have what I think is  debilitating health anxiety and feel like Iâ€™m dying everyday, my parents think Iâ€™m a pussy and wonder whatâ€™s wrong with me for both of my brothers turned out great and Iâ€™m the laughing stock. Iâ€™m unemployed and donâ€™t know where to start with no car and not even any desire to do jack shit. Sorry for that rant, Iâ€™m not looking for sympathy or feeling bad for myself I just have no desire to do anything other than be dead. Everyday is a living hell and I canâ€™t imagine that itâ€™s just me who feels this way. Itâ€™s like everyone is riding into the sunset or like a child who has to stay inside during recess while everyone else plays outside. Thatâ€™s the perfect analogy for my life. Iâ€™ve also become such a couch potatoe, I canâ€™t even walk downstairs without feeling like Iâ€™m going to faint or getting Intense vertigo, or go outside without feeling super lightheaded and seeing an excessive amount of floaters in my vision. Like what the fuck I should at least have control of my faculties at 21 years old. Fuck I have notnijg else to say, anyone care to talk or empathize at least, itâ€™s comforting to know Iâ€™m not alone
