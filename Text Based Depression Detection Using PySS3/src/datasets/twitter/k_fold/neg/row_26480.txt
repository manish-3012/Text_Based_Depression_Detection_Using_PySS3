I feel like things are coming to an end.Iâ€™ve never really had this feeling. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide a couple of times but this is much different. You can always imagine a very vague picture of what your future might be like. I just donâ€™t see myself getting anywhere. I feel like the best way out for me and everyone else would be to just end it. Thereâ€™s so much wrong with my I feel I am beyond fixing. My body is ridden with huge scars and my toes are fucked from slamming them against the ground as a instant coping mechanism. I used to rip off toenails too and slice up the bottom of my feet so itâ€™d hurt when Iâ€™d walk. Some of those need surgery. Iâ€™ve been to a youth hospital before and all they did was pump me full of drugs. Every waking second I feel like shit and I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. Hotlines never seemed to help and friends were never there for me. The last time i was around people I considered friends was at a youth group I go to. A â€œfriendâ€ guilt tripped me into giving him my sweater that a person really close to me owned gave me the night before he killed him self. Everything that comes out of my mouth I hate. Iâ€™m transgender male to female. I pass on the outside but as soon I open my mouth. I sound like a guy. Iâ€™m ridiculed for sounding â€œgayâ€, whatever that means. I truly feel I have nothing left. I even feel so stupid writing this out. Itâ€™s not so much for the fact Iâ€™m searching for help. I just need an outlet. Soon Iâ€™ll be going a few cities over to meetup with friends I donâ€™t often see. I want to give them each something really important to me even though I feel like Iâ€™m a setback to them. I really donâ€™t hope Iâ€™ll be coming back. The way Iâ€™m living right now isnâ€™t sustainable. Iâ€™m binging on crap food then throwing it back up. No one knows about that either. Iâ€™ve been in trouble with the law a few times because my mother made false assault accusations. I really donâ€™t want to hurt anyone else. If I got angry at someone or something Iâ€™d just twist it and take it out on my self, causing mental and physical damage. I donâ€™t even know what the purpose of writing all this down is. I feel robbed of my childhood. I was constantly beaten,sliced and burned by my older brother to which my parents didnâ€™t bat an eye to. This was all until the day I took a butter knife to ward off my brother, who was twice my height and would constantly over power me. My parents went apeshit and since then our relationship hasnâ€™t been the same. I have a burning hatred for my mother and itâ€™s always uncomfortable around my father. Around a year later, I made a friend who I grew to trust. Most of my friends at the time were 20+ while I was 14. They werenâ€™t mean or predatory at all. They were really nice. The new friend was completely unrelated to this group but was around the same age. I was sexually abused by him and Iâ€™ve tried talking to current â€œfriendsâ€ about it but im laughed at. Which really hurts. Around this point. I started keeping everything inside and so I look like Iâ€™m always happy.  Which people say they are glad I stopped pretending to be depressed and suicidal. Now if I ask for help. No one will listen. Within the next few weeks I hope that things will come to an end. I canâ€™t live like this.
