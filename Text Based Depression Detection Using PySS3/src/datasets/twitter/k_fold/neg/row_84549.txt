Nothing's changed, it's still the same.I tried working on myself for around a year now. Eating better, going to the gym, dressing better. But, nothing's changed. I know that it's stupid to think that these are instant cures for depression but my desperation keeps growing. I hope that they'd at least help me feel better. Nope. I still stay home all day and never leave my bed. I still cry myself to sleep almost every night. Nobody still wants to hang out with me. I feel like I can't control my outcome anymore. I'm always at the mercy of others. And the excruciating loneliness hurts. It burns a hole in my chest everytime I go out and see other people having fun with their friends and going on dates. I can't deal with this pain for much longer. Everything weighs me down and my legs are so close to crumbling. I'm so close to giving up. I don't want to do this to my parents bc they worked to hard for me, yet it feels like I have no choice. I don't know how much longer I can keep going, but I'd probably estimate about a week before I lose it all. I just want it to stop hurting (i know it sounds cliche).
