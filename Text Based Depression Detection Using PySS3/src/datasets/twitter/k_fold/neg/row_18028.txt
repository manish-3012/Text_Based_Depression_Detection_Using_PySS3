Big trigger warning for trans people in thisMaybe this is me just being off my meds, maybe this is from over indulging in drugs, maybe itâ€™s just how Iâ€™ll always feel. I donâ€™t really care which it is because point is, this is shitty, it keeps going back to being shitty, and it wonâ€™t stop returning to being shitty. 

Iâ€™m a tranny, my body has been fucking obliterated by testosterone so Iâ€™d never pass, Iâ€™m about to turn 19 really soon and Iâ€™m still unable to come out to anyone because truth is, I actually hate trans people. I find them all including myself fucking disgusting, we look like freaks of nature and seeing other trans people makes me feel fucking sick. I have horrible dysphoria and canâ€™t go without transitioning but why does it matter when Iâ€™ll always just be a man, I can be a dead man or a disgusting freak man, but never a woman. Iâ€™m sorry I donâ€™t want to hurt any trans people and this is disgusting of me to say but I can clock any of them, even ones touted as pretty and passing, I can always tell. I donâ€™t want to be like that, I donâ€™t want to be gross and ugly. 

My birthday is almost here, Iâ€™m still a man, Iâ€™m still going to be a man. I donâ€™t want to celebrate it, I donâ€™t want another night of all my friends seeing me as â€œone of the boysâ€ I donâ€™t want another night of me having fun then going home and crying because Iâ€™m a man. I donâ€™t want another night of me pathetically waiting until 4am and doing my makeup and wearing nice clothes to make myself feel better only to still see a man in the mirror, if I transitioned years ago then maybe, but Iâ€™m disgusting now.

I can get a boyfriend, I have people attracted to me, I donâ€™t care, theyâ€™re attracted to me as a man, everyone wants me to just be a man. 

Even the people who are supportive, you can tell they stifle their disgusted reactions towards trans people, Iâ€™m autistic and even I can fucking see it. 

Iâ€™m failing school despite everyone thinking Iâ€™m smart because Iâ€™m too fucking useless to get out of bed, everyone is disappointed in me and Iâ€™ll never make my family proud. Fucking hell i canâ€™t even get a fucking minimum wage job. Iâ€™m disgusting and Iâ€™m worthless. I donâ€™t see a point of continuing and hope I can have the courage to go through with my plans tonight. 

I smell like fucking shit too because I can barely shower most days without wanting to throw up because of my disgusting body, I donâ€™t leave my house most days so it doesnâ€™t matter anyway but honestly not being able to do basic fucking tasks because Iâ€™m a freak is the most frustrating thing.

Genuinely Iâ€™ll probably pussy out on the suicide attempt tonight and not actually do it because Iâ€™m weak so sorry for wasting your time with the rant.
