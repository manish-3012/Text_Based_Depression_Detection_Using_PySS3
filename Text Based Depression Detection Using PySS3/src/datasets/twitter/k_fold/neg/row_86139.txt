I don't care and I should.I believe my problem lies in my lack of motivation it is not enough for me to just want good future. I couldn't care less about future "me". I have personally given up on trying. I am currently going to therapy for no real reason. My psychologists misdiagnosed me (I found out not too long ago) so that sucks too. Therapy is wo weird for me. I tell my therapists whatever problem or dilemma I've been facing atm or long term and she gives me/helps me think of an amazing solution, but as soon as I step out of her office I ignore and "forget" it (I use "forget" loosely because its always in the back of my head I just choose to turn away from it). At this point I believe I just donâ€™t care about myself anymore. I'm only 15 (a sophomore), and I really shouldn't be having a problem like this at my age. I love academics I'm good at them. In fact amazing. All my tests scores (state tests and such) are perfect or nearly perfect, but I do absolutely no homework or even class work sometimes. I lie to my parents that I do, even now they think I'm doing homework, but really I am typing this.I got away with doing it for  4 years before getting caught at the end of freshman year (not doing hw that is) even now that they know they donâ€™t really do anything they don't seem to care and neither do my teachers. I feel neglected. What used to be a 4.0 GPA is now 2.0. and it pains me (as contradictory as it may sound) to not care. Because I should care. I regret the past few years of not working hard or not trying at least, but as much as I do I donâ€™t plan on changing. I sought help by my going to my school's psychologists which is how I ended up in therapy, but even that hasnâ€™t helped. I donâ€™t know what else I could possibly to do to change. I'm on the bring of mentally breaking apart and doing something drastic. With that most likely being attempting suicide. 
 
I apologize for any mistakes in my grammar or if I skipped words in the middle of my sentences like I tend to do, I wrote this in a rush and don't care to check for them.
