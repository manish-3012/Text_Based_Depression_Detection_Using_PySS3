iâ€™ve gotten to the point where there is nothing i can do to change anything and the rest of my life will be spent taking hits that i no longer have the strength to takei tried so hard to get better. i thought depression was something you just dealt with until it went away. but it never goes away. 
when bad things happened, i took them as life experience. when good things happened, it made the bad things seem easier to deal with.
but what am i supposed to do when the bad things start making good things seem invisible?

i set myself up to fail. i didnâ€™t do things that were necessary because i let myself be taken over by nothingness. iâ€™ve lived emptily.

when you try so hard and people tell you its not enough, what are you supposed to do? are you supposed to keep trying? are you supposed to keep trying even when there is nothing worth trying for?

iâ€™ve stopped caring whether i wake up in the morning. iâ€™ve stopped living every day like its my last because i honestly couldnâ€™t care less if it was. iâ€™ve stopped trying to give meaning to my life because i donâ€™t think any meaning could make myself feel better. 

i feel like iâ€™m in the end game and everything i do is just a precursor to the inevitable result of every bad thing iâ€™ve done to get to this place. 

i hate that the only choice it feels like i have is to kill myself. it really feels like doing that would be the most empowering and strongest thing iâ€™ve ever done.
