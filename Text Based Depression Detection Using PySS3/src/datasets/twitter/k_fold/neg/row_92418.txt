Stressed out of my mind about my job, boyfriend's family member death, PTSD, insomnia, depression, paranoia.I am so incredibly overwhelmed. My trauma happened last year during the fall and fall has swung around again and I feel horrible all around. Bf is stressed because one of his family members passed away last night and he can't go to the funeral because of school (the funeral is out of state). I've been so paranoid that I've started hallucinating. No reason. Just unreasonable paranoia. I haven't slept in three days and I work nights so I want to call in for my overtime shift but I'm worried I'll either get in huge trouble or fired. I don't know what to do. If I lose this job I'm fucked. I refuse to move back in with my parents because they're Mormon and I hate living under the same roof as them. I don't know what to do anymore.
