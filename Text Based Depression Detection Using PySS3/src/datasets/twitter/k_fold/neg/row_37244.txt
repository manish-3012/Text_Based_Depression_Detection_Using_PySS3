Over and over again.I've struggled with mental illness my entire life. With no improvement. I kid you not I'm at the point where I'm starting to lose my mind. Because of my disassosiative disorder I forget everything. Even what may have happened 2 minutes ago. I'll even forget who I am. Heck, I may even forget that I made this post. And of course, my depression and anxiety make matters worse. Along with those I've also struggled with self harm. I've struggled with it for going on 8 years. This year I managed to stay clean for about 4 months maybe. Maybe 5? Which is new considering I could never stay clean longer than a week. But I relapsed a month or so ago. And I've relapsed again today. And I've relapsed BAD. I'm too tired to deal with this anymore. I feel like killing myself is the only option at this point. I've already tried before. I almost wish it worked that time.

I don't even know where this post is going anymore. I just have no one to talk to. The one person who I can go to isn't even responding to me. And THEY fucking asked what was wrong. Clearly they didn't care that much to find out.
