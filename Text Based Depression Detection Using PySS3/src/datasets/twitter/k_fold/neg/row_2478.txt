Tonight.I've posted here before. I made it through last time but this time idk. The love of my life left me, the relationship was too serious for him. It came out of the blue.

I can't live another day without him. I had planned to take my life two days ago but a friend got involved and stopped me.  There's noone to stop me now. My brothers in the shower andnim thinking of drawing a nice warm bath when he's done and slitting my wrists.

I'm scared about the pain. I know it's going to hurt but nothing can hurt more than how I feel.  I can't go on like this. 

He was my best friend, my family, my lover.  I will never find anyone as special as him again.  All I can say now is, I love you dude, I hope you find happiness in your life.

I guess I'm not looking for a reason to stop, but I want to tell someone. I won't be missed much, my mother and father don't really like the fact that I moved back in with them, and besides my ex I only have 1 good friend.  

I just, I feel pathetic. I hope I succeed because waking up tomorrow will only hurt me more.  I wish he wanted me.

Edit: thank you for the kind words. I'm going for a drive.
