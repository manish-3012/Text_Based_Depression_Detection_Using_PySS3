Today is 5 years since my mom died. 1 month since my dad died of COVID. Suicide ideation = euphoriaI just feel so alone. I know I have people that love me. Friends and family. But not having both of my parents really hurts. And I know I wonâ€™t act on these thoughts because I have a dog. And it would really hurt my family for me to kill myself. 

But the thought of dying feels liberating, euphoric. I have dealt with depression most of my life. And I had learned to tolerate the sadness, loneliness, and tiredness that comes with that. But right now I feel so fucked up emotionally. It fees like I am in this void of endless pain, loneliness, and sadness. Like there is no end in sight. And even if it ends, what awaits me if I stay alive is the baseline of my depressed self. 

It just feels like whatâ€™s the point of living if itâ€™s just suffering or numbness.
