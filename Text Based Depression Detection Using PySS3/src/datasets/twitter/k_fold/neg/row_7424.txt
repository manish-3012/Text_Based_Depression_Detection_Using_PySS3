Everyday there are people who decide not to commit suicide.Today I watched yet another article or video about a beloved member of a community who killed themselves. Sometimes it feels like thereâ€™s a lifelong tally of these stories that builds up in a personâ€™s lifetime. Unfortunately we donâ€™t get to read articles or obituaries about people who decided not to kill themselves today. So I just wanted to say thank you for not going through with it. You all have so much courage and strength beyond words. Thank you.
