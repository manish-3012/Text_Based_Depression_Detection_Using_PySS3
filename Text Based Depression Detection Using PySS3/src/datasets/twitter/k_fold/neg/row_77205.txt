I'm lonely, useless, and sad for no reason.These thoughts continue to creep into my mind; even if I'm having a really good day. 
I live two hours away from my boyfriend, which shouldn't be much, except that he, and 1 other friend, are my only friends. I can't drive. Otherwise I would go see him. My friend lives in the dorm next to me, but she values personal time. So I'm alone in my dorm hours at a time a day. 
I wait for her and my boyfriend like a fucking dog. I wait for him to wake up (noon, sometimes around 2) and text me. I wait for her to come back from work, get out of class, etc. 
I tried to start going to the gym. I'm fat and lazy and anxious and it ruined that all over again. 
My boyfriend doesn't get off until 10, and by then I want to go to bed but stay up later for him.
I feel unattractive. I feel unwanted. I feel clingy, but lonely. I tried to express this. He said I could still watch my shows (he got us hulu) and do my homework. 
I only take 4 classes because 5 was too hard for me. 
I can't even be a full time student correctly. That's literally the only thing I have to do. My doggy died while I was at school. 
I just don't want to feel this way, anymore. For some reason, all I can think of is suicide, but I don't want to do that. I don't know what I want. I don't know if I want anything. I mostly just want nothing. 
I'm 18, and I'm like this. I feel like a waste.
