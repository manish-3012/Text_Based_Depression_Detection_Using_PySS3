hope to see you soon my little love SkylarI've been doing so well this past year and was not in such a deep depression but I feel it creeping up on me again, more than ever. I just want to die, I have nothing going for me. The only thing I wanted so bad was my baby Skylar, and that was ripped from my hands. 

I probably won't ever forgive myself for what I've done and could have done. I'm so angry at myself that I couldn't give you everything you deserved. 

I am not happy at all, I don't feel love for anyone anymore nor feel like I am deserving of it myself. I love you much, Skylar. I will see you soon, sleep well my sweet little angel.
