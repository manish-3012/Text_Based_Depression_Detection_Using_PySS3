I think i will kill myself tonightFor the past 10 years i have always felt inferior to everyone and i never feel like im good enought.I talked to my mother a few times now that i want to kill myself but im just making her cry for no reason i tried to be strong for my family but i am just weak.I never felt like i fit in and every friend i made has always let me down so i have trust issues im a wreck.I am currently 23 and another year passed because of corona i can't even find a job.I feel worthless.I tried to make myself feel better by starting to gaming but it's just made it worse because when i lose i want to kill myself.I feel like without my family i would have the only reason i haven't killed myself is i don't want them to feel bad.But every year i feel more and more pathetic.I have never had a girlfriend because i feel like im not good enought for anyone.I have tried going to the jym and everything to raise my self asteem but going there just makes me see how worthless i am and how easy i give up.I always look for help because i am simply not good enought. So i think i will just end it tonight i have been depressed for about 10 years now and its not getting better it probably never will.I just wanted to write this down so someone can see it i don't want to tell anyone.
