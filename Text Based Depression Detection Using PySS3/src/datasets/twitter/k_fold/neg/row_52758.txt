You saved someone from suicide on reddit how &amp; why???Itâ€™s hard for me to believe someone could come on here and convince me my life really means something just for the sake of being nice, so tell me how did you find out you saved someone from suicide &amp; why did it matter so much at the time to help them?? Iâ€™ve made my suicidal posts on here a bit but nothing was said to me to make me think â€œI gotta snap outta this ______ is rightâ€
