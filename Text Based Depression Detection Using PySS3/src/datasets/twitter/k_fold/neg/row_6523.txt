And... Back to square one. (I relapsed). :/Everything was going so well today, after attempting suicide 3 times last week I thought I'd got it out of my system. These last two days I've seen myself returning to my "normal" self. My normal self being suicidal yet hanging on. At the moment I'm suicidal. Full stop.

I know I'm too much of a wimp to actually do "it", but with every attempt I'm getting closer and closer to the edge. Last week I waited until the last possible moment to stop myself from going through with it. Two months ago I would just cry into my pillow praying not to wake up in the morning.

I feel like soon it's going to happen, and I'm scared. I don't want to die, I just want to not be me anymore. But I know that this is the only life I'm going to get, I can't kill myself and start again. I can only kill myself. And that's it, game over. I'm torn between wanting to experience the life I dream of and hating the one I'm currently living.

I'm so scared that I'm going to kill myself yet I want to do it so bad. I just feel like there's too much shit for me to work through to ever live the life I want. I'll be 80 by the time I'm free of it all and then I'll be too old to enjoy life as I want to now.
I already have my dream job and my own place, and I'm only 22. But I feel no enjoyment from it, due to my anxiety and depression... And many other "issues".

But when I say the "dream life", I don't mean all that stuff: Jobs and houses and money. I mean feeling happy and being free of my past. I just want to love myself. But I know I'll never get there because week by week I get closer and closer to the edge. I'm just waiting for something to push me off.
