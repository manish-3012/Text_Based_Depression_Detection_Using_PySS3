23m in pain and losing hopeCouple months ago I started getting pains and weird noises in all of my joints. It just keeps getting worse with time. Doctor doesnâ€™t really know what is going on. My TMJ is giving me the most shit. Iâ€™m young and supposed to be in my prime but this is taking a huge toll on me. Some days I wonder if it would be better to end all my problems but Iâ€™m too scared :p
