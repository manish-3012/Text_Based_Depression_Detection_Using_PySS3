Help please.My girlfriend of 3 years cheated and broke up with me. It's been very tough. I dedicated my life to her and cared for her so bad and so hard. That I want her back even after all this. I stayed in the hospital for 6 days after surgery while going through opiate withdrawls myself (I've been clean 2 years. That's one great thing) And. I know I'm talented, funny, and not to bad of a looker. But I just feel broken. Worthless. You ever think about how happiness is just some weird ass illusion? No matter what something bad will happen which will restart the cycle. And I dont think I can take much more. If people with money, wife, kids, and fame still kill themselves then what hope do I have of obtaining happiness? I just don't want to feel empty anymore. Robotic. I'm sorry. I shouldn't becoming to strangers and placing this burden on them. I just really. Really wanted someone to talk to.
