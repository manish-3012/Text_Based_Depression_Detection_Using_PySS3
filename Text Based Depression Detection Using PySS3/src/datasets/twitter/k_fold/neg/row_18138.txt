How do I know if I'm crazy, or enlightened?I know that grandiose ideas are a symptom on mania... and I have some pretty crazy ones.  Idk... it's confusing..  I feel so disconnected from reality.  I'd rather hang out where I get to watch the universe. I trudge through life but I keep having these epiphanies that tell me I need to kill myself to get to my next, better life.  Keep the cycle moving.
