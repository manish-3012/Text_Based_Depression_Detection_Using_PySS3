I tried to kill myself.Last night I tried to kill myself. I have anxiety and depression. Last night it was real bad. I took a bunch of pills. I did not have the guts to take it all. I started feeling dizzy, drowsy, impaired coordination and slow breathing. I lied on the floor waiting for the end. But it did not happen. What do I do now? I have finished up half of my back up pills. I am still dizzy. I have no option 2. Help.
