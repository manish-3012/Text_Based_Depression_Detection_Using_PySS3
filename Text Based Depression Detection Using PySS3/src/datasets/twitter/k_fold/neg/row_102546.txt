I don't know how to carry onI just don't how how to carry on like this. I barely sleep, barely eat and doing even the littlest things is so exhausting. I feel like I'm worthless and unloveable, and those thoughts just won't go away. It's 4am here and I'm on my 4th cigarette, and the dawn feels really far away.
