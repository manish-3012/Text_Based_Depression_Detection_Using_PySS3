Every once in awhileI'm graduating, I have a great GPA, engineering major, work experiance, been trying to find a job. I've been applying nonstop since last August. I keep seeing people around me finding stuff no problem, one guy with less experience and a lower GPA was at it for less than a week. I haven't even heard back from anyone. at all. I might as well have been doing nothing. There's so much stuff I guess I should have done, but I didn't. And I graduate in a few weeks.


I'm getting married in a month. I should be happier, but I'm not. She can tell. There's so much left to do and I just don't want to do any of it.

I have a project due this week. It seems pointless, i'm bored of it, it's the last thing I have to do.


I feel like a failure. That at this point my life is a wreck.


I get some great flash of insight about what to do every once in awhile. Usually it is a new way to approach the problem. Often this new way is to just end it.

I wish something would happen. I wish I wasn't me. I'm so sick of myself.
