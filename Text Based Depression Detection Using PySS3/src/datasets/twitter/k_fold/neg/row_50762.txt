Anyone just never really even know where to begin describing their internal mess?Like I cant even begin. I have a tendency to overdo detail. I'm trying to stop because I know people dont like how much I talk. I used to be somebody people confided in, but now I just talk and am a shit listener. but there are so many issues at once that are so complicated I cant convey the extent of things without providing all that detail.

I do find myself going off into these places where I want to die when things get to be too much. Like if something I tried to do to get myself on he right track doesn't work right, I get set off on this path of destructive thoughts about everything that is wrong.
