When is it acceptable to "vent"?I see thousands of people complaining and venting because they are lgbt or people won't "check their privilege" or "tfw no gf" or "my granny died :("

But the absolute instant i barely mention, or even just think about mentioning, that i have been diagnosed schizophrenia, borderline, autism, psychomotory retardation, and tachicardia since i was  born, and never knew about it until it was too late... suddenly everyone wants my head on a ruby plate. just straight out attempt to murder me like they become feral or something. it feels like I'm in The Walking Dead.

When is it ok to vent? Is it even legal for me at this point? I'm 20 now, i could have been healed, treated, fixed when i was 5 but i can't anymore. I feel like my very existence is a mistake. Because it is. I cause nothing but grief. and destruction.
