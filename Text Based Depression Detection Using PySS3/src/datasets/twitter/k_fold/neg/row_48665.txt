shamei hate myself and i'm so ashamed of myself. i'm so selfish at this point that i really think i could end it all. my life is such a nightmare and i hate the person i've become. i'm a worthless peace of trash. i deserve all of the pain and suffering that i experience and more. i hate how long i've prolonged my suicide. i feel like it's my destiny.
