I have no friends, only strangers who I slightly know.One of my closest friends made me realize we were strangers, probably because it seems I am so distant and afraid to get to know someone. I don't want to be hurt. Having friends only makes me jealous of their other friends and paranoid of whether they actually care or not. 

I have Asperger's which I was diagnosed with when I was 17. I have taken shit and scared people away for all my life for being different. I don't want to scare people away anymore. I just want to go away.

Most people don't see me as the seriously depressive type at work I'm always smiling, laughing, and being social. The people who do know didn't expect it when I was mental hospital for a few days last December. I am holding a terrible charade with my public life.

I just don't want to be in debt anymore, I don't want to be strangers with my friends, and I don't want to feel so godamned depressed.

Edit: Thank you guys.
