Sort of ruined my lifeI got a letter for my college saying I owe them money or else they'll be going to a debt collector. I feel like a criminal - well, more so than I did before. I was in an honors program that covered tuition. I guess when I failed a semester and then proceeded to not talk to fucking anyone because I was too ashamed of being an academic failure, they must've dropped me from the honors program and now I owe tuition. I'm pathetic because I can't muster up the strength to talk to my school. 

It just seems so daunting. I'm so embarrassed by myself. Everyone must think I'm stupid. I think I'm just going to follow through on what I should've done a year and a half ago and just jump off that bridge this Thursday. No one will miss me. My ex was the only person who would've cared but he left because I'm a failure. I feel bad that so many nice people have been victims of these mass shootings, wish I could've taken one of their places.
