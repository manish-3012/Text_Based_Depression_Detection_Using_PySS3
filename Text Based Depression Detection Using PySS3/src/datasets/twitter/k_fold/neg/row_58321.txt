I CANT TALK ABOUT ANYTHINGJust about every time I try to post here, I wuss out because I think my problems are stupid and should stay as fucking inconveniences and they don't. They pile up. In sick of it. I would love to talk about it in person, but not a single person gives a single flying FUCK when I'm trying to be serious. This is a fucked up world. And I promise myself everyday they after high school is over, I'm gonna make out with the barrel of a 12 gauge shot gun so I don't have to deal with this stupid bullshit. Fuck this. Fuck you for reading. Fuck me.
