No one is truly ever there for youThis is stupid Iâ€™m sorry. I never knew my dad, my mom was neglectful and isolated me from my family, I never socialized with anyone growing up so in middle school I was the kid everyone made fun of, but I have friends now. Theyâ€™re the only people I have in my life, but whatâ€™s ridiculous is if they canâ€™t or donâ€™t want to hang out on any given day, I start to remember the time in middle school when I truly had no one and I panic really bad. I donâ€™t project those fears or insecurities onto them, they donâ€™t know about any of my freak outs, but itâ€™s exhausting having to go through that anytime someone dosenâ€™t wanna hang out with me. I feel stupid for having these meltdowns and want them to stop. They havenâ€™t stopped for 6 years so now just to get over the stress once and for all Iâ€™m gonna end my life.
