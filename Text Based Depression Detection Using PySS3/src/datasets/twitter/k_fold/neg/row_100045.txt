Can I Just Die Already?I think this is the best solution. I have Gender Dysphoria, which makes me hate myself. I really just wanna die. I could transition, but I have to tell my parents, and I don't know what they'll think. I worry too much, that's my problem. I worry what they'll do, or think. Will they think I'm weird? Will they support me? And after I do that, I know 2 people right now, that I'm really sure will make fun of me when they find out. And after all that pain. I'll probably look like Shrek. Its not worth it, life's not worth it.
