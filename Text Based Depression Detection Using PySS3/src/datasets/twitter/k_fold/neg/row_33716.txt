Iâ€™m 17, male, I have no friends, no social life, and no courage to talk to anyone.Seems that if I didnâ€™t have family, no one would give a shit if I killed myself. 

It sucks when I see so many people hanging out, and having a social life, and I donâ€™t. Itâ€™s not from a lack of trying. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to people, and get their contact info, and whenever I talk to them, itâ€™s always me starting up the conversation. 

A few months ago, I was a lifeguard, one co worker who was really the only one would I didnâ€™t have to start the conversation with, him and I made plans to go out on eat on a Monday. We invited two other people to join. Well that day came, and the plan never happened. And all day I was waiting for them message. It never came. I was too afraid to message the co worker about it because I knew what the response would be. 

Then later I ask someone else to see if they wanted to hang out three times, and each time they couldnâ€™t do it. And I havenâ€™t asked again because I donâ€™t want to go through the pain of getting the same response again. 

Countless times Iâ€™ve tried to hang out with people, and countless times, I failed. And I just stopped messaging people, because they never messaged me first. If I just died. No one would noticed. I just feel like no one likes me. It hurts me so much. I wish I had people to hang out with or people who at least message me first. But I guess not.
