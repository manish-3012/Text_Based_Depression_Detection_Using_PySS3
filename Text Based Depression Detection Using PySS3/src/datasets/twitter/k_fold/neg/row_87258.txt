callingI feel this weird curiosity with death lately. I am depressed and generally don't enjoy life, but keep trudging on for laughs and to see what happens next. I take it one day at a time. Lately I have been wondering what happens when we die.  I hear a voice telling me how I should die and how I should do it and why it wouln't be so bad. Not sure why this is happening, but it's so convincing sometimes. I'm too poor to pay for a therapist or services. usually the curiosity and excitement of each day is enough to keep me here, but finding out what happens after life seems more and more exciting
