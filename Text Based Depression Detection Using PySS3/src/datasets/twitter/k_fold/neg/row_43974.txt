I'm alone.If you respond to this I probably won't reply, but I'll read it.

I haven't had any strong connections in my life. I'm distant with my family, and my friends all have people who they are closer with. The only time I have ever felt any romantic attraction to someone was either infatuation or idealizing and using them as an outlet for my loneliness. I can act very well. Sometimes I feel something and go through the reactions, but halfway through I'll realize that I'm not even feeling that emotion, just doing what I'm used to doing. If I ever get close to someone or something, I am filled with a horrible feeling of anger. When we first adopted my cat, I held her in my arms and she fell asleep. I was so uncomfortable and angry that I had put her down before I hurt her. When my mom tried on her wedding dress to show me, I felt so angry I was on the verge of tears and had to go be alone for the rest of the night. The minute I feel connected to anyone, a switch is flipped where bonds are now anger. Every single friend I've had, I've gone through around a year long phase where I CAN'T STAND them and am really awful towards them. All I want is to not be lonely, but the minute I have a chance at that, I physically can't be around that person or animal anymore. I don't mean any harm to people, I just can't control myself. I guess people don't see that though. People never get angry at me, they just sort of fade away. If life is all about the connections you make, so what am I supposed to do? One minute I'm content and perfectly fine, and not five minutes later I can barely stop myself from doing things that I won't go into detail about. There's about 1000 more things I could write about but I'll refrain.
