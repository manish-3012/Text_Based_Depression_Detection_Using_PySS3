Have you ever wanted to off yourself to hurt an abuser?I would never kill myself, I canâ€™t because I know how that would affect my family and friends. I know it would devastate my parents and traumatise my siblings. So I keep it all together for them.

But part of the reason (well a good chunk really) why I am suicidal is because my parents are abusive. And whenever they start their shouting or their insults or whatever it takes so much effort to not say â€˜HEY! I wake up every morning resenting the fact that Iâ€™m alive to live another day, it takes so much effort to not open a bottle of bleach and chug the whole thing. Iâ€™m keeping it all together, or trying to, for YOU. So YOU donâ€™t have to go through the trauma of finding my dead bodyâ€™ 

Times where it gets too much, when theyâ€™re hurting me again for the millionth time, I have the thought of killing myself in front of them so they can see my dead body and feel the pain I feel everyday. 

I know itâ€™s extreme and I always tell myself off for thinking this way, but I wanted to know if anybody else thinks this too?
