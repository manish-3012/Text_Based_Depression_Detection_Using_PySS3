I donâ€™t deserve to be happyOk, lemmie start off by saying that some of you will probably be glad to hear that Iâ€™ve sort of been in a good place this past week. I havenâ€™t been a cynical pessimistic little shit to people for once and I havenâ€™t contemplated suicide for the first time in a long time. Iâ€™m just thinking to myself right now â€œAm I actually getting better or am I just having another mood swing?â€ I mean either way I simply feel as though I donâ€™t deserve it, I tell myself that thereâ€™s people out there that are so desperate to feel happy again and they are probably more in need of getting better than I am, cuz it may be too late for me. Since this post, Iâ€™ve now made 6 suicide attempts in my lifetime and counting. (I should really stop attempting unless Iâ€™m truly sure that Iâ€™m gonna go through with it.)
