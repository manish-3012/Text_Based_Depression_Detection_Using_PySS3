Pressure of livingThe past two years have been a complete shit show for me , i fell to all kinds of peer pressure by doing drugs and harming my body in so many ways I really really regret, I've decided to turn around though at the age of 21 but  I'm soooooo lonely and depressed   no friends , I lost alot of friends   , I feel I'm at a delicate transition but I just can't muster the strength to go on and stay clean and keep living. I regret so much which have caused many sleepless nights for me.  HELP
