Need help... suicidal for several monthsIâ€™ve been battling depression for three whole years. Iâ€™m currently in the 8th grade, and this year has made my depression snowball into suicidal thoughts. I honestly have no idea what to do. I have no friends, I have a bad relationship with parents, and Iâ€™ve tried talking to the absolutely incompetent counselor. I know I act like a spoiled, entitled, oversensitive brat- which is just another reason why I find suicide to be an appealing option. In short, I feel hopeless. Nobody cares, nobody looks after me, and nobody understands. The whole school system is a complete mess. Inept teachers, horrible friends, and bullies who get away are the main reasons. Iâ€™m a student who avoids trouble, works hard, and gets good grades, and yet teachers always target me, pick on me, and never recognize my hard work. It hurts my soul during the school awards ceremony to see that a teacher picked a kid that would constantly bully me and who hardly works at all, instead of me. I feel as if my commitment to school is in vain, useless, and as if thereâ€™s zero point of continuing school and even life.

Everything started fine at the beginning of the year. Then, a particular incident occurred, that wronged me so much. Me and a kid were in health class. He took my paper, and I took his pencil in a joking manner. I asked for my paper back. Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s wrong with this kid since he reached his hands out and strangled me THREE whole times. I was doing my best to keep him off me, before having to resort to using my pen and stabbing him. There was blood and ink everywhere. The teacher quickly noticed and demanded an explanation. That kid, who had completely started the incident and escalated it, claimed I stabbed him for no reason. As everybody was staring at me, the teacher simply told the kid to write a report in the office. I asked to go too, as I felt the need to provide my side as well. I arrive at the office, where I write two whole pages detailing the events, everything that unfolded, and how the conflict arose. We got referred to the assistant principalâ€™s office, where we were told to set across from each other. I knew straight away that the principal did not EVEN LOOK AT MY SIDE. HE HAD ZERO IDEA WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT. I argued the stabbing was an act of self-defense, in which he responded by invalidating and completely berating me, about the dangers of ink and potential injury. He attempted to demonstrate â€œproperâ€ self-defense with the behavioral reinforcement teacher. All they acted out was one person shoving another into a corner, and the cornered person pushing him aside. This, to me, was an insult. Had they read my side of the story, they wouldâ€™ve known well that the incident was far different than their demonstration. Every attempt I made to properly explain the incident, the principal called me â€œrudeâ€, â€œdisrespectfulâ€, and â€œirresponsibleâ€. I managed to keep my cool, even though I was extremely pissed off. We both got a day of suspension. Keep in mind that the school did nothing to ensure I was okay, or to confirm my side. When I got home, my parents did not care whatsoever about the incident. They did not care about my safety or anything. Both my mom and dad simply dismissed the incident. I wrote an angry email to the principal from my momâ€™s email account. The email mainly consisted of criticism, moral questions, and how I felt. In the reply, the principal was very unapologetic and made several pathetic excuses, such as not being there, not knowing the full details, and how I never mentioned to him that my life was in danger. Anybody with an OUNCE of logic will know that if somebody tries to strangle you three times, your life is OBVIOUSLY in danger. 

Although this still pisses me off to this day, it has shown a great hatred of school administration and mistrust between my parents, friends, and teachers. I found it amazing that NOBODY sided with me. Despite the fact that the relationship between me and my parents was already rocky, how dismissive and their lack of empathy and care absolutely jeopardized it. Itâ€™s said that once trust is broken, it is never earned back.

I continued to struggle with poor treatment and bullying throughout the rest of the school year. Itâ€™s quite amazing how none of the teachers care about me at all. I always get in trouble, for doing little to nothing. Iâ€™m always targeted, amongst teachers and bullies. I cannot simply sit out in gym due to suicidal thoughts without the teacher berating me, telling me to grow up and â€œstop being immatureâ€. I cannot even go on Reddit when my work is finished, without being written up and given detention. Meanwhile, I witness kids getting away with insane and in some cases, illegal activities. Teachers witness me getting picked on. Teachers watch as I get shoved in the hallway, get called names, and even get me in trouble when I attempt to stand up for myself. Teachers witness my everyday struggles with depression- do they not care to ask me how Iâ€™m doing? No. Nobody cares. Iâ€™m not given the help I need. Help is simply ignored or laughed at when I request it. The school counselor is useless, I have no friends to rely on, and I cannot talk to my parents due to mistrust. I was diagnosed with depression about 1-2 years ago. My doctor gave my parents a business card for a local therapist. My parents laughed at it and never followed up on the therapy. I feel as if my family doesnâ€™t care about or love me, which serves a great example of a dysfunctional relationship. I am introverted, shy, and anti-social. My parents call me a â€œstupid autistic childâ€, without helping me or giving me treatment. I cannot go a day without suicidal thoughts. Chronic suicidal thoughts have been bothering me for several months now. I donâ€™t know who to turn to for help. I need a therapist, but thatâ€™d be impossible since I would need to consult my parents. Suicide seems like the only way out. I need help and I need a way to get it. Any ideas would help a lot. Thank you.
