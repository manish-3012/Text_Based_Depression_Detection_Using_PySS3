Feel so lonely it physically hurts my chestI have friends i talk to occasionally, but it feels like thereâ€™s this huge void making me feel so so so lonely. Like I Iâ€™m torn between wanting to be so alone that i just end up finally getting it over with and holding onto hope that i meet someone I can talk deeper to. Idk probably sounds stupid but I need to rant somewhere about this. Anyone have ways to distract themselves from loneliness besides the obvious?
