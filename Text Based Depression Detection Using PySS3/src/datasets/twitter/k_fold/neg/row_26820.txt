UPDATE 2: CuttertilldeathSo... this is an update on how my life is going now... Original post is from about 5 months ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/lno7o/cuttertilldeath/

The first statement I'll start off by saying is that I have finally been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder aswell as severe anxiety and I might have ADD:?

*UPDATE* I haven't cut for the past few months now.

I used to think about killing myself everyday. Every morning when I woke-up, if something bad happened during the day, and before I went to bed. Before I fell asleep at night I would pray that I wouldn't wake-up in the morning. I just wanted all the pain and all the suffering to be over, and I'd be gone from the world. The people in my life would move on and act as if I was never there. No one would care, and everyone's lives would be a lot easier. My parents, my few friends(if you can even call them that), and my boyfriend. I've had multiple attempts aswell. Planned it all out, left suicide notes, ready to do it, but well as you can see, unfortunately I'm still alive.

*UPDATE*: About 2 weeks ago I jumped out of my 2nd story bedroom window. I'm okay though, I wanted to die but I couldn't get up higher. My left ankles sprained but everything else is fine. My depression medication Wellbutrin XL is working really well, and I love my anxiety medication Klonopin its fucking amazing. I feel so calm and at piece with my surroundings and I don't get tense, anxious, or have any racing thoughts so its great! :D

Boyfriend and I broke-up but I'm doing really well. We broke up about 2 months ago and the great part is, is that he's still my best and closest friend but we don't have that emotional attachment anymore because we're over each other. :D

I do not have any communication with my mother anymore and if I do I am not afraid to stand up/speak up for myself. Assertiveness &amp; Mindfullness is key! :D
