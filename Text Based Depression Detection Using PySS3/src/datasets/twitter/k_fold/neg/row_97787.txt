Not sure why writing this but want toWill be 30 in few months and realized I wasted my life and there are zero reasons to continue this 

I have tried killing myself in past but wasn't able to do it properly, ending up with therapy sessions and all that shit which doesn't help 

Will try one more time soon after researching enough about the perfect way to end it so that I die in seconds and don't end up in hospital or some other shit place 

Hope my mom dad forget me in few weeks, it will be painful for them but there is no other way left
