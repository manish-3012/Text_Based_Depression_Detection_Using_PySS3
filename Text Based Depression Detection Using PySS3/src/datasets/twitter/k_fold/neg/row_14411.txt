I think I'm going to kill myself tonightI don't even know why I'm posting, probably the part of me that wants to hold on, the is done though.

I've tried dozens times before, as recently as last week, but I think this time is going to be the one that works because I'm taking control out of my hands once I try so there's no wussing out at the last second.

Seriously, why am I posting? I don't feel like I'm one person, but hopefully it wont matter after tonight.
