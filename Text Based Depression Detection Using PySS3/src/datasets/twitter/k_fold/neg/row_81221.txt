Thinking of it. Again.Second time posting here. Probably not a good thing, eh?

It's the same as last time,, just the feelings are far stronger. I'm sick of being alone, I only have one friend whom I only see at the end of each month, I can't talk to literally ANYONE so I can't just go out and make friends, /r/r4r is fucking useless, I'm 22 and beginning to think I'm gonna be living with my mother, jobless, loveless and a virgin at 50, and NOT out of choice like some of those "absinence is key" freaks you hear about sometimes. Dude, if I get the chance, I wanna get laid, how many times were you dropped on your goddamn head to think sex is a no-no or some shit? 

Probably less times than I wanna bash myself in the head with a fucking sledgehammer.

I live in Biritish Columbia Canada. The Okanagan. So, hey, if you do too, and you think you could save me, be my guest, give it a shot. But at this point? Not even the thought of what my death will do to my mother is keeping me at bay.

I just wanna end it. 

And I can. At anytime. There IS a gun in this house...
