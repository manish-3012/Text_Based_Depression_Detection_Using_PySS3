Please Help :)/ :(I'm really fucking depressed. I'm so depressed I think I've lost my own sanity because I don't know what emotion to feel, happiness or sadness. I see these horrible things and I just wish I had the money/power to make it right, but what's a 16 year old kid to do with no car or money. I'm pretty smart I'd like to think, but that doesn't get me anywhere. Every human I've ever come in contact with misunderstands me and I just can't take this anymore I really need help.
