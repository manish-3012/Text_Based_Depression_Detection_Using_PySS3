Letters are written, hope I am not forgetting anyoneI am a monster and the pain of my leaving will fade. The pain I cause my family in my life is constant. The scab is being re-torn off over and over. I am a bad person. I am a MONSTER. My best friend confirmed this to me. I do not believe in any sort of after life, but I hope one exists so that I may see my son's faces again. They are beautiful, but I am an ugly creature. I am the problem. Eliminate the problem. Fix the problem.
