I hate my life and i feel old and wasted at 22i hate that i was forced into a engineering program. i cant even do the programs by myself i have to have my dad do them for me. it sucks that being in an engineer program added an extra year so all my friends from highschool are now working. my friends from high school are mostly not even in computer science they're in business, enviornmental scienses, biology anyhting but fucking engineering. I hate that my dad has this hope that i will become a software engineer when i fucking dont want to. I want to work in marketing or somewhere in the business field and do youtube and instagram blogging on the side. Tbh i feel like i could make more money doing that than if i were to force myself into a coding job. Everytime i do something a bit good like get a good grade in a computer science test( i am amazing at memorizing crap from comp sci tho) he has this glimmer of hope that i will become an engineer one day and i fucking hate that.


i have to pass this hard ass algorithm class in the next 4 weeks while taking a gaming programming class and im dying even tho i get a lot of help with the code from my dad but theres still a ton of math to learn. sometimes i just want to give up and change my major to biz econ but then i know that if i just complete these 2 classes then i can take the easpy peasy javascript and sql classes as electives senior year and still get my engineering degree.

i dont know i feel so unfairly treated it sucks a lot
