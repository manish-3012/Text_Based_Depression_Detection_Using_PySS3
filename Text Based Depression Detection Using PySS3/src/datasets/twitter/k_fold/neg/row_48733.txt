Anxiety is going to be the death of meI just cannot cope anymore, anxiety and depression have been big parts of my life since I was 10, I'm 30 now and have had both good and bad times, this is a particularly bad time because my ability to pretend I'm OK, which I've always had, has really shrunk, with my self confidence, over the past few months. Nothing much has changed but I feel extremely suicidal. In fact, I feel at my happiest, calmest and most content when I think of suicide. I am not far from it right now. I do have a plan but I don't have a time or date. Has anyone experience of being in this place?

I take quetiapine, mirtazapine and pregabalin, I think they've destroyed a part of me, they keep the anxiety at bay sometimes but what's the point when they've taken away all the good parts there used to be of me? Does anyone else have experience of meds like this? I can't see a point in carrying on, except to save some family pain of my suicide, which is important, but I'm feeling this reason not to go ahead with my plan is getting smaller and smaller in my head.
