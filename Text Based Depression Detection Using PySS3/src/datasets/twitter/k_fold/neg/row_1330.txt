I could've ended it years agoI'm staying alive, hoping that something good happens.

It feels like watching a tv show and you'd usually like the first episode but you didn't, so you keep giving each episode a chance in hopes they turn out to be good.

But it's not? hope can be poisonous, at the same time, it can be the only thing that keeps me going.
