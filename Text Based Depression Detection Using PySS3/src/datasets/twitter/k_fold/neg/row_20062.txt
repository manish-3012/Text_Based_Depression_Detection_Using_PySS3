I don't really know what I'm meant to type hereI'm sorry, I don't really know what I'm meant to say here I just really wanted to have somebody to talk to.

Uh six months ago, my only friend passed away and I've been trying really hard to make new friends but people don't seem to like me.
I've always been sorta depressed but it's never been this bad before and I don't know what I'm meant to do anymore. I can't talk to my family anymore and I can't remember the last time I went a whole day without a little panic attack about the future and I'm starting to make myself really sick.

Anyway, thanks for just letting me tell somebody.
