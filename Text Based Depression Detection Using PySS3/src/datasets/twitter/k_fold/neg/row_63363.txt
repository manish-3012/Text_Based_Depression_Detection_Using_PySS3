I donâ€™t want to live but I donâ€™t want to die...Iâ€™ve been absolutely isolated from society ever since quarantine started, but things got better when my gf started coming over a lot to my place. I have a disease that prevents me from going to school, (Cystic Fibrosis) and thatâ€™s already sad in itself. So now Iâ€™m stuck in zoom calls all day trying to keep my shit together and not have another breakdown with what I think is bi-polarity, when all of a sudden I get a call from my gf. Iâ€™m excited, havenâ€™t seen her in a while, and now I just donâ€™t have a gf, I donâ€™t see an end to the pain and sadness, I want out but I want to keep going cuz I know thereâ€™s chances it might get better. Iâ€™m hanging on to dear life not to just run away, be done with everything.
