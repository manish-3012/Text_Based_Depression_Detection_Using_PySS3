Nothing seems to matter anymore to meSooo this is seemingly an atypical reason for suicidal thoughts. I'm not actually depressed. I have no mental disorders, besides BDD, but that's unrelated to this issue. I'm just contemplating ending my own life because nothing fucking matters to me anymore.

I'm about to turn 18, on the 11th actually, and I begin university in two days. The issue is, I just don't care about the future, or anything in my life right now. My family is dysfunctional and I don't really truly love any of them, I neither have nor really want a romantic relationship (prior trauma has poisoned me against intimacy), and friends have been growing distant. Not distant through any fault of their own, but I can tell that our paths are diverging. 

The people around me all have hopes and dreams, aspirations. Things they want to do in life. To me, it all just seems so fucking boring. I chose my path in uni (english, philosophy minor) because it seemed like the path I would hate the least, not enjoy the most. 

I want nothing. I feel nothing. I'm not sad about having no reason to live or continue, it's just an unfortunate fact about me. I don't want to hurt myself, I don't think lowly of myself. My life just feels like it's over, and dragging it out any longer would be a disservice. I'm ready to see what's after, if anything.

In case it comes up, I am not fully religious or atheist. It's not something I ever think about, really. Honestly, no afterlife or a finite one is the most appealing to me, I would hate to just exist in a state of consciousness for eternity. You would run out of new experiences so quickly and then it's just an eternity of boredom. I'd rather just cease to exist, much less hassle.

Just figured I'd post here to give some of you good Samaritans that frequent here a different case to the norm, but feel free to move past and go to someone whose struggle is more active. Thanks for reading, anyway.
