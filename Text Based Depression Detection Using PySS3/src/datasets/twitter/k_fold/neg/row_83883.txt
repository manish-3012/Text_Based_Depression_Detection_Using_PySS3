Lost my boyfriend. My grades. And now my car. Its overI was in a crash today. Earlier before that i had ghosted all of my friends and blocked everything, deleting all my social media and art presence online. I had a perfect driving record, now I will never drive again, because the crash was my fault. I ruined everything. I lost my grades and now I'm going to fail a class when LITERALLY LAST SEMESTER I had all A's. All year I've been afraid of germs and tonight i learn it gets so much worse than getting sick. There is no good in this world. And i want to just escape.

I am sick and tired of hearing that life gets better. Everyone has told me for the past days. Read my other posts. The problem is that in the back of my mind i believed people, a part of me believed it gets better. It doesnt. It never will. I never will drive again. I never will go to school again. I never will love again. I never will go outside again. What is left? I cant even breathe anymore. Im done. Goodbye.
