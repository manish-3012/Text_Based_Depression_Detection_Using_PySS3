helphelp... i'm feeling suicidal.. reached out to my friends but no one cares.. broke up with my ex to give me space to recover and be normal before getting back together again and now he's fallen out of love with me... my dad is dying but my parents dont want me to come home because they think im a failure of a daughter... there's no one to turn to for help.. i can't afford a counsellor... there's nothing to look forward to in life and rationally even if i recover there's no happiness for me or any meaning in life.... i've been verbally and emotionally abused by my parents, even hit by them a few times, threatened to be sent to the mental hospital and have my life ruined by the records. some bitch i thought was my friend many years ago encouraged me to cut so i could be her guinea pig, she wanted to be a psychiatrist. (i've overcome the cutting but still get anxiety attacks) and most recently a guy who liked me and was chasing me spiked my drink and haha... did stuff... i dont really want to go on living anymore... there's no point and no happiness out there for me.... and everything that's happened has changed me so much i can't function normally anymore. i just want a normal life and people who care and im grateful that me and my ex are still best friends but what else in there in life for me anymore... i just want to go... i really want my ex back... he's the first time i've ever known happiness but its also unfair to him to have to carry my burdens and  i love him and know that he cant have a happy normal life with me... i want to be capable of a happy normal life.... he's taught me what happiness this world has to offer but now i can't have any of it...
