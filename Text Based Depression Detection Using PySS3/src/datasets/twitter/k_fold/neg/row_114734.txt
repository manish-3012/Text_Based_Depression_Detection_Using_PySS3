I just had a "What is the point of all this?" moment.It was nice out for a change so I went for a walk to the shore. I sat on a seawall for about 30 minutes and for the first third was nice and calm. Then for no real reason I can't think of I just got terribly depressed, looked around and felt like just jumping in, and walking in deep (can't swim). 

I've not had a thought like that in some time. Last time was about 4 months ago waiting for a train and I just thought, without fear "What if I just jump down?" 

Now I'm going back in my cycle of seeing/feeling that I have no real goals or prospects, no "marketable" skills, no friends, no job... ect fill in the rest. I've cried enough over the last weeks and I simply can't anymore so now I'm back to my regular self, Staying in bed all day pressing F5 over and over.
