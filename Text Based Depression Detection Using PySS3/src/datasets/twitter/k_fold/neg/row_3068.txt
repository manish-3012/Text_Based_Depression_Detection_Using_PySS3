What am I supposed to do if things can't ever get better?I have no avenues in life, no skills, no talents, no one that would care for any extended amount of time if I up and dropped. I struggle to relate and understand others with out just getting jealous and hateful inside of them. I'm a financial burden whos incapable of holding a job. Im a pathetic failure and if I was to just drop alot of heartache and problems would be solved for everyone. The only thing that been stopping me is my fear of what happens after, but more and more I'm afraid of waking up again the next day more than dying. I feel so alone and lost and confused I don't know what to do anymore.
