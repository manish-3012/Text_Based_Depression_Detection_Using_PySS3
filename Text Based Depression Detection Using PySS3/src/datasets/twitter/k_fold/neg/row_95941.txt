Living for others; not myselfI've been diagnosed with depression for the last four years. I've felt so apathetic, but then I fell in love. She made me feel like I was living, but now she makes me want to die even more. We dated for less than a week only for her to break it off because she was dating someone else, someone who I very much dislike. Yet she wanted to be friends, and I can't say no to her, so now she treats me like a mistress. We cuddle and she comes to me with her problems but she also brings up how she's dating him. I feel so horrible for basically cheating with her. 

What's kept me going this long has been not wanting to hurt the people close to me. I just imagine them being sad at my passing and I don't want them to be sad, but now I care so much less about them. When the people closest to me treat me like that I just don't know if I should care so much. I don't even feel like living a life solely for others is good at all. 

I know something is holding me back since I'm here rather than jumping off a bridge, but I don't feel like I'm even living for good reasons anymore, if ever.
