I'm thinking of jumping off a bridge nearby. I'm pretty sure the impact will kill me.I've lost all hope and can't find enjoyment in anything, and so I've decided this is what I might do. I think jumping from a tall place will be the quickest way, and that way I don't need to worry about having second thoughts. Like medication overdose.

I do wish I could make it more meaningful, but in reality I'll probably just be another number and another static. My story won't matter.
