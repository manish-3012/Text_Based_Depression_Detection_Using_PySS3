22 and over itWhat's the purpose? Go to school, get a job, get a wife, have kids, grow old, and die. Death catches up to us no matter how amazing of a life we live. I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was like 12. I'm in my senior year of college with at least another 4 ahead of me in grad school. I want to do pediatric occupational therapy and work with the special needs population, but what's the fucking point? Family and friends are dropping left and right. The healthiest people I know are getting cancer and the scummiest dwellers continue to succeed. I really do not see a purpose to life anymore. My whole life I've pushed the idea away because my family would be heartbroken, but who the fuck cares anymore. It's a selfish act, but there's more little ones at home. They'd get over it. I work, I go out numerous times a week, I live a very "fulfilled" life, but it just seems utterly pointless. Maybe I'm missing something here, but how many of you can honestly say that it all isn't a waste of time and energy? Look up at the stars at night. It helps you realize just how fucking irrelevant each one of us is in the bigger picture.
