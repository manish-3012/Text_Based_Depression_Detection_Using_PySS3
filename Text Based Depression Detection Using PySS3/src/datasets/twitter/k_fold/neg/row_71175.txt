A pen and red wine.Ignored the red flag about sharp weapon in a pencil case. Oh dear, maâ€™am, I just happened to grab it and god knew what happened. Loved the taste of red wine on a wrist. Dear, best friend, please never scream when you see me being covered with red wine and pen marks, itâ€™s going to be okay.
