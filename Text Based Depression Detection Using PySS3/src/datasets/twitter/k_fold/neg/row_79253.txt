I'm in France, broke, and suicidal... I've tried all the affordable help but it's not working.I've been depressed and anxious since childhood. I have the necessary tools to commit suicide eventually in my Amazon cart just waiting for that day. With panic attacks, self-harm, and being in a sexually abusive relationship for years, and being bullied no matter how many times I changed schools, the pain and self-doubt has only intensified. Sure, I do have "good days" sometimes but I always end up back at the bottom of the well.

So I'm asking if anyone knows of resources (financial or for mental health help) in France or that applies to France with it being in the EU, please let me know. I'm only 22 and really don't know much about these things as I've haven't lived in this country my whole life... Thank you so much for any kind of support you sent to me or anyone in my situation.
