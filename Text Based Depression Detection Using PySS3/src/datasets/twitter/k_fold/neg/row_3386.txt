Friendship finally ended of 8yrs now they are talking about suicide (text in post)I truly wish I could explain every little detail of this from beginning to end so that I can paint a clear picture because this friendship has been a very VERY complicated one. The best I can do is think of all the cliff notes and put them down as I think of them. (WARNING: This is probably gonna be a loooooong read but I feel all the info is needed to paint a clear picture because life is complicated and can't be black and white)

**Also I will have the full text she sent me at the very bottom

- She has multiple mental issues depression being a big one

- For the past year we have been FWB

- She loves me but I don't feel the same (trust me we have talked into detail and she knows "I'll never want to be with her")

- She treats our friendship like we are in a relationship (this is the big kicker to me just ending this friendship outright)

- She has talked about cutting and has cut herself many times

- She has talked about suicide but as far as taking pills hasn't ever fully committed as she says she cares to much about her pets having no one to take care of them.  (4 ferrets and 3 cats)

- She lives in what could only be explained a shack with a drunk/meth head father, she is pretty much homeless but works for Amazon as a driver.

- I truly have tried to be there for her and help her as best I can emotionally and truly am able to blame myself for not being able to deal with her anymore

- I ended the (toxic?) friendship sadly the only way it could have ended. (Our friendship has almost ended several times already but neither of us went through with it in the end after I guess talking it out) how I ended it was being very distant only saying pretty much the same thing of, "its you now leave me alone" (PLEASE REFER TO NEXT POINT(s) ABOUT THIS) as I knew the only way this friendship was going to end was for her to hate me.

- I have tried my best AS A FRIEND to be there for her as best I can. It feels like it was never good enough. She would always apologize for acting a certain way yelling, getting mad at me, insulting me. But if I did anything wrong I would essentially be verbally abused/insulted until I take blame essentially. Again it fell like she wanted to be there for her like the equivalent of a boyfriend.

- EVERYWEEK for a bit over a year I dedicated one whole day to hangout with her and another day after work and I would stay with her till 10pm

- I am not going to say I was perfect in this friendship but if I was not answering a text within 10 minutes of her sending or if I did not text back because there was nothing added to the conversation to actually keep it going I would ALWAYS get answers back that were along the lines of (actual texts by the way)
-----It doesn't matter you don't give a shit anyway
-----There are so many things you just haven't answered and I have given up trying to get answers from you.   Because I know to you the question means nothing which is why i didn't get an answer
-----Im going to go die now
-----Should i be Apologizing 
-----Goodnight i guess ðŸ¤·â€â™€ï¸ 

 It's obvious enough that you don't wanna talk to me
-----I feel like I should just leave you alone forever and you would be a lot happier. Is that what i should do? 

- She talks to me about her dreams a lot almost always featuring me

- Our sex was ungodly amounts of good, like I am sure would make everyone jealous good and probably will never have sex that good ever again. BUT that was not even a single reason why I stayed friends with her. Though she now thinks otherwise and has in the past sayjng I used her as a cumdumpster

- I have told her and truly ment that I understand to some capacity her mental issues. (I listened to a podcast on mental illness that finally made it click for me and it was insane! No amount of videos, articles that I read ever made sense to me bu this one finally did it)

- If I missed a question that she asked me while I was at work and I somehow missed it or never answered instead of asking it again i was told to find it or I got this kind of text
-----No but it's fine,  i just double checked you never answered my last question Monday which was a curiosity question

- I almost always would head over her house if she had a bad day

- On her birthday I stayed the night with her cuddling as we slept as i always declined sleeping in the same bed/staying the night (i wanted to make it clear that it was out of friendship)

- my hugs always made her feel better

- me being around always made her feel better

- i didn't have to talk to make her feel better as long as I was there holding her

- i was pretty much her rock 

- i was finally mentally broken down from being put down over and over again if I was not this perfect friend she wanted me to be it feels like

- if she was having a rough day she would essentially want me to just say something rather then nothing. But I can't just do that i can't think of what to say half the time and if i try to say something ot felt like the wrong thing and if i don't it was the wrong thing (we have discussed this before)

- *My brain is racked right now ill add more as I think of them*

** The text**

Since I know you blocked me I figured I should just say this anyway. Maybe one day you'll go into your blocked messages.  I have decided not going to live anymore I have decided on how I'm going to do it,  So hopefully by this time next week I will be dead.  I  Don't know how to live in this world without you anymore, i just can't do it.  If I'm successful like i think I will be, just know you mean everything to me.  I was holding on because of you.  All the support in the world couldn't help me once you left.  You'll be getting a gift from me and I'll be making sure you get your game back with some weed for the future.  The gift will prob arrive after I'm already gone.  I'm sorry i couldn't have done more and I'm sorry i couldn't be strong enough without you.  I would Always miss you.  Goodbye my person,  my bestfriend heart and soul.
