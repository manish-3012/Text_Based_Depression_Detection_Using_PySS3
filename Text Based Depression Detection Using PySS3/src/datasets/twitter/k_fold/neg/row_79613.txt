On and off suicidal thoughtsThere are some instances in my life where I feel like I have the power to do anything in the world. Sometimes I feel like I have a very clear and concise plan for what I want to do with my life when it comes to choosing a career in college.

On the other hand, when any obstacle such as exams or studying gets in the way of what I want to do, I immediately resort to contemplating suicide and wanting to harm myself. I have tried to self harm in the past but I was too scared to cut my wrists with a knife. 

My mind is absolutely fucked up. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™ll be able to take this.

Any advice on how to deal with this? I would really like some help right now. I canâ€™t talk to anyone I know about this in real life without being a burden to them.
