I'm feeling completely alone. No family, shit job. Seemingly too old to make new connections with peopleI'm in my mid 30s, parents passed away several years ago, no real family to speak of left. I have two daughters, but am rarely allow to see them and when I do my ex wife makes me feel like shit about whatever she can.

 Cant seem to find a good job after fucking up a DOT drug test several years ago. After child support, I'm barely scraping by. 

Friends are mostly too busy with their own familys now. 

Women my age are looking for somebody that can afford to support a family, and that isn't me. 

I've dealt with depression most of my life. And I know it drives people away eventually. But I start getting really bad when I feel totally alone and that just makes it worse, which leads people to not want to be around me even more. It been a reoccurring issue in my relationships. 

Nothing I do seems to improve my station in life, and it only seems to get worse as debts and bills pile up that I can't afford. 

I think the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because nobody would be there to feed my dog.
