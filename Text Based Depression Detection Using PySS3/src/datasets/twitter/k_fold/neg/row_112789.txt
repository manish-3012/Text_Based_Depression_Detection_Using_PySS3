Any Ideas?Sorry in advance, this will be a mess I'm just going to write what comes to mind.

I can't relate to anything I feel so distanced from the world, I've been down since I was 16 with a few little high points that fade so quickly I can't remember anything other than that I did feel a little better occasionally. I have been losing interest in everything I was once interested in, My family do nothing, my friends are all overseas and have changed so much since high school that I can't really connect with them like I used to. I am unhappy at work and live totally alone in a 1 room flat thing 5 days a week which allows me to be alone with my thoughts a lot. I try to find content on this stuff and how to fix it but i find it always seems to miss the mark talking about 'ending the pain' I really don't understand that for me it's much more a lack of any feeling at all I just live day to day. I have been slowly introducing my friends and family to the idea that I am pro-suicide in a way e.g "People say suicide is selfish but I think expecting somebody to live in misery just so that you don't have to feel bad for a little while is selfish", stuff like that. I can't think of much more to add right now but I guess that little insight may be enough for someone to be able to suggest something to try to improve my quality of life, I have been trying to fix it myself to no avail.
