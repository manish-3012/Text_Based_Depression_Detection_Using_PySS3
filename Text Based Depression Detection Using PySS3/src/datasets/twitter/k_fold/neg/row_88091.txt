i cant find a reason to stayhonestly, im struggling right now. my antidepressants arent working, my parents dont know what to do with me, my best friend started to ignore me because he cant handle me anymore and quite frankly everything around me is crumbling apart. my therapist said that im gonna get better but i cant believe her. im so utterly exhausted from the total beat down my depression and life have given me that i cant take it anymore. im only 15 for fucks sake i should be out with friends not stuck in my bed contemplating wether or not life is worth living. and quite frankly, i cant find a reason why it is worth living.
