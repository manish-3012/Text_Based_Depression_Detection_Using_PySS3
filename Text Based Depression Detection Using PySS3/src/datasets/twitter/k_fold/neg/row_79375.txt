Is dying by blood loss too painful??I have been thinking really hard about killing myself, but I dont want to fail, I read that sleep pills and hanging have quite the chance to fail 

So I thought about a gun, but I cant afford one, neither do I know where to buy one

So I searched more, and I found death by inhalation of gas, like nitrogen or something, but I dont know how to do it or where to buy some

So I came to the conclusion, that maybe slitting my wrists would be the better solution, but I am afraid if it will hurt way too much or take too long
