Idk what to do It's been 2 years of endless pain and suffering, I suffer a skin infection and it's spreading rapidly, I've been trying to go to a doctor, trying traditional herbs, etc, but nothing really cure it.
 I'm depressed, I stopped going to school for 2 months, the scar and everything is making me lose my confidence.
 Maybe it's a matter of time that I had enough, my family keep telling me to pray and pray and pray it's driving me crazy, the only thing that keeping me from killing myself is my promise to someone who don't even care or love me anymore.
 I just want to be free from this, I'm tired.
