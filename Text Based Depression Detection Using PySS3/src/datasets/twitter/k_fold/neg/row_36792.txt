Thinking of ending it.I donâ€™t know where to start. I just feel like Iâ€™m at the absolute bottom of societys â€tier listâ€ if that makes sense. Iâ€™m an ugly autistic transgender lesbian. Iâ€™ve been sexually and emotionaly frustrated for 4 years, and I need someone to be there for me, emotionally and sexually.

Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I need sexual release to function as a human, but whenever I play with myself, I break down and cry because no oneâ€™s there to do that with me, so I donâ€™t get a sexual release, leading to me being an even worse person. I donâ€™t know what to do. I hope I get raped, idk.
