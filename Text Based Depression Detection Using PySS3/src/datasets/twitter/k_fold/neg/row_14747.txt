I'm losing hope all the timeI'm getting incredibly depressed because I feel like my other mental disorders are preventing me from being able to live a normal life. I don't like myself, I feel dumb and worthless, like I can't do anything or be friends with anyone. I want to live a normal Life and not be stupid. I want to be treated just like everyone else and not more friendly and respectful because I have issues but I also feel like my issues are preventing me from being serious and being able to handle stuff. I want to have a nice job, have relationships with people and maybe have a family, I don't want to end up having to work a minimum wage job at Goodwill and live in my mom's house and not have any friends or anything. I try so hard to try and find my calling in life but then my issues come in and fuck it all up and I feel worthless again. It's a stupid reason to feel depressed but I absolutely hate having these issues and being labeled as special or disabled. I'm sorry if I offend any of you with my words or anything but it's the truth and it's the reason why. I feel like I'm going to slip and fall into a deep depression and end up taking my life, I try hard to be normal and find my calling or friends or anything but I can't, and I'm starting to give up.
