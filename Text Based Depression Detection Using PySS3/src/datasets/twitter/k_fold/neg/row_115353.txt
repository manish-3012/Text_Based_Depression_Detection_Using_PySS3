I Wrote My Suicide Note TodayToday, I wrote a note for my intended suicide six months from now. I have a debilitating neurological disorder that has made my life miserable. Everyone is complaining about COVID-19 quarantine? I've been socially distancing for years. Haven't worked in two years, haven't exercised in two years, haven't done anything in two years.

I am a shell of a human being. Doctors keep saying, maybe this med, maybe this med, maybe this med, but at this point, I'm just so tired of hoping for the next miracle. There is none. My life is exhausting. Waking up is exhausting. Eating is exhausting. Typing is exhausting. Sitting is exhausting. Standing is exhausting. Sleeping is exhausting. I haven't felt rested in two years.

I'm 26. This illness has stolen my twenties. I want to be a dad. I'm not going to be, I can't put this on children. I want to be a husband. I can't burden someone else with this. I'm a drain on my parents, I've been fighting with social security for two years, and I just want to be independent again. I want to work again. I want to hike again. I want to work out again. I want to be human again. It's just not happening.

I don't want to end my life. But the thing is, I've been dead for years. Killing my body isn't really going to change much.

So I'm giving it six months. Six more months to hope and pray that social security comes through, or that I'm cured, or that something changes. Six months.

And then I'm going to send my friends and family the note I wrote today.
