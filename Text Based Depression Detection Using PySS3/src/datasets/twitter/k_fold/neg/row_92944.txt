VentI have work today and I want to die.

I actually don't hate my job. I find it fulfilling in a lot of ways, or I have in the past. I'm regularly texting a friend who I like and while I can't talk about being suicidal I feel like I've managed to keep the topics positive and cheery and our interactions are going well. I've been taking my medication regularly, going to the gym, and losing weight. I'm taking classes to prepare for a career that I am committed to and that will pay well.

I still want to die.

This is as good as it gets for me. I'm employed, have money, have friends, am healthy.... And yet none of it helps. I feel like I am choking. And every time I swallow the urge to talk about it I choke a little more.

How can I have any hope for my existence when even during the best case scenario I feel like this?

I just want to do something to help the world before I go. I'm trying to be strong until then. Maybe if I help others my existence will feel meaningful.
