Suicide is my only option.I'm too lazy for life. I can barely keep working anymore. I legit took a whole week off and am already dreading the thought of having to go back. If it was an option, I would just lie down in bed till I die. I have passions, but I'm too lazy for those as well. I look at what I should do to get closer to achieving my dream, but it's just such a chore. The thing is, I can ask for help and have people give me exactly the advice that I need, but I wont act upon it. I'm too lazy for that. It's weird because I want to achieve my dreams and do what is necessary to fix my life, but I just won't. It's too much work. I think I'm done with life. What a waste.
