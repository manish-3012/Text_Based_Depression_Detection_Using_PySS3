Killing myself tonight, this is my last post everOn this day, October 7th 2020 I'm finally ending my life. I have no reason to stay. No passions. No talents. And all the few online friends I've got decided to ignore me. I get really anxious waiting for anyone to reply but it doesn't happen. It's not like my death will change anything in their lives anyway.. It's better that way, an insignificant person like me who's already dead inside must really die.
