Posted this in r/Depression. Upon reflection it should go here I'm fighting every day to not kill myself. The urge to go out into the mountains with nothing but my wits and fighting for my life is something I fight every day. Will I die? Most likely, but at least I'll die like a human being. I'm tired of being a slave to a system where I'll work until I'm too old to work but "not old enough to die". I cant go to college anymore because of mental illnesses, I can barely work in spite of them. There's no future for me, no recovery, no hope.

I'd rather die a free man than live a slave.
