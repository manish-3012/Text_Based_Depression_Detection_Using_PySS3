Tired of being aroundNo oneâ€™s gonna see this but I just want to put my thoughts down somewhere. Iâ€™m just tired of being around, I donâ€™t have hope that iâ€™ll make it in the job I want, I study wildlife conservation and maybe thatâ€™s a waste of time and Iâ€™ll end up in a warehouse job or the same waitressing job that gives me nightmares because my anxiety skyrockets every shift. I donâ€™t fit in anywhere, iâ€™m so different to all my family and I canâ€™t confide in them or relate to them in any way. I donâ€™t fit in with my friends either there just arenâ€™t any common interests. I just donâ€™t belong socially, no hope for a future. Iâ€™m in uni and on my own and since i started iâ€™ve just been self destructing with skipping antibiotics, disappearing drunk on nights out, getting too drunk and embarrassing myself, smoking, i had sex with an older man for money, sleeping around, and iâ€™d take any drug offered to me. I have little regard for my own safety because maybe iâ€™ll die by accident and I wonâ€™t have to end it myself, thatâ€™s the ideal situation. I donâ€™t feel this â€œimmense depression that I cannot cope withâ€ I just feel like iâ€™m not meant to be around and I donâ€™t belong here. I want to see what happens afterwards. Sorry for typing a wall of negativity but maybe someone out there sees this?? Thanks for reading this far if you do
