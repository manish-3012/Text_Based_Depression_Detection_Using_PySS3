Question to suicidal people.Do you see yourself as a nice person? 
Is it possible that all of us are good people that just get fucking walked on by assholes? 
And after a thousand things go wrong... 
When things seem like they can't get any worse
When it feels you can't get any closer to the edge.
All the people we help, never fucking help us back
Even if they eventually get into a position that they are able to. Despite everything you did for them. 

And honestly. 
That's the least of my worries. I'm losing my dad whom I'm dependent on because he's old and I dropped out of school to take care of him. Hospital bills in 6 digits with $300 in my bank account. (which has to last me a couple weeks at least.) 

I have a drug test in 6 hours for a pretty good job. Got the job on short notice. Had no idea that I would even have this opportunity anddd.. 
I know I'm going to fail it. (I smoked a lot of weed. 5 days clean but was an extremely heavy user.) 
Going to try to sneak clean urine in. If caught potentially facing some jail time. 


If I don't get this job. I'm likely gonna be homeless in a couple weeks. I have nobody to fall back on. I have no car. I rent my living situation. I'm fucked. 
Every other job I've applied to for months has ignored or rejected me. 
I have no opportunity. And it seems like every single day more shit goes wrong. 

I'm fucked and it feels the only way out is painting my brains on the walls. 
I've called suicide hotlines 7 times this month and am on a first name basis with John at this point. 

I talk to him casually but he doesn't know I'm standing on the ledge of a bridge (the fall would kill me. ) and I stand there balancing on one foot. 
Sometimes I get wobbly and feel an adrenaline rush. 
I could easily slip and fall any of the times I do this and never have to worry about any of this again.
