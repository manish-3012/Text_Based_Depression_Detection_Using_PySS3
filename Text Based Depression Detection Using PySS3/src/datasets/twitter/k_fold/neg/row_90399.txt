I cannot seem to die.My attempt at hanging myself failed again. I donâ€™t know how else to die without causing as much harm to others. Iâ€™m sick of dealing with depression. Iâ€™ve seen many therapists and psychologists, they didnâ€™t help much. I donâ€™t know how to continue going to school in this state. I hate skipping lessons because of my mental health. Even when I force myself to attend school, I end up having panic attacks so I rather stay home. I just want to end this life right now, and Iâ€™m angry that after attempting suicide multiple times Iâ€™m still alive.
