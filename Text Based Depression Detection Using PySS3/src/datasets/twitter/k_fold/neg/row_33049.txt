I am tired. I am selfish. I am afraid.What in the hell am I doing here? What do I say? Am I saying this for me, or for you? I don't even know.  I am all mixed up inside and feeling awfully alone and lost. 

I am tired of acting a jerk. I am tired of hurting and feeling hurt. I am so incredibly tired of telling everyone that I will be just fine. Tired of taking it one day at a time. Tired. So tired.

Why did I think I could make this work? I am afraid.
