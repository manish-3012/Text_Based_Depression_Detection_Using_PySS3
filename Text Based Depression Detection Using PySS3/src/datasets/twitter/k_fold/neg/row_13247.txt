Just had my girlfriend of 4 years break up with me because I love shooting up drugs more than I love her.Title says it all. She was all I had, everything else I've burned to the ground. She has been my rock in my low times. Now I'm hungry, moving in with my parents, broke, 0 self esteem and want a reason to live. Somebody tell me it gets better.

I shoot up heroin or any other opiates I can get my hands on.
