I want to tell my therapist butI want to tell my therapist that Iâ€™m thinking of ending my life but Iâ€™m scared to do it. I donâ€™t want to end up in the hospital again, and even though Iâ€™ve got a good job, family and friends who love me, and a lot of things to live for. I still find myself feeling broken and lonely from a single event. I keep thinking about when I was happy and how I destroyed my own happiness and deserve to die for it.
