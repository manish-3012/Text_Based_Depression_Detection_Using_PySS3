I woke up at about 11pm eastern time and tried to go to bed at midnight but now I woke up againI woke up because I had a bad dream and started having suicidal thoughts. Thankfully my boyfriend was still awake so I could talk to him, and he helped me a lot. I just woke back up again with more suicidal thoughts but now heâ€™s asleep and heâ€™s the only person I talk to about my suicidal thoughts and I donâ€™t know what to do....I donâ€™t have anyone else to talk to and Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m gonna cut myself or kill myself.....
