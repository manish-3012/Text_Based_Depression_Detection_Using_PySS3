This is wearing me down so muchAlmost 23, still have yet to experience the love of a woman or the feeling of having a girlfriend. My first kiss was with a stripper and my first time was with a prostitute. I was an early bloomer, my first thoughts of being with a girl came in kindergarden and have been going and been going unfulfilled since. I'm not bad looking or a bad conversation, but I'm uncontrollably shy. No matter how many ways I improve myself or try to disguise it. I can't even begin to list the ways I've changed mentally and physically in the last 2 years, changing for the better, getting rid of things holding me back. I've gotten so much advice, I've done so much, I've gotten myself out there but I can't find someone for me. I'm exactly where I always was. Do I have people in my life that love me, maybe - it is actually hard to tell with the people I know. Do I feel like an unlovable piece of shit when I spend every night lonely convinced there isn't someone out there for me, definitely. Should I 'love myself first before I try to look for love in other places'? I thought I did. But it always comes back to this. Every day I can't take another day. How many more days like that. I've tried it all, all sorts of medicine and none medicine. It dominates my thoughts no matter. I've gotten to my breaking point and my mind isn't in a good place. Thoughts of self violence are more prominent than suicide right now. I don't mean I don't want to end it, I mean a screw is loose and I wanna beat the fuck out of myself before I do. 

I feel unvalidated as a human, irrelevant as a man, and alone as a person.
