Itâ€™s almost happeningMy hearts already racing with the thought that I am finally going away for good if the only thing I do alive is fuck up and disappoint people then what is right is to go away for good. Take out the weight of every bodies shoulders because of me.
I just need to do one last thing, I just have to wait for my ex whom I love dearly to wake up so I can have a last call with her, and Iâ€™m jumping out of my balcony, I hope itâ€™s high enough to die instantly because I donâ€™t want to suffer more than I already am.
