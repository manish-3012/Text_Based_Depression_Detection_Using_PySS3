Loneliness, family and depression. I am a male over thirty. I recently lost my job. I have since found a new one that I am about to start but it's shitty and embarrassing(fast food). I just know it's going to be humiliating as fuck when someone I know comes through the drive thru, but hey I've got to make rent somehow. Anyway, that's only part of my problem. I stayed at my mom and step-dads house over christmas and since I didn't have to return for work I ended up staying for a week, they live an hour away btw. Since I've been home I've been feeling hopelessly depressed and lonely. Since I've been out of work I have not a dime to my name and no way to go out and distract myself. I'm getting ahead of myself in this story though. My step sister who is seven while I was there very obviously showed that she has a little girl crush on me. This is common with young girls and men they look up to. She's a little sweetie and I enjoyed the time we spent together. I didn't realize it until I got back home but what I missed most about my time at their house was the time I spent with my sister and the affection she showed me. It hit me that I was feeling romantically attracted to her as well. That's when I began feeling suicidal. I can't stop thinking about how fucked up I am and how hopeless my situation is. I feel like the biggest loser in the world and like I will never be able to have a healthy relationship with a woman my age ever again. I just want to end my life. The only things that are stopping me is the thought of how much hurt it would put my family through and the fear of not succeeding on my first attempt.
