Thereâ€™s nothing good in my lifeI have nothing to look forward to in life. There isnâ€™t a thing making me happy. I feel worthless, like Iâ€™m not good enough for anyone. The person who loved me for 3 years no longer does. If a person with prior history and commitment doesnâ€™t love me anymore, thereâ€™s gotta be something wrong with me. 

I wouldnâ€™t commit suicide over a breakup. But I just wish my life had at least one good thing. I havenâ€™t thought about this in a while, maybe 2 years, but fuck.
