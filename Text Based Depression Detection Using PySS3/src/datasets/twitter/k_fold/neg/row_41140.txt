So long everyone. I really got to think about it and no matter what I do in life I will be alone. Everyone has got some kind of problem with the way I do anything. They make fun of the way I talk, they hate how I wear my shirt or what kind of socks I have. Any solution I come up with to a problem is stupid and there's a thousand reasons why I'm an idiot. It seems to be very important to make fun of me in front of new people. 

I get it, no one wants me here. I'm sure some hippie liberal person would say they want me here but when it comes down to it that person wouldn't stick around. I tried to explain my frustrations in r/depression and no one really said anything that was helpful. When you try to carry on a conversation people just disappear. Just like real life. No one knows what to do or where I can go where I don't have to deal with this bullshit. I know where I can go though. I'm going to put a bullet though my head. That will free me. This constant problem of living life will end. I've had enough interacting with people. I hate being around most people. The people liked are dead now and nothing I can do will bring them back. Since I can't be happy anytime soon, I'm going to hit the power switch on life.
