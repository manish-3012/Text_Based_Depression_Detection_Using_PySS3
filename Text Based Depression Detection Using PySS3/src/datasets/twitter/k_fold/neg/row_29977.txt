I'm not even sad, I'm just disinterested in life.I see a lot of depressed people who are very sad. For a long time, I was aggressively sad. No one cared much about my safety or happiness. On top of that, I haven't played my cards well with the women, past or present, in my life. My bones are crooked and quite poor, and I think I just don't have a lot left to do. 

Really, I might be beyond being sad. 

Also, I have begun to suspect I am aware of things humans are generally not supposed to register. 

Overall, selfkilling, or the thought of it, doesn't make me uncomfortable anymore, but life does, which leads me to believe that my fate is already sealed. 

Have a nice day all :)

(I remember talking to a swedish woman some time ago over the internet who wanted to kill herself, and she felt unamused as I did, and I know that it is upsetting.)
