Hey guys I need advice and help and idk something man...Personal responsibility. I believe in personal responsibility.  I believe that the hole Iâ€™m in has been dug by me and that itâ€™s possible to climb out and my duty to find a way.


My parents wonâ€™t get the help for me though.


I live in a household where both parents are hoarders.  I step over trash and I have become a hoarder too, although Iâ€™m in high school.  They keep giving me ADHD medicine as my father is a doctor and my mother is a nurse.  I tried anti-depressants but they made me feel flat and I didnâ€™t like them.  I think about running away or ending it all the time and Iâ€™ve hit a wall.  Iâ€™ve always looked down on this subreddit... and Iâ€™m sorry. I thought that the yes men and the support was all just a show for the weak.. but I need help now and it hurts.  Idk what to do. They wonâ€™t get me a counselor.  My mother calls me crazy.  I think I suffer from bipolar disorder. What should I do reddit?
