I Deserve To LiveIt's repentance, really.

I don't deserve a break like death. I don't deserve to be able to escape my disgusting, atrocious existence.

So I guess I'm not suicidal, per se. I will never go out of my way to commit suicide. I will never take too many pills, I will never slit my wrists, I will never tie a noose and hang myself. No matter how badly I want to, no matter how desperate I am for reprieve, I will never do it. Never.

But if a car runs a red, I won't move. If the bridge I walk across every morning decides to collapse, I won't scream. If a mugger has a knife, I'll guide his blade to my jugular.

This feeling is almost as despicable as my existence.

Almost.

Maybe a little more despicable. It's really a slimy, gritty feeling. Leaves me feeling like I need to wash my hands, and then my face, and then the rest of my body, like I need to scrub myself raw and then I need to bleach my insides, too, because they're just as defiled as the rest of me.

That's what suicidal thoughts are to me.

I'm not suicidal. I don't want to die. I don't actually hate myself. And my life isn't too bad. People have had worse hands dealt to them.

But I can't stop these thoughts.

And no matter how badly I want to just swallow all of the needles I have in my house, I never will, because I deserve every bit and piece of this nightmare...

So I guess I don't really belong on this sub, do I...?
