How do people have a will to live...?25F. Like truly it blows my mind that up until 8 months ago I actually wanted to live...? And for what? I used to think I was helping people by trying to talk to them, be their friend and that suicidal thoughts could be taken away... how fucking naive.  Now Iâ€™m just bidding my time until my parents die so I can follow them them the fuck out. Unfortunately, itâ€™ll probably be a while. I would feel bad writing that except Iâ€™m pretty sure they want out of here as well. 

Itâ€™s also crazy bc I used to/am so into personal finance and funding my retirement account. I was setting myself up so well and now Iâ€™m like, in the coming years, do I just cash out and go on a bunch of trips (travel and drugs lol). The other option is writing a will... but for who? I guess family abroad and charities. I probably wouldnâ€™t give my brother a single cent since heâ€™s the reason Iâ€™m so fucked.
