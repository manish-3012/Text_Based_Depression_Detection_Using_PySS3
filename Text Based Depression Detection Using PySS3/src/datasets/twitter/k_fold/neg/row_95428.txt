DrowningI feel stuck in an endless battle against myself. My brain uncontrollably plans suicide notes and lives out fantasies in which i die, while I am fully awake. I feel like I have no control over these and my panic to make it stop makes it go more as if I enjoy it. But I don't. I'm drowning in my own brain.
