Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for several years.Only of the biggest mistakes Iâ€™ve made in the last few years was trusting a god damn psychiatrist. The damn shrink decided to give me the drug Risperdone for depression which is a complete inappropriate use of the medications. While on the medication for 5 months I gained 60lbs and developed gynecomastia also know as manboobs or bitch tits. They have struck around for over 2 years and the only way to remove the is through surgery. The rapid weight gain had left to severe stretch marks on my stomach, sides, and arms which look absolutely disgusting not to mention all the damn loss skin. 

The only way the fix the issues is thorough surgery. The gynecomastia surgery will cost 4-8k and the arm lift will cost another 4-6k. Iâ€™m I eligible for the risperdone lawsuit because I was under 18 at the time.

I had a fucking shit ton of student loan student and the damn credits wonâ€™t even transfer from the school. The school I want to transfer to will only accept 12 out of the 30 credit cards I had. 

I have no god damn way to pay for college because my parents refuse to help even though they pull in $250,000 a year. You absolutely need post secondary education either if itâ€™s a four year or two year program or even an apprenticeship. I still canâ€™t afford any of them and I refuse to work a dead end job the rest of my life. 

I donâ€™t see the point of do counting my pathetic life when Iâ€™ve been bullied and negated by my parents my entire life. If I kill my self I wonâ€™t have the pay my student loans and my parents will have to pay the debt. 

I would simply seize to exist and in a sense rest in an ever lasting sleep. That sounds like a miracle compared to the hell Iâ€™ve lived learn for the last twenty two year.
