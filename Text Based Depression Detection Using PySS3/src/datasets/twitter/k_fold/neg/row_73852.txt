It's cold out. I gotta get out.Two years, more than 2 years I've been suicidal. I'll never be normal. It's time to go. I wish I could talk about methods, but I know what my method is going to be anyway. I have to spend all my energy lying to myself. all of my energy is spent lying to myself and fighting the pain. 

Evil people get away with it. Evil people get away with it because pathetic people don't stop them. My dad got away with it. My stepmom gives him everything he wants and she doesn't give a shit about how evil he is. And she wants to play the victim, too, when she's actually just helping him. I hate her. I'm so glad I'm away from them

Now i need to get away from the world. Evil people get away with it. And I'm ready to go now. My poor husband has been through so much with all of this. I'm just ready to go now. God it's cold outside. Somehow that will make it easier. If i'm going to be alone and ignored, I'll go away completely. 

Ever notice how common suicide is these days? People treat it like a car accident, like an accident. It isn't.
