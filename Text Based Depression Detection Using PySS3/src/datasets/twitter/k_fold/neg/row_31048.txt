Help me. i cant sleep on this thoughtsHi everyone. this time the post is not for me. for years I have suffered from suicidal thoughts, abuse of alcohol, drugs and medications. 3 times I got very close to doing it. a couple of months ago I decided to go to therapy. I am on aripriprazole and my suicidal thoughts, dissociation and other symptoms are under control. But I'm worried about a girl I haven't heard from in months. she was very similar to me and even if she didn't tell me about it I think she is suicidal too. every now and then I think about it and I can't even sleep. what should I do? going back would be bad for me because I let go of my old life and I absolutely don't want to go back. for everyone here who is reading. remember that you are not alone and people like us are the strongest. thank you for reading my post. hope someone can help me. my mother tongue is not english i apologize for mistakes
