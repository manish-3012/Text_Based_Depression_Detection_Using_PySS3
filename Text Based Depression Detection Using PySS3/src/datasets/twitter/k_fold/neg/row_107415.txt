Itâ€™s just a matter of time...Iâ€™ve been depressed for a longe time and donâ€™t wanna live anymore and I donâ€™t have courage to hurt myself, I donâ€™t have any goals for my life. Never had a dream, when will it end... 
feel I wasted so many relationships and feel like Iâ€™m the problem of everything. Itâ€™s hard to say to my family and friends that Iâ€™m not suicidal because I donâ€™t want to worry them...
