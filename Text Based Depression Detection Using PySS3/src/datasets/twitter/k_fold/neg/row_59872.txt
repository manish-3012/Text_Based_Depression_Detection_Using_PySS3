Seasonal depressionI just want to see the sun. I feel so hopeless, why am I getting so fucking sad over the sun? I saw a blue sky today, that was the first time this winter. It was so pretty and gave me a good feeling but it went away once I went inside. Why canâ€™t I just live in the south? This is total bullshit
