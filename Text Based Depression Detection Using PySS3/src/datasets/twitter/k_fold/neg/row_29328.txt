Home stretchIm probably going to kill myself in the coming months. I have everything ready.

I'm in my 20's and  Im financially sound. I live with my parents. 

It seems like society genuinely does not care for sick or depressed people.   

Every daily tasks feel like an energy drain and I end up staying in bed all day. I feel like there is no hope for me to live a good life. I used to have alot of hope for life. I even imagined myself at some point living in the city and maybe even having kids. 

It seems that depression has taken over my thoughts and there is nothing I can do about my circumstances.

I'm not looking forward to dying either because it will be uncomfortable.
