i feel so guiltyiâ€™m here, wasting my life. wanting to end it all, having no energy to do anything but stay in my room most of the day. i canâ€™t focus on day to day tasks because all i can think of is how much i want to die. i try to tell myself it will get better, but iâ€™ve been saying it for years and it never does.
