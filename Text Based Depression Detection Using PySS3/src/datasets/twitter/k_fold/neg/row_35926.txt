I want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to dieIâ€™m not happy. I havenâ€™t been in a really long time. Iâ€™ve tried almost everything. Therapy, moving, switching jobs, new friends, even alcohol, sports, traveling, fun activities, hobbies, medication. 

Itâ€™s weird cause I know I have a good life. I donâ€™t have much to complain about - I just donâ€™t feel like this person Iâ€™m forced to be. I feel like I donâ€™t belong in this skin or this particular life. 

I donâ€™t enjoy fun things anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m fake happy All. The. Time. 

I donâ€™t want to live this life anymore, but I also donâ€™t want to die. 

I just needed to admit that every night when  I go to sleep I wish I either wake up as someone else, someone I feel is me, or I donâ€™t wake up at all.
