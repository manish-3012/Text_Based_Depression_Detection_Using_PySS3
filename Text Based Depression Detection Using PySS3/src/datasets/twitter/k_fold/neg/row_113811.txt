Vulnerable to everyone for the first time in my life and ndads got free rein to bully meIâ€™ve felt this down before only this time itâ€™s bc I recently dropped out of uni. 

And Iâ€™m unemployed rn but but ndads decided that weâ€™re to pay Â£20 a week 

That parts important bc itâ€™s difficult enough accepting that Iâ€™m not this high achiever anymore and that Iâ€™ve got to take anything even if itâ€™s state money regardless of how I feel to the point Iâ€™m starting to question if all he cares about is cashing in 

Today my aunt came round and asked the usual howâ€™s life only she asked with everyone starting at me so what do I want to do now I froze and heard dad say that anything that pays or something like that I instantly wanted to break down bc heâ€™s just such a bully about it and Iâ€™m trying not to have these walls up for the first time so that I can learn to improve my self esteem but itâ€™s so difficult 

Last week I was scared to even apply for jobs bc Iâ€™ve been out of work so long I just listed ones that have vacancies felt so pathetic but also like I was taking a great step if that makes sense as Iâ€™ve had no support just had orders barked at me so Iâ€™m trying to go at my own pace but I know I need to hurry 

Some other points 

- came back the other day angry he watched someone get hired 

- admits he takes cheap shots at me like well if you worked youâ€™d understand why x 

- calls me and sis lazy idle bitches as the go to insult  

- body shames calling me fat or worse 

- favours the sister currently bc although sheâ€™s in the exact same position she filled out a job application confidently in front of him and it was for her old job , I was later reminded of that 

Point being I canâ€™t take being bullied this much my aunt showed actual compassion and even came to see me in my room later Iâ€™d tell other family  members only then Iâ€™d get judged more and itâ€™s also happened before when I was in school and he threw my chlothes out compared me to my employed sister and I had to stay at my cousins bfs who also had to know my business 

I actually canâ€™t take this anymore and Iâ€™m obviously financially unable to leave and If youâ€™ve even red this fat thanks sorry about typos or format Iâ€™m just on my phone
