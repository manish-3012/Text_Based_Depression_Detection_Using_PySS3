Waiting.I think at this point Iâ€™m waiting for the holidays to be over. What a horribly selfish thing it would be for me to ruin everyoneâ€™s Christmas and new year, yâ€™know?

 March- March would be a good time. Maybe April? No holidays, no birthdays. No reminders. March or April it is. Maybe I will get a bit better by then, and Iâ€™ll not want to? Probably not. Iâ€™ve only been getting worse as of late. 

I feel... better. I have my plan, I have the date. My reassurance. I just have to get through until then, and then I can sleep. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll wake up, and Iâ€™ll be damaged, but the reward is worth the risk.
