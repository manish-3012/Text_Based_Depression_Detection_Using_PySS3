I am being stalked and I am terrified. Please, please help.Months ago, a girl added me on Facebook and began striking up conversations. At first I didn't notice anything too weird, except unusual intensity and social isolation.
About 3 weeks ago she told me that she was going to visit me (I live about 70km away) and stay at my house. I did not respond to these messages.

About 9 days ago, I hadn't responded to a number of messages on Skype, asking me what I was doing. Suddenly my webcam light came on, and after a minute or so I realised that somebody must be remotely viewing my webcam, because I hadn't turned it on, and my webcam had never come on by itself before. I suspect it was her (although I was not aware that she had the technical capability to do this, she did often speak highly of hackers and their skills).

I disconnected from my home's wireless network. The webcam light stayed on so I shut down my computer. I deactivated my Facebook and blocked this girl on Skype.

Since that time, I have received about 9 text messages from this girl, initially pretending that she didn't know who she was texting, and then saying that she got my phone number from Skype and telling me she was coming to my town this weekend and wanted to hang out. I have not responded since the previous couple of text messages when I simply said that I wanted to be left alone.

I have a severe anxiety disorder and am prone to panic attacks. In the past week I have had several. Every time she messages me again, I panic and can't eat for the rest of the day. Basically, I am terrified of how far this girl might escalate this. Will this go on for weeks? Months?

I am afraid to go to the police because I have some documents on my computer wherein I discuss aspects of my personal issues and past that I am very ashamed of, and I am fearful that if this girl hacked my computer, she may have gained access to these documents.

I am terrified. Please help.
