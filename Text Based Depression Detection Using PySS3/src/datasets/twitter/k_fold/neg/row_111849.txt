I was at this state 3 years ago and now I am back3 years ago, March 12th 2017 I purchased a 9mm handgun and a box of bullets and sat in a hotel room in Seattle Washington ready to die. At the time I was processing out of the military and I knew if I went home I would regress and all the work I had done and growth I had been through would no longer amount to anything. 

The most significant memories of my father I had were him beating me or screaming at the top of his lungs over frivolous things, outside of that I have always been the outcast of the family. Traditional methods of discipline didnt work and I needed room to grow and support that I didnt receive apparently made me a "shit kid" and didnt see me as anything more until I joined the military. 

So there I was in that hotel room staring at my weapon and I recieved a few messages from some battle buddies who believed that I just needed to get out of my head. So I did that. We spent the night carrying on like a bunch of idiots and that night of drinking saved my life. Instead of going back I went to college and got back to work, setting plans and accomplishing goals again until I graduated back in May.

 Now my nightmare is realized as I am here in my family's home in the same thing I knew was waiting for me. A resentful father that is past his prime bemoaning on my personal failures and claiming to be superior and knower of all things. My sister is a doctor now and married and other sister is engaged and settling into a successful career.. while I am still single, jobless and honestly I just dont care anymore. I want to die.
