Ever get that feeling where you want to kill yourself and you are like desperate to do it but you just have so much going on that your too depressed to die?I am getting ready to go to college and I also am working like 4 jobs and Iâ€™ve lost the only job Iâ€™ve ever felt happy doing because â€œit isnâ€™t a proper jobâ€ but now Iâ€™m getting ready to go to another new college that will ruin another thing for me.

Last time it ruined working with kids this time it will ruin working with animals

And i had to leave my job at the youth center because it wasnâ€™t a proper job apparently so now Iâ€™m free to work at a bird of prey place which I also wonâ€™t get paid for so like whatâ€™s the fucking point of it all? 
Iâ€™m waiting until after Iâ€™m 18 to kill myself because then at least I can go out while fucked up on my whole salaryâ€™s worth of vodka but I just really want to feel something now.

Iâ€™m not white Camhs anymore because â€œyou are nearly 18 which is basically 18 which means you donâ€™t have depression anymore so you donâ€™t need usâ€ so Iâ€™m on my own. I canâ€™t talk about the way I feel to anyone because they always have an opinion about it like Iâ€™m sorry you have chosen to feel angry because of my depression but I could really do with either a rope to hang myself or a hand off of the bridge Iâ€™m currently looking over.

TL:DR I am so stressed I want to die but too stressed to pull the trigger
