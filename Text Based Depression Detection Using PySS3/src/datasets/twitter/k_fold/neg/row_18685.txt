It's impossible to improve my life.I'm writing this because I think it's kind of funny. When I was young I honestly believed I could improve my life. After time this has changed and I have come to believe that my choices and actions mean nothing. I cannot find work, or love, or family, and it is not possible for me to harvest, create, or borrow resources that would offer me out of this. The truth is that successful people are given their success, usually on a plate, and my hard work will never get me anywhere because of what other people have chosen for me. Now most of the time I would just get drunk about this but it's causing me more and more physical problems which have forced me to abstain from drinking, and I don't want to be alive without depending on drink or drugs, as life and all its people inside it are aggressive and self-absorbed. So my idea is hanging. I've already 'practiced' this and know where to choose, going through with it is more difficult though. The solution to that is to get some kind of drug of the internet and drug myself, then hang myself. It's still going to take some willpower, but the scary thing is that is not bailing, but that I would be very motivated to go through with it. And it's not like anyone would turn up at my funeral either - no one would. So what am I really missing out?
