I want to be happyIâ€™m never going to be happy 
Everything about me is wrong why canâ€™t I be happy
Why did the police have to come round when I threatened sucide why canâ€™t I just die
Why do my parents make me suffer even more by not letting me be myself canâ€™t they see Iâ€™m screaming for help
When I attempted sucide they said they were going to change they didnâ€™t that was a year ago Iâ€™m still struggling whatâ€™s the point in hope anymore, whatâ€™s the point in living anymore.
