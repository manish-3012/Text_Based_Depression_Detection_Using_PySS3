I don't know what to do.I just feel underappreciated and unloved. No matter how hard I try to get to my goals, I fail. I'll never get to do my dream job. The time my drunk alcoholic dad told me I'm the reason my parents got a divorce still haunts me, and I still feel like they would've been better off without me. My boyfriend told me he'll never love me because he's emotionally void but I'm so damn inlove with him and he doesn't even know it. I go out of my way to please everyone else around me, sometimes I just want someone to do the same for me but I know they never will. I've been taken advantage of because I have a good heart. 

This isn't even the start of it, I'm only scratching the surface. I just feel like I'm going absolutely nowhere right now because I've failed at my chances to be a paramedic. I've failed as a daughter. I've failed as a sister. I've failed as a girlfriend. I've failed as a friend. I quit doing the things I love because they're just so damn depressing now. I just want it to be all done. I put on a good act that I'm okay and that I'll make it through all these blocks that get put in my way but I'm ready to give up because it's just not worth it anymore. There's just really nothing for me to be happy or look forward to anymore.
