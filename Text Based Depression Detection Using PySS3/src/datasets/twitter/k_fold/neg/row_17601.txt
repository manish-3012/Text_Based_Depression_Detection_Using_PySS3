26Hi this is my first post and just want to say goodbye to someone. I have â€œstuck with itâ€ but now at 26 am done. I was supposed to have my first day of work Monday for a job Iâ€™ve been working to get for 8 years and now I pray I wonâ€™t make it until then. Thank you for reading this. I hope whatever brought you to this page and what is hurting will give you a break soon. I hope you feel better.
