i want to actually want to livedeath isn't an option for me because of the people around me. it's still a battle. but i still can't imagine a future. there's nothing because i'm nothing. i want to die so badly it hurts. i feel a pain in my chest, and it's almost like this inner peace is within reach, but i can't grasp it. i want a fatal accident. a heart attack. or spontaneous combustion. when i'm numb i miss being miserable. and when i'm miserable i miss being numb. there's too many contradictions, nothing makes sense. the hollowness is so fucking loud, i want to destroy this shitty soulless body. the only way to make it stop is to die. i wish i could want to live desperately. i want purpose, because i'm losing my grip. i'm selfish. i don't want to hurt anyone. i want to do better, but i'm so fucking tired
