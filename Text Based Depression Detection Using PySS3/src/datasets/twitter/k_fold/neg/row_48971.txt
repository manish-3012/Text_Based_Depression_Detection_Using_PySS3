I want to die. And this week I end all of thisSeriously, why would you still believe life is sacred? None of this matters, so why would anyone care about my existence. I can't wait to die, and fuck I don't give a shit about anyone who has ever loved me because love doesn't mean anything to me or this thing we call existence. I can't wait to die
