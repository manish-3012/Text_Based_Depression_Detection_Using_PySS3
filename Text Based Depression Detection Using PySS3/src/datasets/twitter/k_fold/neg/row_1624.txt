Should I kill myself if I dont feel like living?Im so fucking weird. Im 17, and in highschool at Math&amp;Computers. I feel so fucking lonely, without any love, without anyone. But sometimes I feel good about that, and sometimes dont. I dont...even know what to say right now, only for the fact that I dont know what people know about me. I've been a volunteer from 14 yr old at computer club, mentoring kids, I've been working in IT from 15, more like a freelancer. I've been doing graphic design, photography, and videography, again on freelancing. I've worked so hard to be helpful to people, to everyone. At school, by doing troubleshoot on the PCs, by doing photo at events made by it. I've done stuff like this at my church too. And I have this type of things...for free....for a long time....from 14 yr old.....And i have been happy everytime i saw someone happy by what I made. But it started killin me, with school getting hard, with a very big programme, little sleep hours. I dont even know. I feel like no one really cares that much about me. They care more about what I can do for them. And I dont feel helpful at all. I feel drepessed, and like shit. Dunno what to do.
