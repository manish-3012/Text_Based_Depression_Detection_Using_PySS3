I've never had a friend Definitely people who I talk to and have conversations with. They call themselves my friend but it's always that thing where you'll be talking and you know they're not listening. They're waiting for you to stop. Nobody really listens or cares. I don't even know why I talk.
    
 Idon't know if all friends are like that or what. It's hard making them and even harder keeping them around. I don't think I'm good enough to keep people around. I feel like a wisp of a person. Fleeting and insubstantial. 

All of my exes treated me like shit. Now I'm starting to think it's because that's the only kind of love I deserve. The half assed kind. I feel like I'm not supposed to be alive. Like a puzzle piece jammed into another but it's just not fitting. You mash and you mash and it still doesn't fucking fit.

 I'm so horribly alone. I'm in college now but I'm already in debt because I'm not smart enough to get better scholarships. I'm on a bridge right now looking at the sunset. I don't want anybody to come to my funeral because I know they'd only be there to garner sympathy and save face. '"oh we loved her we loved her" blah blah blah blah blah liars they're all fucking liars. 
I thibnk the only people who've ever really loved me are my family but I know it's hard living with me and dealing with me. I know I make things hard for them. I wish I was good. Or beautiful. Or something. Anything. I wish I was anything more than who I am. Anything more than a pathetic husk. Failing over and over again trying so hard to be somebody worth loving.
