Currently on the verge.Right now I'm sitting in my car, on a rainy day. I have a knife with me, but I'm too chicken shit to end my life because of the pain. I'm a 22 year-old university graduate but I just want life to be over already. I have people who love me, whose lives would be ruined if I ended myself.

I wish I was never born, but I don't want to die (if that makes any sense which it probably doesn't.) I wish I had no one who depended on me so I could just go out with a clear conscience.

I have no one to talk to right now. My family is sick of my depressive shit. I'm a walking contradiction and it's getting to a point where I just want my own brain to shut up.

I want professional help, but I don't want to be chucked into an institution (my ex friend was in one and it was not pretty)

Advice/guidance would be appreciated. Does life get better? Or is this it? 

I don't have much time.
