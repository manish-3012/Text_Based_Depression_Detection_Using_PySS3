Is anyone else good for the next ~1 year but know that your time is running out for pretending everything is ok?I have recently started my 2nd year of community college and its becoming apparent that once i have to become independent, there is just absolutely no job that i want to have and i dont enjoy life enough to justify slaving away for the next 50 years of my life. The thing that has been keeping me going for the last few years was the dream that i could be a professional golfer and make a good living on tour, but that dream is never going to happen so now i am left with no options. Im not totally depressed but i have never been able to envision myself having a normal career for a salary. To me, that feels like slavery. Im in my math class right now and i am completely lost so there is no way i can go to a 4 year college as a physics major(my current major) and no other majors seem like anything that i actually want to do. I want to live a life where i actually do what i want to do instead of doing the thing that i hate the least to make money. Golf was that escape from reality for me because i love golf and the only life i want to live is through that. I feel like my life is leading up do a mental and emotional breakdown.
