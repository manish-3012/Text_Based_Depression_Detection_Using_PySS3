At least Iâ€™m going to die happy.Iâ€™ve made my decision that at the end of this year that I will be going to Florida and I will overdose on MDMA. It would mostly likely be fast as I would have a heart attack and I would be inhumanly happy for my last moments. I hate that Iâ€™m going to have to put my mom and brother through this. I hope they can use this as motivation to achieve better lives for themselves. I hate that itâ€™s come to this.
