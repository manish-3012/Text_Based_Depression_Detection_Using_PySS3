my life was stolen from me by pursuing academicsi was always branded as a higher thinker. i was sheltered to preserve the residue of overabundant non-essential info i learned over the years of schooling. senior year now. i lack connections. i lack awards. i lack money. there was a time where i thought making 100 on a test meant harvard-bound, because thats what they taught me, and now i'd be lucky to full ride out of state, albeit without funds.

in the midst of promoting a larger than life reality, i now lack the essentials to keep a part time job, or to handle awkward confrontations without spazzing out. and i really think imma be a big time producer / rapper like i dreamed, huh?

its humbling to know how much of a failure i am now though, since i heard all my life was praise for kissing everybodys ass. now i dont have backbone, or anybody in my life to teach it. 

im looking to do a month of silence and control my emotions, and if i can undergo thirty days of silence with a smile every day, then i'll slaughter this body.
