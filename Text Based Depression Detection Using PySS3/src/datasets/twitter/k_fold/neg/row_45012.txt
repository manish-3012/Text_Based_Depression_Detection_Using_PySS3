I frustrate everyone. Maybe Iâ€™m better off dead.No matter how hard I try to fit in or be nice, I always end up frustrating everyone. 

Letâ€™s face it, everyone here has little patience with dealing with me. Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not perfect, Iâ€™m sorry Iâ€™m not this or that. I canâ€™t help the fact that Iâ€™m prone to committing stuff thatâ€™s problematic until I realise itâ€™s problematic. 

I hate having to feel like this. Maybe if I died, this all wouldnâ€™t happen anymore and I donâ€™t have to feel like this all the day.
