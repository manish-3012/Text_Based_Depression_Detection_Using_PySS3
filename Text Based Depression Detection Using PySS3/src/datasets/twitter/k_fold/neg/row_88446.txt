I'm doing the best I can.Forgive my grammar. 
I'm doing the best I can right now, but I have this urge to splattered my brains out on a clean white wall. Life for me has lost all of it's charm and luster and only because my family needs I haven't done so.
I think the scene would be beautiful, poetic even, but alas I can't bring myself to end it all. I couldn't put my parents through that. Unfortunately it means I have to be alive a little while longer. ðŸ˜”
, Best wishes
 Me.
