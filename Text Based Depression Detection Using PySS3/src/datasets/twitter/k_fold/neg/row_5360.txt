Im just tiredIve been going through an incredibly difficult time. Im living in a DV shelter I have no finances and I am 5 months pregnant. I have considered killing mysef but lately with the added stress the thought just enters my mind daily. I use to cry alot or sleep it off but now i have found myself being in a daze. Im praying for a glimmer of hope.
