Loose ends?Wondering, if I do go through with it, what things should I make sure are taken care of first? So far Iâ€™ve got: clean the house, hide/stash sex toys (so my parents donâ€™t find them when they clean my apartment), remind boyfriend itâ€™s not his fault. Anything Iâ€™m missing? Just donâ€™t wanna be a bigger burden than I have to.
