How to buyHow do you buy a gun without tipping them off that you're suicidal? I'm worried that I won't be able to go through the process without giving it away that I'm going to kill myself. Don't know enough about guns to know the lingo, I only know what gun I need to get.  Any advice or tips or other ways to buy a gun that doesn't involve interacting with someone?
