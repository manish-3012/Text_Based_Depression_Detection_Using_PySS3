I don't want to live.I'm sick and disgusting. I feel like a grotesque monster. Why would anyone want to be with a fake and fraud like me? I'll never be a real woman, and I'll always be alone. There will be no happiness for me, no good ending. More than 98% of people would refuse to be with me, so what's the point? I'll always be different and seen as an outsider. Every second of every day I think about plunging a knife into my throat, and finally ending it all.

I'm a freak and a monster. There's no point to continuing to live.
