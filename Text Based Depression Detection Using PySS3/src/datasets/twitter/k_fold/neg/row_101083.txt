Suicidal ideation Iâ€™ve been having the past weekI donâ€™t find that life is worth living anymore. I was going to kill myself on March 10th, but didnâ€™t do it. I that regret so much.

At the time, I realized I was tired of trying to find reasons to live, and tired of trying to convince myself itâ€™s worth being alive. 

Now itâ€™s really more pointless. Thereâ€™s no point in me living.

I wish that my household had a gun so I could get it over with. Or that I had a car so I can could drive into the woods and never leave, or drive off a cliff.

I have no autonomy anymore, Iâ€™m just stuck and I feel like everything is pointless, the future I see for myself is empty 

The people I live with would be happier without me. I feel like my friends donâ€™t care about me. I canâ€™t do the things or go to the places that distracted me. Iâ€™m really just taking up space.

I want the relief and peace I imagine oblivion would give me. Lately Iâ€™ve been telling myself Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m done. Iâ€™m ready to go. 

My plans arenâ€™t aligned to whatâ€™s reality though. In my perfect world I would be able to go somewhere and end it where no one could find the remains, I donâ€™t want anyone burdened with whatâ€™s left. 

But Iâ€™m tired of being tired. Iâ€™m tired of existing worthlessly
