I don't know if anyone can even helpI'm not even sure about posting here but it can't hurt right

I'm 16 and I'm a trans man which is probably important because dysphoria and parents and junk blah

I was looking at this suicide scale thing for whatever reason and it says that the average person only thinks about suicide if it's brought up or in an academic way and that's so foreign to me

I could be in a really good mood but there's always that little background of wanting to /thinking of/ imagining committing suicide and its not a big deal if I'm in good mood because I've adapted to deal with it but good moods happen so rarely that it's a huge problem

I really wish I could go back to counseling but when I was in it I was constantly ridiculed by my dad for needing it and my mom for "not trying hard enough"

I take my meds man but they haven't worked in a long time and its getting so much harder to remember to keep up with the schedule

I'm not gonna go into my whole living situation or anything but it's just causing this stuff to multiply tenfold 

I've started just thinking of it more and more and I don't know what to do 

I just can't really see a point in keeping on honestly if my entire life is gonna be like this with my own head constantly weighing me down

I'll probably just drink myself to death by the time I'm in my late 20s I don't know why it matters
