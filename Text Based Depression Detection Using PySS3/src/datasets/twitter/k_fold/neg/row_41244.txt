Iâ€™m trying to keep living, but Iâ€™m running out of reasons to keep going.My family proves time and time again that Iâ€™m just a burden. Iâ€™m an awful person. I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. I canâ€™t even get restful sleep anymore. I donâ€™t have any reasons to stay. People will move on. Most wont notice outside of my immediate family. It would be better for everyone if I just worked up the balls to kill myself. Nothing would be ruined anymore. My family could have a peaceful home life and more money. I would break my motherâ€™s heart anymore. My boyfriend would move on. Heâ€™s out of my league anyway. I donâ€™t even know why heâ€™s with me. My dogs are puppies. Theyâ€™ll forget me. I just donâ€™t see a reason to stay anymore. My heart and mind are just too heavy.
