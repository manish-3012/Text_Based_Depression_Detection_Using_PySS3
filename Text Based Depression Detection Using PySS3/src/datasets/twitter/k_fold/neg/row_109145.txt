trying to find a way outI've had suicidal thoughts for at least the last 15 years of my life. I suffer from chronic pain that means I can never rest comfortably. There is no cure for my condition. I have difficulty making and maintaining relationships with other people. I've tried to be a generous, forthright person, but I have no lasting friendships. I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I've been trying to improve myself all along but to no avail. I've been working hard for the last decade in my industry but have made zero professional progress.  I don't think I was meant to live in this world. I haven't killed myself yet because of my parents but it's been weighing me down. I'm so lonely and frustrated with existence. Any viable options besides checking out?
