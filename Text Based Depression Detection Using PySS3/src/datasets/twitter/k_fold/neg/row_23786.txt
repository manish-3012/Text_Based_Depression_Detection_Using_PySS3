Iâ€™m disgusting. I have no friends. I should dieIâ€™ve been so lonely lately. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how Iâ€™m all alone in this world. I keep feeling like Iâ€™m weird, awkward, and disgusting at campus especially since Iâ€™m never walking with anyone. I eat alone, go to classes alone, everything I do is alone. I feel like Iâ€™m such a fuck up and whenever Iâ€™m talking with anyone I feel like Iâ€™m being disgusting and weird. Even when I try to reach out and get out there I feel like I donâ€™t deserve to be associating with anyone. Even going to office hours to ask questions about assignments makes me feel like my professors hate me because Iâ€™m so stupid. Iâ€™m pretty sure my group mates for a class of mine hate me too because of my incompetence. I feel like disappearing. I donâ€™t want to have existed in the first place. I wish I could just erase myself.
