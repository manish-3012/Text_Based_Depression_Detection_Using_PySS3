I'm so tired of being destructive to myself.It is endless. This quarantine has left me alone with my thoughts and it has been unending. I recognize I failed (I am 30 and have nothing to show for it) in life, and am a toxic person. I spend my days binge eating, then going on fasts for days to repent for it and the cycle continues. I'm stuck inside all day and I cant get away from this stupid food that ruins my life.
