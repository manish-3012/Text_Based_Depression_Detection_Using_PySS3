I told myself that if just one person remembered my birthday today then maybe I'd try to live another year. Nobody did.Firstly, I want to say that this isn't a post about me wanting a bunch of people to wish me a happy birthday online. In fact, I don't want anyone to so please don't. There isn't anything happy about it.

It's been a terrible year. I lost all my friends and my family have given up on me (and I've given up on them). I didn't expect much. But it still hurts. It really hurts. Even just a message or anything would have been something. It would have meant that someone thought of me, even just for a moment. But there was nothing. I got one notification on Facebook and it turned out to just be some automated message reminding me that I don't have a profile picture. Like I needed to be reminded that I'm too ashamed to show my face to anyone. I've been thinking of and planning my suicide for well over a year now, almost 2 years in fact. But I gave myself an ultimatum. I'd give myself another 6 months. Maybe things would get better like people always say it will. And I tried to make them better. I tried to get back on track and do what I needed to do to live the life I wanted, even though I didn't want life at all for so long. But it seems like there is nothing for me in this life. No matter what I do it seems like I'm destined to a life of failure and solitude. And I would rather die than live like that. I'm not posting this for attention, I just feel like I need to get this out so I won't have regrets when I do it. Thank you for reading, if you bothered.
