Nothing I used to love doing makes me happy anymoreI do them for the sake of appearing normal to my family. I cant focus on anything at all. There's just something at the back of my mind that's preventing me from enjoying anything. I cant even focus on my assignments anymore. They used to be a good distraction. Now they're just something that exacerbates my negative thoughts and emotions. It's like when I try to fight back, it retaliates even harder.
