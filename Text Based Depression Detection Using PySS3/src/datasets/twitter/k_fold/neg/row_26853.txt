I went to a gun shop todayBut I couldnt do it. I sat in my car for a while cause I was scared to even go in and ask to use the gun range. I eventually went in and walked around for a while pretending to look at stuff even though i dont like guns and have never even handled one before. I went back out to my car but after a few mins I told my self I had to do it. Even if I'm scared to I've been planning on going there awhile so I figured I might as well do it while I'm already there. 

But I just couldnt. Since it was my first time the guy stayed in there with me and it just made me feel guilty with him standing right behind me because he has nothing to do with this. Theres no reason for me to make some stranger have to deal with that.

Now I just feel so pathetic cause I dont think I'll ever be able to do it. I feel like I dont deserve the same help someone else would because now I feel like I can't even say I'm suicidal when I can't do it and because I dont always feel actively suicidal.
