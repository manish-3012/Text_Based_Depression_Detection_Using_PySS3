Asked someone what would happen if I'd do itAnd I added that I ask because I want her to tell me what I anyways know.
And she only told me what most people could say...
But it calms and helps me... It has something to do with that person but if someone would tell me something different and more important than just what anyone would tell me, especially if someone would be important to me I imagine that I maybe could atleast stop planning it, and give myself a little bit more time before I'm going for it.
