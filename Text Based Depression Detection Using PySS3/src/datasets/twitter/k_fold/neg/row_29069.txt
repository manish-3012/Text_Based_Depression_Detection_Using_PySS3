Racist therapists tried every method, I don't believe there is real help out there unless I have a lot of money to find itSo anyway I'm alone in my life and am gonna die soon. Not sure how but it will be at my own hand. I don't want methods and quick fixes and shit that makes my illness bareable. I've tried so many big pharma meds that I honestly think it's made it all worse. Seeking help. Doesn't work for me bc I can't get past the fact that therapy is in exchange for money and there all in it for a check. There's no way if knowing if they actually give a shit. I have bills and bills stacked up of therapist that were awful to me but stuck with me for a check. Some of them were so done with me but they stayed for a paycheck. That's what they do, waste your time and money and lie and tell you there is hope. They will never tell you to your face that they have no clue how to help you. They will just keep taking a check until you quit so they can be on some "she gave up on herself" Bs so they don't have to hold themselves accountable for the bare minimum they gave me. Plus the micro aggression all racism and how most therapist do not take black patients into as much consideration as there white ones. A lot less remorse a lot less patients a lot less willing to really dig in the root of the problem. Being black and mentally unstable... My whole fucking life the world has never been on my side. And I'm slipping away. It's like I'm not even really here anymore. I work online so I'm a Recluse. I don't talk to my family, my illness has pushed away all of my friends. I can never have a healthy relationship. So what's next? What's left for me to do when my illness has destroyed everything I've ever cared about. What the fuck is the point?
