I'm running out of optionsI've been going through a pretty rough time in the past few months. Im a 23/M living on the east coast. To preface everything, I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety at a young age. I've always been on some sort of medication to help handle the peaks and valleys. These last 7 months have been hell. I graduated last winter and got a job out of college. Job is pretty shit with bad pay. I don't like what I do. Ever since college ended, all of my friends moved away so im quite literally extremely alone. I'm going through the worst heartbreak I've ever experience in my life and for the first time since I was 18, I am seriously considering suicide. Endless days of nights crying in my room is how I spend my time these days. I've been going to therapy and my psychiatrist, uping my dosage on my medications, confiding in "friends" and really trying to make an effort to get out of this way of thinking. But nothing is working and every day I come closer and closer to wanting to end it all. I have a plan. I know how I'd do it and I know that given a particularly hard night, I'd have no problem carrying through with it, especially with some liquid courage. I'm not too sure what I'm asking of this community. This was mainly just a rant.
