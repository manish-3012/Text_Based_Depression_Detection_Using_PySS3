I can't deal with the pain any longerI just can't. My friends have basically all excluded me / forgotten about me. It was bad enough when it was just my friend group, but even one of my closest friends seems to be avoiding me as of late. I originally thought they were just being them, but I since learned they weren't as busy as I thought they were and have been seeing other friends and didn't think to include me, despite knowing I'd like to be included. The pandemic and my surgery earlier this year made things very difficult for me, I basically did surgery recovery solo when I was strongly recommended not to. My parents are narcissistic ass holes I don't want anything to do with, despite their persistence. I'm convinced I'm the problem at this point, the pain is never ending. I am tempted to use the remainder of my pain killers to end it. Maybe not tonight, but probably this month, December is basically a nightmare for me :(
