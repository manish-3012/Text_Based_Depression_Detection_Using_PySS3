I cant do this much longer.I suppose I should start from the beginning: I'm a freshman at highschool who's been struggling with depression and social anxiety for a long while now. It's nearly the end of my first year and I still haven't been able to open up to anyone. I swear I've tried but I can't do anything. I don't know what to do anymore. I used to write poems and sing songs about my dreams of love and friendship but nothing can make me feel any better or distract me anymore. I've decided that if nothing changes by the end of this school year (June 20th), I'm going to kill myself. Everyone would be a lot happier without me. I'm not even a very good or positive person so it would be better for those I care about if I stopped bothering them with my presence. I just can't do this much longer.
