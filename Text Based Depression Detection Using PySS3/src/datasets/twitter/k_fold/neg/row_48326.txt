two years, nothing new(19y/o female)
itâ€™s coming up to  the anniversary of my second (proper) suicide attempt and my new meds are making it worse rn. 2018 was not a good year, started with being spiked n assaulted 3 days into the year, had a bad year at school, and then found out all my friends hated my guts! anyway, it made me go completely off the rails. dropped out of school and cut off contact with everyone and stopped leaving my house. itâ€™s to the point now where i have developed agoraphobia n probably only leave my house once, maybe twice, a month. and honestly at this point in my life i really canâ€™t see it changing, ever. iâ€™m disposable in everyoneâ€™s life, i can never keep anyone around me for longer than two years without them not hating me by the end of it. i rly rly canâ€™t do this shot anymore. no one truly needs me to be around them anymore. i have wasted two whole years of my life doing nothing and i am going to continue to ruin my life by doing nothing unless i kill myself
