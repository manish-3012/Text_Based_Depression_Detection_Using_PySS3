I thought coming back meant I could be with you again but now you've left and it's just me again.i think out of them all, knowing that you stayed the longest.. is what's really starting to hurt me. i should've never left. i should've never been spiteful 
this has been my biggest loss so far and i dont think im handling it well xD 


fuck.
