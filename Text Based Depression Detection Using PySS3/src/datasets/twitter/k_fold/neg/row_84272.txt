Gun in my mouth I pray for sunshineThe older I get the closer I am to pulling the trigger some random night. Some days are good, other are the worst. Life is a continuous slope downhill so what the fuck am I doing here? The only reason I haven't killed myself is the thought of what it would do to my family. I hate this world although I don't want to kill myself I find that I always come back to that feeling. I am an empty vessel waiting for my chance to leave, the only other thing I know is pain. I pray one of these nights the swell doesn't take me before my time
