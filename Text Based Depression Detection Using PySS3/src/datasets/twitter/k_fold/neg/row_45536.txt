I don't know what to do anymore. I can't do this.I dated someone for a couple of years and...it was perfect. I got pregnant a few times, and I lost it each time due to stress. We were supposed to get married. We almost did.

He decided after a while that he wanted to join the Navy. It was sudden. I didn't want to be a military wife, and he knew this. I was pregnant at the time. He left me pregnant and all alone soon after finding out I wasn't willing to completely up and change my whole life like that for him. 

I was devastated and I lost the baby a week later- probably due to stress. I never told him that I lost it, he didn't care.

A week ago I found out he isn't in the Navy after all- he had been having an affair and left me for her. 

I still love him. I know I'm weak, I know I'm stupid. You don't have to tell me, I already know.

But I can't take this anymore. It's been so long and every single day without him is fucking miserable. I tried moving on, but I just fucking can't.
