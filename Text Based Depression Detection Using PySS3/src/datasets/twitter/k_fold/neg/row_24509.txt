I turned 33 today...I fucking hate my birthday, it's always a week of depression leading up to it and then anxiety and depression on the day and the next few thereafter. It's always been a day of histrionic narcissism from my parents and just shitty gifts growing up, typically clothes and second hand books. We were poor growing up but it was always obvious that my sister would get new things or at least one thing she wanted, whereas I would not.... Now its just typically a phonecall with my parents crying about how they miss me and telling me how "they will put a card in the mail tomorrow...."...

I just never anted to live this long. I never wanted  to fucking live, I hate it. People get up me that im a mess on my birthday and mopey and "why cant you be greatful?"... But it's never been instigated in me it should be anything than anxiety filled and cheap... I remember when I was 13 my dad was like "well you didn't get me anything or mine, maybe you need to get a job"... so i got nothing that year... 18 was "well we were going to get you a car but you decided you wanted to move out of home so we'll give it to your sister"... i know this shit is in the past but fuck ever does it weigh on me...

i don't know... i don't feel worthy of anything good in life, which is probably why life is shit... but at least doubly shit on my birthday...

I just wish it was a deathday... then I could only have one... alas I suck at killing myself... and dont want the "you cant even kill yourself, stop being attention seeking" lecture again....

maybe i should pay someone else to kill me.

fuck this.
