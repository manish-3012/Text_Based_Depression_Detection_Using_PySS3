DAE find that having suicide as an option to be almost liberating?I find it somewhat relaxing and reassuring to know that if I can't cope with life anymore, suicide is always an option to set myself free. Thinking about this makes me very sad, but at the same time, calms me down from any stress and anxiety. I'm serious when I ask whether thoughts like this normal?

I guess this stems from my desire to always be 'free' from society. By that I mean, I've always hated the idea of having to be be 'tied down' to starting a family, or taking out a mortgage. I love an independent and minimalist lifestyle, and suicide seems to fit perfectly into this as I can be totally free from life.

edit: I wasn't sure whether to post this here or to /r/depression

edit 2: great, I'm being downvoted, of course no one gives a shit
