fighting the urge right now too?Just wondered if anyone else fighting the urge right now wanted to talk in an effort to delay something irreversible. I've never seen so many other people expressing the same kind of pain and thoughts as me as I have here. I wish I had more to offer, but I could use the distraction of a conversation if anyone is around.
