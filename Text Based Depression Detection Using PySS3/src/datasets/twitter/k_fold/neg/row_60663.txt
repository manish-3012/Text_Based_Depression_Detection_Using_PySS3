I dont deserve to liveI dont deserve to live. I need to shut up and never share my feelings. i am fucked up and cannot be normal. My feelings arent valid. They are just self destructive and i cannot function as a human. Everyone that comes around me gets hurt or wants to leave no matter how they were at first to me. The first time i genuinely felt love by someone regardless who i was and felt different, i became so happy that i became obssessed and crazy over them. And in the end managed to pushed them off. Just goes to show how i cannot be cured of being messy myself. I wish i could just never see anyone again and kill myself. Why am i like this? Why am i not normal? Why do i focus on the same things over and over and make small things big? Why am i so pathetic? Why am i myself? Why cant i change how i am? Why do i continue to breath? Why am i so clingy? Why do i have feelings? My feelings are not valid. I dont deserve to have feelings..feelings always made things bad. I am the constant person in everything that goes bad. I just want to break down and cry and hug someone but all i can do is hug myself tightly and hold back on crying because crying never really helps and i dont have privacy and i am a guy. I am not worth anything and i do not deserve to be alive. Someone else couldnhBe been given my life that would atleast be worthy of it and wont not appreciate the supposedly gift of life. Why am i so negative? I hate myself so much i cannot express it enough. I just want to keep hitting my head on a wall till i die
