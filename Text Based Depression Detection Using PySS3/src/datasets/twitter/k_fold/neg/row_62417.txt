I have no motivation anymore. I feel like a failure and nobody in my life cares for me from my point of viewI honestly have been depressed for over a decade, and im nearly 20. No house, no car, no license, no true friends, all the women in my life has betrayed me. I'm thinking of ending it this week, there is so many flaws in my appearance, personality, and life. I don't have nor do i think i'll have a purpose, No matter, i'm just a particle in that which is humanity. With nobody really in my life, there's not much to lose. Reddit has been good to me though, helped me through my depression slightly with memes. Nothing will stop the what i feel is the inevitable.
