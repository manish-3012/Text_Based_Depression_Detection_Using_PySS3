I don't know what to do.So, my life is kind of a broken mess.  I'm probably an alcoholic.  I used to do drugs, but I moved away so I wouldn't have access.  I feel like maybe if I could get help I could make it, but I'm unemployed now, living in a hotel.  I'm about one month or so from homelessness.  No friends or family to talk to.  I have a scar from a previous suicide attempt that I feel like people see and know I tried shooting myself.  I just need a job, if I could just manage to find one I feel like I'd have a shot at pulling myself together.  It's the first time I've felt like I might have a chance at happiness, but it seems like it's too little, too late.  

Why couldn't I see anything important for what it was when I could have done anything about it?
