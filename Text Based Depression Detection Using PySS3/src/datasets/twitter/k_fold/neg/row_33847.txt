Not sure whether to reach out to ex or notShort explanation of where things are.

We were split for two months, then almost reconnected. However, I have BPD and freaked out and hurt her dearly. Then I obsessively tried to fix it, emailing a ton and sending her a letter. Definitely came off as the crazy ex. All my best intentions just made everything worse.

The thing is, I'm suicidal and she's the only one I want to talk to. It's not losing her that's killing me, it's the way I destroyed everything and hurt her. I have a pattern of this in my life, and I'm crumbling under the weight. I hate everything about myself and am suffering extreme guilt and anxiety, and just not living.

I want so badly to reach out, but I don't want to drag her back into my life that way either. She deserves to be happy and free of me. I truly believe this. If I do kill myself, I don't want her to even know about it. It's not her fault at all. Fuck, I love her and want the best for her. Having a suicidal ex is not what's best for her.

Yet the compulsion remains, and I am fighting it. Do I have any right to ask her for help? I'm not her responsibility and she's made it clear she wants nothing to do with me. I don't even know what I want from her, and I am already embarassed enough about the way I handled things.

I just don't know what to do. We have a connection that even she acknowledged will always be there. I'm afraid I'm just using it to justify whatever urges I have though. 

Can somebody please give me some advice? I don't want to hurt her anymore, but making peace with her would help me so fucking much.
