Help isn't workingI thought everything was going well. Been talking but it isn't helping yeah know. Talking to some random stranger is hard like gonna be honest even getting hurt I'm still feeling shitty. I still hate myself. Also fuck everyone. I've been trying to reach out to a friend who i thought was always there for me. I just asked if we could maybe talk but he said "you are giving out bad vibes" pos i was there for me all the time and when i need help you turn me away. Next day he asks for my help. What's the point i deserve all of this. I'm a just a obessive, creepy, depress pos and i deserve all of this. I'm a horrible person and a disgusting human. I hate. myself. All of this could have never happened if i just stopped overthinking. I'm just a disgusting human. There's days where i hope i die in a accident or something that isn't suicide.  Because 1) pain 2) I'm scared of failing. I'm sorry i just needed to let that out. Also helping isn't working. I tried everything fuck it i should just go back to drinking what's the point. I alresdy had this dream of my taking sleeping pills and going into my bath tub and hoping i drown myself. I picture myself at my funeral condolences by touche amore in the background. I feel disgusted about how i acted. I hate myself even more thinking about it. I just wanna be gone.
