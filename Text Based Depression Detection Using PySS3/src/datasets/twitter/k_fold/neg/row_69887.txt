I'm experiencing one of the darkest periods of my life amd my family thinks the better solution is just to always insult meIt's now months that my life is just a circle of the same shitty things. Every day is wake up, watch online classes, get insulted by parents, go to sleep. I think Im going crazy. Okay the weekend when I don't have online classes it's just wake up, get insulted, go to sleep, always telling me I sleep too much and do nothing all day. Everyday the same. I just want to kill myself but I don't have the courage to do it yet I guess. But the more the days pass the more I just want to die. What should I do? (I'm 20 and was going to run away from my family some time ago but covid made every plan of escaping impossible)
