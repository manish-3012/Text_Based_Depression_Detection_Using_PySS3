hahaha i don't even know how to confront my own feelings with being passive aggressivei literally don't even know what to do anymore, it's like i can't even talk to anyone without being ridiculed. my mom is in hospital, i spent christmas alone in my room slicing my chest until my boyfriend came home. i know he wants to leave me but is too scared of what i'm going to do when he does. it's all a waiting game now. photos of me drunk absolutely embarrassing myself were posted all over facebook by pages with 70k likes without me even knowing because i have no forms of social media at all. my sister hates me now because of how much that embarrassed her. my mom couldn't be more disappointed, my dad cut off contact a year ago after i told him i was feeling suicidal again. i never finished school and i can't get a stable job because all i want to do is fucking sleep. i want everything to just stop. i want my body back. i want my friends back. i want my family back. i don't know where everything went wrong but i know it's too late to fix it. i can't even see a therapist because a bad trip left me unable to talk to anyone new without becoming a fucking nervous wreck and crying after every sentence.
