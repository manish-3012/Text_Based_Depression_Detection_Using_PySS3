Constantly feeling lostEver since a very young age I've felt so lost in life. Like I wasn't meant to be alive. From all the abuse and neglect I endured when I was younger it kind of messed up my brain. I struggle with a few mental illnesses. I'm actively trying to get help... I haven't found a good match for meds so I just feel worse and worse. I relapsed with self harm after 9 years of being clean; i haven't told my spouse because I really don't want them to be disappointed in me. I've relapsed with my eating issues... I'm feeling more lost than ever. I feel too old to be struggling this much and i just don't want to do it anymore. I'm tired. I just want everything to stop. I want my brain to shut off. I want to sleep.
