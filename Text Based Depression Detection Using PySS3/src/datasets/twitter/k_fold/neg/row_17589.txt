I tried to purposely overdose, I failed but now I canâ€™t stop thinking about itI tried to take way to much klonopin (benzodiazepine) and then I drank about 6 shots of Bacardi and had taken 120mg of adderall. Why am I still alive? I donâ€™t know what to do. This happened in March. I literally canâ€™t stop thinking about it, because I canâ€™t really remember it. I donâ€™t remember the week after. I donâ€™t know what to do
