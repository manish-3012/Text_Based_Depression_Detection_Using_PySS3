Went to the Bridge tonight and stood up looking down , am i okay?I feel quite content with these feelings of ending my life. I'm a Last year University student and I'm just tired of all of it. Went to a bridge, stood on the railing and wanted to see how it feels to be near death. It felt right. No one in my life knows my feelings since I cover everything up with a smile and bring funny.
