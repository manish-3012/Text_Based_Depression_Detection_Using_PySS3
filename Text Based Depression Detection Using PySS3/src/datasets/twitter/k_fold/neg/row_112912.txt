i donâ€™t want to be herei feel like iâ€™m going insane, i canâ€™t sleep or eat properly and my body feels disgusting and uncomfortable to be in. everything is too overwhelming and i just canâ€™t catch up. i donâ€™t really know what there is for me anymore. itâ€™s getting worse and worse. my head just feels heavy and iâ€™m so exhausted all the time. can someone just give me some reasons to stay positive at least? iâ€™m scared of what i could do to myself.
