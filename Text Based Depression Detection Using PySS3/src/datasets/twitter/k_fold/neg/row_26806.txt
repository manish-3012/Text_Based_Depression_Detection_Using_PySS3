When will I ever be free from not being a wage slave or slave to the money?Why bother with life? We are all slaves to money which we work tirelessly for only to have it stolen from us by the people that own this country. The big wealthy/elitist fuckers who aren't human but probably do heavy drugs and don't sleep.

Will I ever be free without having to work and have money work for me? How sad it is that a work of fiction controls our lives.. Whoever coined this capitalistic system deserves a metal because it's going to destroy humanity in the long run - but I think that's what they want.
