I think suicide is the best option for me.Even though I'm 24, I don't see a reason to live anymore. I know that I have low self esteem, and it's been that way for the past 8 years. I don't have any friends, not even at my job. I know I'm a decent person, but I just think people don't like me; that I'm too boring. I don't party or go out live everyone else that are in my age range. That's probably another reason why people don't take to me too. I'm sure if I died, no one would miss, and that would be for the best. I really just think I'm worthless and even though I'm pretty lonely right now, I just don't see a reason to keep pushing forward. I would love to meet another girl who was interested in me, but I'm sure I'm just too ugly everyone else. I just feel a lot worse now. My first ex, who just got married a few months ago, just told today that she is pregnant, and that just ruined my day. There was one girl I liked at work but she just seemed not interested, and now she is with another person at work, so now I'm don't even feel like going to work anymore. I also feel stuck in life, I hate my job but I have still show up to work. I want a better job so I can move out of my mom's place, but I need a college degree. But I don't have any money for classes, and I don't make enough at work to really do anything besides food, gas, and stuff on amazon. I also don't have any social media since I've had bad experiences with it, so I just don't use it. I really just don't see a reason to live. I have no motivation to keep going forward.
