I want to kill myself tonight.I've never been this low. I saw my ex for the first time in 7 months. She has a new boyfriend and has moved on. I tried to rekindle what we had. She had to explain how over we are. I'm so fucking sad. I feel worthless. I can't care about anything but her. It's not just her. I have financial issues, and anxiety about my future. But this is whats pushing me over the edge. Please someone talk to me.
