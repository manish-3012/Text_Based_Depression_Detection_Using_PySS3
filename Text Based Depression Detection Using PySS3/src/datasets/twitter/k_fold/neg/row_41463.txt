You'll never knowWhen waking up everyday to "be that better person" keeps draining your inner motivation to do anything in this pointless world, look to any other human beside you and realize they may feel the exact same way. I've had suicidal thoughts for years, it's been bad these past couple months. Although it never looked less appealing to me as to when my buddy purposely crashed his car on the highway in efforts to kill himself. Hours before I found out about the incident I had been under the assumption that this "lady killer" of a handsome man had been happy all along and living life to the fullest; which I had been jealous of for some time. We all have the inner dialogue, but if you make the effort to keep pushing on one more day, then you're still playing the game. Maybe the levels get easier as time moves on. Best of luck to you; live life until you feel alive. 

Do not lose yourself on this journey.
