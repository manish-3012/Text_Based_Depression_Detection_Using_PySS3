HurtI want to hurt myself today. I want to cause pain. Iâ€™ve been sweating, thinking about taking my anger out on myself or somebody else. I want to cut my arms up. I want to feel something, anything. Due to my disgusting sexuality and hideous appearance, the only thing I deserve is pain and suffering. I am black and I hate being inferior. Knowing that I am worthless makes me crave suffering. I deserve everything bad thatâ€™s happening to me. Suicide chatline ghosted me. I want to feel. I want to slit my arms or legs rn. I want feel anything at this moment. My parents are useless and only cause me to hate myself with their religious shit. I deserve Hell because Iâ€™m gay so whatâ€™s the purpose of living? Iâ€™m tired of hiding my sexuality and I donâ€™t want to stay celibate for the rest of my life. i want to go away. What if I slit my throat, right here and right now? I want to cause harm. I am so angry rn. I want to cause physical pain anyway I can.
