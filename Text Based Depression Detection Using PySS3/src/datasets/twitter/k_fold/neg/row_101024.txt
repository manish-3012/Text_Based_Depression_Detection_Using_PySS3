Suicide is soon.People have consistently told me it will get better, things will change, etc. I have been living in chronic pain from cluster migraines for 9 years now. It's to the point even biologics barely control them. (Aimovig). I have Bipolar type 2 and Aspergers. I almost finished my R.N degree until I had my first psychotic break in my last semester. 2 years later. I'm married and work a dead end job in healthcare. Even if I were to go back is have to drop another 40,000$ and 2 years. Just to fail again. Thinking about just pulling out a lawn chair. Sitting on the Rail road tracks and let a train take me. People have held me here against my will because im selfish. So I'll let someone else take my life.
