Help meI tried to kill myself twice in high school. I thought it would end. I thought I got past it. Now Iâ€™m in university and I am suicidal again. I feel like no one cares about me and they donâ€™t want me in their lives. I am afraid that the horrible depression is coming again. Will I ever be able to live a life where I am not suicidal?
