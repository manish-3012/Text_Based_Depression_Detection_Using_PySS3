What the answer should be?Hello, people.

I've had severe depression and anxiety for at least 9 years now. Before that I wasn't happy either.   
Had a suicide attempt 9 months ago. Spent a month in a psychiatric hospital, where all the "help" I got was not being able to do it again for that whole month, because I was being observed 24/7.  
I've been on several medications, antidepresants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, benzos. Nothing helps. Mb benzos help with anxiety a bit, but that's not a good solution to the problem, not a long term one anyway.

I live in a shitty country with such salaries that I'd have to work full time to be able to cover only the cost of therapy. I am seeing a psychiatrist on a regular basis, though.   
I'm 23 rn, I dropped from secondary(high) school 3 times, now I'm in the program again + taking some courses, it's all torture. Therefore, I'm at my lowest point again.

I can talk about this forever, but the main point is: if I can't work, can't study, can't have fun, can't socialize, can't simply lay down and relax, what's the point? I was never happy and things are only getting worse.

Since I'm in such a bad situation rn, if I drop out again I'll feel worse, I can't stop taking those courses, because I'll have to pay full price if I don't finish them, I don't have that money.   
This feels like a perfect time to do something stupid.  
The only thing that's holding me back is my partner, I don't want to hurt them. But I don't imagine a life together either, not with a person like me. 

I don't know what to do.   
Also, I'm hardly motivated to do anything. But... any suggestions? Anything?
