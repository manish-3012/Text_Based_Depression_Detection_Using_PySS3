I have decided to end it.I am 30 years old, autistic, and in severe chronic pain. I am unable to exercise or work out or do anything because of the pain. 

I have no career, no friends, no relationships, no future. I have never felt romantic love or had sex - too ugly and autistic. I have no support system whatsoever. 

The only thing keeping me alive for now are my aging and sick parents. Once they are gone, I will end my life and join them in the afterlife. There is nothing more for me here on Earth.
