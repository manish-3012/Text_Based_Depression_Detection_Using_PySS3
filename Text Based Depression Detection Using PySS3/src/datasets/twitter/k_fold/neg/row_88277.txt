It doesn't get better, I'm really fucking tired.I'm fucking desperate. My life was a piece of shit even before this happened, but now that my GF left me it really sucks. I dropped out of college, I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do with my life and the love of my life doesn't want to be with me anymore.

They said it gets better with time but it just doesn't, I miss her more every fucking day, life feels so fucking odd without her here, I feel disconnected from reality and I can't sleep because I'm torturing myself because I know how much I fucked up and it hurts and I really want her back more than anything in my life. I can't sleep because I always dream of her and it drives me crazy.

She's the love of my life, I can't stand toi be without her. I wish there was a painless way to go because I'm a huge pussy and I'm terified of hanging myself or cutting my wrists. But I want everything to stop, please I don't want to suffer this anymore I wanna go to sleep and never wake up.
