I feel brokenOne of my longtime friends passed some time ago and I thought I had been handling the loss ok.  Unrelated to that loss, I've been struggling with thoughts of suicide and my self-worth is low.  But I had a dream last night about hugging her one last time before she passed that made me feel so happy and calm until I woke up and realized it wasn't real and I'd never get to say goodbye.  Her kids have to grow up without their parents, because the dad killed her and then himself.  It hurts so much and I just want it all to stop, but I don't want to hurt my friends.  I want to either stop hurting, or be able to wake up and not start shaking because the thought of seeing people makes me so anxious I'm sick.  I just want to feel better at any cost
