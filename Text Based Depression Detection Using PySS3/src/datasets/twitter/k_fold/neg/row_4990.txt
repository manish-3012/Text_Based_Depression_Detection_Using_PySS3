My life is a f***ing joke: A rant.Childish whining - Today in school, some students hid another guy's bag in another part of the hall. Guy returns, and they convince him I did it. Proceed to have bag &amp; coat chucked halfway across the dining hall &amp; forced to take the walk of shame to go retrieve them. Return to original seat (no other option) and proceed to get pelted with various objects for next 10 mins. Leave lunch hall thinking my life is an absolute joke.

This sort of bullcrap happens most days. I reckon, if I stood up in class one day and killed myself, right there on the spot, no one would care. Tbh, they'd probably cheer. I'm treated like a disease. If all the major diseases assumed human form and walked into class one day instead of me, everyone would most likely be relieved. 'Cancer? Oh great, we thought you were mookamookasector2!' 

I can't even anymore. 6 months until the end of school, but I wouldn't bet on me making it.
