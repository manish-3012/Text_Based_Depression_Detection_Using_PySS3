Talk me downI'm currently sitting at a local park in my car trying to decide if I can do this any more.   My husband of almost 18 years acts like he doesn't love me any more.   He says the only time he's happy with me is if we're high or having sex.   He says it stems from something stupid and thoughtless I said 10 years ago.   Though he was OK with it until he started going out with out me and looking at other women.   I'm so tired of feeling neglected and like an after thought.   The only reason I haven't checked out yet is my kids.   I don't want to fuck them up.  But I don't know if I can do this any more.   I have no friends to talk to.
