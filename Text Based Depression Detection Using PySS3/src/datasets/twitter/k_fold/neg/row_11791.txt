I thinking of ending itI hate my life, and Iâ€™m only 15. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll make it to 16. I go to therapy and Iâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts. But they were just thoughts. Then I told my therapist that I had these thoughts and she sent me to another therapist. After one appointment she said she wanted me to go back but that I would have to schedule it. But I didnâ€™t schedule that second visit. Now those thoughts became me wanting to do it. I donâ€™t trust anyone I talk to and I refuse to open up about this to anyone I meet. Because I donâ€™t trust them, they could tell someone else. A couple years ago I hurt myself and asked to go to the hospital where I was told I was making it all up. My mom got mad at me about it, because it was a hefty bill. I donâ€™t trust her with anything anymore. I donâ€™t trust my dad or my sisters. I just want to end it. My grandma had a stroke and is in the hospital. I hate school because I have no one to make me do it. So I keep procrastinating it. Iâ€™m battling anxiety every day of my life, I have ADD but my mom doesnâ€™t want to let me take my medication because â€œI donâ€™t need itâ€ I guess the only reason Iâ€™ve not ended it is because Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t feel like I have enough reasons to be suicidal. Everyday I struggle with all these things but thereâ€™s a voice thatâ€™s telling me that Iâ€™m faking it all. Itâ€™s all because I want attention. That I donâ€™t have a reason to have problems, my family is well off, your on a sports team, you have all Aâ€™s in school, you have friends, you have a job. Why do you make all this up? Thatâ€™s all I can think. I just want it all to be over. Because it all causes me stress. This weekend I have a 4-5 hour long race and I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll do it. I suck at what I do. I hate this narrative. Iâ€™m just to scared to do it. Because if I fail Iâ€™ll get in trouble. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever have the guts to do it.
