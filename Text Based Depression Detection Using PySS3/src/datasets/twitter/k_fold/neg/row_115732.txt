Setting a date and not backing down from itIf I'm not better by 01/17/21 then I'm killing myself on that day. I'll try to remember to make an edit to this post on whether or not I'm gonna do it, not that it would matter. I just know in the back of my mind that even though I'll keep trying I know that it will end like this. âœŒ
