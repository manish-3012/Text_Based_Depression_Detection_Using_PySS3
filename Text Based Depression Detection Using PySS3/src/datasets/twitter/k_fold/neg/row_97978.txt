Another depressed beanThe only thing Iâ€™m good at is sleeping and I canâ€™t even do that anymore, itâ€™s 3am and Iâ€™m wide awake just wanting to die, if thatâ€™s not a fat mood idk what is. I plan on ending things next week for good this time - life has no meaning anymore and this feeling of emptiness inside me is too much to bare. Rn the only thing keeping me going is knowing how upset my best friend and mum would be but even thatâ€™s fading now and Iâ€™ve written my suicide note. Everythingâ€™s fallen apart - my relationships, friendships, Iâ€™m not me anymore and I feel drained like Iâ€™ve been so busy trying to fix other people, thereâ€™s nothing left of me and I canâ€™t get it back. The prospect of uni doesnâ€™t even excite me anymore, I really want my time on this earth to end so I donâ€™t have to keep waking up every morning to the same feeling of worthlessness that haunts me but Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s going to hurt and I wonâ€™t just slip away peacefully like I intend. 
Everyone keeps telling me things will get better but I truly donâ€™t believe they will and my mindset doesnâ€™t have the will power to change. I honestly feel drained like Iâ€™m a shell of a person whose just existing because of biological functions like eating and breathing but Iâ€™m not living and I donâ€™t want to live if Iâ€™m honest. The world is so incredibly full of evil and suffering with people being the most cruel of all, I donâ€™t want to go on like this. Thankyou for giving me somewhere to vent.
