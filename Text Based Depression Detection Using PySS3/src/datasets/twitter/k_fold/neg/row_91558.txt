Sorry, I never thought I'd be turning here just to talk to someone...I never thought this would be something I'd be doing. I'm sorry for wasting your guy's time. But there is honestly nothing here for me. I mean I have friends, and I love them dearly. But my own family is telling me I'll never mount to anything , that I really am a dumb son of "gun." I really am smart, on the state testing I score above average... but the standardized testing and the way they test in schools is f'd up. I honestly feel like a single bullet would make a lot of lives better. *if you read this thankyou, but I apologize for wasting your time.
