My support is not right hereI message some people who help support me, it's only been a short while when they're offline but more and more I slip. I didn't think I could continue posting, making new topics, when I know the inconvenience others but I'm desperate here once again. God dammit. God and as I was half way through this more shit happened. I'm a mess.
