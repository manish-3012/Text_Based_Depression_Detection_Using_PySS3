I'm screaming it out, but no one is listeningI feel like I'm screaming out that I need help, that I need someone to show they care, that I just need a friend. But all I'm feeling is dismissed or ignored. 

I talk about my depression and anxiety on the regular. It's not a secret. I've opened up to more people about my cutting, but no one cares there either. 

I'm fucking screaming out that I'm not okay, and the response I keep getting is either complete avoidance of me or the subject itself, or it being made a joke. 

As my birthday approaches my thoughts keep getting worse and worse, and I just can't take it anymore. 

I'm screaming out that I want to kill myself, and the only feedback I'm getting is fucking "lol same"  or "don't say that unless you're serious. Do I have to be standing with one foot off of the roof, about to drop, in order to be taken seriously? 

I just want a fucking friend to tell me they love me, that they care, that they would be hurt if I died, because right now I only see my death as a favor to mankind - so maybe that is what it really is; my death could only help the world because of how much of a burden I am. 

Afterwards people will still say, "I never saw the signs." They signs were there, clear as day. They were just ignored.
