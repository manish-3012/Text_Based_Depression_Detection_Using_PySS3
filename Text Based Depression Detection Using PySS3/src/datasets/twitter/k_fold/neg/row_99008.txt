I can't trust myself and I'm conflicted.2 weeks ago I went up to the woods with a revolver a bottle of vodka and bullets and played Russian roulette a couple times then contemplated just doing it. I was there for 5 hours just thinking and feeling the gun and holding it to my head.

In the end my exact thought was "As much as I want to do this I can't hurt the people I love" and I walked out and told a close family member what I had done. 

I went to a crisis counselor two days after my attempt and she wanted to admit me to a psych ward but my parents knew that would just make me worse as well as me so we left and they sent the cops to my house which eventually just left after I talked to them.

Now I'm making new plans and this time if I attempt I will definitely go through with it. My aunt took the gun but I have other methods like a cyanide pill or jumping in front of a 16 wheeler on the freeway. Everyone already knows I attempted suicide but even if I tell them I have these plans it won't help at all because I'll just be admitted get out and be in the same place I am now and if I don't get admitted talking about it to a family member won't do anything.

I see myself going down the same road of suicide each and everyday with no escape. Im not hopeless I just see no point in living anymore and am currently living for other people. My therapist asked me what it would take for me to live for myself and that was probably one of the hardest questions I have ever been asked.

Thanks for reading this far, every single day is a battle hanging on a thread of trying not to kill myself so I don't hurt my family.
