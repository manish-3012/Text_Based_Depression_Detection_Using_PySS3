does the idea of suicide comfort you?lately I've started realising that the idea of suicide has started comforting me. like when things get too bad and I know I can't take it anymore, there's always *a way out* ... 
it seems reasonable, yet it also scares me cause it's not ordinary, I've attempted once and life has only gotten worse after that, but that's beside the point.
