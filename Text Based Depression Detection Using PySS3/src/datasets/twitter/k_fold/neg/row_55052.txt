Where am IAn arrogant brat

feels love and affection.

I babble here aloneâ€”

silence my confession.

.

Cancer in my brain

bleeding from the inside

visions of pain

never ending

.

Stumbling in the rain

looking somewhere to hide

but seeing the same

never ending

.

Desire masked by pain

couldnâ€™t cry if I tried

a smile I must feign

never ending

.

In warmth I once sat,

no need for possession.

Harms I cannot atoneâ€”

faded words my concession.
