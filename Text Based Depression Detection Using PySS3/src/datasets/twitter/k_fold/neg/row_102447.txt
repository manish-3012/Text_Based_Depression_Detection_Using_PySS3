After failing once this is how I feelI wish that suicide was funded by the government. I wish guns for suicide would be like condoms, given to teens so if they're going to do it, they do it right. I wish euthansia was legal. I wish that I wouldn't have to fear buying poison or a gun off the black market because if I get caught my life would get worse.
