I don't care anymore about the good in the world. I can't even perceive it because I'm too caught up in suicidal thoughts.I have no friends because I am an asshole and I can't change. My own mother can't even stand my company, nor my grandfather. I have nothing to live up to. I don't have anymore dreams about the future. I don't know why I'm going to school for a job I'll hate that won't pay the bills, ever. I just wish I could lay down and just turn off. I don't have the courage to kill myself, but I pray to get killed everyday. suicide is on my mind 24/7, and at this point the only cure is to kill myself just to stop thinking about it. I don't have it bad but my brain won't stop perceiving it as bad. I want to die so badly.. I wish I could just up and do it but I just can't. My whole life is going to be wracked with depression; I've seen what older people post on this sub. Depression really never does get better, it just gets worse. My biggest regret every day is that I didn't die the day before. I'm a fuckup loner who literally cannot make friends. I break friends. I have no future, and no will for a future. Hell, I have no will at all anymore except to die. It's almost a thirst for suicide, and I just wish somebody else could pull the trigger for heaven's sake...
