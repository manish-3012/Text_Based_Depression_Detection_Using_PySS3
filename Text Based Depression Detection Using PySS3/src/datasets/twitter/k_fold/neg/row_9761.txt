Goodbye SW. And thank you.This isn't a suicide note saying how I'm going to kill myself. I'm saying goodbye because I feel strong enough now to unsubscribe. I didn't personally post a lot (or maybe even not at all) on this subreddit, but there were a lot of posts by other redditors that I could relate to. I just never had the guts to open up to complete strangers.

But all the support everyone else was leaving in their comments for the OP's who came out for help on here, I want to say thank you because that really helped me also.

I haven't thought about killing myself for a couple months now, and I realized this a few days ago and I felt a joy that I haven't felt in so long that I had almost forgotten that such a feeling existed.

So thank you. Please everyone on here that are helping others who is still stuck where I used to be, keep doing what you all are doing. The difference you can make really is life and death.
