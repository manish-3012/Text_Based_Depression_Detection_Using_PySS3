Just ur average failureI haven't followed through with anything in my life, i try to be disciplined and make something of myself but I fall short every time. I know I'm doomed to a life of being mediocre at best. All my life I've been know as a "nice guy" but that only seems to benefit people around me so they take advantage. I'm tired of trying to be something I'm not and I just want it to end. When I was 19 I made a promise to myself that I would live a life for my cousin who passed away and I really thought I would make something of myself but 6 years later I've done nothing. Life is pointless i have no friends and no one that cares about me. The only thing that keeps me going is knowing when I take my own life my little brother will fall to the same fate as I. I'm not a role model and I failed him as a older brother. I just don't get why I can't be who I need to be for him
