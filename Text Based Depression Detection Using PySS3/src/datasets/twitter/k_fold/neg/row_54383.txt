The worst thing that can happen to me is waking up tomorrowI originally tried to make a similar post with a throwaway but it's not showing up so fuck up, time to use my real account.

I'm having the single worst day of my life. My best friend told me I make her suicidal. I have 3 friends total, if you're counting generously. All of my interests and passions have slowly faded away into nothing. I have literally no goals in my life. Every day I'm struggling with constant crushing depression. I finally decided to get some therapy but it's been totally useless. I dont remember the last time I was happy. I dont have a single thing that's worth another day of this
