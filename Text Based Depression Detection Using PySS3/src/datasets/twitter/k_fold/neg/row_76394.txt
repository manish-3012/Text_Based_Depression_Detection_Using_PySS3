What is the pointI'm 19 and for as long as I can remember I have struggled to find any motivation or ambition. I am widely regarded as an asshole despite my efforts in the last few years to be more apathetic but I've only lost friends since then. My girlfriend since I was a sophomore is growing increasingly distant from me and is having problems of her own in college so she said she doesn't have the time to help me with my problems and called my selfish when I mentioned my problems to her. I owe my two best friends over $600 collectively and have no job. Everyone told me that after I graduated from high school things would get better and I'm here months later even more unhappy and no prospects of success at all. I want to die and I don't know what to do. Nothing helps. Ive been sitting in my backyard for 2 hours contemplating and it all led me here somehow. If I don't do it today I'll just end up doing it some other time. What's the point. Why shouldn't I do it.  First it was "you'll see after you graduate" and now it's " you just need to find a job" I graduated and I had a job and was still miserable. Why should I even bother anymore. It seems to me that I would just be wasting my time
