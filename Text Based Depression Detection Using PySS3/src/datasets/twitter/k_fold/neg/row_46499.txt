I'm done living this pathetic lifeJust got told from someone I thought genuinely cared that I'm too depressed and negative to be around. I told them I wanted to relapse and self harm and I told them, and instead of offering condolences or getting me help, instead screamed at me and said I was joking about self harm. Well, I'm not joking now. I want to slice the shit out of my body and bruise myself until I'm a pulp of my former self. I've been trying for fucking years to get better. But apparently I'm too much. I'm too much for everybody. I'm a burden.
