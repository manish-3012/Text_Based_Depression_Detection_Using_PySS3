Iâ€™ve always been suicidal, but the idea of my family and friends finding out stops meEver since 8th grade Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide, but whenever I consider how I would go about doing so I think about how my family would react and I stop because I donâ€™t want to hurt them. My close family has a history of depression and I feel like if I hurt myself itâ€™s possible they might too. My mother has said before when I was little that if my brother or I died she would kill herself, and that is honestly probably one of the only reasons why I havenâ€™t gotten to planning ever. My life shouldnâ€™t be hard. Iâ€™ve had a very fortunate life, which makes me think Iâ€™m a failure for being suicidal because most of the suicidal people I see have been through so much. I feel like I need to develop ambitions and try harder in school, but my terrible procrastination and failure to plan makes it hard for me to do much of anything. I used to do very well in school, before I started to procrastinate. But ever since I started doing homework later and later and over the past year I almost stopped completely. I do care about school and my future but still oddly feel unmotivated when the time comes to actually get work done. Now I feel like Iâ€™m past the point of recovering. I feel like my story is nothing in comparison to the pain that a lot of the people I see on this subreddit feel, but I thought Iâ€™d get this out because I feel like if I told someone i knew it would affect our relationship a lot.
