Help! I'm tired of pretending I'm okay. I can't trust anybody enough to tell them that I almost ended my life twice when I was eight and eleven.I am currently around 13 years old, and everyday, I regret my decision not to end it when I had the chance. I want to jump off a bridge and have planned the whole suicide. I cut. I'm a selfish bitch who doesn't deserve a life that's not worth living anymore. I feel selfish, guilty for feeling this way which makes me want to die even more.
