Hi, I am fluctuating between panic and calm. Need Help, voice in my head telling me to kill myself.I am manic depressive, on the bad end, it keeps telling how I need to die. How much of shitty person I am and happiness is unattainable for something like me. Been fighting to not kill myself for awhile. This is the first time I actually went and picked up something deadly, kinda scared, but its calming in a way, To be so close to nothing. I honestly don't know what I will do, its hard to fight back sometimes. Sorry for the weird writing, not in a good mental state.
