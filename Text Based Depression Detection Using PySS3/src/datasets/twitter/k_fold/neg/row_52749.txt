I feel unwanted.I'm so lonely right now and I just want to vent. 

Last night I got a Facebook notification that one of my friends uploaded a new photo. I opened it and I saw a picture of the birthday party of one of my friends. And of course, I wasn't there. 

I don't know why but I still feel like throwing up. I know I'm lonely and I don't even expect to be invited to anything but I feel like shit. A few months ago he was one of my best friends and now I've been replaced. The thing that hurts most is that friends are all I have left and now, for some reason, I don't feel like I have anyone who would even care if I died right now. There's nothing left for me to live for. I'm alone and have nobody I can love. I really just want someone to care about right now but I'll take death as another option.
