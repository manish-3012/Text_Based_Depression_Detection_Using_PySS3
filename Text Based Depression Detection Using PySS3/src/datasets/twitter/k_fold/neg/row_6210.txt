Iâ€™m out of time to get better.At the beginning of June I was admitted to the hospital with suicidal thoughts, severe depression and anxiety. I came back to work after a week and a half and have missed several more days of work sense then. Iâ€™m now out of vacation/sick time and management is upset with me.  

This morning my depression is at an all-time high and all I can think about is how I am out of time to get better.   

Things have gone downhill. Today I withdrew from my classes (something Iâ€™ve never done before) and most of my assignments at work got reassigned to others because I was taking too long to complete them due to the excessive absences. People are upset over having to pick up the slack for me and Iâ€™ve never been able to handle others being angry with me.  

This kind of things has happened to me many times before. Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder and have been on so many more medications over the years than I care to remember. Iâ€™ll go for years feeling healthy then, without warning, I crash and burn.  

This time I canâ€™t seem to pull myself out of this terrible rut. Iâ€™ve run out of my as needed anxiety meds a week early because I took them more than I should have. I canâ€™t get any work done at the office because Iâ€™m too busy crying and wondering if I have enough pills to put me to sleep so that Iâ€™ll never wake up.  

My boyfriend wants to take me back to the hospital but that wonâ€™t do any good. I canâ€™t miss more work and people are fed up with me because Iâ€™ve had more than enough time to get better.  

Iâ€™m not better though. And I have no one that I can go to for help. My boyfriend has too many other concerns and I would just needlessly worry my family who arenâ€™t really doing any better than I am.  

Iâ€™m worried that if I took every single pill in my possession, it still might not be enough. And I wouldnâ€™t want to live through it. I have no access to a gun. I feel so low and I donâ€™t see how anything will ever get better. I will always be unstable. Always just barely able to take care of myself.  

If I was gone, my boyfriend could find someone better. They could find someone else to do a better job at the office. I wouldnâ€™t bring everyone down any more. And I wouldnâ€™t hurt any more. I have nothing left to offer the world.  

But I donâ€™t know if I have enough pills. I donâ€™t want to wake up back in the hospital.
