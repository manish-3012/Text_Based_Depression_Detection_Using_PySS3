I don't know what to do anymoreI'm 16, I work 2 jobs along with school. This leads to me being exhausted. My best friend won't talk to me anymore. My parents don't care anymore because I'm just an ass to them. I'm loosing all my friends, my grades are suffering, and all I feel like I do anymore is cry, work, school and sleep. One of my jobs is miserable but I can't quit because I have people depending on me. I'm just stuck and all I want to do is die. One of my best friends just dropped off the face of the earth which is really screwing with me. I'm just so stressed that I want to die. I've been suffering from depression for about a year and a half on and off but it's getting extremely bad. I'm sorry I just don't know what to do and have no one else anymore.
