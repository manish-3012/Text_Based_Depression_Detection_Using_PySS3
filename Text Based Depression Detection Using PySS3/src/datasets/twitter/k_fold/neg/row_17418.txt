too ashamed to botheri've never cut myself before, but i'm feeling left with nothing. and i'm trying it. it's easier than i thought, which is scary.

i've been arguing with myself for the past couple of days to take all of my antidepressants and just get it over with. i already looked it up, and it should do the trick. it's just seeming so much more appealing.

**Edit** Thanks for the support. :/ I'm at my sisters now, so I'm not alone with my thoughts.
