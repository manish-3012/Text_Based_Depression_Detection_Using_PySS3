Need help keeping SO (20M) Safe and aliveHe had previously stayed with my family, but there were certain circumstances yesterday that have added to his overstaying his welcome, per say. 

Other living situations have dried out, his family can't take him in, his health is deteriorating, he doesn't have enough money to really do much, and he was supposed to have surgery at the end of January  that would leave him immobile for  6 months, kind of fucking him out of a job.
At this point, he's just at an all time low, and I'm really fearing for his life right now. He's so young, and has dealt with so much crap...

What steps can he take right now?
As far as housing, disability, any government assistance...
I'm looking at homeless shelters, couch surfing...something, but due to yesterday's circumstances, I'm a bit out of it and scared and not thinking clearly.

Please help?
