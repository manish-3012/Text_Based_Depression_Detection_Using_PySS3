Just can't seem to be happyI kind of needed to vent, and I'm hoping typing this out might help me make things clearer

I feel like I should have a really happy life. I'm at a college I really wanted to go to, studying something I actually enjoy, and during my first few years I had a lot of really great friends that I had lots of fun with. I'm also decently well off, so when all of us decided to move out of the dorms, my parents just bought me an apartment in a nicer part of the city instead of having to live in the part that's less nice, closer to campus.

I guess that's where the problem started. I live so far from school and all my friends that I rarely have the time or motivation to see them anymore, and I've fallen out of touch with them. It also turned out that the apartment itself was honestly quite badly maintained, which meant that I had to spend a lot of my time fixing things, or dealing with the doormen and maintenance personnel, who seem to look down on and bully me since I'm still in college unlike most of the other older people living there.

In fact, I hated the apartment so much I started doing all my homework at school and ended up also taking more classes and an internship just so I had excuses to stay away from home longer. Now, I come home absolutely exhausted and, it makes me sound like a schizoid but, it makes me crack every time the apartment personnel looks at me, which was when I started to feel like I might be depressed. All of my old hobbies, and the work that I used to find so motivating and interesting just feel numbing now.

I just feel like there's so little I have to be depressed about, yet for the last couple of nights when I come home, I've drank a cup of vodka and just leaned on the balcony staring at the ground, hoping I finally fall over by accident. I'm honestly just relieved that tomorrow might be the last time I go out onto the balcony again.
