Just trying to find a safe space to talk about thisI wake up everyday and say I wish I was dead. I think that death will be the sweet release I need in this life. Iâ€™m not strong enough for this world I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be. The cards I was dealt are so shitty and I work really hard to change the deck but I just keep losing. I think about hurting myself or ending my life every single day, itâ€™s all I think about as soon as my brain slows down and I hate it. But their my thoughts so I also want it, itâ€™s like Iâ€™m longing for something  to take me into my next life.
