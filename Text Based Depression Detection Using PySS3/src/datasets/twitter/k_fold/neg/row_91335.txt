I just sit there absorbing everything.Its a sharp pain in my heart. So sharp it feels like im being stabbed and all i can do is sit there just feeling, burning under the surface. I dont want to do this anymore, i cant do this anymore. I hate myself for existing i hate myself for looking the way i do i hate with all of my soul what is in the mirror. I tried yesterday, another scar to add to my collection. Im so sad it didnt work. After i type this and go to sleep i hope i dont wake up. I cant cry either its so hard to cry and when i do its a short period of time...like really short like for fucking 15 seconds. I try to force myself to cry sometimes because i know that bottling it up isnt helping either, but i cant cry. So i sit here every night planning another method of killing myself, and hoping that i dont wake up in the morning. Im not strong enough to do this. I dont know maybw this was the wrong subreddit maybe this wasn't clear enough but...idk just wanted to vent i guess.
