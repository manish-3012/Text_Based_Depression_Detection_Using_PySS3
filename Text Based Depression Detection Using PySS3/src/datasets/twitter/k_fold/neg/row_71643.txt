I donâ€™t know what to do about school.I hate school. I hate the way it works, I hate the system. But I canâ€™t do a thing about that. The school board wonâ€™t listen, they donâ€™t care if Iâ€™m suffering, they just want me to obey the teachers and get good grades. Knowing that I have to do this until Iâ€™m 20 or so, I canâ€™t help but think of ending it all sometimes.
