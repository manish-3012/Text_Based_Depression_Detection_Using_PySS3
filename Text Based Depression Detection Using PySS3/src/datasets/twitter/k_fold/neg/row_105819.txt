Long post, lots of history. Just fed up of having to keep picking myself up.A brief history of my mental health issues;
I have a long history of mental health problems. My last major depressive episode was 2 years ago.

That particular episode lasted 18/24months. I was house bound (agrophobic) and extremely suicidal (hospitalized) during this time.

I have been sexually abused by a family member, and I was raped by a stranger when I was 15. I have an alcoholic mother, who never looked out for me, I was always in the mother roll.

I have no friends, the last friend I had, is currently do her damn best to ruin what little future I have scraped together for myself. 

I am angry. I have done everything possible to keep my shit together, I have failed in little ways, many times, but I've not gone to an irreversible place. The thoughts have always been there, to sell my body, drown myself in drink and drugs so I don't have to think, just walk out, never come back, just cease to exist. 

But I always held myself a small bit higher than those things. I've always been kind to people, I care about people I become friends with, but *every single time* I get fucked over. 

I am so tired. All I want is to get away from these thoughts, memories, feelings. I just want a clear time where I can just; be. 

I want to give up, I am tired of fighting. I am tired of constantly getting myself to stand on my feet again. I'm tired. I'm tired. I'm tired.



Not on medication. I was on fluxetine and olanzepine when I was house bound. I have just started seeing a psychologist. I do not have a method picked, I am just so fucking close to the edge. I am hurting. I just want to be well. It hurts me that I am back in this place.
