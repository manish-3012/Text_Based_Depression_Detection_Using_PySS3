Do you learn to cope?I'm having just about the worst month I've ever had in regards to depression. The anxiety that I have isn't helping either and I find myself constantly wishing I wouldn't wake up when I go to sleep or just fantasizing how I would end it so I don't have to deal with this anymore...

Are there any exercises or rituals that people have to learn to deal with or mitigate these thoughts? Thanks..
