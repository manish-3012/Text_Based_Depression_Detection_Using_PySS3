Ruined the best thing that ever happened to meIm in my early 20s and since my early teens I've have had anxiety issues and have been involved in counselling but with little success. I have always wanted a girlfriend but during my school years never had any success, no girls ever seemed to give a shit about me and I wasn't confident enough to make things happen. Up until last year I had never got anywhere with a girl. I was working away from home and I ended up working with this girl and she took a liking to me without me realising so I wasn't anxious. Eventually when I went back home she admitted it. She asked me out, made plans for me to come up(5 hour bus ride), made all the moves such as holding my hand, kissing me. She took all my firsts including my virginity. My life changed, I felt happy for once, confident and finished off my degree with good marks. I went back to work away again during the summer and started working with her again but she just went very distant from me. Me being me I panicked and kept asking what was wrong and didn't give her space. She snapped at me in the end and said it was over and that she just didn't feel the same.

This was two months ago and since then I've been a mess. All my anxiety is back, I feel depressed, lost all motivation and all I can do is think off her. To make it worse is we had a holiday booked which we are now on as she said she will go as friends. It's the worse idea ever, she being nice to me and it feels like it back to normal but soon as I go in for a hug or any affection she recoils. It feels all fake. It hurts so much. I scared this is the last time ill ever she her.

The best thing that has ever happened to me that changed my life is now gone. I won't ever get that lucky again. My biggest fear was always that she would get bored of me once she gets to know me. Im just a mess and want to end it
