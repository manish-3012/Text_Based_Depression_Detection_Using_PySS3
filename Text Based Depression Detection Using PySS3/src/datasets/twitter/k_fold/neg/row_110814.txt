I can't deal with schoolI'm in 8th grade and in algebra 1. I don't know why the fuck they would put me in algebra because I don't have the capacity to deal with it. I have a 57 in it. The cycle is just me learning the lesson we learned yesterday. And that happens everyday. I'm a fucking retard. Everyone else understands this perfectly. The only relief I have is just banging my head on the wall. My parents are religious delusional cunts. I have no friends. And I have to apply for this IB thing for high school but I can't. Especially since my grades were shit in 6th and 7th grade. If I ever pick something up like programming I give up on it. This is a ramble but anyway I'm thinking of just stabbing my self. Should I do it in my head or my heart? I don't care about the pain but I'd be happy to have less of it.
