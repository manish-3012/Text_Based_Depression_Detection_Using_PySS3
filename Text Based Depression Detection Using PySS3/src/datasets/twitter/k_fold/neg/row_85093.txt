Something that helped meI just want to share something that helped me recently during a phase of very strong SI. Mindfulness as taught by Thich Nhat Hanh. Specifically what I read in his book entitled "Anger." He taught me this technique of noticing the intense feelings and talking to them like children tugging on your sleeve. mindfulness is a mother he says. I've been doing this for about a week and today actually felt palpable relief. Read the book. It took a while to sink in (I have known about this technique for years but didn't think much of it) but for people who are alone and tormented by powerful, overwhelming emotional forces and thoughts, it is worth a try.
