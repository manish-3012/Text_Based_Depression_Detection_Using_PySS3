Coping methods?Hey guys. I'm not sure if this is the place to post this but I'm not sure where else to ask. I'm looking for come coping methods. I've tried a few things over the years but haven't found anything that worked well. I used to smoke weed to keep the suicidal thoughts away but can't anymore. Working out helps but I can't always make it to the gym. Drinking isn't a good idea or a long term solution. I've thought about anti-depressants but I know I have a tendency to abuse pills. 

Does anyone have any suggestions? Since I stopped smoking weed my depression has gotten really bad and I just don't know what to do. I want to die but I know I can't kill myself because I care about my parents too much. I've hit a wall here and I really need some help. Thanks in advance.
