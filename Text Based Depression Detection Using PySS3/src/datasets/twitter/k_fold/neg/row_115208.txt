My life is so fucking dumbI am 18 years old and I'm still in Grade 12 in high school. I hate school so much I have no friends and I hate socializing so I dropped out last year and went back this year. I suck in school so much I always failed every class and I wasn't even in any smart classes. So basically one year of my life gone playing video games.

Now I'm in Grade 12 this year and I'm in one Grade 11 class and one Grade 10 class. I have enough credits to graduate this year but I have no future. I'm not smart enough. I tried to take the most basic of math classes because I always fail my math class. I was/am so depressed that I tried to commit suicide by swallowing 30 pieces of acetaminophen because my parents wouldn't stop fucking yelling at me last year. My parents still don't take my seriously. I STILL think every day of ending my life and what's the best way to end it without any pain. 

I don't feel like getting a job because I am so fucking useless and I hate my parents with a passion. When I was younger all they did was physically and mentally hurt me but now they stopped since I'm older.

All I do is cry myself to sleep at night because I am worth nothing in the real world. Can you believe it? An 18 year old crying. I have no credentials, no experience and all I do is play LoL to remove myself from this shitty life.    

I am a fucking pussy and I went to a therapist to fix my social anxiety problem but stopped going after three weeks because he'd tell me to go talk to people which is the fucking reason I am a social reject.

So what do I do now? I'm not taking nor have I taken any meds but I still feel like suiciding.
