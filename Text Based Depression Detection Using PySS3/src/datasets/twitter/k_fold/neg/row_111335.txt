I need a coping mechanism...I have been suicidal for a very long time but never this serious. I'm at wit's end and I don't know what to do. I lost the only person I cared about I suppose I may not have been good enough, but she did show me true happiness. I have written my family and my few friends letters, I'm ready to die. I don't want to hurt my family but I don't think I can cope with this pain anymore. My girlfriend did not cause my disgust for myself, my life but losing her has really set me off and if anything else comes up I'm so done. I have a full bottle of Citalopram, more than enough to OD. If I can't find a way to cope I'm so far gone there is no coming back. I love my computer but I have lost all interest in what used to give me an escape(WoW, LoL etc...). I don't know what to do anymore...
