I'm as close as I ever been to suicide but I feel oddly calm.I have been actively thinking about and even planning my suicide for a week or so. I alway imagined being this close to suicide as a time of turmoil, a time of seemingly endless panic and anxiety over the possibility of dying. I always believed that if I ever reached this point, I would be in so much pain that I would be actively seeking help. Yet, this is not the case. I feel calm. Thinking about suicide and planning it doesn't fill me with anxiety as nearly everything does. I'm oddly calm, which makes me wonder if this is normal. Is this why some people don't seek help when they're teetering over the edge, because of how calm and right it feels to thinking about suicide when they're close to the point of actually doing it? Is this the point where I should actually seek help from my therapist or someone close to me? I don't feel like I will, because thinking of asking for help fills me with more anxiety than thinking about suicide. What should I do?
