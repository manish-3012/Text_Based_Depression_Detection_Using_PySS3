i have no one lefti feel like no one cares or would care if i died anymore and 

i actually feel like theres no one left who genuinely cares about me, and they dont just like me because of something else that doesnt define who i am. sometimes i feel like my friend only likes me because im gay because theyve portrayed things like that. its 4am and ive completely lost hope and im scared. 
for the first time in six months i contemplated killing myself because no one would care and i have nothing left to live for and i scared myself just thinking about it

im really sorry for ranting but i just felt like i needed to get that out. ill probly delete it in the morning.
