I feel so tired.I- I'm afraid to kill myself but it's all i can think about. I have attempted suicide in a few different ways but they were not even close to succesfull. And I don't completely want to die but at the same time i reaalllyy do.. can't explain it complety. But lately i have been feeling worse and worse and i don't know how long i can keep on doing this. I try to stay alive for my dogs and bunny because I know my mom will just get rid of them if I die. I'm the family disappointment and my parents hate me and they surely do like to show that. I hate my body so i literally starve myself. I feel so ugly, no matter what anyone says to me. I feel really bad tonight and i dont know what i might do but i felt like venting on a community where people understood how i felt. I'm only 15 and i feel like i won't even see my 16th birthday..
