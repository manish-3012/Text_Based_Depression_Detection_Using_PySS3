Iâ€™m too scared to end it.I turned 18 this year and it has been the worst year of my life. Before I start this I just wanna point out that in my friend group Iâ€™m the strong one. You know guys arenâ€™t supposed to get sad or depressed. You just keep moving. I donâ€™t tell anyone about my problems but I think itâ€™s time I open up to someone even if it is just people on the internet. 
Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide since May this year. Every day I wake up I just wonder what death is like and how bad I just want it all to end but Iâ€™m just too scared to end it. I went to jail in May, right after my dad said that it would be best if I moved in with my mom. Moving to a completely new state Where I donâ€™t know anyone and all I do is work and go home at night. I know youâ€™re gonna say â€œwell try to make friendsâ€ Iâ€™ve tried. Iâ€™ve met new people and tried to go out more but people just get tired of me.
Now Iâ€™m back with my dad until my probation is over but all he does is call me worthless. Him and my mom both wanted me to go to the military. I understand why I mean a place to stay and free food away from my family and with all the benefits itâ€™s a no brainer but I guess Iâ€™m stupid. Music is my passion. Everyday I make new music and learn new things but my dad says all I do is take up space, Iâ€™m literally nothing. And I feel like nothing. I mean thanks for pointing out the obvious of how worthless and stupid I am and how I donâ€™t do anything but eat his food and use his electricity and live in his house but I canâ€™t do anything. I canâ€™t get a job because Iâ€™m only gonna be here for a couple months. I donâ€™t even know anymore I just wanna make him proud of me but all he sees me as is a failure. I mean I have to love him heâ€™s my dad, he might not have been around all my life but heâ€™s my father and I just wanna make him proud. If I canâ€™t do that I think Iâ€™d rather die. I know itâ€™s my life and I do what makes me happy but the only thing that would make me happy is the support of my dad. I just wanna be better but every little thing I do sets him off. I just feel like I wouldnâ€™t be a bother if I just ended everything, itâ€™d make his life so much easier
