My future is bleak. My life is ruined.I don't think I'll ever be able to live a healthy life again.

I'll never be able to trust someone else again. I'll never be able to make decisions again. I'll never be able to trust MYSELF again. If I'm so horrible that someone who was supposed to love me unconditionally has destroyed me so easily after years of promising he wouldn't - then I'm not worthy of love. Everyone I connect to will do the same to me in the future. 

I hate where I live. I hate my life. I hate the decisions I made for someone who has ruined me. Every day I hate everything around me. Nothing brings me joy and happiness anymore. Nothing works out the way I want. Ever. No ones listening to my side. I have been silenced. Mocked. 

I wanted a family. I wanted a loving husband. I wanted to have my first kid in 2020. I wanted to go to school again. I want to feel confident enough to finally live the way I want to. Literally - none of that is possible now. None. Of. It. 

I'm too old to go to school. I pick the wrong guys to date. There's no way I'll meet someone, trust him, marry him and have a healthy relationship in enough time to have a child in 2020. My clock is ticking. My body is already dying around me. I'm too poor to do anything I want to do. My life is ruined. My life is over. 

I don't want to live my future. It's bleak. It's depressing. It's not worth anything. Not worth trying. Not worthy of love.


I don't support the death penalty. I think the worst penalty for a criminal is to live his life without freedom and long enough to feel miserable every day of his/her long life. I see death as an easy way out. 

If I don't kill myself, I am subjecting myself to the same punishment I think murderers and criminals deserve. To live an unfulfilling life in misery. I will never be happy and healthy again. Hell, I don't want to. There's no way I will survive this. 

If I do kill myself the suffering will be over. They won't think I'm looking for attention. They'll finally realize how much pain I am feeling. I won't have to go through this again.
