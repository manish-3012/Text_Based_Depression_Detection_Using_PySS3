I am so close to doing itI've wanted to kill myself for a few years now and I'm just ready to do it. I'm not scared of death anymore, I just don't want to put my parents through it. I'm sitting in my car right now ready to drive somewhere high enough to jump. I just can't decide if I want to put my family through this. I already decided I'm willing to put my friends through it, which is really selfish, but a lot of them have treated me like shit so I hope that makes them think a little more about people. I think if a close friend of mine killed themselves I would totally understand. It's just not worth trying. I'd rather just be gone. No more getting friend zoned, no more stress, no more responsibilities. That's sounds good to, but I just can't decide wether or not to let my family go through all of it.
