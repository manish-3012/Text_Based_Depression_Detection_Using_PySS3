Just a vent postHonestly I don't even think I will post this. I am just so done with everything. I have been over this whole life thing for years, yet somehow I am still around. I think the fact that depression kills my desire to do anything is the only reason I am still alive right now. I try so hard to keep pushing, keep living, keep trying to make the world a better place, but I haven't found an honest reason in years. Another big stopper for me is the fact that I fucked up six different  attempts and the last one got me put in the hospital. I know intellectually I should probably go back, but the truth is I don't want to. It isn't as scary or as bad as it sounds on paper, but I want to be done. I want it to be over. I have people to leave behind and it is selfish and blah blah blah, but dammit my life has been lived for other people. Always used for one thing or another all for someone else's pleasure one way or another. I can't be truly happy, not in any way that matters when I know it is all going to get fucked up. I fucking try though. Tried. I went along with my last two relationships against my initial protest. I tried to tell them it wouldn't work. They didn't, but not for lack of trying. Both times I allowed myself to think maybe this is it. Maybe I can be content. I had shit together. They helped me. They both left me within six months of our planned wedding dates. The first one was an end to an off and on relationship of over 7 years. The next was after 4. I don't blame them for leaving me. To paraphrase the postal service I was indeed the one worth leaving. I have learned a lot about myself since then and what it means to really be me, to have my experiences. There is a whole lot of me that needs uncovering and I have been in therapy for years trying to do just that. It is starting to work though. Some shit is getting shifted and feelings I didn't even know about are starting to come through. I am learning things about myself I would never have learned otherwise. The thing is though, that I don't want to anymore. I am so done with the hurt and all the pain. I am so done with letting the people in my life hurt me and waiting for the next one in line. I think about my death a lot. I think about all the different ways to go. It is always there. No matter where I am at or what I am doing I keep at least two different options open just in case. It helps a lot of the time, but it is kind of annoying when I am home alone. I can't leave the house anymore. Most of my friends have already moved on. I had to end the last speaking friendship I had, because it was toxic for the both of us, even then they were states away. I feel like if I go back to the hospital again, I might not get out. I don't know if I should be let out. I just wish it were over. I have the means. I don't know. I guess we will see.
