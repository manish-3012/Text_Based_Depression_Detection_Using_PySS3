I fear that my friend will die any day from nowOne of my friend has always been suicidal since we met, and I tried my best to help her. Unfortunately these days she's saying stuff like "These will be my last messages", "No one can help me" and things like these and it's making both me and my other friends really worried. She has done overdose before and she talks about self-harm. Words can't describe how worried I am and my anxiety has been really bad for this. I got some understanding issues and I take lot of time to understand stuff and usually someone has to simplify things for me. English is not even my first language and she talks only english, that makes our conversation pretty bad. I feel like she's going to commit suicide any day and I'm so sad and I feel bad because I feel like I didn't help much
