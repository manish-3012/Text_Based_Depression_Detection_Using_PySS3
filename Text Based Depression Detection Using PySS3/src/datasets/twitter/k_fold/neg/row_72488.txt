I was a talented and up-rising star novelist but severe depression drained all my aspiration.I am completely unable to write, *even just one page*. I couldn't, I've tried again and again and failed.

This drastic mental illness cause me to feel like a painter without hands, a surgeon with fractured finger-bone,

reminds me of ***Doctor Strange (Marvel)***. Absolutely, so tragic... I feel extremely *worthless* right now,

as I've dedicated my soul to a literature career and a magnificent artistry.

Yes... I'm considering to hang myself. Without arts....*no life at all.*
