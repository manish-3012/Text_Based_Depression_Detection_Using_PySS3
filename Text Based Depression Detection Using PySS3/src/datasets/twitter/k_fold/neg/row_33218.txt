I tried once now Iâ€™m staring at the window thinking of finishing what i startedI struggled a couple of years ago and slit my wrists but i called 911 and went through rehab, i was fine but now Iâ€™m just empty and full of hatred and sadness towards myself once again.
To be honest I donâ€™t know even why, Iâ€™m just going through a tough time, i might have to leave my house by the end of the month and I came to the realization I canâ€™t even be the best of myself for my brother who means the absolute world to me.
All that just leaves me with the thought that maybe i am just broken and never really going to function properly so might as well just end the problem.
If anyone has any suggestions
I donâ€™t even want any warm words just some solid advice or any type of reasonable logical reason for why I shouldnâ€™t just jump off my apartment and create a smaller less hurtful problem that itâ€™ll be for the people around me to deal with than to actually deal with my shitty personality or the thought of how am i fucking up my life anywhere i might be
