Why is it not today?I just don't get it. Why can't I go through with it. I know deep inside how worthless I am to every single member of this planet. Why haven't I just stepped in front of a car?

I don't want to involve anyone else in my death, but i'm at the point now where I don't care.

I posted a week ago, thinking maybe someone around my area would bother talking to me but it never happens.

Why is this the hardest thing to ask for? Why can people do monetary favors but nobody wants to be your friend?

I lost everything. I'm in debt because I crumbled under pressure. I want to try to make things right but I can't.

I want to fix relationships but im told to go kill myself nobody cares.

I just want freedom. some days i feel ok, the other days its quitting time.

I know I'll never be able to physically talk to anyone and thats whats doing it.

I can't live in this world anymore. I just cant. I don't want to keep typing the same message over again. Who cares if i do yoga, it calms my mind for 20 minutes ad then right back to hating myself

I need someone to honestly state they are willing to meet me in person

Ive been rejected on all forms of social media. FB, Plenty of Fish, MAtch.Com, tinder, etc etc

I hate the one woman I know (2,000 miles away) uses the "you're not *that* bad looking" or, "you're not as *bad* as you think you are"

but thats it...you know some cheer up there.

I dont want to be alone, but i am. I dont want to die but if i dont it's a future of misery

I cant do anything about it, ive done all I can, except blow my brains out and make sure nobody ever forgets it was their fault
