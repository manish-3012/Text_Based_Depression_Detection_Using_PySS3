Every morning I wake up contemplating whether do I want to die or notIf I want to, well okay. If I didnt want to, something shit happens. I wish our company driver didnt find the rope I had prepared last year. To think he thought it was convenient enough to find one in our house and didnt need to buy one for towing our damaged business mobile. 

Come to think of it, this next monday marks one year since that happened. I never actually thought Id attempt it myself before. Things are actually worse now than before. The want to die is stronger, but the urge to end it all has gotten less intense. I dont even really care anymore
