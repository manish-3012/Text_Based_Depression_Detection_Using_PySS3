If you were suicidal, what would you do to get better?I've been to the psych ward. I've tried therapy. I haven't tried anti depressants, but I have tried recreational drugs. I have lots of friends, and a loving family. Intimacy would probably make me feel better, but Ill never have an intimate relationship. Suicide just seems to make sense. But people keep saying Ill get better. Am I fucked?
