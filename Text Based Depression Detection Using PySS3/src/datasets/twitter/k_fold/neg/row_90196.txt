DonePlacing the order for the pills as we speak. Am planning to take my life next week. I am twenty years old and have rarely felt happiness. I donâ€™t care anymore. I love my family, the few friends I have, and anyone who cared enough to try to help. I hope things get better for you all, I do genuinely hope you all get the help you need and keep looking towards a bright future. My story is coming to a close but I believe in you all. Goodnight.
