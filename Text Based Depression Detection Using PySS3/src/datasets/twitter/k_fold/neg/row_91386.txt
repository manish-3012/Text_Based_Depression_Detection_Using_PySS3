does it matter?Interesting food for thought - it's generally viewed as unacceptable to end your life because of the grief you may cause to those who were close to you. Suicide doesn't end pain after all, it just passes it on to somebody else. 
But, it's significantly more acceptable to cut ties with everyone you have ever known and move away, even though those people may not ever have a chance to speak with you again. 
Is it the finality of death that makes it such a big difference, as it eliminates even the smallest chance of reconciliation? Is there solace in the fact that the option may exist, no matter how unlikely it may be?
