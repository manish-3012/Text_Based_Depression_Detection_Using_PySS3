Wish there were more good daysI've always had persistent suicidal thoughts in my for the ten to fifteen years. Some weeks I can feel somewhat normal, and might only be a passing thought a few times a day. Other days it occurs every second until I sleep. I try to silence it. And I've found that taking cold showers through out the day will silence everything for a few brief moments. And working out helps at times too. Not always, but it helps keep my mind quiet. 

I live alone and rely on myself for everything. I really couldn't live with anyone else. And I'm deathly allergic to pets with fur, so my only companions are several, oversized plushies. I feel calm, lying on the floor, just hugging them.

I have my good days and bad. Some days I feel so good and free, I feel like I am my god himself. And other days I wish someone would kick my door in and end it quickly. I stay away from people since I'm afraid I may accidentally hurt someone from my days of overconfidence or my days of self hatred. I wish I could have more good days than bad.
