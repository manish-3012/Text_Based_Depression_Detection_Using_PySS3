If I kill myself then she wins; I won't let her win.The only reason I haven't killed myself these past 15 years is because I know my suicide will just be another opportunity for my narcissist of a Mother to make everything about her and her strength and suffering.

I've been depressed since I was 10 years old. My entire life I was told that I was spoiled, ungrateful, manipulative, and 'exactly like my father'. I never asked to be born, certainly not to a family of narcissists.

Do you know what it's like to be told that you're a manipulative liar since you're 5 years old? Do you have any idea what it's like to question every good deed and gesture because it's always used to manipulate / guilt trip you in the end?

Do you have any idea what it's like to try to tell your Mother that you are depressed, only for her to literally laugh in your face, then get angry and call you a manipulative, ungrateful, spoiled little brat who doesn't appreciate how good he has it?

I've made my share of mistakes as anyone else has. But unlike other people they were never *my* mistakes. If I made a mistake then she would call everyone in our family, all of my friends, and all of *her* friends and tell them about the horrible things I did and how hard it is for her to be my Mother. Then she'd she'd parade me around them, emotionally tarred and feathered, then wonder why I have no drive to do do anything with my life / make friends / spend time with my family.

Do you have any idea what it's like to have your own Mother use your love for her, your love for your family, and your love for your friends, as a weapon against you? Do you have any idea what it's like to have her slander, libel, and defame your character to everyone you know, simply so that those same people will pity her and commend her on her strength as a person?

Eventually I broke free of her, but it wasn't enough. She gets to live happily-ever-after, careless to the fact that her only child loses sleep every night because of how much he truly *hates* her.

I want to die; I've wanted to die for decades, but I refuse to kill myself. I refuse to end my pain just to give her another soap box to climb on. I refuse to let my passing be an excuse for her to tell more lies about how horrible I am so that everyone will say, "Oh Kathy, I don't know how you did it! You are *so strong*!"

The **only** reason I haven't killed myself she wouldn't even let y own life be mine; it *has* to be about her. I wish she was dead. I want her to die knowing that her only son hates her with all of his soul. Then I can finally die in peace knowing that nobody will be able to claim my pain and struggle as their own.


Kathy, I fucking hate you. You are the worst human being I've ever met in my life, you have ruined more lives than you know, and you single-handedly alienated your only son from his friends and family because you didn't want to accept the fact that you were a terrible, selfish, narcissistic Mother.

The wonderful life you built for yourself came at my expense, both emotionally, and financially. Everything about yourself you hated, you pushed on to me. You told all my friends and family what a liar and a manipulator I was, which was a manipulative lie on your part to trick them into taking your side of an argument before even hearing mine.

There is a reason you've never had a friendship or relationship last longer than a year -- you can't keep up your act. For the first few months you are the most charming, benevolent, generous, open-minded person anyone could ever meet, but sooner or later that manipulative narcissist in you breaks forth.

What causes me the most pain is knowing that you're out there living in a house I helped pay for, filling my families' heads with lies about the horrible things I've done to you; which in truth, are actually horrible things you've done to me. That is how I know you're a sociopath -- everything you claim to hate about me, every flaw of mine you harp on, every negative thing you've ever said about me -- these are opinions only shared by you, and the weak-minded people who believe what you say because you're a very convincing sociopath.


Am I perfect? No. Have I made some horrible mistakes in life? Absolutely. But never once did you, or anyone else in the family ask me, "What happened? How do you plan on fixing this?"

Instead, you would drop in on them unexpected and in a complete flurry, pretending to be a concerned Mother trying to save her child, while you fill their heads with manipulative lies. All I ever heard was, "Why did you do this? Don't you think about anyone but yourself? How could you do this to your poor Mother?"


Do you remember our last conversation? I was trying to have a talk with you about how I didn't appreciate you going into my room, stealing my phone, checking my messages, and going out of your way to misinterpret my texts to support your own made-up accusations.


You had no reason to do so. You suspected I was on drugs for no other reason than you wanted to make some drama in your life. I don't do drugs, I never did drugs, but you couldn't accept that. You needed me to be flawed and broken. You needed me to need you, but you were realizing that I didn't need you, so you tried to force me to need you by alienating me from my friends and family.


When I bought my car you convinced me to put it in your name and insurance because it would save you money on your premiums, so I agreed. As I got older, you **refused** to sign my vehicle over to me, or to take it off your insurance; except, when I was in dire financial straits and you wanted to use your legal ownership of my vehicle as leverage against me.

Do you remember when you bought me the bike for making Honor Roll in 3rd grade? Do you remember the first thing you said to me, as I was walking it out of Toys R Us back to the car?

You said, "Well, I hope you enjoy this because the second you screw up I'm taking this away."

And then suddenly, I'm an ungrateful, spoiled rotten little child because I didn't want the bike anymore. I didn't have the social maturity at the age of 8 to realize I was signing a verbal contract of servitude; I was under the assumption that it was simply a loving Mother rewarding her son for working hard in school.


You tell everyone you've loved and supported me my whole life, but you don't know a fucking thing about me. Since I was 12 years old I've been actively writing music / involved with the Music Industry. I went to College for Music. I was in a band for 5 years. I ran a recording studio and a sound company for over a decade.

Can you name a single song I've written? Can you name the instruments I play? Could you name the band I was in, or any of it's members? How about my studio, or my business partner? 

No, you can't, because the path I took in life didn't offer you an opportunity to coat-tail on my success. You couldn't claim any stock of my musical prowess because the only thing you know how to do is be pretty and seduce high-rollers at Atlantic City casinos.

I hate you, Kathy. You robbed me of my childhood, but convinced everyone I knew that I robbed you of your 20s. You robbed me of my self-esteem, but convinced everyone that I was actively trying to ruin your life. You never let me learn how to make a mistake and build myself back up; instead you punished me for any mistake I made because of how it effected *you*, and made sure to tell everyone about my mistakes and how they effected you.


I hate you Kathy. For all of this, and for the fact that you get to live happily-ever-after with a family who loves you because they have no idea what kind of person you really are. Your happiness, position, and success in life came at the direct expense of that of your son.

I was never your child; I was a vanity project and a conversation piece. You brought me into the World to prove to everyone you could accomplish something. You used your knowledge of my Father and how his mind worked to manipulate and trick me. You were more interested in solving issues rather than prevent them.

You actively walked me into scenarios and social traps because you knew how my mind worked. Did you do this to teach me how to rise above myself and become a better man? No, you did this to prove to me that I am my Fathers son, a piece of shit, and that you would always be two steps ahead of me.


I hate you, Kathy. I hope you enjoy these next few years of your life, because sooner or later your Mother is going to die. Then your Father is going to die. Then your sisters are going to die. Then you're going to be left alone with no one left to blame for your own self-loathing.

You will not have a funeral. You will be buried in a paupers grave, the only souls in attendance will be the two migrant works paid under-the-table to dig your hole and bury you in it. I won't be there, I will be at home burning your possessions; thankful that you are finally gone from the World.


I hate you, Kathy. I truly, deeply, utterly hate you. I want you to die knowing that.

- Your son




Kathy, I know you think you're in the right. You said and did all the things you needed to in front of the people who's validation you sought, but you never followed through with any of it. 

Yes, you did the things legally required of you as a Mother. Yes, I'm sure you made sacrifices and struggled. But it was *never* about me. It was always about you, your struggle, your journey, and how **you** triumphed against the World with a child strapped to your back.

But did you ever read me a bedtime story? Did you ever offer to help me with my homework? Did you ever ask how my day was for any reason other than the fact you had found out I got in trouble and were now trying to trick me into lying to you like a manipulative girlfriend? Did you ever talk to me about how I was feeling in life, what my goals and dreams were?

No. You just gave me *stuff*; stuff I never asked for, and then labeled me as spoiled and ungrateful because I didn't fall to your feet in servitude after being given gifts I never asked for or wanted. Your gifts were always selfish manipulations of my emotion and will. Your kind words were masked with secret intent to get me to let my guard down. Your criticism was never about helping to grow as a person, it was about making me understand how much my choices have affected you.

That is no way to raise a child. That toxic, manipulative, narcissistic mentality is the **exact** reason why your Father left your Mother, and the same reason why your Grandfather left your Grandmother. You, like your Mother, and your Mother before her, are self-important narcissists who feel that they are God's gift to the World and put here for the express purpose of telling everyone how to live their life.

You've told my friends and family for years, **YEARS**, that I was a lying, manipulative sociopath. Think about that, Kathy. You labeled your own son as a lying, manipulative sociopath when he was seven years old. Why? Because I was my Father's son, and you never got a chance to tell him how you really felt about him, so instead you tried to groom me to be him and then exact your revenge? I never asked to be brought into the World; you were the one who ignored the advice of literally everyone in your life to give me up for adoption; because **you** needed to be needed.


But to those same friends and family, ask yourselves this -- when have I **ever** tried to manipulate you? Did I ever call you up in the middle of the night in attempt to literally wrangle a posse so we could emotionally tar &amp; feather my Mother? When she made mistakes, hurt my feelings, or did bad things, did I call you, her friends, and everyone else she knew to air her dirty laundry to all of them, hiding behind the guise of being a "concerned son who's only worried about his Mother"

No, I didn't, because that's her game; her angle. That's how *she* operates, and I refused to become her. 

But I don't forgive any of you, because there is no way you didn't see what she was doing. You can't have been blind to that as adults, what was so clear to me even as a child; I refuse to believe it.

I think what actually happened is you were caught off guard by how *hysterical* she gets when she's manipulating people. She knows exactly how to work you up and trigger that damsel in distress reflex. Doesn't help that Kathy is a pretty woman who knows how to wield it (Hey Kathy, remember when we went to Miami and you told me not to call you Mom because you were trying to become a Versace model?).

You knew what she was, knew what she was doing, and went along with it anyway because it's easier to appease a screaming child than it is to discipline them. You chose what was easy over what's right, because it's easier to go along with her than it is to argue with her.


And that's why she won. It was easier to believe that I was this sociopathic monster from the age of 5 who spent every waking moment of his life trying to sabotage and ruin the quality of life of his Mother. Much harder to believe that you were duped by a pretty-faced sociopath who is so insecure that she goes out of her way to sabotage peoples' lives so that they're forced to need her.


I hate you, Kathy. You are the worst thing that has ever happened to me.
