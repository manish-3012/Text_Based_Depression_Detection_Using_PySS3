Ending my life, 20 years old. I'm worthless.I'm 20 from the UK. 

I've realised that I can't offer people anything of value. I'm ugly, poor, stupid, not really fat but not six pack healthy, got no friends, not naturally funny or talented at anything. Been bullied all my life and never had a compliment, or had a relationship.


I know life is about survival of the fittest, which I'm not, I have no place in society.

Goodbye.
