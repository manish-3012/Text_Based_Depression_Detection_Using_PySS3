Never thought id get hereHello. So im not quite sure where to even start but. I read through some posts through here and i feel like maybe i dont have it as bad as abuse and such but. Throughout my life i have lived in 3 different sataes, and 2 different countries and yet it has seemed to be a complete circle for me. People just tend to use me for personal gain and help educationally or just faked there way ou of my life, and most of it has to do because i had been consistently bullied for 12-13 years of my life which ranged between verbally to physically. And recently its gotten to the point where my parents acknowledge how lonely i am and it tends to be very degrading. Im only 18 so sometimes i feel like its probably just hormonal feelings but tonight i have considered taking my life but i know i could never do it because i would feel too selfish in the act yet i feel so desperate to just have someone listen for once to me and not use me to vent their problems and such.
