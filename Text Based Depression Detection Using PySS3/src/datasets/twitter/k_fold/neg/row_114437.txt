I Keep wanting to crash my carsometimes when I'm driving alone on the road at night I'll speed up as fast as I can and all I want to to is drive straight into a telephone pole. it feels like no one loves me and I just don't have any friends anymore, I have people I talk at school but I never hang out with anyone, the only constant thing in my life is my girlfriend and she really holds me together, but I'm scared if I tell her that I want to die she'll leave me, and then I would have no one, and I'm scared of that too
