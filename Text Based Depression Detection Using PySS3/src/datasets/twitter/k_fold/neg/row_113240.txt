I just need to get this off my chestI was dating this AMAZING girl for about three months now. Things were going great and I was enjoy every second we spent together. 
Fast forward, and my 50 year old co worker comes up to me and says "isn't this your gf?" And shows me his POF app. She's on there basically selling herself to "rich daddies" (She's 18 and gorgeous). 
I confront her on text because I'm still at work. She comes clean that she's been fucking other guys on the side for cash. Sometimes in MY BED. 
She had my credit card from earlier for a small purchase. Once all this is out in the open she maxes out my card (about 10k) then jumps on a plane to a different province. 
I still see her on POF... I made an account to try to contract her. Not sure why. 
I really don't even care about the money. I thought I was going to marry that girl though. 
Oh. Also my childhood dog was run over this weekend. So that's fun. 

Tldr: 
The girl I was going to marry breaks my heart and my dog dies.  


Not really sure why I'm posting this. I'm just feeling really really down and I desperately need the support. I'm at the point where I really don't care if I wake up in the morning. I think I'd actually prefer that.
