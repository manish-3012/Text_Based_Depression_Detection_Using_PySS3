i have 8 daysPlan is to skateboard down my road to a bridge above the motorway at 2am. I have exams this week which apparently are going to pan out my entire future. I cant pretend to be motivated anymore. The future scares me. I don't want mine to be shaped by my mistakes now and somehow the only solution in my mind is to end it now. My brother killed himself last year and i've seen how it effects people. I am how it effects people. I cant talk to any friends about it because they'll tell my family and i don't know if i could cope with seeing how my mother would act after what happened with my brother. Im a trans boy who's currently closeted at an all girls school. 
Help?
