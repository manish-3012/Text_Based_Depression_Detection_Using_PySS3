ignore this if you want, iâ€™m just ranting through a poemall i wanna do is sleep  
man i wish iâ€™d pass away  

this becomes so hard to deal with  
each and every passing day  

some people just donâ€™t get it  
some are telling me to pray  

people saying â€œit gets betterâ€  
â€œhold on for just todayâ€  

listen, i donâ€™t want your help  
nor do i want advice  

i just want to be forgotten  
or rather dead, to be concise  

iâ€™ve been here living long enough  
heard what you have to say  

quit telling me to hold on  
iâ€™m done with trying to stay  

all iâ€™ve heard so far  
are fake promises and lies  

because no one really cares  
until somebody dies  

donâ€™t bother with my funeral  
shedding your fake tears  

or saying that you loved me  
to all your friends and peers  

itâ€™s hard to express your feelings  
my mind is always astray  

but i guess iâ€™ll try and hold on  
for just another day  

edit: idk if itâ€™s obvious by the first two lines, but i used powfuâ€™s  song â€œdeath bedâ€ as an inspiration 

edit 2: had to repost this again on a different account because one of my friends mightâ€™ve accidentally found out about this, and itâ€™s too personal for me to show them
