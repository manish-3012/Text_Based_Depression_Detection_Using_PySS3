17 year old disabled parasite. Killing myself is the only way to give back what I've stolenI'm still in high school but I'm at a dead end and don't see much point to going on any further with this shit.

I was born with septio-optc dysplasia (De Morsier's Syndrome). I have several impairments, the greatest of which being a severe visual impairments since birth. I can't get a drivers license or join the military or anything. 

I get good grades but I'm not in any competitive classes because of my syndrome, so I can't make any friends since I'm with a bunch of kids who don't care about school and the teachers treat me like shit so I fucking hate going to school and doubt I'll be taken seriously by college.

No girls will go anywhere near me. How am I supposed to take care of a family if I can't even fucking drive? Who's attracted to someone with a disability?

In summary, my life is fucking meaningless. I'm a cancer. I won't be able to do anything. Can't get a career, can't get married or have a child. Fucking why keep going? So I can get some shitty disability check? All that does is turn me into a parasite feeding off the tax dollars of everyone else. Everyone except me actually wants to live and has a chance to benefit society, why are they being punished with my presence? 

Suicide is the only way to repay everyone who has had to put up my burden, if i die then everyone will benefit.
