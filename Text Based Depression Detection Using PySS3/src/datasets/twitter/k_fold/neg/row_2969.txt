Should i speak about suicide scars on a job interview?Sorry, if this isn't the right sub, but i don't know where else to post this. 

4 years ago, i had a suicide attempt, that left my arm badly scarred. And it's really bad, around 50 scars, half stitched, clearly visible, and and it's also very clear how i got them.  Now, i'm going to a job interview, the job is a shopping assistant in a stationers shop. Since its a job where scars could be a problem, due to working with people, i think i should tell about them to the employer. If i cover them on the interview, i fear that it can cause problems later. But if i talk about them, how should i do that? I thought about just going in short sleeves, and acting naturally, but than maybe they just simply won't hire me. But if i talk about it, we can find a solution, like working in long sleeves, or it will show them i still have problems (which i really don't, i'm just bad at communication) I'm so concerned,  and feel so lost, i'm contemplating not going to the interview at all, but i really need a job. Can you help me with some advice?
