Should have kept my mouth shutA few months ago I posted on here about how everything seemed to be getting worse at once, and how I had already started writing my note, etc. Well, a few days after that post I made the mistake of telling my therapist, who sent me to inpatient. It wasnâ€™t a bad stay, and I was fine for a little bit afterward, but for some reason today I suddenly had the urge again. I donâ€™t understand why Iâ€™m here. I have a family whoâ€™s supportive, and a boyfriend who supports me too. But thatâ€™s just it: I donâ€™t deserve that support. I just fuck up over and over and over. Always too dumb, ugly, fat, incompetent. A waste of space. Iâ€™m the only one home right now, if I really wanted to I could finish my note and go off myself, no one would notice until tonight. I just donâ€™t want to waste space anymore, Iâ€™m such a disappointment to everyone around me. Iâ€™m sick of it, Iâ€™d be doing them all a favor.
