Tried venting to my only friend (who knows I'm suicidal), got told to fuck off.Been going through the worst time of my life. Extreme, agonizing, crippling depression. I'm miserable from the minute I wake up to the minute I fall asleep. I have one friend. He knows all of this. I tried messaging him a couple times on Facebook, he gave me a response that basically entailed "fuck off I'm busy" with a sarcastic emoji. Yes, he knows how serious this is. I've always apologized for venting and he would say that its okay and it's what he's there for. But I'm a burden to everybody in my life. Tonight might be the night.
