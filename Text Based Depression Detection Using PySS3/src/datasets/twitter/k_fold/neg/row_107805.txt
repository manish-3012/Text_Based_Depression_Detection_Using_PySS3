Anyone wanting to kill themselves but are too proud to do it?My life has sucked the past 3 years and I really just wanna go through with killing myself but Iâ€™m too proud to do it. Becuase of the people who have screwed me over and the ones that hate me and make my life harder. Even the random strangers who like to ruin my day just for the hell of it. I HATE THIS LIFE AND IM SO ANGRY I WANNA KEEP LIVING IT. And I have no motivation to do anything at all and friends at uni kinda hate and bully me which makes everything 100x harder. I cry myself to sleep every night but make myself wear the best outfit everyday and just go through with it. It goes like that and never stops but I have come to the conclusion that if I kill myself no one will care and I dont wanna feel that insignificant. Maybe Iâ€™ll do it when I accomplish something so at least Iâ€™ll have people coming at my funeral.
