"What is it that is causing you misery?"I saw this question posted in another thread, and it hit me like a ton of bricks. I feel so unloved and unlovable. I had wanted to kill myself since I was 10 because of this. I'm nearly 30, and I still want to. The only thing keeping me alive is fear and that remote possibility that "it gets better". Right now, it doesn't. It hasn't gotten better and seems highly unlikely to. I'm probably near at least the halfway point in my life, so there's not much time left. I figure it's only a matter of time until I kill myself. I'm just not sure when that time will come.
