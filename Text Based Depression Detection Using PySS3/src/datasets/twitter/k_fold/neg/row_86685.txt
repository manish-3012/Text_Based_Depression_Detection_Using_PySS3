I have nothing and no oneI lost my family. Pushed them away. Lost my boyfriend(E(. He'll be gone forever. There's no more love for me from them or myself. I feel hopeless. I don't know if I should end it now or wait till I move out. (E) said he doesn't want to be around if I do it. I'm only allowed to stay he because he feels bad. I have nothing but him. And I can never get him back. I feel the most broken I've ever been. Broke the most important man in my life. 

I truly believe without my family or (E) and his family. I'm nothing so I should become nothing.
