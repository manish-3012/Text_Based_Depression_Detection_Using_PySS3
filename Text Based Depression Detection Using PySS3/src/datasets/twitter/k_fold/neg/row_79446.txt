Iâ€™ve written my noteIt took almost a week, but I think Iâ€™ve said all I need to say. I spent the first few days pairing down the language to make it less accusatory or mean. I truly donâ€™t think anyone will care when Iâ€™m gone, but I donâ€™t want to twist the knife incase Iâ€™m mistaken.

Today is a holiday and all my friends have abandoned me since the first time I attempted. No one wants anything to do with me, and I donâ€™t blame them. Itâ€™s difficult coming out as suicidal to your friends and family, itâ€™s even worse doing it and then having them abandon you because youâ€™re not fun for them to hang around with anymore. People are inherently selfish, myself included. Itâ€™s hard to justify a friendship that comes across as charity work. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll go today, but I probably will tomorrow. I have a hanging rig all set, Iâ€™ve tested everything and it shouldnâ€™t take long. Happy 4th of July. ðŸŒ­
