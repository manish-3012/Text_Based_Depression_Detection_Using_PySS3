I've picked a day, and I know exactly what I'm going to do.My friends have been dropping like flies.

Both exes have moved on to men that I could in no way compete with. The first after leading me around, the second after being emotionally abusive and lying to me. I'm a failure.

Messy break up with the last one, tons of rumors spread. I can't make friends.

I've had OCD my entire life. Sabotaged highschool for me so I can't enter programs until I refinish certain courses. Sabotaged my social life basically since I was born. It's really hard to make friends.

Intrusive thoughts (a symptom of OCD where you literally can't stop thinking about something, it feels like there is some other being inside you throwing these thoughts at you) have made it really difficult even now to stop 

I can't make friends or trust people anymore, it's been two fucking years like this now. 

I can't control my intrusive thoughts of my OCD, medication hasn't helped. I spend nights curled up in fetal position trying to push them out. I lose hours of sleep, and can't focus on school work even though I'm reasonably intelligent. 

The economy and my current situation as a disabled person might not ever let me have the dignity of living away from my family who I have grown pretty distant from.

I can't even get work.

I'm fucking ugly. My hair is already going out. My body is shaped weird and doesn't look good at all, this is after my dieting and exercising where I've lost 50 lbs and am at a normal BMI.

It's been 13 years since I've been happy.

My parents are going to get divorced. I realize that I'm in my 20s and should not care but I do.

The only reason I exist is because a religion told my parents that my Dad would stop being mostly gay. 

I've decided I've given myself until shortly after my 30th birthday.
