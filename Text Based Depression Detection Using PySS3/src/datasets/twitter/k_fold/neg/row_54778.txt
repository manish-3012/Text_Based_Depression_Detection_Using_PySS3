Need advice with suicidal friendMe and Ben have been friends for forever. He's struggled with anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember. The first time he mentioned suicide was a few years ago, but it seemed like a thought and a concept more back then. The past year so, he's had problems finding a meaning to life, and understanding who he is and what he wants.

 He has problems making friends, so I've been one of his only confidants through everything. He's my bro , and I love him, but it's really taking a toll on me. I've told him about my issues with depression as well, but they always seem to take a backseat. I am not suicidal, so the fact that he is suicidal makes me feel like I need to be there for him no matter what. That it's selfish to turn him down. I never make him any false promises, never tell him it's going to get better. I normally just listen, and try to tell him that I'm here for him, and then I love him. 

Normally doesn't go anywhere. He drinks a lot and does a lot of drugs. When he drinks, he'll call me at all times of the night, he'll text me when he's at work, it just feels like I always have to be on.

 He tells me he's sorry that he uses me. He tells me that he's a shit friend, and he has nothing to live for. I tell him I'm here for him, and I'll always be here for him. And I know a lot of you will say to  tell him to get therapy immediately (he's going), and that i need to back off for my own well being but how? I'm his only friend. It seems awful and impossible but I can't keep this up, I'm really hurting and I just can't help him. I don't know what to do. I'm sorry this is so poorly structured. Any help or advice you can give me would be so nice. Thank you.
