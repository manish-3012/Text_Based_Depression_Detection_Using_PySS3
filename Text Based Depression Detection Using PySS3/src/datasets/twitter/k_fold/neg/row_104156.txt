To be honest life feels like an obligation to meI don't enjoy my life. It's not bad, but it's not good either. I just end up doing the bare minimum to not face any consequences of being "lazy" and waste any free time away. 

At maybe 17 (I am 22 now) I thought of committing suicide. Same stuff, I wasn't in pain or anything, just apathy. But I am still here, I wasn't serious about it back then, but the final argument that made me abandon the idea was that it would hurt my family. 

And recently some stuff happened and I am again suicidal. Also saw some people say, that a person should live their own life without doing stuff others demand from us. Added one and one together and I get the thought, that maybe I shouldn't keep up with this obligation.

I mean if I can freely choose how to live my life and not let other's decide for me; I just wouldn't live. I was born, raised and now I am expected to live the rest of my life... even though it kinda sucks. 

I am currently in a state where I don't really give a f\*ck. I guess I could seek therapy, get some medication and work towards bettering my life... but why am I expected to do so? Maybe it's better not to bother and just end it while I don't care. Why do **I** have to **work** to fix a life I don't care about right now?

Fixing my situation would be hard. I am also (duo to never doing much) very inexperienced in stuff like healthcare, insurance, medications... it would take so much effort and stress to do anything. And I find it extremely difficult to talk to others about how I feel, I can't just say "hey I am probably depressed, help me seek help". I can't even talk about mundane stuff. So getting on the right track to fix my life... it's just a lot of work for the sake of a person I don't care about - myself, just to satisfy people I don't want to hurt.

Maybe I should just use the fact my life is my own and end it. It's not to solve my problems that are poisoning my life, it's life itself that is my problem.
