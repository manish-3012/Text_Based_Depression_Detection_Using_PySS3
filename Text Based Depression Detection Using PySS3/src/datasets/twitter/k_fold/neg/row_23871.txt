It really sucks to have realized that life is meaningless at such a young ageI realized it when I was 16, Iâ€™m 18 now. There really is no point, you grow up, you get a job, you try to make money but always end up not having enough of it, then you die. Itâ€™s really sad because I wish there was a purpose but in reality there really isnâ€™t. The only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of how sad I know my mom and dad would be. I couldnâ€™t do that to them. They are so loving and they work so hard in this meaningless life just to do the same thing every other mid level family does. I probably wonâ€™t ever kill myself, im too much of a pussy, but god does it suck always wanting to be dead.
