I fucked upWhere do i begin. I have kinda always been stressed out in life. Either it was school, family, friends or life in general. 
I failed last year college. It wasnt hard but i really luck motivation in life. I told myself i will suicide if i fail again this year and its seems that i wont pass. 

I am so fucking tired and i feel like shit the whole time. 
I got pills but i stopped because they arent working. But the problem is me. I didnt even try to pass college this year, i didnt put any effort to keep in touch with friends, i stopped exercising. I sleep 5 hours a day because i spend the night on my phone. I keep making these decisions even though i know they are destroying me. I think i gave up along time ago. People have tried talking to me but i rejected. What can we talk about when the problem is me?
 I dont even know

I brought this all to myself. I have planned my suicide. I dont want to go on.
