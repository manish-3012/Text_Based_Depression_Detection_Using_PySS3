Thanks for the LithiumGet prescribed lithium 2 months ago. If they knew how fucked up I was going to get in the next few months, they wouldn't have prescribed it to me. Maybe I'll do it slowly, like 1500 mg every day so it's in early December, instead of on a holiday. If my family cared about me as much as they say, they would try to support me being trans. I'm another statistic.
