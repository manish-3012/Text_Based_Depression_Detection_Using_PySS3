I don't know what to do...I am in a wheelchair with a rare condition, nobody knows what it is. I feel like I am big waste of time, I want to quit university and I feel I cannot do it, got no motivation or concentration on anything. I do not trust anyone as all my family does is lie.
I have suicidal thoughts every day of the week, I have seen therapist but they don't seem to work. I told my mother and she couldn't care less, she is constantly rude and horrible to me, she is all nice to my brother and sister, now I don't talk to any of my family even though I still live them.

I need help but I don't know what...
