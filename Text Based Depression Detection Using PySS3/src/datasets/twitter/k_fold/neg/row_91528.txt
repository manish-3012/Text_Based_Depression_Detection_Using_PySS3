This may sound weird but I think something wants me to kill myselfThis all started last summer when I was convinced something living and putting thoughts into my head. It sometimes tells me to hurt or kill myself It is starting to freak me out. This same thing putting thoughts into my head watches me and it is starting to take over my life as I'm afraid to leave the house.

I am not sure whether I will kill myself but I think about it often although the thoughts don't feel like my own. It feels like someone or something is putting these thoughts into my head. I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense.

I am seeing a psychiatrist about anxiety and depression but the last few days I have suicidal thoughts constantly and I don't see him for another month. 

I am not sure what else to say or what I want out of this post but if someone can talk to me and help me and maybe give me some tips on how to block these thoughts would be appreciated.
