I just wrote out a huge paragraph but I accidentally clicked back and now it's goneI'm not re-writing all that shit. I'll spare the details. I just need someone to convince me to not kill myself despite having zero reasons to be alive. The only reason why I haven't done it yet is because of the high chance it would fail and I'd be left permanently brain dead or something.
