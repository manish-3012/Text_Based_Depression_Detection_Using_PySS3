I want to kill myselfMy mom is angry after getting out from the hospital. She says no one loves her. Sheâ€™s upset at my sister whoâ€™s uncaring and disobedient to her. She threw stuff. She says if she died weâ€™re the type of daughters to cry for only three days. To be fair, I wouldnâ€™t cry, I would kill myself right then and there because sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m forcing myself to live.

I hate myself I hate my life I hate all of it. I want to die. Please please why canâ€™t God let me die. Iâ€™ve never asked for anything in my life except this and I canâ€™t even have that.

Please, I donâ€™t want to live anymore. No oneâ€™s happy and I canâ€™t fix anything. Itâ€™s all shit. Iâ€™d rather die. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so so tired.
