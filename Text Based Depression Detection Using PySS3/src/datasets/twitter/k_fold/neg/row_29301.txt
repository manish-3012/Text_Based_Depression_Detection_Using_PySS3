Thanks guysI am the same guy who posted the'7billion people in the world but no one cares about me' in this sub in December. The support that I received was overwhelming. I had deleted my account a couple of days after that so now that I am back I wanted to thank you guys. I didn't want to live anymore back then but now things have started to look up. I still have bad days, I still feel depressed but instead of giving up I continue to fight. 
Love ðŸ’–
