I have hit the bottom and it sucks here&gt;I m am in my early 20s my life was kind of good until two years ago when I was doing exercise and herniated my l5 s1 disc resulting in excruciating sciatica I m always in pain..I should have done the surgery a while ago but I didn't since I was afraid that there is no one around to take care of me(I study abroad) also my friends left me and my ex girlfriend cheated on me ..so I m so alone all the time except when i go to classes there I see people around and might say hi to them but we never go through details abouts themselves or me because no one cares.I also never complain to my family to no let them worried Until recently when I told them I m about to do surgery...now my chance for surgery is gone because I've run out of holidays due to my internship . .lonely in pain and nothing to hope for I've found myself thinking of suicide the whole time, I've also been searching for ways to end it but the country I stay at no drugs are allowed and impossible to get ,,so I m left with only jumping off a building ..my building is 13th floor high so I think it's enough if not there is another building next to mine with 20sh floors .my only reason not to do it till now is my family but I guess when I m gone it won't matter hopefully... 
&gt;Ps:I ve tried acupuncture swimming walking to improve my state and still trying but there is no noticed improvement maybe 5% better still can't do any activities like sex or partying so i m always in bed or in my standing desktop...goingg to classes hurt me so much because of sitting and I want to stand all the way in class but i m shy 
&gt;English is not my first language so I m sorry if I made this post hard to be read.
