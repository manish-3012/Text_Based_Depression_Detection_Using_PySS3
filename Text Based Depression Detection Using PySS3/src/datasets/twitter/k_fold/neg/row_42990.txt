Here and back again.Last time I posted here, it was about me being curious of death and thinking of suicide, even though everything in my life was good. Well, now everything isn't good. The love of my life that I spent five and a half years with has recently told me that she doesn't love me anymore, and that she hasn't been happy in a while. Now, I had always been really good at telling how she had been feeling, and I can tell you that she got really, really good at pretending to be happy to fool me.

Since then, I've had trouble keeping up at work, my bills have fallen behind, and I'm noticing that all of my friends are entirely too selfish to help me out. I have many friends, but the only one that ever really knew me was her, and though we are trying to be friends and I am trying to talk to her, every moment that I do I start to feel worse and worse.

I have some short-term goals I would like to see through, such as finishing my novel (and perhaps the sequels). But beyond those, I see no reason to keep going. I believe it was George Eastman, inventor of the roll film, whom, before ending his own life by gunshot, left a note saying "My work is done. Why wait?"

I have lost trust in people, I have lost a part of myself (since I couldn't 1. see she was unhappy and 2. do anything to stop it), and can no longer see any of my future, since it was planned out mostly with her.

I need something, anything. About a third of me wants to die. Convince him otherwise or he may just start gaining ground.
