Why am I this way?I might regret that Im writing this but I just feel like it. I dont want to die, I really dont , but I just want some relief, something to look forward to , a goal that I want. Im just miserable. I cant move forward because Im weak , because of self pity and I dont do anything to be better or to change my situation. I hate how I feel I hate who I became and I hate the situation that Im in. Instead of being grateful for what I have I just think about my sad worthless future where I probably wont like anything. Why cant I be logical and strong? Im just avoiding important questions because i dont know the answer and I will regret not doing anything now. Why cant I work for my own benefit? I see myself as a big faliure. And i might just writing this because Im an attention seeking stupid person but I just feel so tired
