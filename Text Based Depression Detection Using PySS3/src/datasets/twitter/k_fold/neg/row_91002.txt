37m never done anything that amounts to anything,No accomplishments in school or a career, no romantic relationships, no children, no property, been homeless for a month because my parents kicked me out by calling the police, been driving around with a noose in my car looking for a place to hang myself.

Been a messed up time for me it all started last month when two days from my birthday my parents started speeding up moving out from the home I've known since I was 8, and only the second home I've known which is only a few hundred feet away from the first home I've known and the first home i was actually born in. 

So I kinda panicked and was trying to slow them down from moving, because I don't want them to move and sell the house, and they called the police on me and had me arrested I was in jail for 2 days over the weekend and now have a record with the police and have to deal with legal issues from charges brought on from the state, that are bullshit charges. Because of the charges the judge put a no contact order on me so I can't see my parents can't talk to them can't even come near their property anymore which is my home and always has been.
