I don't want to be alive anymore.I can't stop thinking about my baby. He would've been one years old come the 15th. I hate myself so much for how I've handled this past year. 

I completely screwed up everything in my life and ruined all of the relationships I had. I have nothing going for me anymore. 

I've had plans to off myself come the 15th for the past year and I think I am going to follow through.
