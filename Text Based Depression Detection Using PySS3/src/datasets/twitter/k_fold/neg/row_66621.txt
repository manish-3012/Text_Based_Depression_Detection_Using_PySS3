One of my poems expressing now I feel.I looked death in the eyes 
bitter like your coffee stained eyes.
Wiping away your tears 
snatching my tissue
now stained with your sticky coffee residue,
which you should of asked to use!

You looked death in the eyes 
and it almost kissed you.
Now it's justifiable why everyone feels sorry for you.

I prayed since I was 15 for you to rescue me. 
The smell of my desperation becomes bleach to her stain, covered but now tinted permanently.
As existing became my crime.
