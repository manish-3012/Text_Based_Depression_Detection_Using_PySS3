I lost the will to live the day I died.Yes wonderful title but all too true. I was fighting for my life with cancer for 9 months. During an operation to remove the tumor I died on the operating table for several minutes. Ever since then I haven't felt the same. I have had a note written since then and I have been trying my hardest not to finish the job, but I am coming up on the 1 year anniversary of my cancer free status and it has become harder and harder to find a reason to get out of bed. I lost my drive, my spirit you could say. Since that day I started drinking in secret, and I haven't been able to sleep. Sorry if this seems like the ramblings of an angsty 18 year old but I had to get it off my chest. If this falls on deaf ears I won't mind I just had to say it.
