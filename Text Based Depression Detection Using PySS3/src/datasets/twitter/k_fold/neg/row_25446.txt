Having hardest time with very bad depressionSo for some quick backstory. Iâ€™ve attempted four times,three by hanging the last by pills. Iâ€™ve struggled with alcohol addiction that lead to bad alcohol poisoning and nicotine addiction that lead to nicotine poisoning. Recently Iâ€™ve been having some small split personality issues but the main issue is Iâ€™m having a really suicidal thoughts. Every night for four nights now Iâ€™ve just felt no reason to live,I donâ€™t feel sad I donâ€™t feel anything. I try things to make me feel but I just donâ€™t. Whenever I do feel happy itâ€™s with my one and only friend,but after that I feel like that happiness is fake. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore Iâ€™m in physical pain and mentally worst state Iâ€™ve been in. I just need help or someone to talk to.
