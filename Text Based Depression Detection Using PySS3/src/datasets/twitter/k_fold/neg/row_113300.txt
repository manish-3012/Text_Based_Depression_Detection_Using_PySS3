How being tired affects your mental healthIve always experiemnted with substances but Cocaine was thr one that did it for me...
I nevwr knew it gives you a rage of energy then you crash...
I crashed and now I cant get back up. It eventually build to my anxiety of life, inability to grow like everyone else because I was all spiritual and bullshit.... Adhd doesnt help as much...
But I had a better chance before for change thsn now.... Im just tired.. And Im done.... I dont know what to do... Just wish I had someone to talk to about stuff.. But I got a golf ball sized conciousness ans cant think and conversate like everyone else.... I feel fucken sad inside...  
the reason wjy I just dont get up and get a job is because Ill get tired real fast and its like Ill begin to loose balance.. Its rediculous... So I woudnt be able to move as fast as life itself... Man.... :(
