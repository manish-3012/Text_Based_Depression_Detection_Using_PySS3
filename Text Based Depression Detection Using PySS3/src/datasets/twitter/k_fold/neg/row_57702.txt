Itâ€™s my birthday.Today is my first birthday since my husband left me on October 19th of last year. I came home one day and he was gone.  It was my fault but I never saw it coming. Iâ€™ve wanted to die ever since. Begging the world to take me out in a freak accident because I am too afraid to end it. Today is my first birthday without him. It is in the top 10 worst days since he has left. Every holiday is hard. Every day is hard. I donâ€™t function anymore. Iâ€™ve gained so much weight because I literally quit life. 
Not a single person told me happy birthday today. Not the girl Iâ€™ve been friends with since I was in 2nd grade, not my â€˜best friendâ€™ who I let move in with me when her relationship ended and she was suicidal. Only for her to abandon me after my husband left and I was at my worst. 
Iâ€™m so tired of people telling me that Iâ€™ll be ok one day. There is nothing left in me. Iâ€™m so afraid of myself. I just want it to all go black forever. I think Iâ€™m getting closer.
