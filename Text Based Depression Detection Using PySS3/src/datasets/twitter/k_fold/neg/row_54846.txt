I didn't go through with itI made a post here the other day when I was in a really bad place. I ended up not being able to find my dad's gun lol so I decided to get drunk instead. I think I'm okay now, for the most part. I spoke to my psychiatrist and she got me scheduled for weekly sessions with my therapist. 

I don't know what I hoped to accomplish with my post. I was very angry and in despair. I didn't think anyone would actually care and reach out to me, but through that post I ended up making a really good friend, so it went much better than I expected. I just thought I'd let y'all know that I'm okay and I appreciate everyone who reached out to me and was concerned. Thanks. ðŸ˜„
