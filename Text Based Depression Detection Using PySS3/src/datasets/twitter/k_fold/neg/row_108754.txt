What helps familiesWondering if any of you had a family member who killed themselves and if so what helped you get over it? I'm done and although I'm not close to my family and they rarely communicate with me I'm sure there will be some adverse effects of what I am going to do. And please save me the it gets better or try therapy stuff. I've tried therapy with several therapists, don't have health insurance anyhow right now so it is a non-issue and it doesn't get better. I'm in my 40s and if it gets better it would've happened by now. Have no bad feelings towards my family just want to lessen the impact on them as I stated before. Thanks.
