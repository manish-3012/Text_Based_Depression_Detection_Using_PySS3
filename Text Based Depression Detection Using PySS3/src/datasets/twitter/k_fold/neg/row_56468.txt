no motivation to wake upHey reddit, this is a beautiful subreddit and it's amazing how you help out people, maybe you can help me out too. So i am 20 years old, im a college student right now, i had to skip a year because my parents couldn't afford a place where i could sleep during college. This year was pretty rough, i finally found a cheap rent that they can afford, i also worked during that gap year as a waiter to help them out. I studied a lot this semester and i wanted to make them happy and proud. in romania there is this rule where the top 4 students get money for their hard work, and i was almost there but the 4th student had the same final grade this semester AS ME, and they picked him for the loan instead of me because he had a higher grade at a certain topic ( but in total, he had the same grade as me). I can't believe how unlucky i am with everything in life, i keep trying and trying and nothing good ever happens to me, how could i be this unlucky? I fell on my knees and started crying when i heard how unfair this college system was, that money would have helped out my parents so much... it was 150$ every month (for 7 months). I have no motivation in waking up anymore or to try to do something, i just feel empty, useless and a fucking failure. I can barely smile, i barely have any light left in my eyes, i am sick and tired of being unlucky all the time, my life is a series of fucked up unfortunate events and i'm sick of it all. I worked so hard and stressed so much over those 1050$ ... my mom tries to cheer me up , but i can see the sadness in her eyes too, she wanted me to be happy, and i fucking failed. I was thinking of ending it all tonight, but i can't accept the idea of passing down this pain on somebody's else's shoulder... I hate being poor, i hate this... please, can somebody help me out? i am so lost right now and i really need some guidance
