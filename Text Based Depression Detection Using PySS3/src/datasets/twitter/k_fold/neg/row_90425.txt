If onlyIf only. If only I could muster up the strength to talk to somebody. Yeah, I have my therapist but I only see her on a weekly basis. Talking to somebody once a week about the dark thoughts that wreak havoc 7 days a week doesnâ€™t help that much. If only it did... if only i didnâ€™t get the short end of the stick maybe Iâ€™d be normal. Maybe I wouldnâ€™t have tried to take my life and get bakeracted, in other words, punished for wanting to go to sleep and never open my eyes again. If only the reassuring remarks, like â€œpush through itâ€ and â€œyou have no reason to feel like thisâ€, rid me of this illness. But then again, thatâ€™s all hypothetical
