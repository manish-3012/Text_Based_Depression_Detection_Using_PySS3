Failed semester, Got forgiven, Got sober (8 mos.), Went back to school, Failing again.About 9 months ago I had a mental breakdown and begin drinking like crazy, which resulted in failing my classes for the semester.  I came close to suicide attempts for a period of weeks and began regularly self-harming.  

My school's counseling program was amazing and had me tell my family what was going on;  I got sober, enrolled in a PHP program, turned my life around, got the classes removed from my transcript, and went back to school this Fall.  

Now, I am sucking at my classes again.  I got A+'s on my midterms, and I love what I am studying, but I have been sleeping in and missing the last several classes, and missed two big papers.  I think some people are just incompetent and rotten to their core, and can't be fixed.  

I was unbelievably lucky to get the second chance that I got, and I've thrown it all away.  Sobriety is good, but what does it matter if I am the same shitty person I have always been?  I can't put my family through his, emotionally and financially again.  My family was so supportive, and I know that I don't deserve them.  Some people don't deserve a second chance.
