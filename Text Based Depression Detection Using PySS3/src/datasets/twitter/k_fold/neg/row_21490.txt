I Wish... I wish that I could be worth it.   
I wish that I wasn't alone.   
I wish that school doesn't breathe down my back and abuse the quarantine.   
I wish that I could love myself.   
I wish that I still had that someone to hold me close and tell me "its gonna be okay"   
I wish people could like me for who I am rather than out of pity.   
I wish my parents would listen to me and not yell at me over my brain.  
I wish I could love my depression and anxiety so that way it can leave me like everyone else.   
I wish I could be an A+ student like my parents want me to.   
I wish I could be happy.   
I wish I could give up.   
I wish I wasn't a coward so I can finally bleed.  
I wish I could die so I can finally be at peace.  
I wish no one misses me.  


I wish that tomorrow is a better day.   
I wish that I will amount to something.  
I wish that I live one more day.  
And another.  
And another.  
But 2020 just doesn't like that huh? My parents got rid of my art program, and blocked my few ways of feeling okay. I've lost almost everyone. My parents never cared that I'm unwell.  


Who does? I'm just a face in a crowd. No one will miss me when I'm gone.
