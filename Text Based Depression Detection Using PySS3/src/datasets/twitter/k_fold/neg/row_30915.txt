Waffling about ending my life.I'm more agitated than I've been in awhile.  I am leaving my decade relationship with no where to go. I'm moving my stuff into storage but that's all I can afford to do.  People think healthcare pays well, it doesn't. I keep having ruminating thoughts of taking out my body sized stuffed animal dog and laying on the floor in the storage unit and slitting my wrists while I hug it. The hospital I was in not that long ago didn't help. I accidentally took meds that knocked me out before I can do enough damage to my wrists to bleed out and surprise surprise I'm not actually depressed as much as I feel hopeless and lost so I just woke up from that attempt.  Used the liquid sutures from my first in kit and went to work for the week before I was sent to hospital. My record says it was an attention seeking behaviour and not a true attempt. I want to die but I'm terrified of the consequences if I don't succeed. I know how to do it. I fucked up before because I underestimated the meds. This time I won't. I don't know what to do at this point.  I don't want a future.  I don't care about what great things I can accomplish. I don't care about the patients whom I've come to know and help save their lives.  I'm tired. I'm broke.  I'll be homeless in two weeks. I just want this over. I keep thinking about the stuff I have and down want others to go through like my journals and phone.  I don't know what to do and I don't know where to turn to.
