I feel like I'll have to go next year.I'm taking the A levels starting tomorrow but I'll be getting my results next year. Chances that I won't make it into any university are overwhelmingly high. Ive always been a failure when it comes to studies. Too bad that is the only thing that matters here.

My parents don't have the means to send me overseas to further my studies and I would rather die than become a burden to them. I would rather die then see myself become a failure in everyone's eyes. Just leaving feels so much easier
