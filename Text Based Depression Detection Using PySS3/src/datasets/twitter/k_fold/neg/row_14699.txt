One reason I donâ€™t do itThe thought of suicide always puts a smile on my face when I couldnâ€™t smile all day, whenever I think about it I canâ€™t think of any negatives, I just think about how great it would be, such a relief.

The only reason I donâ€™t is for other people such as my parents, friends, and a girlfriend at one point.

Itâ€™s kind of empty knowing the only reason I keep living is because of other people and I really could care less if I died.

Anyone else feel that?
