I know it's not the right place but severely wanting to end it all but just because if this but other reasons alsoF 23 irish no significant medical history either than a hiatus hernia weight maybe 13 stone height 5f8

I am flushing burning up really bad for almost 6 months, it's not emotionally or heat related. It just is constant my face is always not to touch and my cheeks are always so red and blotchy and warm, no temperature just skin burning.
Not rosacea been tested.
Its getting to the point where it really stings and is just so so uncontrollable and uncomfortable all the time.
It never eases or goes away it is always burning.
It's starting to make me feel I'll as it's so warm all the time and arms have started burning to.

Please if you can think of anything give me some advice, I really hope its something good and not one of the many horror story diseases I am starting to believe it is.

Also get lightheaded from time to time and chest pressure from heartburn and belching. Probably not related.

My lifestyle a mess and this is taking up all of my thoughts.
