Depressed life is worthlessI don't know what is real anymore. I have nobody to talk to and I'm tired of talking on anonymous boards on Internet. I wish I could just stay in some hospital where would be at least somebody listening to me, no matter if they do that for money or not.

I don't know if I have a psychosis or what is wrong with me. The only person I've talked with regularly in the past year is telling me I'm a worthless whore and if I died it would be better for everyone. I have nobody but my cat here and people are avoiding and ignoring me.

I feel I'm not even here anymore. I don't know what I am, who is "me" who does these things, wakes up in the morning, types this keyboard. I don't have any real friends or anybody who would appreciate me for who I am. I mostly just hear that I'm a meaningless whore. My own family is hating me too.

My family has so many problems, physical and mental abusing, alcoholism and my mother suffers some sort of neurosis because of all the stress they have in my home. I suffered from that environment as long as I was conscious about myself and my environment and some months ago it all came too hard for me to bear and I moved away.

There's no reason for me to be here. I wish I had at least one person that would like to talk with me but I know nobody. I'm entirely lonely. I see no reason being here. I don't know what to do. I have no reason to breathe or do anything, what the hell should I do if I don't even want to move any of my limbs or think any of the thoughts going through my head. I wish I could stop being. Stop being here and just wasting everyone's time. Stop being this worthless whore and do what's best for me and kill myself before I destroy anyone's life. A depressed life is worthless, I don't want to live this kind of life. I wish it just ended. If I had a gun it would be so easy. I don't even know any ways to kill myself. How fucking pathetic is that.
