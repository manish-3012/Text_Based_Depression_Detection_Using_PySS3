I didn't know whether it was a suicide or not, I jumped into the Mississippi riverOff a viewing spot, not a bridge or anything. I dove in head first, cracked my head open on a concrete block, fucked up my back and neck for a few weeks. I don't know where else to take this. This was in August. That's probably something I shouldn't have done lol. So I was feeling down, and now I feel down about that. And the same problems exist. I read these stories of people who jump off bridges and then realize they can solve all their problems halfway through. Well I've tried that shit, nothing works. Don't know what to do honestly.
