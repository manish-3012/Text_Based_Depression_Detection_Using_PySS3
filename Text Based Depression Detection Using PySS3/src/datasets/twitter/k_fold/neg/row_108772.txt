I almost got Baker ActedI woke up yesterday to my eye irritated, and filled with fluid. It hurt like hell, and I decided I had to go to the ER to get help. I got checked in, and the nurse took me back to get my blood pressure, etc. She asked a few general questions, as per usual. 

Then she asked if I had thoughts of hurting myself. I thought about answering no, because I'm used to dealing with this issue on my own. But I felt compelled to tell the truth, so I said yes. 

Suddenly it was high alert. She began talking to me in a calmer, more soothing voice. She wrote this down on my papers, and she asked me more questions, like if I had a plan, etc. 

All questions were answered truthfully. I told her I didn't have a plan, that it was more of just a thought. She accepted this, and soon I was taken to my room. After getting situated, another nurse came in, and was acting the same way. Calm, soothing tones, asking me questions, confirming what I'd told the other nurse. 

She comforted me, and said a specialist was on her way. The specialist got there, and again, more questioning. She said I was going to be monitored, and that there was a possibility I was going to be Baker Acted. 

This scared me for a few reasons. I've never been baker acted before, and I didn't know what to expect, and I didn't think I was a danger to myself at the moment. I understood, though, that this was just them making sure I was safe. 

After getting blood and urine tests done, another woman came and asked me about my thoughts. Same round of questioning, again. I told her everything, and soon she left. 

I should clarify, that though I have suicidal thoughts, I'm deathly afraid of death. (Pun intended)

It's more of a feeling of not wanting to exist. Not wanting to feel. Just to be numb, and not hurt anymore. I can't, and I won't, take my life. But it doesn't stop me from thinking about it. 

After a long time, the specialist came back and told me my thyroid is "out of wack" as she put it. She said this is what could be causing weight gain, as well and mood swings, depression, and my thoughts. She gave me a list of clinics for me to try, and discharged me from the hospital with parting words of encouragement and hope. 

I thought for a while there I was going to regret telling them the truth, but I'm glad I did. I have an appointment tomorrow with a therapist, and hopefully get some medication to balance out my emotions. Wish me luck, guys.
