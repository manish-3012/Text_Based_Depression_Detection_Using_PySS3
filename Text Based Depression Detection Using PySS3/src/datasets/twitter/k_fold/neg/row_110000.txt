I want to kill myself tonight, can someone talk to meI don't feel like typing out my backstory again so if you want to talk about my situation specifically please read these: [One](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/l86ne/suicide_seems_morally_right_to_me/) [Two](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/mfbvz/ive_been_trying_why_is_nothing_getting_better/)

Since Two I've just been kind of hanging on, nothing is changing. Because of the way I've planned to die these next couple days are the last ones I'll be able to do it. I don't want to get trapped in life for another year, but I'm obviously scared of dying.

I'd appreciate it if someone read my other threads and talked about that, but I'll take any company I can get right now and you guys all seem pretty nice here.
