It never goes away, it just evolves...This is a throwaway account, because there are others on my main that don't need to see this...

I haven't been this low in a while, its been a few years. 

I knew its been building for a while and yesterday I was pushed to the edge.

As in I was standing on the curb, about to step into traffic.

None of my friends and family could stop me, the only thing that I think did stop me was I'd feel bad for the poor person that hit me and them living with that. 

The day before was the snapping point. And today.

Today I realized I can't recover. Its exactly how it was 2 years ago. 

I didn't escape and I don't think I ever will. 

Idk... why I'm writing this... I'm just so fed up trying and don't want to try anymore...
