21 gonna commit suicide at 30.21, M, in college. Homeless in college. I feel so sad, so mad, it's all really bad. I feel as if there's nothing to really do. I feel stressed all the time. The only thing that keeps me going is music. I sing and play guitar and write songs everyday and post a new album about every month. Currently learning how to mix and record music on my own. That's the only thing that makes me happy. Just going to continue writing and recording songs until I'm 30, then end it all. By then I'll hopefully sound really nice with all those years of practice. I've thought of this idea two weeks ago, and I feel a bit better. Don't worry as much, since I know it'll all end soon.
