Forgot my meds yesterday. Paying the price todayAt least there's an explanation for how hard it was to wake up and separate dream from reality. 

The floor is moving underneath me and my head is spinning. But worst of all, I want to cut open my arm. 

My boyfriend has my bike, and driving the car is too dangerous. 

None of my friends are priviledged enough to have a job where they can ditch everything and come help me. 

I don't want to die. Not yet. I've come too far.
