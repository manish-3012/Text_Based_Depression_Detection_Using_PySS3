My friend is hurting herslef and it triggers me so badI wanna help her.
I used to self harm alot in the past, but I haven't done it on ages.
But she's using my razor that I leave at the shower, and I feel guilty. 
If she uses this one the cuts can get infected. I think I'll give her a fresh one. With bandages and some alchohol to disinfect it. I know I can't stop her, but at least she won't be stupid and get it infected...
I don't know what to do, I'm sitting alone for 3 hours crying, and anti vantilation and I hate it
