Loneliness is finally getting to meI have no friends. For all of last year I really only had 1 friend, but she moved away recently. We still text each other from time to time, but that's only like 1-2 times a week, 3 if I'm lucky. Everyday when I go out I don't talk to anybody, I also have social anxiety so I'm always super nervous about people judging me. My friend hasn't texted me in 2 weeks and I don't know why. She just stopped. The last 2 weeks I've deteriorated in my mental condition so badly I don't even want to be alive anymore. But I'm too scared to talk to anybody about it. I'm still in high school and I'm just dreading college 24/7 because I know it'll be 100 times worse then this right now. I don't even know what I want to do with my life, so I have nothing and nobody to live for. Suicide is something I've been considering, and I've already made a plan, will I go through with that plan? I don't know. But after I finish this post I'll either go through with the plan or wake up tomorrow and let the suffering continue.
