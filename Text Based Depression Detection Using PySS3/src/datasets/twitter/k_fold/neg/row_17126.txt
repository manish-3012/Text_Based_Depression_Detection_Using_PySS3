I have a good life. I've done almost everything I've wanted to do. I live with my boyfriend and his family. I have a job. I've travelled plenty. I study at university-- it's a great university. My grades are excellent. I don't have any serious issues with the way I look-- I am ok with who I am.

But I seriously want to kill myself, and have been wanting to for 4 years. I've recently gotten myself into a relationship, and it's the only thing holding me back-- my boyfriend might be sad, but again, it's a "might" and not a definite will.

Every relationship I've had, whether it be familial, platonic, and/or romantic have ended awfully. Some conflicts have not been my fault, but still. I've come to realise I am the 1 common denominator in and between each of these conflicts. 

Everyone has conflict, and trauma, and something they can't quite move past-- I get that. But I feel heavy with guilt, and carry the burden of my family's hurt with me. I might be too sensitive.

The equation I have worked out is as follows: 
Said relationship - me = stability. 

This is something I've thought about in depth. I want to make 2019 my last year, and I want it to be a great year.

I think this is my final call for help. I want to feel better. I would like to move past this, and I feel I can't.

Many thanks in advance.
