Hi all, I really don't know what to do. Would appreciate a helping hand in working out what to doHi everyone. I'm 18 and was a full time trader. I spent around 6 weeks working really hard at what I did and managed to make 4x my initial investment. Well, I was usually really good at managing my losses, but today I lost 95% of my account (Â£30,000), and that is all of my money pretty much. I dropped out of college to do this as I was really dedicated to making this work. I have very few friends and no partner (I have aspergers so I have a very hard time socialising and such). I genuinely feel like ending everything as now I have almost no money to trade again and this experience has mentally scarred me away from ever considering trading again. I have no qualifications that would enable me to get a job I would enjoy, and really struggling mentally anyway, I was never that happy even when I had a lot more money as my lack of social happiness overrode the highs I got from making lots of money in a short space of time. I genuinely see no way forward anymore and would just like to open up because I have no one to talk to. Thank you. :)
