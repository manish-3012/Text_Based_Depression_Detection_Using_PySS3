Suicide Survivor, Becoming Aware of triggers.. but they're very impacting. Seeking advice and just to ventHello, sorry if this isn't the right place to post this. Please let me know and maybe advise me of the correct sub reddit if I'mcwrong. 
I had an attempt in December. My whole life I've struggled with an array of mental problems and I used to go to the bathroom, turn off the lights, run the shower real hot and just sit in the steam to bring myself down. In December I used that shower as my way of swallowing my pills to try to take my life. Now I am safe.. somewhat. I have not really found a bounce back but since then I haven't actively wanted to try. Well.. kind of. 
I've still had a lot of mental problems and medication adjustments but unfortunately the diagnosis I have can't really be medicated to help me be stable, only therapy and anxiety pills. So I find myself still sitting in dark bathrooms crying in steam. Recently my shower moments have been getting more frequent and I've noticed I have begun to self harm and want to self harm but only when I'm in the bathroom. I have moved out of the house I attempted in (it was an awful reminder) but I think showers as a whole are triggering. Since my attempt I haven't wanted to shower because I do feel kinda cruddy when I take them but when I'm already in a foul mood they are impossible to get through without an anxiety attack. I had one bad enough the other night that even hearing the sound of water falling pushed me into an attack.
So my question here I guess is does anyone else have specific triggers from past attempts they're willing to share? And how have you overcome them? I'm also speaking to a therapist and my loved ones about this topic but I wanted to have a conversation with people that have actually gone through or are going through similar experiences. 
Thank you. And be safe everyone.
