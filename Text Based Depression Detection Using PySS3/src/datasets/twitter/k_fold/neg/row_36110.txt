Why am I suicidal?Ok-we get that Iâ€™m depressed and all but why?
Why do I feel like ending myself,how come the minute you feel useless over depression you go straight to death when you KNOW there are other ways? Iâ€™m constantly telling myself to eat a couples pills or drown myself but I just ..... canâ€™t. Please comment down what I should do
