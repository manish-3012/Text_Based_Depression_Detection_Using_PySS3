Birthday Suicidal ThoughtsIts a bad time of year for me again. Every spring in April I get really depressed around my birthday. I first tried to kill myself just before my 16th birthday. I haven't attempted since then but my 20th birthday is just around the corner and I want to die again. I have some ideas of how to go about it. Not sure if I will yet but its on my mind. A lot.
