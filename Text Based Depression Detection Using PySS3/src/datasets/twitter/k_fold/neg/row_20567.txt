suicide is the only way outI was forced to do inappropriate things by a girl that was a few years older then me and then it happened again with a different girl 

I feel disgusted by myself everytime it comes into my mind, I've self harmed ever since. the self harm has been going on for 4 years and I just hate my body even more I hate every part of myself. they both took away a part of me when I was only 6-8. I feel sick everytime I think about it. I hate it I hate it I hate it so much I hate them so much I hate myself so much I try to block it out but it doesn't work it just doesn't work anymore.

self harm just doesn't do it anymore I want to be gone.
