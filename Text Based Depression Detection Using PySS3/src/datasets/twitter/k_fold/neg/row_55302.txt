I'm at a dead endPun intended
For the past year I have done nearly nothing. I do odd jobs to support myself my rent was 500$ a month and I only spent 70$ a month on food and internet. I've been living at the bare minimum and I'm ok with that. But after intense thought for the past few months I've kinda realized that I want to die. I'm not sad or suicidal, but life to me is just kinda meh. Nothing in life really interests me and I really only have fun when playing games. I still hang out with friends but I derive no happiness from it. I feel like I would kill myself, but I don't want to make others around me feel sad. With that being understood I still don't really get the point of living a meaningless life where no matter how hard I try I can't seem to derive any sort of feeling from. I don't want to exist just for existence sake. And I kinda wanna die because at least it would be interesting
