You'll move on.You say you won't, that you would never forget me, that you would never recover. But I stand before you today, alive and breathing, and it's like I don't even exist. You'll forget me when I'm gone. You might even miss me a little, but you'll forget about it in time. The times we shared, the funny text messages we sent, every laugh, every tear, every time we made something for each other, or bought eachother little gifts. The late nights, the early mornings, they'll be forgotten in time. Nothing but a distant memory to you and those who shared it with you, your new life is in your face now oh, you have no time for nostalgia. So you'll move on, you'll forget I ever existed, you'll forget we were ever friends, except for the rare moments when you'll find something that reminds you of me, if I'm lucky. But that's okay, because I don't want you to hurt for very long because of my choices anyway.
