Closing the book on my lifeI have tried everything. No one knows what to say because really, what is there to say. All people can say is â€œit gets better,â€ or try and guilt trip me. I get it. Thereâ€™s only so much one can say and do in these situations. Itâ€™s not up to other people to help me. People donâ€™t understand how deep this goes. I guess I canâ€™t blame them. But I deserve to feel this way. Iâ€™m scared but I think Iâ€™ve made up my mind on what needs to be done. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to post anywhere anymore. Whatever happens to me, happens. 

At least I know I tried.
