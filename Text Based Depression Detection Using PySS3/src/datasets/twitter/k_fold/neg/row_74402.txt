Staring down the barrelIm having the hardest time of my life which is saying alot ive fought depression since puberty. But this is well beyond that I just had my 28th birthday all alone no calls no texts no communication at all. It gave me cause to think the last year of my life has been a hellish misadventure. I have always had issues with letting go of the past but combine this with a crippling drug addiction a recently diagnosed scizophrenic disorder. I have fought through some of the toughest thing a person could face. It's like a lifetime of hell dropping on me one giant fuckup at a time. I can't bear to show my face I can't bear the idea of living one more day. I haven't been sincerely suicidal in many years but all the sudden it's all I can think about. With all the mistakes ive made I can't imagine things getting better I just feel so worthless like a burden on society as a whole. I just want the weights on my soul to release me so maybe just maybe the cool touch of death will free me. There are so many hellish events all around me I don't blame the drugs they just enhanced the personal torment born of a life of soul crushing unending loss I can't take anymore of this. Even as a child I accepted the eventuality of death by my own hand but now I feel it one step behind me the cold touch of eternity. I don't know why I'm posting this I just can't keep it locked away anymore. I just know if I go through with it they will wonder why how do I explain all the years of hell that they can't begin to meet a chance to through it in there faces the pain they caused me.
