I have a dateI have a plan.. I have a week to get ready..

I am the worst human on the planet.. the world would be a better place without me.. I don't know how to explain myself.. or the situation I'm in.. I'm just a disgusting person.. I wish I died in the hospital.. I wish I killed myself so long ago.. I'm sorry I ever kept the burden of my existence on everyone I've ever met..

I'm sorry I am the way I am.. that its hard for me to show love.. that I'm not good enough.. I'm sorry I'm am such a waste of space.. I have never wanted to die this much.. I know everrything is my fault.. I know what a peice of shit I am.. I know I dont deserve anything I have.. 

I'm sorry to my family.. for possibly ruining this time of year.. I know you've probably seen it coming and have been preparing yourselves.. but I know your lives will be better without me..all of your lives will be better without me..
