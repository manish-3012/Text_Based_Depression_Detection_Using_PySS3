Statement That is Much OverdueDonâ€™t do it please. For the sake of family and peace. There are alternative medications for the disease. I have been there but fought through. We can do it together. Whether the resolution is rehabilitation, vacation, group meeting/therapy, diet/nutrition, or psycho analysis, solutions are out there. Sometimes we need to learn the hard way. Please be aware and strive to do better and succeed for the sake of yourself, community, family, and friends. God bless.
