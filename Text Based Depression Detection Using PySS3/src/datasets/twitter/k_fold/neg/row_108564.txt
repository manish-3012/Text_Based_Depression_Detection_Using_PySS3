Ive been isolated in my home for years. Almost all of my schooling from ages 1-18 has been in isolation. I think I want to die.Hello. Iâ€™ve been homeschooled my entire life more or less due to a combination of a very sheltering mom and an illness I was born with. Because I was homeschooled and later online schooled for all my high school years, I developed no relationships outside of my family. Iâ€™ve never had a real girlfriend or boyfriend. Iâ€™ve never had a friend I met on my own that I knew for longer than a week. I was lower class early years, but now Iâ€™m middle class. I have so many materialistic things but they start to lose their value. I want human connection. I want to know what it feels like to have friends that you can hang out with. I want to know what it feels like to have a girlfriend to, just be with. I have wanted this for years. I think about it every now and then. Iâ€™ve met thousands, likely tens of thousands of people online, but it means nothing to me now. Iâ€™ve learned so much from them, but gotten no experience and no feelings from it. 

In january of 2020 i got my drivers license. I was beginning to be independent. I was excited about starting college in the fall and meeting people to build real life relationships. Covid destroyed that vision. That same vision I had when i tried going to public high school only to get severely sick within a week. I now take fully online classes in my first semester. I havent been around other people except for my quarantined family for 5 months. I now do exactly what I did in highschool, except my depression is worse because Iâ€™m older and still facing the fact that I have never had a friend in real life, at least not around a decade. This is the closest ive gotten to thinking about killing myself. Tonight. I just feel like i cant take it anymore. Every time people hear my story, not within a depressing context, they just tell me the same thing. They feel bad for me and they say ill find someone one day. My entire existence has told me otherwise. I dont know how to kill mysef or if im even strong enough to. I dont know what to do.
