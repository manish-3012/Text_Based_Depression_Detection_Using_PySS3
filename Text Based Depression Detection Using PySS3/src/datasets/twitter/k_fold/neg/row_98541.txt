Failing Highschool, want to kill myselfI've been an honour student since I was in grade 7, I'm currently in grade 11. 
I've been to over 8 schools and moved over 9 times. I never stay in a house for more than 3 years, as soon as 2 years pass my family moves to a new location. It's hard to make friends, why make them when I'm gonna move again. My mom literally came into my room one day and said we're moving. My dad left when I was in kindergarten, never seen him since, hes running from the cops.

Last year was my failure year, first semester I got honours like always. Second semester is when it all went down hill.
I transfered to a completely new district. My mother transfered me into the school a week before it started. I had to sign up for classes I didn't want to be in since the classes I wanted were full. The highschool I was supposed to go to had me signed up for AP-1 classes, which were the art kids who were very smart. This school had me in Math 10-3 which were the slower kids, I completely died in that class. My schopl is filled with fithy rich drugged out white kids. Me coming from an Asian family, completely hated it, I didn't fit in. 

That whole year I had made no friends. Second semester for Science 10-2, I had this new Caucasian teacher who completely hated my guts. My mother decided it would be a great idea to go on vacation a week before we had our summer break, because of it I had to hand in around 9 assignments in one week. I was panicking. I did it all thankfully but it really killed me. The whole 1 week vacation I was in panic. The science teacher gave me no notes to study on, I had no friends in that class who would help me and I was surrounded by classmates who a copied off 1 person. The teacher would make jokes like mimicking Donald Trump and saying racist things. She made a joke and said "See, all the white kids are laughing" and looked directly at me. She'd always forget I'm in class and would mark me absent, she'd never give me the assignments so literally everyday I would have to go up to her desk and ask for it. EVERY DAY. She'd give out tons of home work and I'd fail all of it, when I asked for help they would always be half ass answers. She'd always talk about her boyfriend and forget how to do something we're learning so students would always correct her. She failed me. I got a 43 and needed a 50 to pass. 

(Longer story)-this year:skip;;; They put me in Science 20-2, my grades went from being a 43 last year to being in the 90 marks. This teacher was amazing. Suddenly they kicked me out of this class, put me in learning support, I'm a good student, I had no homework, I sat in that class doing nothing. Counsiler does not like me at all. This school offers no support.

 I think I had about 18 credits last year. Very low, I asked for online courses, summer school, extra credits but the counsiler, like I said, hates me and said no to everything. My mom wants me to take more Science classes, so I will have 3 cores next semester, Sci-10 Eng-2 Social-2. Next year Sci-20 and Sci-30. I don't need science 30 to graduate but shes forcing me. first semester is almost over... I had a huge mental breakdown last year, I don't cry in front of people but I started crying in my room and my mom came running, you'd think shes there to help right? No. She yelled at me, screamed, threw things at me, said things like " Why the fuck are you crying? HUH??!! Answer me, look at me, what the fuck is your problem!" She threw a phone charger at me. I have younger sibling 13 &amp; 11. They steal, swear, lie ALL the time. Theres sooo much more drama to tell you all. 
I've been depressed for so long, so many years have gone by without killing myself. I can't do these fake smiles anymore

Theres absolutely no way I'll get enough credits to graduate, I want to drop out and just end it all. I don't care anymore, it's almost 3AM right now, I can't sleep, all I can think about is killing myself. I'm ready to die.
