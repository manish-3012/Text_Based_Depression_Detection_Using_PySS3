i watched the tv show that i watched when i overdosed and waited to diethis may come across as really disjointed, and im not sure if this is the correct subreddit either

about 4 years ago i overdosed on painkillers and hoped to die. i lay in bed and put on hannibal while i hoped i would drift away. after a trip to the ER and a glorious stomach pump i learned that me dying in my sleep would not have been the case. 

i've never been able to watch hannibal since then because of the association. i haven't felt suicidal in quite some time, nor have i harmed myself, so i thought i'd be able to handle it 

but i was so so wrong. i binge watched because i seriously enjoyed the show. it was all good and well, until i came to bed now, and all the feelings that i was afraid of have just flooded back. i feel so embarrassed and stupid. i haven't felt the feeling of wanting to hurt myself or just die in so long. i can't believe i'm still this weak

i have no idea what i'm seeking from posting this, i just don't want to talk to anyone i know about it
