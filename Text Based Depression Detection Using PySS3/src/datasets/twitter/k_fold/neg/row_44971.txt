THIS IS IT. I HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I NEEDED TOI did everything that I am supposed to do to get better with depression. I have a 40 hour a week job, I had sex, I have tried meditation. I went to my local Buddhist center for their meetings for a bit. I have gone to therapy for 3 years now. Just last month, my art got popular enough that I have 1000 followers. I can't do much else with the virus but anything I was *allowed* to do safely, I did do. 

And I still hate it. I feel like I have no control. I feel tired and sick. No matter how many times my friends tell me that they like me, or appreciate me, I can't digest it properly for some reason.

I am one of the most privlaged and well off individuals ever simply because I was born in modern times due in a first world country and I still am unable to do it.

I can't even talk to my friends about suicide anymore. I know how it'll go each time. I know that they'll give the same lines over and over until they get sad themselves, or they'll just threaten to throw me into a mental prison. I hate this. No one even feels real.

What am I missing? Is there anything else I should try. I have done EVERYTHING I was told to do. And I still can't do tjid
