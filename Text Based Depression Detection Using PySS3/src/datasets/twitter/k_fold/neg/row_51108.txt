How do I stop constantly thinking about suicide?From when I wake up to my dreams.. when anything happens, itâ€™ll always be on my mind but itâ€™s weighing me down so much. I feel guilt at times for even considering it. I donâ€™t want to do it yet , I just want a break from these feelings. Maybe dying would be the only thing to stop feeling like shit all the time
