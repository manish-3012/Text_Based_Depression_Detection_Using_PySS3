Alcohol and drowningI think I have the perfect way to commit suicide. Every other method I researched is messy and/or too expensive to carry out, most of them being really hard to access the things I need. With this, I buy two pairs of handcuffs, a mask to cover my face, drink enough alcohol to where I start to get incredibly drunk, eventually blackout, and go into some body of water where nobody can find me and slowly drown to death as I sink to the bottom. The best part is, since I will be blacked out from the alcohol, I won't experience the worrying sensation of drowning. It will just be the end of my existence as I know it.
