I'm back on the edge again. Reasons I should kill myself:-I'm not attractive and probably never will be.

-My voice and laugh are horrible sounding and I can't change it.

-I can't change that I'm attracted to my own gender.

-My chances of finding love are next to nothing.

-Parents don't accept me.

-I'm sick of watching my dad treat my mom like garbage.

-Best friend doesn't accept me.

-I'm a burden on the few friends I do have left.

-Parents are not letting me take antidepressants. They are legally allowed to do that.

-Therapy hasn't helped so far.

-By the time I turn 18 I'll be to screwed up to fix.

-I can't keep straight A's anymore, barely holding on to B's now.

-I'm a broken person.

-I have no phone or privacy still, it's been almost 2 months since my suicide attempt.

-The lack of privacy and isolation from everyone is making it so much worse.

-I know I'll get over her in time but it hurts so much right now.

-School starts in 3 weeks, also when the anxiety will be back.

-I've completely lost faith in God and don't believe anymore.

-I don't have enough shitty coping skills for the crushing hopelessness and random waves of guilt.

I wish somebody would talk to me. The only thing in the world I want right now is anyone in my life to tell me they love me. I just need to hear it. I am so sick of holding on and I've had enough.
