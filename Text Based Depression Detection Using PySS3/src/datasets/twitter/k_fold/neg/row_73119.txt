UselessnessI don't know how to start something like this. However, considering this sub is called Suicide Watch, I guess I will just jump right in and say I am definitely thinking about it.
I feel very lost. I'm doing very poorly in my classes, I've switched my major at least three times, I still don't know what I want to do with my life and I am in my third year of college. I also hate my job with everything that I am. I've been gaining weight and hate to look at myself in the mirror. 
Basically, I have lost my drive in life. I'm stuck and don't know where to turn. There is so much pressure on me to succeed and I can't deal with the reality of failing. My parents say they will support me even if I choose to drop out of college and just work, but I can't help feeling that they would be disappointed in me. After everything that my brothers have put my parents through, I don't want them to feel like they failed at parenting all three of their children. 
I just want to escape, but there are a few things currently holding me back: A new kitten, the fact that I made my younger brother promise never to commit suicide and I don't want to look like a hypocrite, and I can't imagine the pain that I would cause my family.

I just don't know what the next step is...
