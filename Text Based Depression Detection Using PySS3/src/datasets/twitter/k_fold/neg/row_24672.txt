i cant do it againi cant do it again. i said id keep going to protect my future self and all past selves that have led me here, but i cant take another heartbreak.

all i do is support you. im doing my best. i thought you saw that. i dont understand why you cant even support my emotions when i support you moving across the world because thats what would make you happy. did you forget i did that.

i dont understand. maybe i never will. it doesnt really matter, i guess i always knew it'd turn out this way. thank you for showing me what it was like to be happy for a little bit. at least i finally got that, even though it'll end the same as i thought it would before i met you.

i want to rest. just like the other people here. i wish we could meet each other so we could maybe not feel so alone. im sorry im not there for you all enough either. im so tired.

i want to stop feeling this way. it would've been better if i never existed at all. my conscious gift of life is wasted on me. im sorry. i really do try, or or i think i do.

im so tired. I've always been tired. i dont think i was ever supposed to wake up into this life.
