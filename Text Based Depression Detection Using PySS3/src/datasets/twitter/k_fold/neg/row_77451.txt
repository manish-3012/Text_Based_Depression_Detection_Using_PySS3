The person I care about most is stuck in a fissure. She can either climb up or let the floor break beneath her and plunge her in oblivion.I...I'm so scared. I've never been this scared. My friend is losing hope and quickly. Her stress has brought back her multiple personality disorder and in full force. One of her personalities "does what is in her best interest" and told me today that she will kill my friend if it gets to that point, even if there is a shred of fight in her. She's given up hope in her anti depressants and won't take them. 

I'm going to talk to her tonight about councillors and meds. Tomorrow I'm going to the hospital to get advice from their staff. Other than that, I feel so helpless. I don't know what I'll do if I lose her.
