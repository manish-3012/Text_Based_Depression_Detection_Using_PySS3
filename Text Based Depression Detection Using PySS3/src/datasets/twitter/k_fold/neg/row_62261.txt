hey, just wanna tell you about my life.My dad killed himself about 2 years ago, this left me absolutely devastated. I couldn't talk to anyone because I didn't want to bring anyone down. When your friends are happy it's hard to answer anything but "I'm Fine" to the question "Are you okay". But there was one person who made everything better, she wouldn't take "I'm fine" for an answer, she would text me whenever I looked sad asking if I wanted to talk, she would take me outside and give me a hug and tell me it is all going to be okay.

Then I got my grades for my A-level, I was predicted A's and B's, I got D's. The uni I wanted to got to obviously didn't accept me. I was so distraught that I tried to kill myself, I threw up the pills at the last minute. I then confided with with my friend whom then consoled me as she would often do. 

Then all my friends left for their respective uni's, and I was stuck at home, all alone. whenever I got sad I would text or call her, sometimes she would drunk dial me. It made me so happy, I then realised that I had feelings for her. And I would make them known to her when she came back for Christmas, so I did. It turns out that she and one of my other best friends were going out. I still kept in touch with her once she got back to uni, text her every so often. But, then I said some thing I didn't mean, and pretty much alienated her and and her boyfriend. Now there is no-one I can talk to when I'm down and every time I think about them together I want to jump in front of a train.
