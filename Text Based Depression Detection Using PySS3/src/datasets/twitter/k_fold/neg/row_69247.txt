Question for you: Where do you see yourself in 5 years?The answer has always been  'I don't know' for me, 'nothing'. I think ahead and just see a void. And that's on a good day. But it got me thinking about what other people's answers might be, to see if they're similar.

If you happen to read this, please take a moment to think about this question, and answer it here. It doesn't matter what mood your is. It could be how you feel right now, how you feel when you're not feeling down, or both.

It might even help a few people here. We're all in this together. You are not alone in how you feel, as you can see from everyone here.
