Cant even bring myself to reach out hereI can't convince myself to ask for help here and share my problems. 2016 was the worst year of my life and it was all my fault. I deserve what I've received and I'm afraid to tell my horrible story as I'm worried I'll just be put down more and hated for my actions.
