Back againPosted on here a few weeks back about wanting it all to end. Those feelings have resurfaced again this week. I don't do anything but go to work, spend the days shut in. At work it feels like I'm running in a hamster wheel, constantly trying to get up ahead of the curve,  failing and falling backwards. 
What's it all for? This stress and pain? I don't enjoy my life, I don't enjoy what I do. There's literally no reason for me not to die outside of the family/friends will miss you and even that is a selfish crock of shit. "Oh you're suffering and want to end this experience you never volunteered for? Don't do it, we'll all feel bad."
