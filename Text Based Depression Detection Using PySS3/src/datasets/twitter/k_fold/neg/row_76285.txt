I lost the only thing that has kept me from killing myself since 2016I am a graphic designer or was one before everything went to shit last night
I've wanted to kill myself for a long tome but my passion for art and design distracted me for years
When I felt down I'd turn to my laptop and design away and get paid
Now the only thing that I truly loved is gone
I could easily raise the money from this 9-5 store job but getting to that amount before the second lockdown happens isn't possible and people that claimed to support my career have ghosted me

I have nothing to lose anymore and I think I'm ready to die. I need a painless way to kill myself
