Being trans sucksI'm 15 years old, suicidally depressed, lonely, and trans. I feel like some abomination to the planet even though I'm not the religious kind that thinks those kind of things. I have an appointment to see about getting HRT on the 8th of August, I am very happy about all this, but it feels like this is getting all too real, and it makes me want to snap and end it. I have almost no friends despite being nice to everyone, and I'm so lonely all the time. I can't help but think it's the fact that I'm so unattractive that no one likes me, the same reason for the fact that I've never had a girlfriend/boyfriend. But I think that's due to me being asexual and trans. I feel like I'm going to die alone because I'm asexual and trans as well, nobody will ever love me the way I am, and maybe that's why I have no friends either. I just wish I could stop feeling like such a burden to everybody, I feel like if I removed myself from everybodies lives, then their lives would be measurably better. Because I'm so annoying and weird to everybody somehow, and I can't even figure out why.
