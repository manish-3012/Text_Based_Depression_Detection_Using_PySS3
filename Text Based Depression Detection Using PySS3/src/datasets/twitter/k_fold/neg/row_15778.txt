iâ€™m ready to goi have a note. i donâ€™t have the strength to keep going. i have my gun. but i still have my sympathy. i donâ€™t wanna hurt my immediate family. so leave the note. drive as far as i can and let someone find my random car w. me in the trunk w. a self inflicted gun shot. the narcissist in me wonâ€™t let me do it thou.
