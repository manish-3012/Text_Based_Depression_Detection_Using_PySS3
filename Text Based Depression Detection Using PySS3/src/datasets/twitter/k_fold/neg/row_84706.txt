SundaysOn Sundays I have the desire to die.  The first two suicide attempts were on Sundays.  Tired of teetering with death.  Wish I had the balls to successfully go through it.  Least the people who successfully committed suicide ended their suffering.  Hell I tried sleeping pills and prescription meds.  All I had was just a long dream less sleep.  I tried taking eight energy pills and all that happened was my heart was beating fast for like ten hours.  I tried to die and still want to die. I know how life is and I don't have a zest for it. Still staying alive is just  prolonging.  Well goodnight and may I find the courage to one day end my life.  Or may I find the peace to continue life.  Idk just tired of being human. Tired of hearing the crime on the news,  people dying that wish to live tired of feeling in despair,  tired of dealing with realism,  tired of this whole moral thing in life,  tired of going to work.  Tired of seeing the world suffer.
