I really want to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to disappoint family members.Life sucks. I wanna end it. I always think itâ€™s going to get better but Iâ€™ve been saying that for years now. Iâ€™m a lost cause at this point. 
I hate the fact that my brain plays tricks on me. Sometimes I feel fine with life and sometimes I feel like total shit. I canâ€™t take it anymore and I canâ€™t take my brain playing these tricks on me.
