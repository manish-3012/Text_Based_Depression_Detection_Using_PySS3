Very close to doing it. I'm not sure why I haven't yet.It hurts. It hurts really bad. She's gone. She doesn't love me like that anymore and she's gone. None of the usual things help. Not music. Not videos. Not hot water. Not self-harm. Nothing makes it stop. I look around my room and see all the little gifts she gave me, but it's all lies anyway.

I want to kill myself for the same reason an animal in a trap wants to gnaw its own leg off. I can't take the pain anymore. I want it to be over.  
The pills are right there in front of me. Why haven't I taken them yet?
