I'm thinking about calling it quits for the new year. I've felt unwanted and depressed for years.That's all I want anymore. To spend some time, even if it's a little, with family or friends. Because I've been lonely for a very long time, now. Going on 20 years. And I keep trying to tell myself it'll get better. I keep trying to tell myself that I shouldn't live for other people, because fuck other people anyway. All they've ever done is treat me like garbage, abuse me, or ridicule me. That's all anyone's ever done. So why do I even want companionship? Most of the time, it just makes me feel worse because I just always end up becoming the third wheel or the last resort. It's easy to talk about plans, but once it comes time to enact them, they flake out on me.

And yet here I am..I've been depressed since November..Thinking about suicide on and off. The only friends I have are online but I no longer talk to them, because all they do is belittle my feelings.. Tell me how their *other* friend has it worse, and tell me to talk to *them* because in their minds, that's some kind of therapy. Because they somehow think, "Oh if he talks to this person who has it worse, then they won't feel bad anymore". I'm not going to compete with others for affection. And it's fucking disgusting, anyway. All it does is make me feel like my feelings are irrelevant and worthless. And with how much I hate myself, I feel like that anyway..So the idea that they think their bullshit is some form of therapy for me..I think I just hate them, now.

Self-love is nothing but contrived bullshit anyway. How are you supposed to love yourself if people around you have given you every reason not to. Whether it's beating you up, cheating on you, ignoring your pleas, bullying you, calling you the weird retarded quiet kid, etc..

It's all become a predictable pattern now. I know what to expect from people. Because it's the same thing I've experienced since my teen years. Neglect. Abuse. Loneliness.
