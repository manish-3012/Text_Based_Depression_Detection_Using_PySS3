I'm a huge disappointment to myself.I might fail chemistry. If I fail , I lose financial aid for community college.


I don't know what I'll do if I do fail chemistry.

I was never supposed to be in this position. 

I was supposed to be in the military by now. But I'm terrible at sticking to my diet and exercising regularly.

Before that I was supposed to be in university . I should be in my third year university working on an internship. Instead I'm at community college because I had to withdraw and take a break from college for a year due to depression.

I'm considering switching my major from mechanical engineering to something else because my mind is just not in the right place to be a successful engineering student ( depression distracts me).

Which sucks because I really would have liked to be rich and young. That was my expectation of myself. I also wanted to convince myself that I'm smart enough to be an engineer.

If I fail this chemistry test, I'm right back at square one. Trying to lose weight to enlist while fending of my emotional demons.

I feel like I'd be a hell a lot more successful as a student if I was in a position where I was happy with myself.

I used to think a girl could make feel that way, but no.

I was hoping modding a car would be something that gets me through. But I barely have any money for something fast and worth modding.


Nothing makes me happy. 

I really wanted to take a break after highschool to get to a point where I'm happy with myself but my parents pushed for me to go anyways , and here I am.

I feel like I have no options, and things will only push me further and further away from being to where I want to be in life thanks to me not taking care of things I should've taken care of when I was younger.

I'm not feeling suicidal, but the idea of suicide seems so freeing from this situation I've gotten myself into now.
