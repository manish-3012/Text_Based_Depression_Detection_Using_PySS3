its your choice.Are you even worth anything? What value do you have to your peers? All you do is make them feel sorry for you. When your parents see your pitiful expression everyday, they canâ€™t help but cry. They donâ€™t know how to fix you. They even took you out of school in attempt to do so, but even that didnâ€™t work. It just made you a bigger burden. They always have to keep an eye on you now to make sure you arenâ€™t hurting yourself, despite everything they have done. You know you canâ€™t be fixed, so why do you still keep tormenting them everyday? You practically force your friends to hang out with you. They donâ€™t actually like you, they pity you. Are they really even you friends? No matter what you do you can never make them happy. They might be reading this right now, crying, because they think that they havenâ€™t been good enough for you. That no matter what they do you always end up being sad and doubting them. Or maybe theyâ€™re angry. Maybe they think youâ€™re doing this all for attention and that youâ€™re faking all of this. That the reason youâ€™re not in school is because youâ€™re lazy and retarded and incapable of working. Why do you even try anymore? They donâ€™t deserve this. Nobody does. Thatâ€™s why they always leave, and I donâ€™t blame them. After all, all you do is burden them. So I will ask again, do you want to live, or do you want to die?
