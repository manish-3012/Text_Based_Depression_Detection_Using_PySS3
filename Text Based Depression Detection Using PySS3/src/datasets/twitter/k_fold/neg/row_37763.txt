What's the point of continue living anymore?I'm just done with life, i'm seriously done. I have a gun with a bullet loaded right now and i'm ready to end my pointless life.

I'm a 25 year old gay man...What's the fucking point of my existence? I'm literally a mistake, every guy is straight except me, this is enough proof that i shoudln't exist.  
I'm a gay bear and i get crushes on other bear guys, but i'm sure they're straight, so i literally can't be happy, so why bother living?

I'm just tired of this world, a world that doesn't like me, thankfully all of this will be over when i press the trigger of my gun after a few minutes of making this post.
