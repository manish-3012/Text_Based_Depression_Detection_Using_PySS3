I keep saying that I want to kill myself but I know I'm not going to actually do itI've been really feeling crappy about my life in general. I just don't know how to climb out of the hole I'm in. I'm seeing a therapist about my ADHD and depression but I'm really scared to tell him about these thoughts because I feel like I'm going to get myself involuntarily committed. I know I'm not going to kill myself but the sentiment and ill feelings are real.

I'm trying to take life one day at a time but it's really hard to see beyond what's in front of me right now.
