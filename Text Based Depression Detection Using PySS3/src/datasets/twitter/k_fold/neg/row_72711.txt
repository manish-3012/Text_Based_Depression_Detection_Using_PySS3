Losing all my friendsIdk if this belongs here. Maybe some of you have been in a similar situation and have advice?

My friends complained about another friend that seems to not put as much effort into the friendship so they just ended it.
I think I might be next because I'm sorta distant as well (have always been that way but have distanced myself further over the past year) and I'm kinda the odd one out. 
We were two people and all was fine. Two years ago we made another friend. My first friend seems to be only able to concentrate on one person at a time (our new friend is rather extroverted) and both of them meet up regularly.
It didn't bother me because we were still doing fine but I don't talk to them anymore and they weren't even aware of that and that kinda hurts tbh. I talked to them but it's still the same so I don't even bother anymore. I just don't know what to do.

Tl;dr: I feel left out but I know that it's my fault. It's hard to accept the fact that - even though I talked to them - nothing has changed. I just feel really insignificant.
