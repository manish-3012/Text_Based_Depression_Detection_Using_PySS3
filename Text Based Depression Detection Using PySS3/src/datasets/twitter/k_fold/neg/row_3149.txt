Since I was 9 years oldI've always been having suicidal thoughts and for the past 9 years the only thing stopping me was that's impossible to get a gun in England and I want my last moments to be painless. My life's always hurt and just keeps getting worse and worse and I can't bear it anymore. I spend my free time while I'm not at college researching on suicide methods that I'll be able to do without arousing suspicion beforehand and I'm stuck.
