The carnal hatred of men who have needsIt's why most of this subreddit is men. Society hates needy men. I'm a very needy man and as a result I eat children's food so it's better for me to just kill myself. It's why men are called cowards and creeps etc. It's because of a deep carnal hatred of men who have needs. It results in an isolation where men are discarded and pushed aside. This why they kick a man when he's down. It doesn't matter how much abundance there is in society. This will always be the case because it's at an instinctual level.
