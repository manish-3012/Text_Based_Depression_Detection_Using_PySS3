I won't be around to watch the ball drop into 2018I just feel like I have been through enough pain, enough lies, enough betrayal, enough heartbreaks to finally just say fuck it.

I had an accident when I was little that caused me to wear prosthetics for life. Years, going in and out of hospitals because of it, limited to certain things I can't do. I can't run, I can't go in the water, I haven't been at the beach in years, I can't do half if not three quarters of the things that  I want to do.
My dream to join the army was crushed because of having a prosthetic. Every time I gave out my heart it was stabbed and abused. Had surgeries where I lost count on how many I had to get on my leg. Last one needed more Skin, so part of it was taken from my left side which one looks like a Shark took a bite out of me. My friends don't hang out with me anymore, all of my exes left me after I gave everything to them. I am just tired of it all.

P.S. This is a throwaway account ofcourse.
