I'm too scared to live.I believe my death will be a tragedy to my close friends, my girlfriend, my family. 

Unfortunately, I am an opiate addict. Let me fix that -- an unemployed opiate addict. I mean, I'm not a complete moron nor do I consider myself lazy. Crazy perhaps, but not lazy. I moved couches two weeks ago for $35 per day. Some people considered me a genius -- "Honey, your rate is $50/hr and you're 17?" I flew through my youth on wings of a prodigy-level software engineering career. Pissing hundreds of dollars on acid and weed. Taking cabs. Giving giant tips.

Now it's all over.

I'm broke. My last job fired me in May for failing a piss test -- my fucking piss didn't match up their ridiculous expectation of what piss should be like.

The bottom line is my last hit -- a small shot of black tar heroin I did this morning wore off. I'm out of drugs, I'm out of alcohol, I'm out of money. I'm looking at a painful, restless heroin detox until I can score or sit through it. I don't know. 

I feel like I'm somewhere no normal human should be -- a place too scary and dark. An inhumane place. A living nightmare of severe opiate withdrawal combined with stress of unemployment, stress of being 21 and nearly homeless. I was homeless and right now I'm crashing from a place to place. At least I'll be warm. That's comforting.

I'm too scared to go on and even though I'm sure some people might be sad when I die I still fantasize about doing it. Bleeding to death. Injecting grams and grams of drugs until I can no longer breath. Flying from a bridge like a kamikaze drug-crazed suicidal fucking pigeon.

I know suicide hurts others but nothing would give me more pleasure than a fucking nuclear bomb attack straight into my strung out body. 

I don't even want any fucking heroin. I just want the nightmare to go away.

I'm sorry.
