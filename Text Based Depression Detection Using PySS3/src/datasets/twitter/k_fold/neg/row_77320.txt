Suicide..what's it like?Has anyone here actually survived a suicide attempt?
What was it like?

I ask because..I'm kinda flip-flopping on it right now.
I don't wanna die,but I just think we're all just too fucked to get any kind of positive ending.

Maybe the "express lane" is the best way out.
The express lane being suicide in this case.
