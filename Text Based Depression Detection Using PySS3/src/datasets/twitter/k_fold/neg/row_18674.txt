I canâ€™t close my eyes for very longIâ€™ve been awake for the last 3 or so hours. My partner got home around 2 and woke me up. I havenâ€™t been able to close my eyes for more than 5 minutes or so (not sure if thatâ€™s accurate, Iâ€™m very tired) without very graphic ideation and overwhelming physical intent. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but I very much want to kill myself. Iâ€™m just reaching out to feel a little less lonely right now.
