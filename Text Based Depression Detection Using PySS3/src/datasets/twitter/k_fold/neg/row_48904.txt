Losing hopeI met a guy (33M) on an online dating site six months ago.  We went on dates and were in constant contact. We were planning a life together. I called him out on still being still on the dating site and wanting more commitment and he started lessening contact with me. I feel terrible as everything I look at reminds me of him. The car, phone, clothes, places we been, our business ideas, anything I made him, whenever I wake up I look for the morning messages. This is my first heartbreak. Is there any way I can get through this as I am losing hope?
