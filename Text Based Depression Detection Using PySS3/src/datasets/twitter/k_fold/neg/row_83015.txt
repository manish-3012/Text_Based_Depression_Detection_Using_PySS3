I think I'm going to stop eating...I've been feeling more and more bad today about myself. Even after wasting my entire thanksgiving break being sad and depressed, I just realized I gained weight too. Everything is just making my head swim with anxiety.

I think I'm going to stop eating starting from today. I'd like to think that I'm doing this to lose weight, but it's mostly because I hate myself too, and I think it will be an apt punishment for myself.
