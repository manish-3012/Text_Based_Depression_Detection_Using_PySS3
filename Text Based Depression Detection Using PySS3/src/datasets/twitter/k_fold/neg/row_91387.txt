I'm sorryI'm sorry Stephanie. I really am. I don't want to break you like this, but I just have nothing to live for. I just don't want life, I don't want everything that life entails, the bullying, the harrassment. I have no friends, and no matter what I do I can't get them. You know that, but you just don't understand. I'm sorry Jerry, for not being honest with you about how I feel, and not getting help. I'm sorry Michael, you were the best fucking faggot I could've ever loved, and the best part of my life. I'm sorry Shelley, for making you upset at me and pushing you away. I'm sorry Reddit, for wasting your time housing my note. I'm going to browse here for a bit in my final moments, as this is the only place I'm accepted (and I still have no friends on here...). I'm so, so sorry for taking the pussy way out. I know that you had plans for me Jerry, and I'm sorry for fucking that up. I'll let you try again with my siblings, not fuck up with me more. I'm sorry for the pain I'm going to cause you, and I know it's fucking selfish, but I just can't take life. I only ask for one thing: please play Hallelujah by Jeff Buckley at my funeral. On my sound system.  That's the last song I listen to before I die, and i think it's fitting. I love you all, and that's why I'm leaving you. I don't want you to deal with me.
