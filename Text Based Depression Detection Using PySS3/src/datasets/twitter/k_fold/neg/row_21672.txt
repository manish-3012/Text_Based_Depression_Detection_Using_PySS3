Having a hard time getting over a breakup. Desperately need advice.We were together for about 3 years. And now we have been apart for more than that.
I think about her often, a few times a day every day. If there's a lot going on  and I'm generally stressed about life and not thinking about her during the day, often times I will still dream about her.

I know thats kinda normal immediately after a breakup, I don't know what "normal" is, a few weeks? Maybe a couple months of being sad about it if it was a long term relationship?

It's been over 3 years since I've talked to her. I completely removed any reminders of her from my life. No social media, no mutual friends I talk to anymore, I have moved to a new town since then, I've dropped out of school, I have even deleted all the music that I listened to during that time of my life. There is literally nothing. Nothing that should even faintly remind me of them. Yet I cannot get them out of my head.

What's wrong with my brain.

I'm going to delete this soon because I was too lazy to make a throwaway
