Is it really wrong to take my life?Reddit is it really wrong for me to commit suicide?

I feel guilty, yes. I regret my parents having me, it was lucky for me survive anyway at 4 lbs 3 oz at birth in 89. If my Mother didn't have 2 miscarriages and 1 still born before me I would never have been born anyway. I regret that everyday. Every time I wake up, I'm ashamed. Everytime I have fun, I'm ashamed. I'm also obviously fucked up, but my friends and family don't know, at most they think I'm eccentric.

I want to make it an accident, no one will have to clean up. I don't think that's wrong.
