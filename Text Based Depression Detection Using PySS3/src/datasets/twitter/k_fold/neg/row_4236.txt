I'm just waiting to die.I haven't accomplished much, I'm jobless, I'm married to an abusive man. I want to end the agony I go through every day. I don't see any other way out. My husband has called me stupid, moocher, useless so many times I wholeheartedly believe it. I feel like no one cares. I'm human garbage. I'm a burden to everyone around me. Yesterday I hung myself but didn't finish because I was too scared, I  just need the courage to finish.
