Can't take it anymore.So, here I am again. I've posted here before and have still the same problems. I hate my life, myself and the way I am. Idgaf about school anymore and go maybe like 3 times per week cause I have no energy and motivation to get up. I just want to sleep, dream something nice and everyday I wish my life was going to end soon. 
I only have like 2 people that I really care about, one friend that I already told about my depression and is probably the best friend I've ever had, and a girl that i love and want to be friend with at the same time. I dont know if she knows but that doesnt matter. She hugs me a lot and that's the only nice thing in my life. These 2 are the only people I care about. But at the same time I wish I'd have never met them. Killing myself would be so easy if nobody knows me. But there's also my family and other friends. Would it be fair to run away from my pain, but maybe destroy their life? Is it selfish, fair, unfair? I dont know anymore, I'm confused and I just want my pain to stop. I suffer everyday and my only wish right now is that noone knows me so I could die in silence and nobody would miss me. Thats all i want, but it's impossible. And that fucking sucks.
