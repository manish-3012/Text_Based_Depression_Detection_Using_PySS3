it sounds stupid but...the only reason why i've decided to stay is because a concert i was supposed to go to in april got cancelled due to the pandemic. i've listened to this artist from when i first felt depressed all the way to now. i feel like i NEED to see them at least once in my life in order to move onto the end of it.
