Hopeful and hopelessMy bpd makes me have very black and white thinking. I go from trying to get better and searching for new good methods of coping to actively trying to  find ways to kill myself.

I do want to get better but itâ€™s hard to see that ever happening when Iâ€™m bad. I have a lot of things keeping me going even if I canâ€™t believe it. Iâ€™m trying my best to help out on the mental health blog Iâ€™m apart of on tumblr, mental health advice. I would recommend going there for help if you need to talk to someone who has gone through what you have. The friends that I have met on this blog keep me going and I know that Iâ€™m doing good by helping people like me.

I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing, I just know writing makes me feel better. 

Iâ€™ve been trying to find things I can do to cope. Iâ€™m doing little things that may seem stupid but if it keeps me from ending it then thatâ€™s all that matters. Iâ€™m trying to make a self-care/mental health box type thing that has things I can use to distract myself when Iâ€™m bad. So far I just bought legos because I wanted to and I feel like that would help. I suggest you try this if you think it would help. Iâ€™m going to put some other things I can use as a distraction like puzzles and things like that. 

So far playing the new PokÃ©mon game has helped me a bit. Also going out with friends a bit, or should I say going out with friend. I was very bad before I left but it helped a lot to be distracted with someone who kinda understands and didnâ€™t make me talk about what was going wrong. Not that talking is bad, itâ€™s just the only thing I ever do. I just want to stop talking about it and physically do something to fight it.

I donâ€™t know why I made this but maybe it will help me or someone else. I am very hopeful and hopeless at the same time. 

I am done having to deal with mental illness. Well I know I canâ€™t shut it off but Iâ€™m going to try so much harder than before. Iâ€™m going to get rid of all of the pills that I donâ€™t need so I donâ€™t have them to abuse/overdose on. Iâ€™m going to keep being organized and try to organize ways I can stay better, like remembering medication. Being organized really helps my mental health so I feel like this will help.

Another reason Iâ€™m suicidal is because I feel like I donâ€™t have a future. I donâ€™t feel like I have access to education like I want and what I want to do is looked down upon anyways. But fuck that Iâ€™m gonna start classes again. Iâ€™m gonna write music. I think I want to do music therapy, so I am ready to start making myself better so I can finally live and see a future for myself. I know Iâ€™ll feel the opposite of this later. I constantly write all of these motivation type posts for me but then I feel like they are stupid and a lie when Iâ€™m bad. Iâ€™m gonna try to look back on the moments when Iâ€™m positive and try to think, â€œIâ€™m not always bad. This will go away. Even if this happens all of the time everyday, it will stop.â€

Iâ€™m ready to live.
