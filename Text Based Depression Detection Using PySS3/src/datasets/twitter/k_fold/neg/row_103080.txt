I fail at everything, even trying to kill myselfTwo nights ago my flashbacks were coming back and after a whole day of being paranoid over everything, shaking and experiencing flashbacks to the point where it was hurting me physically, I tried to cut vertically. I grabbed my razor and pressed down my wrist and cut upwards. Blood dripped down my arm, and I started freaking out. I could feel flutters in the edge of my hand and my arm started hurting. I put pressure on it and started crying because I hadn't cut deep enough to kill myself and I just wanted the suffering to be over. 

I told my friend the next day and she was trying to get me to tell my parents or my other friend who self harms so I can get help, but I know my friend is going to freak out and scream at me and tell my parents. I've been having pain in my arms and my wrist, in the morning of yesterday I felt numbness which is gone now, but I still keep getting pain in my arms, as if I have a tight muscle or something. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel even worse because I fail at even trying to kill myself and I have no one to talk to, my psychologist is just going to put me in a psychiatric ward because she mentioned last session if I was going to harm myself any further or try to kill myself, I would have to be admitted. We had to make a pact until I could get referred to a psychiatrist, but I broke the pact. I can't tell my parents, they will freak out and start ranting about religion mumbo jumbo and stop me from seeing my friends or going on my phone, because they think it's triggering me. I wish I could have gone deeper, so I don't experience the suffering of the world anymore. I can't take it anymore and I hate feeling like I can't even succeed at anything
