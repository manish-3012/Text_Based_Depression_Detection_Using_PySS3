Trying to understandHello everyone, been a long time lurker, reading through the posts trying to make sense of what I am going through. First of all I am a 33 year old male with that appears to be clinical depression and suicidal idealizations. I had tried to get medical help but it has been a negative experience. I have trouble control my emotions and tend to hurt myself by punching the walls or cutting myself to see the blood flow. Lately I have been toying to really hurt myself physically to stop the pain and actually committing suicide to stop the pain that I have. A pain I am trying to really understand because I don't know where it comes from. Some days I really wish I could actually die, but some days I function enough to get a clear mind and try to live with it. How do you cope with all the pain and the sadness? Or the deception and the shame? Anything that you will think it will help its appreciated. I am scared of I can really do to myself lately. Thanks for reading.
