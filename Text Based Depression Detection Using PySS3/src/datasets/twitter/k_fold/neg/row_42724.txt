I want to die to not end the pain, but to end my existenceThe title may seem weird to read but Ill explain it. I have always wondered what's the point of existing. I never agreed to be born and exist. Existence means you have to do stuff and my life has a lot of work and stress. I want to end my life because I don't want to exist at all and go through this retarded process of life. If I don't exist, I'll just be peaceful for me which is just the way I want it. The human race will be extinct eventually and all our fingerprints and progress will be wiped with it. Why the fuck should I do stuff for it for all our progress to be wiped after. Happiness for you and others is the most important part of life but I never will be happy because I'm existing. I'm numb to everything, I don't experience many emotions and my face is always straight. I never smile and always talk in a monotone/emotionless way to other people which is probably why I have no friends(in highschool btw). Being born is not a choice but killing yourself is, which is why I'll do it. People think I'm crazy and they're right because I am. I am psychopathic and do have a lot of mental problems but I have no intention of fixing them. No one gives a fuck about me, not even my own parents, but they're right. I may be crazy but I just want you to know that I am not killing myself because of pain.
