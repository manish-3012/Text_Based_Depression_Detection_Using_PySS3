I get excited whenever I hear/think of anything related to suicide. Should I be worried?I'm an aspie. And like all aspies do, I can easily develop obessesion towards things. Sometimes it's subjects or fandom, but sometimes it can get quite disturbing. There's time when days are tougher than usual, and the thought of death slip into my mind, like a fleeting thoughts. But than I'd get completely obsessed with that little thought, search it online and try to know the exact details of it, how to do it via any possible way, fantasizing myself doing it. The strange thing is, I'm not depressed, I'm not feeling hopeless. I have a backup plan to the original failed one. I know there's things in my life I actually care about, and I don't have the luxury of dying, and my dignity refuse to compromise so easily. But it seems I just keep on thinking about it, wishing that I had 9 lives so I can kill myself 8 times and understand how it feels like. Tbh, two years ago I even tried to hang myself on my doorknob to see if the description in the complete guide to suicide is accurate (I hung myself on the doorknob bc it's safer than hanging on the ceiling.) Should I be worried?
