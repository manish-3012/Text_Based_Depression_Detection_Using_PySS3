It sucks that thereâ€™s a pandemic...But Iâ€™m not gonna lie and say I donâ€™t wish it would give me a way out. 

Supposedly it sucks and is painful, but it would be so convenient. Not my fault. Not my familyâ€™s fault. Just an innocent victim. One of thousands of innocent victims. Just another number. Get to disappear into the news as another faceless nameless mark on a notepad. And I get to be at peace. Gone, no tomorrow, no the day after. My parents wonâ€™t blame themselves and theyâ€™ll mourn the helplessness of the situation and probably just pour themselves into helping other victims. 

Nobody will come to my funeral. 

My parents know I have zero friends. Theyâ€™ll make a Facebook invite and nobody will show up. Even my sisters will be happier, they actually hate me. When my sister got married she had 8 bridesmaids. If I were to ever get married....Iâ€™d have zero people to invite because I have no friends. I threw myself a birthday party a couple years ago and nobody showed up. 

Itâ€™s my fault. My name is Karen and Iâ€™m the girl you used to hate. Iâ€™m annoying, pretty but not pretty enough, awkward, insecure. I gave up. I give up. 

Just get this over with. Iâ€™m done with trying. Iâ€™m done with crashing and restarting and clinging to nothing. Give me something to smile and point to and say â€œlook! Iâ€™m fucked! It chose right! Goodbye!â€
