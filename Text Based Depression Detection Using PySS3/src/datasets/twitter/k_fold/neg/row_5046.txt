I wish I had the guts.This is more Off My Chest than Suicide Watch. I hope that's okay, I can't find the community rules in this redesign thing.

I'm not intending to kill myself. I've made plans, but I can't follow through. Last time I tried, everyone hated me for it, and I can barely imagine breaking the trust they've managed to give me back. Maybe after a bit more of this I'll begin to not mind. I hope so, because it hurts, and I'd like it to stop hurting, and it's not going to stop all on its own. If only I had done it right the first time.

Sometimes I wake up and find myself optimistic, though that feeling tends to die off quite swiftly. Then I'm back to googling "how to get cancer easily", which I'm aware is entirely retarded, but I've got no options besides managing to die naturally \(and also stupid searches like that are probably a coping mechanism\). Well, why is it that every person killed in an accident is a person so full of life and purpose, and I can't manage anything worse than a papercut? Maybe I could trade places with one of them, and that would be the best thing I'd have done for the world in my entire life.

I wish I had real depression. Then I at least wouldn't feel like I'm a fucking poser, and maybe I would have the guts to go through with it, everyone else be damned. That would be better for all of them in the long run, because I'm completely and utterly wasting their physical and emotional resources for nothing.

Anyway, thanks for reading. I haven't said half of the feelings I wanted to express, but I'm feeling better now, and by that I mean I don't feel as bad because I feel kinda empty. 

Regardless, you have a good day. If you are here, you deserve it more than anyone.
