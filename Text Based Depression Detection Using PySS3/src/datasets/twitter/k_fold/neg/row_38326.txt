I'm feeling defeated.I've dealt with suicidal thoughts since elementary school. I have bipolar 1, currently in a depressive phase. My friends family and doctor want me hospitalized but I will find any excuse in the book to ensure that wont happen. 

I dont feel like I deserve anyone's times let alone medical professionals. I also really hated being in inpatient care in the past. I dont want it to take away my way out if I need it. Its comforting to know that I can make all the end myself if I so chose to. I've come up with a few different plans over the past week but it just has to be fool-proof. I have to be sure if I'm going to commit to doing this it absolutely has to work.  I guess I'm just working on that now.
