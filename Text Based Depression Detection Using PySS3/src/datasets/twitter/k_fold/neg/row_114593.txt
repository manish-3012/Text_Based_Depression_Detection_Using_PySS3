An updateSo I've posted quite a bit lately and I thought I'd post an update.

On Monday i told a friend of mine that i was making a suicide plan. I'm pretty sure i upset her and she made me promise to tell my therapist on Tuesday. TBH i wasn't even going to go to therapy but that changed my mind.

Tuesday I went to therapy and I told my therapist that my suicidal ideations had turned into suicidal plans. She asked me what brought this on and at first i wasn't sure but then I remembered I had had a panic attack at work on Wednesday. So we talked about that. She thinks I got triggered and that's what caused it. I don't really know if that's true or not. I left there feeling slightly better and glad I had told her but not really convinced that I want to live or anything.

Not convinced I don't want to either though, so I don't know.

Here are reasons to live:

* My friends and (some of) my family. Not just that it would hurt them if I died, but that I love them and they help life not suck as much as it would without them.

* My cat - kind of silly I know, but I do love the little furball.

* Artwork. I love making art and sharing it with people. 

And here are reasons why I want to die:

* Depression

* Anxiety

* Panic attacks

* Nightmares/flashbacks 

* I hate myself and it's exhausting going through life pretending I don't.

**EDIT** well i was feeling ok and then something else happend and no i really just want to die. see all those things up there dont make up for how fucked things are. the pills and vodka i have wont kill me but maybe they will put me to sleep for awhile yes?
