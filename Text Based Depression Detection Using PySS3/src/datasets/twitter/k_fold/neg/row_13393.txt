Just Read If You Have The Time I GuessHi. Need anyone to read this maybe leave a comment I feel so fucking alone. 

My whole life has been a shit show, had an abusive father on drugs, lived in poverty for my entire childhood. I live in an extremely small town, so small it bores me. I feel so stuck also donâ€™t have enough money to move any where or do anything big. My motherâ€™s side of the family doesnâ€™t speak to me, neither does my fathers. I really have nobody except my siblings and mother. Recently iâ€™ve lost all my friends. The girl iâ€™ve loved for years doesnâ€™t want to be with me. Iâ€™m an idiot trying to take ged classes currently and I struggle with basic math. The reason I left High school was because of how depressed and anxious I was everyday I couldnâ€™t do it. Iâ€™ve been like that since elementary. Everyone has a nice life except me it feels like. It would be so nice to just go out and buy something or eat out or do something without worrying about money. Iâ€™ve been depressed for so long iâ€™m tired of this battle and i donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m so terrified of death and hurting my mother and siblings, but sometimes these urges to reach over my nightstand and take a whole bottle of pills digs at me. The past week especially. This is embarrassing but I self harm too. ( P.S i was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder )  I feel like a loser. I wish I could have a different life, or even better have never been born. This is a bit of a messed up post not much correct grammar probably but itâ€™s late and I want to kill myself Lol. Iâ€™m also sick of telling people how i feel and getting told to go to sleep or think of something positive. That hurts me so much. I try so hard to live but itâ€™s getting more and more difficult. Anyways just let me know what you are all thinking. Sorry
