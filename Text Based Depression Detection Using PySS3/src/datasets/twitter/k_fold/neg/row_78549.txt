Don't do itMy friend recently commited suicide and posted his note here. I'm so messed up over this and the crazy thing is that WE WERE NOT EVEN CLOSE . You don't know how badly suicide effects the people around you . I can't think of him without crying and I think about him all the time . We weren't family or close friends , he was just the funny guy from class . YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW BADLY YOU CAN MESS UP PEOPLE YOU BARELY SPEAK TO. I bet a million bucks he would never expect me to be this fucked up over this . PLEASE DO NOT DO IT .
