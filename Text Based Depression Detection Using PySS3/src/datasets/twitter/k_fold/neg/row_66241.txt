i don't know if i should go oni'm home alone for most of the day today and i'm don't see a real reason to keep going.
i'm only fifteen and yesterday was my birthday. i was hospitalized for a suicide attempt about two years ago, and i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. i just don't really know why i bother. 
i get good grades, sure, but i want to pursue creativity and not a finanically secure career. when i worry about how the hell i'll be able to pay for college and just get by, my parents laugh at me. they find it odd that i worry about it, even though they have no money saved for me. i could get a lucrative position in a cushy job, but i wouldn't be happy. my standards for myself are too high and i feel as though i disappoint everyone around me.
i always think too much, but summer break leaves me alone with my thoughts too much. i think i deserve the pain, but i don't want to live it. i want to be okay but i've been battling this for three years and it never stays for long. i don't know how to be happy without depending on another person. i think it'd be better if i was gone. no one needs me and i'm a leech on society.

i don't know. i'm sorry about my rambling. i have nowhere else to go, i suppose.
