The CPS has provoded an SF2 Toxicology report.I was banking on the lab that did my blood test to be in administration. They aren't. And thus the CPS has got all the evidence of me being over the limit whilst driving. Unless by some magic lucky stretch of the imagination my solicitor can get me out of this I'll be banned from driving. 

Now that may only sound like a small hiccup in life, I've been feeling down for almost all of my adult life. Almost looking for an excuse or a reason to end it. 

I cannot deal with having to tell work, especially as I have recently been moved teams and with the look in to go to university to study civil engineering. They have offered me a fantastic chance.

If I get found guilty I will attempt to kill myself. Method? Well I have a couple in my head but I'm thinking I might take some drugs (perscription or not idc). I'll probably smoke some spliff, drink some booze, pop some drugs and that'll be that. 

I'm sorry that I have let everyone down, myself included. I'm sorry to my parents that I feel this is my only option. I'm sorry to my siblings that I won't be at their weddings, I'm sorry that I won't be able to join in on their life events. I love you all, especially my older sister Jade, she has been an amazing person. And my little brother Jay, I hope you go on to enjoy life, peace out brother, I'll always love you.
