Epstein and suicideI was triggered today by Epstein's apparent suicide. I almost killed myself about 7 years ago but a friend saved me. People are saying they are glad he is dead. Suicide is cowardly and selfish. He took the easy way out of his situation. Yes, he probably would have been convicted and more than likely killed in prison, but he still killed himself. We can't take this lightly or push it away as others will seize on this and take the same way out. 

Just my 2 cents. I have no sympathy for his soul, but I do for those who may take the same path.
