Feel like my life's going out of controlSeveral of my family members browse reddit so I'm going to to try and keep this as generic as possible. I will say that I am quite young and am male and have graduated high school not too long ago and have just recently made it out into the world. This is going to be somewhat of a disorganized rant, because I have never told anyone any of this and I don't know what to do or who to turn to. 

I feel like I'm spinning out of control and I'm starting to become desperate. I'n pretty sure something is wrong with my brain, because I don't seem to experience emotions like most people do. I'm basically trapped on an emotional roller coaster everyday where my mood is entirely dictated by my interactions with other people. If I have a bad social interaction with someone (even a complete stranger) it gets me really upset. Sadness isn't quite the way to put it, more like childish frustration as I usually get the urge to cry. Fear is also a big part of it, as I am really scared of other people, especially when they get mad. Sometimes I get really enraged at the person or myself and get the urge to hurt myself or other people. This mood usually continues until I have a positive interaction with someone, after which I feel really euphoric and invincible, suddenly it seems like there is hope. I'm also naturally introverted and not outgoing at all. But I am dependent on other people to stabilize myself, and so I am always really anxious in social situations and paranoid about what people think of me.

This all makes it very hard to function day-to-day, but recently things have gotten much worse. I started a job in retail about four and a half months back and it is brutal on me. Customers are often very rude and treat me like I am subhuman. Even when I really try to be kind, they just seems to take advantage of it or ignore it. This is really a problem for me because of the aforementioned mood problems. In addition, this job has corrupted my view of humanity. I am deeply resentful and bitter towards other people, and have become sort of misanthropic and I don't like it.

Finally, ever since I was about 14 I could feel an overbearing presence watching over me, and around December of 2018, I realized that this presence was in fact God. It wasn't until after I had started the new job that I made any attempt to contact God, and that's when things really went downhill. I begged God to deliver me and to take me off of the Earth, but he didn't and that's when I realized that he had malicious intent (him and Jesus both). Since then God and Christ have been communicating with me almost daily, even when I don't want them to. I should note that I have never actually *heard* either of them. They communicate by putting thoughts and feelings into me that are clearly not mine. It's hard to explain, but basically I can feel the divinity of these thoughts and feelings and know they do not originate from me. 

God will often tell me when people don't like me and sometimes show me what they are thinking (only when they think bad things about me). He will often make me afraid of strangers. For instance, sometimes I'll be driving and He will convince me that the person driving behind me is mad at me and following me to kill me. God punishes me by putting disturbing thoughts in my mind and encouraging me to act on them. He takes advantage of my self-mutilation tendencies and makes me fantasize about specific forms of self-harm, like cutting off my nipples or pieces of my face or lathering my genitals in Icey-Hot ointments. Similarly,  He also gives me gross or obscene sexual desires and compulsions, or makes me masturbate to certain kinds of extreme pornography. A lot of these sexual desires He gives me are violent or very disturbing and they make me uncomfortable. God reminds me that I am a bad person in the eyes of Christ and that I deserve to die and go to hell. 

Basically, I don't know what to do and am becoming  increasingly desperate. I don't want to die, especially not by suicide. I am worried about what it will do to my family and I don't want to go to hell. But on the other hand it seems like it is my only solution, since things can't get better. I feel like I am in a burning building and I can either jump out and kill myself or stay inside and burn, waiting for the building to inevitably collapse, killing me anyway.
