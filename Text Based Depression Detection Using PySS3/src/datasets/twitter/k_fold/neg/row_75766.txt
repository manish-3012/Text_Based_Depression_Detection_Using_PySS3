Running away to kill myselfHey there... 

Iâ€™m a black woman, 24 years old, and living by myself.

My head is a very tiring place. Constant worry, constant fear, constant sadness. I donâ€™t even want to talk about my life anymore, Iâ€™ve explained it again and again over the phone to mental health professionals but here I am. Iâ€™ll just say domestic violence in my long term relationship, pretty much estranged from family, no friends, and too scared of the future. I feel like Iâ€™m too sensitive for this world, and my anxiety is so bad that I have to calm down before replying to someoneâ€™s text message, let alone face to face. Iâ€™ve tried my absolute best to overcome everything, I really have. For the past 5 years, Iâ€™ve tried cognitive behavioural therapy, mental health crisis team (NHS), A&amp;E emergency therapy and countless counselling/regular therapy sessions I have paid for myself. 

Iâ€™ve wanted to runaway seriously since the start of this year, right after a physical argument with my long term partner. The scar on my face left me wondering how worthless I was. Not to say heâ€™s the only bad person, I have also hit him but more so in terms of self defence. We are still together but because heâ€™s the only person I know, I canâ€™t leave him. Heâ€™s the only person who can make me feel loved. However, I didnâ€™t runaway because I still had university to complete for my parents. Now that Iâ€™ve finished my final exams, idk if Iâ€™ll be here to know my results but I hope I get a 2:1 to make them happy. Anyways, Iâ€™ve already bought a tent and loads of other things I need from amazon. Iâ€™m thinking of going this week. I donâ€™t know where to go, and I will take every opportunity to put myself in danger with other people so they can i.e. rape and kill me. 

Because if canâ€™t do it, I hope someone else can. 

Another thing Iâ€™ve forced myself to do is start doing weed, I never liked it but Iâ€™m intending to use it when I runaway so I can be so high that I walk off a cliff, walk into the motorway, cut myself deeply (since I canâ€™t feel any pain when Iâ€™m high).. or just have a huge overdose. Last week I bought Â£40 worth so I hope it helps. 

Iâ€™ve been lying to my gp that everything is okay because... it is. Iâ€™ve always wanted to die, I donâ€™t want to live in this fucked up world, thereâ€™s no good anywhere. So itâ€™s okay, because itâ€™s my wish. My family never wanted me to talk to them again after I got a non-muslim boyfriend... I wish I never met him cos he lied to me on the internet and took my virginity, something I wanted to give to someone who was ready for a relationship and wasnâ€™t manipulative. I want to die because Iâ€™m not me anymore, I donâ€™t recognise myself. Every time Iâ€™m high and extremely depressed, I think about my mother. I remember how much she cried when I left the house for the first time without my headscarf/hijab on... 9th March 2016... I would do anything to go back there. I believe I can go back there if I die. Back then I was so pretty, good self confidence, friends, some sort of family. 

I miss me. Where did I go?

Iâ€™ll either find myself whilst on this adventure, or die trying.
