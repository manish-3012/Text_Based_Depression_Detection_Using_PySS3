27 and I feel like there is no hope for me.I went through a traumatic event at 19 years old that involved numerous bouts of homelessness and abuse.  I thought as long as I could stay alive and get my degree, things would be fine.

I got the degree. The job market sucks. I'm terrified to get my license. I hate my current job due to constant bullying and favoritism. I try to get another job and they won't call me back. I didn't get into a graduate program I applied for.

Near two years ago, I got dumped from a 7 year relationship, and my best friend killed himself six months later. I can't stop thinking about it. I've struggled with thoughts of suicide my entire life, and I am so, so, so tired. Things never get better for me. I got a new position at work and was excited for it, but now I'm a target for bullying. I try to make friends with coworkers and no one wants to spend time with me. I have very little friends and I'm convinced everyone hates me. 

I'm so, so, tired. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel so trapped and scared constantly.
