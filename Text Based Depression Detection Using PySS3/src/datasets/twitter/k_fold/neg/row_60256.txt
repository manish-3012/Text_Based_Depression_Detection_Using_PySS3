I'm afraid of life.I have severe issues with control and depression to the point where I spend most nights either crying from misery or either staring at the ceiling because I can't stop thinking about death. I think a lot about  my loved ones dying, especially my boyfriend, as he lives hours away and I panic over not being able to see him in time if something were to happen. If it's not that, it's thinking about how, even if my life works out, I'll probably only become happy briefly and then die a horrible death at a young age, either through a gruesome accident or, much more likely, one of the multiple types of cancer that plague both my families.

I've been thinking a lot about this along with my impending graduation/sudden unemployment situation (applied for a full-time version of my position at my current tiny office found out it may have gone to someone else) and I'm beginning to think that it may just be better to kill myself so that I don't have to see myself fail or, even worse, live to see my loved ones die or myself die slowly and horribly. I'd rather be in control of my own death instead of waiting for the cosmic forces to fuck me over one last time.

I know I sound completely irrational but this has been plaguing me for nights on end and I just need to get it out of my head for a little so that maybe I can stop crying for a few moments.
