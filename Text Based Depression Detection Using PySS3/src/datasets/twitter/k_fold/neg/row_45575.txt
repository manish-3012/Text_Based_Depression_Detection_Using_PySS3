Fuck this apathetic lifeGod why can't I feel anything? Why can't I cry? Why don't I care about anything in my life? Why don't I care about myself? Why don't I care about my family? I'm so fucking bored and tired. Life is so fucking boring and tiring and I just don't give a damn about it anymore. Take it. I don't want it. There's nothing here for me. Nothing that I care about. I have a family, I have friends, and you know what? Fuck them. Who gives a shit how this makes them feel? Who gives them the right to keep me alive just so they don't have to deal with the loss? I don't want it. I want it to stop. I want to stop. I want to collapse and give up and fade away. I want to give up on life and just stop eating and drinking and sleep for a few days until I die of dehydration. I don't care anymore.
