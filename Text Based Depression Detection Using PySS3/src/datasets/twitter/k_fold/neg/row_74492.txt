This was a bad ideaI'm just a tourist coming through, and I saw a mention of this sub earlier. I figured I'd stop by and see what's on the top posts, nothing too bad...

Then I went to new. 

Read about this guy who might not make it too tommorow... he's probably on his way up to that roof as I type this...and I couldn't bare to say anything. I couldn't even tell him to give the hot line a ring.

I've got my 1.5 month old in my arms, what if that was him.
I'm just a 19 year old kid, I've had some bad days, I probably need care I'm not getting, I'm probably in terrible shape...but I'm going to be haunted by the image of a shadow falling off a building, that glass shattering sound of bones hitting the concrete below...and I'm going to feel like that's my burden.

I should have never opened this sub, and I hope everyone here ends up okay.
