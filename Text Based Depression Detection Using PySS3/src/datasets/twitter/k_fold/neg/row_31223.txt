I've started planning my suicideFirst time posting here, though I am not subscribed. I just wanted to vent, so I hope that I have at least come to the right place. I have recently acquired some rope from my local hardware depot, and on my way home from work tonight have found the ideal place to carry out my plan, not too far from my home and easily accessible with the aide of my chair.

For far too long I have been dealing with multiple mental health issues - chronic depression, anxiety, complex PTSD, ASD, inferiority complex, and maybe more which I may not be aware of. I'm nearly 30 years old, raised by narcissistic parents; my father was physically and mentally abusive, while my mother was emotionally abusive and would guilt-trip me whenever I showed any signs of feeling depressed. Everything was always my fault, even if I had no direct (or indirect) involvement. I was always bullied at school by anyone and everyone, and even with blatant evidence to prove my innocence, teachers/staff members would always deem me as problematic. I am mostly remembered by my school peers as the one who tried to kill himself during the first year - even the teachers made suicide jokes at my expense, and other students were often encouraged/rewarded for bullying me.

&amp;#x200B;

College proved no better. I was harshly betrayed by my peers and cheated out of a decent grade by the end of my course. The lecturers we had denounced my mental health issues and insisted that I was just seeking their sympathy. It didn't help that I was also struggling with my sexuality at this stage, and experienced the stigma and harassment that accompanied being anything but heterosexual. Around this time, I was also becoming more isolated from my peers at a local youth group at a nearby church - because of the issues with my sexual identity, the domestic issues with my family, and my sheer unhappiness in life, more and more people started to shun me until I no longer felt welcome. I even went to a different church, but ultimately things weren't much better, and my weight/size became the subject of bullying.

Later in life, I was face with restrictions on what I wanted to do with myself in terms of further education, career, where I called home...my naivety would ultimately be my downfall as I foolishly listening to my parents about not moving away and staying put. I missed out on life skills that I so desperately wanted to experience, to the point where I no longer feel like my mental age reflects my actual age. My brother, who had it much worse than me, was able to make a name for himself; he was able to bear children, regardless of how many relationships he had, but has now settled down, has a place of his own, has a stable job and is able to support his life-long hobby of wrestling.

I haven't  been in a relationship for 13 years now. Since my last relationship, the only people who have been interested in me were only interested in money, soliciting images of myself, or used me as a means of getting to someone else. There are three exceptions: one person was interested in sex and attempted to sexually assault me, one was only interested in gaining a visa to migrate to the UK and made it clear I was going to be a stay-at-home partner with no contact with friends or family, and a third was also just interested in sex and made it very clear he wouldn't accept no as an answer. That said, I am far from being even conventionally attractive, moreso by today's standards. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can't even get accepted by my workk colleagues. While my job was the only thing keeping me alive with a decent wage, too much has been revealed about myself for me to be seen as anything but the weird one. Even my birthdays harbor nothing but ill-will. No one wants to spend time with me, and I only seem to attract nothing but trouble. My birthday is in two weeks, and by some sheer miracle my friend has let me visit him for the week. But upon my return, that's when I plan to carry out my suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to be a burden to anyone any longer. For far too long I've been accused of lying about my mental health, or being selfish and not thinking of others. But really, the people who I am supposed to be living for are mostly the ones who have left me feeling this way to begin with. I am exhausted, my will to live for myself has long since perished, and the one person who I was living for...through no fault of his own, I don't think I can carry on living even for him, my best friend.

For anyone who has actually read through this; please know that there is obviously a lot more to what I've mentioned that what I've revealed. Please do not message me asking me to reconsider; I have spend 20 years doing exactly that, I think I've thought it over enough times. Mental health services have failed me numerous times in the past, I no longer have faith in anything, so please do not waste your time sending me links or contact numbers. Also, I noticed that there are trolls who are sending pro-suicide messages to people...to you guys, I say don't even bother; I have likely already heard some variation of whatever it is you send to people, and probably worse, in person. Nothing you send in writing will top it.
