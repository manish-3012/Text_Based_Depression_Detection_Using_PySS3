I donâ€™t understand how Iâ€™m supposed to be an adult.Today is my 18th birthday and although Iâ€™m happy to celebrate it with my family, Iâ€™m having so many suicidal thoughts. Thoughts about how Iâ€™m supposed to be applying to college right now, be getting a job, start paying all sorts of money to all sorts of things, even just getting a fucking credit card and getting credit sounds fucking exhausting. I can barely leave my room on a daily basis, how the FUCK will I survive as an adult. It sounds so fucking complicated and I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m capable of getting through any of it without fucking up massively. 

I donâ€™t even want to die that bad, but I donâ€™t want to grow up. I donâ€™t want to start what will probably be the most miserable part of my life. I just know I wonâ€™t be able to do it because I canâ€™t even do my laundry. How the fuck am I going to survive.
