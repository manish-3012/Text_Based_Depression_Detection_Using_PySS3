I'm always suicidal. All the time. Should I go to a hospital?I'm really drunk right now so sorry.

I'm on 30 mgs of Celexa. I'm always suicidal. I see everything as a suicide opportunity - a bridge, bus, subway, pharmacist, boxing bag, etc. I don't want to go to a hospital because I think I'm being a melodramatic-whiny-drama-queen-angsty-bitch-should-just-man-the-fuck-up-and-get-over-clinical-depression, but honestly I can understand how my logic is absurd. I have cracked open two razor blades and was going to slash my wrists and sleep in the washroom tonight but the logical part of me understands this is counterproductive to life and living. 

This is a totally insane post. I don't have a drinking problem by the way, I'm 18, and this is my first time drinking in roughly a year.
