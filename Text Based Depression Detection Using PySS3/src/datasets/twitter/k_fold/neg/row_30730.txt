Realized Iâ€™ll never be truly happy, and years of suicidal thoughts have resurfaced. Tempted to down the bottle of vodka in my freezer and fall asleep in the snow.It would take forever to explain why Iâ€™m feeling like this, but basically, Iâ€™m very unhappy with myself and my life, especially after recently having my heart broken by a girl I thought Iâ€™d marry. Honestly, I never thought anyone could love me like her, and I poured all my love into her, but she just lost feelings. Thereâ€™s nothing I can do. 

I donâ€™t want to say what it is specifically, but I have a condition that separates me from other guys and can be treated with medication/surgery but never actually cured. Iâ€™ve spent thousands of dollars on this (actually preparing for a surgery next week), but I know that even at the end, I may still be unsatisfied with myself. And others will be unsatisfied with me. In fact, with each surgery, I have more scars and deformities to hide, and some of them canâ€™t be hidden. She loved me despite this, and while it didnâ€™t make me love myself, it was reassuring that I had someone who loved me and supported me. Now Iâ€™m alone. 

A few minutes ago, I sat back in bed and laughed because it really seems like Iâ€™ll just never be happy. Iâ€™ve been miserable all 21 years of my life, spoken to many therapists, tried many different medications, and yet suicide still tempts me. The only real reasons why I havenâ€™t done it yet are the fact that I donâ€™t want to hurt my family (or whatâ€™s left of it) and Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™ll be unsuccessful. 

I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this right now. I was just alone in my apartment, feeling like a stranger in my own body, watching the snow fall outside.
