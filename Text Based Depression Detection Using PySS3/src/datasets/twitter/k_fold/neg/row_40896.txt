FuckI've been wanting to kill myself for about 20 years now.  Everything I do just makes me think about it more no matter how much I might be lying to myself about enjoying "the moment".  I trust no one when it comes to this as basically everyone I've ever opened up to about this has just called the police and the night ends w me naked in solitary confinement.  My plan has been for the last couple years to wait for my parents to die so they don't have to deal with it but I'm leaning closer and closer to saying fuck it to that.  I have a sister but she has a family and they would be essentially unaffected by my absence. I'm willing to hire someone to kill me at this point because I'm pretty sure I'm just too cowardly a piece of shit to do it myself.
