What can I do to show myself that life is worth living?As the title says I'm finding it very difficult to prove to myself that life is worth living. I keep making mistakes that I don't feel are mistakes while I'm making them and I've continually lost friends as I do so. At this point I am alone and lost.

For context I live in Utah and was raised as a member of the LDS church, however I did not believe what the church teaches and don't agree with some of the actions the church has taken.

 I'm 23 years old and feel that there is no point to continuing my life, I make no progress and no friends. I live in my parents basement with a wife who I am continually dragging down. My psychiatrist and my parents answer is always to pray and read my scriptures to try and find comfort or an answer from God but I feel so alone.

I've flunked out college, I've upset and lost my best friend and every day it seems I alienate my wife more and more. I treat her so poorly and take my anger out on her. My parents are both elderly and their health is failing, I am their only child but I cannot support them or their health due to the fact that I cannot keep a job for longer than a year.

I am useless to myself and those around me. Please. Tell me any possible way that my life is worth living. Please.
