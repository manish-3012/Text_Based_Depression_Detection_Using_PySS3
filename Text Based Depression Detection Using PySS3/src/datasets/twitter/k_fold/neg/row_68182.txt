What is wrong with meI had 3 days off. Can you guess what I did? Did I go outside? Did I hang out with my friends? Did I do anything productive? No. I slept and played video games. It would have been fine if it was only those 3 days but when I think about it itâ€™s every day. Whatâ€™s the point. I literally do nothing.
