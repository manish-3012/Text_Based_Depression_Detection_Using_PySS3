Is anyone there, I need helpIâ€™m using my momâ€™s phone since she took mine away. I just wanted someone to talk to, have a bottle of Adderall and I was wondering if I could overdose on that. Either tips on overdosing successfully or just someone to talk to would be nice, I donâ€™t really care what at this point. Please.
