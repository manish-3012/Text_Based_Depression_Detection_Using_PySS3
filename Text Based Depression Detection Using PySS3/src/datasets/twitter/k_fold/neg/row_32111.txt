Canada's MAiD &amp; proposed Bill C-7Hey folks!  41y/o Ontarian here. Long time mental sufferer. Quelle surprise. It's just your usual PTSD, anxiety, depression, unable to hold down a job, no children, no friends, unable to earn a living, childhood trauma, tried meds, tried therapy, tried excersize, changed diet, tried cognitive mindfulness, etc.

I suffer solely from mental illness. I'm exhausted. I don't want to botch the job.

Will the proposed changes to MAiD (medical assistance in dying) apply to someone like me? Can anybody shed some light on what it means once they remove "unforeseeable death"? Will I finally be able to die on my own terms peacefully? Or will mental health sufferers in be excluded? What will "the pill" be and if approved could I self administer and where?
