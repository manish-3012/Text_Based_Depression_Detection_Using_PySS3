Just saying goodbyeI'm sorry but this is the place that I am afraid I have to say goodbye.  

It's been a heck of a two years.  I had a very stressful job and fell into depression.  I struggled with it all my life, but this time was different.  It got so bad that I had to go on disability.  I did that for a little under 6 months.  I went to doctors, was in the hospital, tried numerous medicines, even did electro shock therapy.  I went back to work and was let go 3 weeks later.

Lost my job
Lost my car
Lost my 2 Labrador's when I lost my house
My wife filed for legal separation to protect herself
She moved out with our 3 kids
She won't let me see them because I am too depressed
Have about $40k in credit card debt
My wife claimed all the cash and house equity in separation and I will have about 25k in tax liability
Had to move out of the studio apartment and into my parents home (I'm 54).  I didn't read and just signed the separation papers as I felt so bad about what I put them through.

I've become a burden to my friends
I have been sleeping 10-12 hours a day

I bought a gun.  I picked it up 5 days ago after the waiting period.

My notes are written, I picked out a place in the woods.  I feel so bad for the person that finds me.  I have made a sign that I will tack on a tree about 100 yards away so hopefully they won't see me and can call police.

Anyway, I just wanted to say goodbye.  I can't say goodbye to my friends and family as I don't want to traumatize them more than I will.

Thanks for listening.
