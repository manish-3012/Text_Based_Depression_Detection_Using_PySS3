I need someone to talk to and relate to Im 18. Over the summer i got abandoned completely by my now ex who i was head over heels in love with. She took my virginity, was my first everything, holding hands to PIV sex. She moved on like i was nothing, we were together for a half a year, took eachothers virginity, went on vacation, spent weeks at a time living at eachothers house, we were inseparable. One bad fight and name calling between both of us led to our breakup, which she moved on instantly and i became obsessed and made 100+ snapchats over the period of 2 months begging her for another chance. Today i contacted her for the first time in a week or 2 and she just completely rejected me, said horrible things about me, told me she was done and moved on and didnt want even a mere friendship, asked me for some of my classmates snaps, etc. Just made me feel like complete dogshit. I have no friends I can just go to and hang out with. She was my best friend. I told her i was killing myself and logged out of snapchat at an exact time i told her i was doing it, all she did was mock me and make fun of me for wanting to take my life. i havent done it, and it this point i dont really plan on it, but im still broken to bits and want to share my story and listen to and help others. thank u and take it easy guys
