Got really drunk and high but didn't kill myselfTonight like the title says I drank a lot and smoked a lot of weed and I am totally out of  it right now. But I didn't kill myself i. I drank and smoked to hopefully get myself to where I am too physically incapacitated to kill myself and it worked I guess. I'm stoll here.



I don't want to still be here. I really really don't. My life can't be fixed d. Literally EVERYTHING every tiny thing, absolutely everything would need to change for my life to. Even be ok. Not good just ok. Just neutral. 



I can't make that 180 change. I don't think it's possible at all I really don't. I've sat and thought through every problem and tried to come up with plans, tried to find the way to work through everything and every plan has a huge roadblock. Everything had a reason why it wouldn't work. Everything. This is even with other peoples' help to come up with these plans and I've had people's just shrug and basically say I'm fucked. Which is true I know


You don't know how much it hurts to have other people even look at your life and sit down with you and try to make a plan and they decide there's nothing you can do after looking at everything, but somehow they tell you to hold on anyway



So that's why I have the rope ready. It's tied and hung in the garage because nobody ever uses it or goes in there to see but it's the perfect place to hang myself. I went in there today and thought about climbijng the ladder and hanging myself just like I do most days. But got sloppy drunk instead.



It's not a victory because maybe I'll just do it tomorrow instead. But for today at least I didn't kill myself. Hooray?
