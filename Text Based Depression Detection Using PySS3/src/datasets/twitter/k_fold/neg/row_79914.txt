A tiring compulsive need to be creativeSometimes I get really motivated and try to create some really popular project that will make me famous / rich, and I hate this feeling. I'm already exhausted after coming home from school / work, yet I feel this need to be productive all the time. I can't even play video games / browse the Internet / watch TV without feeling an immense amount of guilt that I'm wasting my time, even when it's only during these times that I genuinely feel happy in life. Like the only break I'll get is when I'm dead, but even then I'm afraid of not leaving behind a legacy and being forgotten.

In short, I envy all the other people who can live life without clinging unto one idea so viciously. Those who can look at Hell (Scrupulosity) or Blindness (Contamination) without fear. And even then I believe that everyone goes to Heaven when they die, no matter what religion or lack thereof that they believe in, because I just want everyone to be infinitely happy forever, I just want all this suffering to be worth it somehow. And I'm jealous of others who can be fulfilled in life so easily.

I'm sorry if what I'm saying is off putting or even straight up weird, it's just that, throughout all the time I've spent compulsively searching up symptoms / doubts / rituals on the Internet, I've yet to find a post that talks about these issues. And I'm hoping that by posting here, I can be understood.
