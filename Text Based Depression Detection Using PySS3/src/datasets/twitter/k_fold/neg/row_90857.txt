Please, help me. I've (24nb) suffered from sever depression and anxiety since I was 13 years old, and maybe even before then. Alongside that i have a chronic pain condition that makes my life not only emotionally painful, but physically painful too.
 To make a long story short, it's now making it impossible to live a normal life. In the past two years, I've had to have 4 months out of work each year. I've been signed off sick again now due to a meltdown I had at work two weeks ago. I self harmed while at the workplace and I fear that I'm going to lose my job, either for the amount of time I've had to take off sick, or because I technically bought a weapon into work to self harm with (it was the blade from a pencil sharpener so nothing major, but that's beside the point; it's the principle)
 It's been just over a year since I last tried to take my life, and I'm dancing on a knife-edge about trying again. I'm nearly Â£10,000 in debt and struggling living pay check to pay check as it is, without having to pay back my debts. I can't eat, I can't sleep and I can't work so I'm really struggling with the idea of carrying on living. I honestly don't see the point any more.
