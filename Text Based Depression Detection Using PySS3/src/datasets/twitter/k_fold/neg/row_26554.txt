Stray cat kept following me, I couldn't do it...Stray cat I was feeding near my home kept following me on my way to the bridge, I can't do it. The little guy loves me so much, never followed me like this before. Now I'm back home and he followed me inside. I guess he chose me as his family. I'm so confused guys.
