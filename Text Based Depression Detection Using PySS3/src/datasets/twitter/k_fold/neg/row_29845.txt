I think I might just end it soon.I've had other posts here, go check them out if you want the backstory. I'm just completely lost, I've lost all meaning to life. All I hear people say is "try to self-improve". It doesn't fucking work. I lost everything that has given me reason. The only reason I haven't ended it already is because I've been afraid to die and that I don't want to have wasted a bunch of my parent's money for no reason.
