Is there anything I can do to make things betterI'm sorry if this is more of a vent than anything but I don't know what to do
It's probably going to be a lot of disconnected stuff that might be out of order and really long so I'm sorry
I appreciate any help and anyone reading all of this
Thank you 

I'm a trans girl

I used to. Be on hrt and after a year on it I wasn't doing perfect but I could go outside quite often and passing a bit, maybe even most of the time and I was able to feel pretty
But I've always had trichotillomania which coupled with dysphoria lead to plucking my facial hair, and my OCD made it impossible to stop going after any I saw even if I had to dig into my face to get them out
But even if it got bad a lot I could heal up and I was able to go outside usually at least once a week 

But then I ran out of hormones because an ex had bought them for me so my supply ran out And then my body got worse and worse and the plucking got worse and spread to wherever any hair was and now I'm covered in scabs and scars and even if I manage to stop digging in and heal up which can take months for both, I always have the scars no matter how hard I try and usually right before I feel I would be able to go outside I see a new hair that I have to get and ruin my face even more
I haven't been able to go outside in months
Even with make up I look horrible

My body has been falling apart even though I do my best to take care of it
Black hairs keep growing and I'm covered in scars from plucking and my teeth are chipping and my eyesight is going and I'm losing hair and what of that is fixable I won't ever be able to afford to fix

I was never well enough to work and I have other problems but luckily I'm on disability so I can get groceries delivered
What I get isn't much but I have some left over for things so that I can at least try and keep myself occupied 
My mental health suffers more when I try and save because I have nothing otherwise
I collect cards because they keep me busy because I can organise them and appreciate the art and work towards completing something

Whenever I have managed to save up for something more substantial so that I'll have more than cardboard to keep me occupied it's always been for nothing
I've always had trouble with electronics, they always get broken even though I do my best to look after everything because it's not like I have much
But it always ends up having a broken screen or something like that when it arrives and I have to get my roommate to send it back
I once saved up and starved myself for months to get a switch with help from a friend but it and the replacement I got were broken and when I was able to go outside I Went to trade it in to try and recoup some money they lowered the value two times while I was there and ended up essentially stealing Â£80 off of me, I starved myself for so long for less than nothing
I just wanted something to distract me from my life
All I do atm is organise cardboard and watch YouTube on my phone

Trying my best for nothing is a constant theme for me
I always do my best but I'm always told that I'm not or it's not good enough because I'm so useless compared to others

I got kicked out of college in my second year because I was too mentally ill ro cope there
It was almost the same with the first year but I wasn't as bad then sk I managed to scrape through and even managed to get a distinction in one module or something but apparently the level 2 qualification doesn't mean much, just a stepping stone to level 3 which I knew I wouldn't be able to handle in my state so I had to choose a different level 2 for my next year
But I guess that didn't help too much

Because my best isn't really good enough my dad always told me I needed to do better than my best and got angry at me 
Even after I got kicked out of the place supposed to prepare me for work, he still pressured me to get a job but there wasn't anything I could do, I never wanted to be like this
I can understand his frustration but it was starting to seem abusive and hostile 

My mum found out I was on hormones around that time and they're separated and live apart but she was blackmailing me trying to make me stop DIYing or she would tell my dad I'm trans

I told her I was trans a few years before that and the first thing she did was hug me and tell me I'll always be her son, and when I said 'well, not exactly' she was dismissive and that kinda set the tone for how she was about it
She wanted me to be a drag queen instead of trans and wouldn't accept my name and tried to pressure me into using one that she chose
She also did a lot of gaslighting and emotional abuse, she broke my trust every time I gave it and she was always the victim no matter what, and I always did something wrong no matter how hard i tried to be good to her
When I came out I told her she could tell a specific friend of hers because I knew she would need someone to talk to about it, but she told another one of her friends and one of my sisters as well, telling me that the other friend was moving away soon so she had to
And she used one of my sisters knowing to try and guilt trip me into letting her tell my other sister, saying it wasn't fair on her

When she tried to blackmail me I knew I needed to move away and one of my online friends had friends that could help me get to the place I am now and I was able to leave soon after

At the time I had a girlfriend in the US that I was supposed to move to be with. But she turned out to be abusive so I was left here

When I was in my first year of college I was in CAMHS who did very little to help me
They started me on antidepressants that made me get worse so I stopped them after a few months
They did manage to get me a GIC appointment at Tavistock and I got my mum to take me and she brought along the sister she told without my consent
But the whole interview seemed to revolve around how everyone else felt about me and when I said that I have anxiety because i didn't want my body to get worse (think this was before hormones) or present as male any more they said that might hold me back from getting treatment?

And my mum tried to sabotage appointments by refusing to take me unless I paid her to take me there, and she would say she'd call to say I wouldn't be able to attend an appointment and wouldn't so that the clinic would think I just didn't want help

But I managed to get a new date with the clinic but I had to wait for a letter confirmation, which they never sent
Though before that they did send a letter addressed to me or my parent/guardian to my dads address, which I didn't give them
If I was 5 minutes later to get home that day or didn't check the post they would have outed me to him

Since I moved I've had no contact with family and I won't change that

I've been moved away for over a year now
My roommate isn't a bad person even if she has some bad views but shortly after I moved in she had a lot of anger problems and at one point pushed over a bookshelf so I've always been a bit scared of her since
She's gotten a lot better and controlled since but still can't get over it
Though now she doesn't give me a lot of my own space
I have my own room but she is always knocking on the door to tell me things about things I have nothing to do with or no interest in hearing and I know she's not trying to be bad or annoying so I try to be good about it but it gets irritating because my room just feels like a communal area and I don't want that
She hasn't even let me see her room since I've moved in
And she often leans on the bed and stays in here for hours and doesn't give me personal space in that way either, it's uncomfortable
But I'm not able to say how I feel because of my avpd and because I'm scared of how she gets when she's upset

At one point I had another roommate that has now moved out for college
This year I was supposed to move out with them, I'd be in a better city that I feel would have been better for me, but nowhere would let me move in there because I'm living on disability and not a student or working
Even though they would have covered the rent and costs that housing benefits wouldn't have covered for me
I tried really hard to find a place and things could have been so good but did my best for nothing

Just under a year ago my last girlfriend visited 
She was all I had
The only human offline contact I had other than my roommate whenever she could visit
She was always so good and kind and every time she visited I had a breakdown of some sort and got ill before because I've always gotten ill before things I'm excited about and she was so supportive and good
We did lsd just after my birthday and I've always had uncomfortable trips but I'm always unhappy so at least it's a different kind of unhappy that had more to look at
But I had my first real bad trip that time and she helped me however she could throughout it and she was so good but I never really recovered and as much as I love her I couldn't love her romantically 
It feels like the bad trip took that ability away from me
It was a long time til the next visit and its harder to realise long distance so I thought it would be better when she was here
But it wasn't 
And I knew I had to tell her but it was really hard
I managed to eventually and I really hurt her, she didn't deserve to lose her partner's love
She didn't do anything wrong
She doesn't talk to me any more 
she was the person I felt the most understood by
I only have two other friends and they're online and can't speak to me as much as they used to, I'm always so lonely

I've been trying to find ways to get help but there isn't anything for me
I once attempted suicide but I didn't get enough pills to do damage down before being found by my roommate
But I got sent to hospital anyway but they said that if I kill myself it's my problem and refused any real help to me

I got put on some other antidepressants but none of them ever helped, just made me feel worse

I tried CBT but it isn't for me

I want therapy but I have no money for it, even online
I couldn't even really afford anything except my inhalers atm, and even they're a stretch sometimes

I haven't been able to go outside for months and it was the same before the last time I got out and the same before that 

The friend that knew the people that helped me move got together a small group of people in a Facebook chat to try and brainstorm ways that I can get better and I appreciate everything they did do but it's pretty obvious they gave up
They promised specific help to me and never talked to me again
I understand they do a lot for a lot of people and I'm not entitled to their help
But to do that just hurt 
My friend said that they sometimes just lose track of the people they help but ever since my friend has never brought them up or said anything to them when I'm struggling so it's pretty obvious they want nothing to do with me
But I know I'm not entitled to the help of others 
It just hurts how I got pushed to the side like nothing

That friend is going to help me get a laptop hopefully though
I used to do digital art a lot in college and I got pretty good
I've practiced for years on paper but it's always just frustrated me and I never got anywhere
But with digital art I could do what I wanted and it was easy to learn and get better
And I want to do more video editing and other stuff too, I try and learn everything I can about this sort of stuff atm and it's what I got that distinction for in college
Maybe I could even hold down a job if it was something like that 
We set up a fundraiser to help with it but only 2 people donated and I appreciate that and the people who shared it but it's still disheartening
I've sold some stuff that I didn't particularly want to sell to help towards it and I've not spent money for a while so I've not been in the best place because of that 
It trying my best but it's going to take til march to save up even with my friends help and I'm struggling enough as is
It would be for more than art because I could play games and hopefully make friends and learn more things using it so I know it will be good if I can last til I can afford it but I've sold pretty much everything I have that I can to help towards it and I've already been self harming again recently and my mental health has just been declining so much even before I started saving and selling so I don't know how much of this I can take

When I first moved here there was my first gay pride event and it wasn't too big but I was excited to see what it was going to be like
But less than five minutes into arriving I got spit on by someone there
And that was a long time before all of the people chanting homophobic stuff rampaged in
Was just another person in what is supposed to be community that felt like I wasn't supposed to be there
Not the first time I got spit on but it hurt the most

I don't want to detransition and I don't think I could go back but I don't think I can live as myself with my body and my mind and the world like this

I don't know what to do

I feel like I've lost almost everything 

All my friends do is say 'hugs' and when I ask what I should do they say they don't know
Whenever they try and help me think of things I can do with my time I've had a long time to think about all this so there isn't anything I haven't thought of that I can't do for whatever reason

I've tried getting help in every way I can but there isn't anything for someone like me
I do my best to help myself but my best was never good enough for anything 

I'm probably missing a lot of stuff but I've already written way too much

I'm sorry I've written so much and I'm sorry I'm complaining and whining so much I just feel like I have nothing and that life is attacking me from all angles and I've always tried to be a good person even if I didn't always succeed so I don't understand why my life is like this and I would just really appreciate any help I don't want to live like this I feel like I'm in prison and I don't want this life any more
I'm sorry
Thank you
