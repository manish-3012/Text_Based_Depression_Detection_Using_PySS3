Overdose.Just leaving, forever.
Nobody should ever have to deal with me again.
I have nothing.
No love.
No friends.
Nothing.
There is no hope for me, the Earth, and reality itself.
There is nothing.
I am a slave to the chemicals in my brain, and to everyone else.
I am nothing.
We are nothing.
There is no hope, even at 15. I will never be happy, no matter how much I try.
Mentor, therapist, even medication. I am still shit. I am nothing, I don't deserve to live. People do not and should not deal with me.
