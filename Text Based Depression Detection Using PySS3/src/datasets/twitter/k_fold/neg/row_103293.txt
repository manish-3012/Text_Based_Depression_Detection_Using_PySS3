Lonely and just fed up to fuckIâ€™m just so lonely, I have like 2 irl friends and theyâ€™re always busy, so when nobodyâ€™s around I get lonely and Iâ€™m already depressed as heck. Got a knife and a rope in the same room. I think Iâ€™m destined to die by suicide. If you have lots of friends and company please be grateful for it, cause when you donâ€™t have any it eats you alive.
