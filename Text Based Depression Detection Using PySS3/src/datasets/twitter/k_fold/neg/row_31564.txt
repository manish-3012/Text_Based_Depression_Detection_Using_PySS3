Summer InternshipsI have been applying to summer internships for months now and have had a lot of interviews but no job offer. I applied to a job posting Monday that was posted last Thursday \[4/2/20\] that I felt confident about as my resume aligned with all of their wants for a intern, but today I saw that the job was "no longer accepting applications" and now I think that the they went with another candidate, but the posting had only been up for 7 days and I saw that they edited the posting on Monday so they must have been considering candidates at least until Monday so that was only Monday to Thursday 3 days to find and interview a candidate and choose them? That is a extremely fast turnaround. That makes no sense to me and I feel like I am at my breaking point with everything as I feel like everything is going wrong.
