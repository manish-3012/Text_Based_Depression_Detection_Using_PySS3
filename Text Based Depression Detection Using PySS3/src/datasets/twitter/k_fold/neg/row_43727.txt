what's this?I feel like sadness is the key to opening up to my happiness, It's the sad moments that help me understand my happy ones. Yet still life lately seems like it's a circle of sad events but as I grow up I realize that happiness is an extremely uneventful subject. Faking a smile and stuff like that used to be something I read on we heart it and think to myself "I am so sad, I fake a smile, I hate the world" and years later I catch myself faking a smile and holding tears back when I am alone. People ask me if I am okay and the casual "I am okay" comes up naturally and almost robotically from my mouth, when social media and my day to day life make me feel emptier and emptier and my odd attraction to self destructive poetry have made me realize that I am stupid. My teacher told me that "people with depression have the time to be depressed, I don't, cause I have a family to feed!" and I thought that because of my ignorance I let myself feel sad as a natural response to choices I made wrong. I also have a heavy chest when I am sad like I am unable to breath properly.
