21 Balding and 5'6-5'7 is there any hope?I think I'm just posting this to vent mainly. I go through cycles where near the end of every two months I get depressed about this, especially balding. I mean the balding stuff is looking more promising in the coming 3-4 years with the stuff that's coming out in Japan. In the mean time I just study and go gym, going to start dieting so that I can get a greater benefit. I don't think I'm really ugly I just need to lose bodyfat, i'm hovering around 23% the thing is I need my hair to look somewhat decent. I've started rogaine around 2 months ago and I think I can see some small hairs coming out around me temples. I probably have a few years before I go fully bald, hopefully Japan will release their treatments by then. That's what keeps me going. Any advice will be appreciated.
