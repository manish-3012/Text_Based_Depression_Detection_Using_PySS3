waking up to sleep againI am a 20 year old college student at a pretty good university. School has never been hard for me, and I'm pretty financially secure for when I exit. I have lost all interests in things that used to make me happy. Nothing makes me happy anymore and I don't even have the will to go to any of my classes anymore. I find myself waking up every morning and passing the time until I go back to bed. Repeat, every day. I know I don't have the problems of 99 percent of the people on here but I just don't see why I should even be living at this point. I feel so hollow inside.
