Suicidal in Los Angeles. I need someone to go to.I am 18 years old. Female. I graduate high school in May. My parents are abusive. My only means of transportation is my boyfriend's car.

I have a doctor who prescribes me anti-depressants. She might not be open tomorrow. I already called her today.

I am having suicidal thoughts where I think I might kill myself as soon as tomorrow. I don't have a lot of money but I need a doctor to help me so I do not do it.
