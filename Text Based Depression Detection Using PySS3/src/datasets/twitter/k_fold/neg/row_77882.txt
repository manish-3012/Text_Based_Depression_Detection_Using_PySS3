"Dream about a good life, wake up tight cus it's back to this shit"I just heard this and it hit me so hard. I hate this life. I can't continue. I feel so weak. It's not like I have a shitty life. My mental health is crazy. I can't fucking stop the voices and the emotions. I have multiple people inside me it feels like. I can't fucking function. I stay in my house sometimes for more than 23 hours a day. I've lost my fucking mind. I don't have the strength to continue. I want to kill myself. But I can't. Because I'm scared. I can't follow through with it. I want to so badly. I'm killing myself by destroying myself. I'm seeing a therapist but... who knows. Who the fuck knows. Life is miserable. I'm basically making my life as miserable as I can until I kill myself. Goodbye.
