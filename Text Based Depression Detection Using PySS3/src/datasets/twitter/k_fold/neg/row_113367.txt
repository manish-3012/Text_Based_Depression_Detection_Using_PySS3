Dear Debra,Hey Debra. I just wanted to say, **fuck you**. 

Throughout my entire life, you have never been there for me. When I told you I thought I had depression, you comforted me temporarily but then ignored it and moved on. When I told you I tried to commit suicide, you didn't even comfort me. When I told you I was trans, you just brushed it off. 

When I went to the hospital, I realized how fucked up this shit is. You have neglected me.

You made up so many excuses as to why you couldn't do this or that just to get drunk off your ass. Even when I was in the hospital a few weeks ago, "I was out of town". You think you are so fucking slick but I'm here to tell you **you aren't**. 

You were supposed to be my mom, not some random alcoholic woman with who I don't even want a relationship. You can take your sorry ass and go ruin someone else's life. 

Fuck you, from Jax

P.S. and you wonder why I don't feel comfortable around you

P.S.S. I swear to **whatever fucking god or deity out there** if you don't take care of my two sweet pets I will make you **pray** that you and your "little" addiction had never existed
