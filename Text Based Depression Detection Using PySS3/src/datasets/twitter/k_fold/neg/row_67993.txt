Screaming into the voidThings finally seemed like they were going well, but here I am, back in the same place Iâ€™ve always been. Depression has become such a part of me that I donâ€™t know how to live without it. Iâ€™m well intentioned, but everyone finds me annoying and I have very few people left in my life because it. On top of that, I have all of the pieces to live a good full life, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be able to put them together. Iâ€™m a disappointment to myself and everyone around me. I donâ€™t want to kill myself, but I dearly wish I could stop existing. I wish this life had never happened to me.
