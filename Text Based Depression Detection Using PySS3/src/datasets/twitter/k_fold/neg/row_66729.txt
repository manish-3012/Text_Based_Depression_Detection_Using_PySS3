relapsewhy report something if thereâ€™s no action i can take to begin with? why claim that you report this sort of behavior to make students feel more safe and yet do NOTHING that could actually help me?

the situation was awful enough without false hope. now all i feel is even more powerless. 

harassing me telling me to kill myself wasnâ€™t even enough for them. there are images on instagram with my face cut out, captions saying iâ€™m fake and toxic, that she wanted to edit her photos to pretend she was with her real friends. to anyone who browses her or my account, they are clearly all referencing me, and despite trying to report all of it, nothing seems to be done. and i feel so sick. 

i canâ€™t describe how much it hurts to literally be bullied right out in the open, pictures of you right out there, and have everyone be congratulating and supporting the person posting it in the comments. i wouldnâ€™t even know how to share my side of the story if i tried. 

i got home today and wrote a suicide note. i cut myself all over my leg, tried to some on my neck, and then passed out on the floor. i still wish iâ€™d done it. not just over this,  thereâ€™s so much more thatâ€™s happened to me, but this feels like one more final straw that i honestly just canâ€™t handle.

i only wish iâ€™d done more.
