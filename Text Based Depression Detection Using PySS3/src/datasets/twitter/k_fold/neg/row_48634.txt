Am I different...???So let me start by saying I don't mean to offend anyone else, or imply that anyone else's struggles aren't real.  I guess everyone has their own story.. and I'm just wondering if there are others like me.

First of all, I'm an 50 y/o male that pretty much has a perfect life.  Beautiful wife, two amazingly well\-rounded successful kids, luxurious home in the suburbs with a great career.  So here comes the unintentional offensive part \- I feel that for me to have all this and then be suicidal is REAL depression.  It's almost like... well, if you're down on your luck, confused teenager, lost twentysomething, unsuccessful, unloved \- yeah, I get it, you hate your life.  But I have all things that I believe people look for and yet I feel so unworthy, useless, undeserving and I just cannot see light at the end of the tunnel.  

I can't stand myself and the ridiculous person that I am.  I literally cannot stand to be with myself \- how does you get away from yourself???  I don't see an end or solution to my self loathing and that only makes it more hopeless...  Yes, my family and loved ones are what keep me grounded today but all I do is hope for an opportunity where I am given permission or don't have as many people dependent on me.  I long to be "allowed" to end my life without consequence.

Again, I am trying to be offensive but I just don't relate to a lot of the posts on here...  guess I'm looking for some comfort and support from like minded people.
