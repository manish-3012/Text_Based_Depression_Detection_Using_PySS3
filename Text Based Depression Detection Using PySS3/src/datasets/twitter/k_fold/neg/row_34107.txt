At the end of my rope, I can't handle anymore of 2017I don't want to get into too many details about why I'm in this position because they don't really matter. All I know is that every week of 2017 has brought new bullshit and I'm at the end of my rope of dealing with it. I've tried medication for my depression, but the insurance is so fucked up in my state I basically can't stay with one doctor to figure out what even helps me. Nothing at the moment helps because I basically have nothing left to care about. 
I don't want to survive for much longer but I don't know how to go through with it.
