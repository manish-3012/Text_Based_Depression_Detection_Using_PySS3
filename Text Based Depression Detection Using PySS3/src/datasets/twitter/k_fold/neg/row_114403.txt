The fruit of the womb you cursed remains cursedFor a long time I enthusiastically looked forward to the day I could joyously exclaim â€œThe fruit of the womb you cursed now reaps many blessingsâ€ Iâ€™ve finally come to accept the fact that day will simply never come. The all-encompassing peace death brings will be my one and only blessing, but at least it will be a glorious one.
