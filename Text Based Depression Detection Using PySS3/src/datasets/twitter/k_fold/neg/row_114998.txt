Suicide has been on my mind frequently.I don't know if I want to die, yet, but it sure sounds appealing.  I've written out a pro/con list and right now it isn't looking great.  

I told my husband of 21 years this morning that I wanted to kill myself.  He said nothing.  I told him I'm tired of picking up the pieces.  Of never having the finances to do anything with our lives because he made mistakes that lead to felonies which ultimately has prevented him from finding honest work that pays the bills and allows for the opportunities to live.  I've had to give up everything I love because we've been on hard times for an eternity.  From an understanding wife standpoint, I've been more than patient as he finds himself and puts time between his past, but I'm tired of seeing everyone live around me, while I have to figure out what I may have to pawn this time around.  I'm smart but I'm depressed.  Worse than ever.  Help me find the strength to make it through the week.
