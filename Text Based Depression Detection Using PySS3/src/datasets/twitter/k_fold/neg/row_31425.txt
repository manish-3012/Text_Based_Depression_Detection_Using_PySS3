A story about two peopleSo in my last post on here I had said I would be dead on the 21 st Which is tomorrow for me but last night I hit a very dark spot and decided to head for the railway. I brought a small tent like I all ways do just in case I talk my self out of it. But last night was different (I have seen people kill them selfs before where I walk the tracks at night I have seen 3 out of the 7 suicides had happened on this corner of the track most use the old willow tree to reach out and touch the 2 high voltage power line cables that run over head for the trains. but still the tree stands and there are still no cameras put up in place to try and stop people) I come across a girl last night she is 21 years old will I was walking the tracks she had fallen asleep when I walked up to her and waking her and having a hr or so talking I had convinced her to get of the track (10 minutes later a coal train come) I felt kinder happy because that night no one died and at the same time I had saved a life I think so after a few hrs talking we explained our life storyâ€™s to one and other and after that things started to get weird between us at this point she started to undress and I wonâ€™t go on but we had sex (I personal donâ€™t know if it was because we felt pity for one and other or if it was true feels for one and other I just donâ€™t know i never had the talent of being able to tell peopleâ€™s feelings thatâ€™s why I only had one girlfriend in my life) a few hrs had passed and we heard police sirens coming through the bush at this time it was close to 4 am when the cops showed up  both of us where taken away and sent to hospital I passed my mental illness test like I all ways do I have had a thing for lying to doctors and other people of that nature so I was let out in 5 hrs of being put in hospital. Her on the other head just got out itâ€™s now 7:30 pm I donâ€™t know what will happen once she gets here we might head back to the tracks and die together or we might just leave and head as far away from this part of Australia as possible. Other wise I donâ€™t mind I have nothing here for me and family is a joke in my opinion well my family is anyways. Thanks for letting me share this for some unknown reason I felt like I had to get this of my chest and my mind.
