Secretly wish my mom would die so I could kill myselfI've been fighting depression my entire life and am about to the breaking point. Something in my brain has made me into an outsider who continues to look on as people have these happy social lives yet refuse to let me in. I don't blame them.... I must be a miserable person to be around. I try SO hard to be happy and to put on a smile for the world because I don't have the energy to explain why I'm so unhappy to them. I used to be happy....or perhaps I was just better at fooling the world and myself? These days I struggle to wake up in the morning.

I gave up drinking alcohol and have been sober over 6 years now, but being a 32(M) this has basically made my options for social life to "hang" online in MMO's or hang out with the old folks at AA. I hang out at work with some cool people and hear as they all plan to get together after work at the bar, but guess who NEVER gets invited? I had to get sober because when my father passed away in 2008 I made a promise to him on his death bed that I would "take care of mom". My mother has since had a hell of a time coping with the loss. Now to add to the flame, she has been diagnosed with dementia and I'm the only one (of 4 siblings) who is able or willing to do the necessary care work for her. I'm also the youngest, so despite what I do or how I do things, it's always wrong according to my family. I've had to section off this judgement (inside myself) so as not to go insane, but this past year the hypocrisy from my family (Let alone what's going on in society) has me just EMPTY. My mother also suffers from depression and the loss of my father has compounded this to where she has never rebounded. I mostly put on a smile for her sake because my old goal was to make her happy, now I'm simply content to make her smile. I often hear from her, "I wish I had died instead of your father" or "I want to kill myself" and at first I would do anything to comfort her, but now I often find myself having to walk away when i begin to think "THEN JUST DIE ALREADY SO I CAN KILL MYSELF!!!"
