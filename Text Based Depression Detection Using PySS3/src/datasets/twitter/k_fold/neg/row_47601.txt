Fed Up, Snapped in PublicI just fucking lost it in public today, I started screaming and kicking over shopping carts. I even yelled at a few people for **NOT** hitting me with their car and letting me die. I don't give a shit if people think I'm fucking crazy. They can look on and judge, but they'll do nothing to fucking help anyway so fuck them. I'm sick and tired of living like this, and I can't keep it to myself anymore. I tried going out, I felt like shit sitting at home, so I went out to Starbucks to work on some projects(because after all, coding skills are **SO** valuable in the job market, which why I have a 6 figure salary, amirite?). Still felt like shit afterwards, and I just snapped.

The past few days have been the worst for my depression, I have consistently felt like shit. I've barely eaten, and I've gotten into a bad argument with my mom. I don't want to live anymore, I'm so sick and tired of going through the same shit day after day. I'm sick of the false hope I get whenever I get called for a job interview, just to feel worse a week later when I don't get the position. I'm also just sick of hating myself for being such a miserable failure. I can't even find joy when a woman notices me, since I gave up on pursuing relationships years ago due to being too insecure and fucked in the head. Yeah, I went nuts yesterday because a woman creepily payed attention to me, which I detailed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/884luw/had_a_fit_of_self_hatred_this_morning/). I know it sounds pathetic and stupid, but it happened and I feel even worse knowing that it did. 

I don't care anymore, I seriously want to purposely sabotage my life so at least **I** can say that I fucked things up, not that I tried and failed. Then when I truly hit rock bottom, I won't have any excuse NOT to kill myself.
