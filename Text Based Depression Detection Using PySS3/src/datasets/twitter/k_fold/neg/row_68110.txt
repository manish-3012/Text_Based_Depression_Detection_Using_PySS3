I don't want to die in my sleep.Everyone says they wish they could just die peacefully in their sleep, but I don't. When I die I want to be awake and I want it to be painful because:

a) I deserve to die slowly and painfully, and

b) I want to know what's happening, if I die in my sleep I'm afraid I'll miss it.

That is all. Good night everyone.
