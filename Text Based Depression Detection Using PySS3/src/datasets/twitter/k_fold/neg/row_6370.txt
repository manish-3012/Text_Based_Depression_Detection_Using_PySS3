I don't really know what to doIn the 16 i have been alive i haven't had any type of feeling except horrible aches in every part of my body because of the endless stress of my life. All this have ended into a multiple personality disorder that make me feel even worst. Because of my lack of emphaty i cannot know how the rest of the people feel and my mind changing all the time makes me loose all the relationships i have and makes my friends stay further from me, just because they are frightened of one of my personalities of which i am afraid too. I have done horrible things that i couldnt avoid because i just cannot control myself. Every day that personality possesses me more and more and that is why i want to stop living, i dont want to become that thing and i dont have a lot of time until I loose completely the control of my body.
