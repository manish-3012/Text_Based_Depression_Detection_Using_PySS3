I feel like running away and never stopping.Itâ€™s not that the thoughts ever stopped but they got better. I managed to get them under control.  I feel so out of control of those suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™m really trying to ignore them, but theyâ€™ve got a grip on me. Iâ€™m 15 and Iâ€™ve dealt with suicidal thoughts my whole life, but for the past couple of years these thoughts are a lot more tempting, especially the ones that have decided to pop back two days ago. I just want a place out of my mind. I want to die.
