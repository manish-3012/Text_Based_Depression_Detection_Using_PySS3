I want to live. I want it so bad. But I canâ€™t keep going anymore. I need help.Iâ€™m exhausted. Just exhausted. I have severe OCD and itâ€™s just taking over my life. Everything is a mess. My apartment is a mess. My bills are overdue because I forget to pay them. I have no food at home because I forget to buy it. I canâ€™t keep up. Showering, getting dressed, everything just takes so long because of rituals. Everything is a chore. Everything is overdue. I just canâ€™t keep up. It sounds so ridiculous, but I even considered looking up if a life coach or maybe Occupational Therapy would be an option for me. Iâ€™ve tried CBT and antidepressants for the OCD, but nothing worked. My insurance isnâ€™t great, so I canâ€™t afford to keep trying different things and Iâ€™m limited to the little thatâ€™s available in my network. But Iâ€™ve gotten to the point that all I do is go to work and sleep. I donâ€™t have enough hours in the day to do everything I need to do, and that just completely depletes me of energy to do anything. Iâ€™ve stopped talking to most people. My communication with the people who I still talk to is limited. Everything around me is overdue and dirty and messy. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. And for the past few weeks Iâ€™ve been getting used to the idea of just ending it. I really donâ€™t want to. But I see no other way out. 

What arenâ€™t I thinking of? There must be something I can do. Some tangible goal that I can break down unto manageable tasks that can help me start to feel in control of my life? I have no idea. My brain is sick and trying to kill me, so obviously I canâ€™t think of any possible solutions that I havenâ€™t tried before and failed. For the past weeks I have even been having dreams where I am walking around and I see billboards telling me to kill myself. Last night I had a dream where I was talking to a therapist and there was a painting on their wall that said â€œjust end itâ€. I have so much love to give. I donâ€™t want to die. But the pain just doesnâ€™t stop. So I figured asking other peopleâ€™s perspectives may help. I once heard that â€œyou canâ€™t think your way out of a thinking problem.â€ So here I am, asking for some advice. Any advice.
