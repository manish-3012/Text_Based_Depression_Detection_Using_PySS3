Does it feel like you're burning on the inside, too?Life's a bitch, nothing new here I guess.

I've gotten in one of the worst arguments I ever had with my mother. I live in her house, and she basically told me that my condition is only on me for doing nothing every day, and that it's not her fault if I want to die. She doesn't want to understand/listen to me, yet she wants me to constantly understand her, because "she's normal, she doesn't need to get to my level". I don't know what I want to make of my life, I don't know what to do right now, I feel constantly alone and the last time I tried to get a diploma was the time I was the closest to end my life. I fear that I'll end up in this state again if I try to leave my mother's house, and staying there's almost like decaying alive.

I'm trying my hardest (searching for job ideas, setting appointments with psychologists), yet I can't feel that I'm making any progress. On the contrary, I feel like it's already too late for me.

Anyway. I took a nap between the argument and now because I felt drained from the conversation, but now I feel like my insides are on fire. 

Is it due to stress, or is it something else?
