Is this a crisis?I've been crying for around two hours. Stabbed my arm and wrist a few times with a blade. I used to self-harm, but I haven't in four years. Head feels like it will explode. I posted earlier in /r/relationship_advice, that's what's initially pushed me to get so worked up. Now, I'm feeling flooded by the conclusion I always come to - that the only thing I see in my future is that I'm going to kill myself.


My partner has been kind. Made me milky tea (usually calms me down), brought dinner to my room (it's 9pm here). But I think he's kind of over my episodes like this? As he's in the lounge socialising with our housemate who I posted about in /r/relationship_advice. I don't want to ruin his night with how I feel. When I told him I was having suicidal thoughts, he said something along the lines of "this happens every month". It just kind of solidifies the fears in my head  that I will never be loved because my depression is just so bad and an inconvenience.


I know I can call my mum and she'll pick me up but I don't want to worry her.


I just need validation that it's okay to be sad, and what I should think about doing?
