I want to die, but not reallyI don't have a compelling reason. I just get tired of feeling this. I know my family and few friends love me, and imagining what they would be through when I'm gone makes me sad. I don't deserve their love, but maybe I want to give them what they deserve. 

Maybe, after 2 years I would stop wanting to die. Maybe 2 years of enduring my suicidal thoughts is worth it, compared to the lifetime of pain my loved ones would have if I disappear.
