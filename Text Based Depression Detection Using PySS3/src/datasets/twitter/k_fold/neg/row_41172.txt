Rant. Dont care if this is read or notfrom the bottom of my soul i am tired. ive always been depressed but as an adult this is just weighing me down. i make money to do things i always wanted to do but now i just dont have the energy. im either sleeping, working, or drinking. always told myself id never be an addict but here i am. following my mothers footsteps. how does one find happiness? ill never know.
