ApathyI may have gone insane, or perhaps I've reached enlightenment. I've no inclination to do anything besides what my impulse tells me to, I seek stimuli, but this worlds conventional suppository wont cut it.

I unironically would love to see this world burn, seeing people die filled with despair makes me feel euphoric; It's like a breath of fresh air, cathartic . I want to go out in the most torturous and inhumane way possible, I want to savor every last moment of my last breaths on this earth. Let me know if you can make it happen.
