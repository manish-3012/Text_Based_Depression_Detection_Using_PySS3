i don't know what I became, but I just want to end it.I'm on a throwaway since I don't want my main account to be burdened with person stuff...


I've had depression since I was 8(I'm currently turning 15) and over that period of time, I've always wanted to end my life during countless times of counseling, my medication being changed, and life just being all around bad...recently, however, after I've stopped that....I'm now returning to it...except this time...much more closer to actually doing it...I've changed since I was happy for once...I'm more complaintive, I'm more annoying to everyone, barely any friends since I left a school to go to another one, and I rather just be alone...and being denied for so many things and feeling like i'm a burden on everyone else is finally getting to me....I don't know what to do next....I don't want to sleep anymore so I can just stay home and not do anything with my life which is what I seem to be doing everyday now...Right now I'm currnetly contemplating my options for suicide,but I still have a small hope that I  could turn this around...I just don't know what to do next...
