I keep calling crisis lines and I still don't feel better.I'm trying so hard but I just can't kick this feeling of wanting to die. I am seriously thinking about suicide and I can't stop thinking about it. I am not considered to be "cool" but that's not the most of my problems. I am treated with such disrespect by people I care about and nobody takes my feelings in to account. I am always written off as being "too sensitive" and I am just dismissed. Everyone wants to know what's wrong, nobody wants to help. Everyone just wants to go on and live their lives and leave me behind unless they want something. I am so pathetic that I give them what they want just so they'll pay attention to me for that little bit. I am so pathetic and when I try to stand up for myself and be strong, people tell me I'm being bitchy. I'm so sick of dealing with this on a daily basis I just want to end it. I don't know why I'm typing this. I guess I just want to get it off my chest.
