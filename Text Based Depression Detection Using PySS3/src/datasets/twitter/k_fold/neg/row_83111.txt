Haven't responded in ahwile.I just have thoughts so it's not bad but I think I'm about to tell my girlfriend I have some thoughts about suicide sometimes. I just want advice if I should tell someone else like my best friend because my gf suffers from depression and I feel that be hard on her especially on top of her successful lifestyle that she deals with. I'm okay I'd just like to atleast get it out that I have suicidle tendencies. I hope I dont sound like an idiot.
