Everything hurts! :) ( Extreme vent )Yes, I feel wonderful.
Every breath, every thought is haunted by an immense feeling of despair, loneliness and guilt. The pain I feel lies so deep within, makes my chest feel so tight and pierced as though I might fain any second. I AM TIRED OF IT.

Is anyone remotely interested in what crosses my mind?
Let's start off simple : I absolutely, from head to my toes, despise every cell I am made out of. No blade, no bullet that would cut through my flesh would be enough pain for someone like me. 

( warning, messy vent and really angry )

I wish someone would have abused me. Why, you fucking pricks, were you too afraid to abuse me? Why couldn't I have been kicked, hit, starved?? Why could my father hit my mother, but not me???? Why did she have to stick around? I WANT TO SCREAM. It's eating me up. I wanted to be a bruised, swollen, crying child!! All you could fucking do was SHOUT. Why is that ugly bitch called mother here? YOU DESTROYED MY LIFE. YOU PROTECTED ME, GAVE ME LOVE AND ATTENTION AND I GREW DULL, SPOILED, ARROGANT. I SHOULD HAVE BEEN WEEPING ON THE FLOOR, DROWNING IN MY OWN BLOOD. But !!! Of course not. I hate you. I hate hate hate you. I could've lived up to my miserable state. I want to burn everything. I am a mess. FUCK FUCK FUCK YOU!!! Loving family my ASS. Don't make me vomit. I only want to cry!!! YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME DIE. WHY SHOUT IF YOU CAN HIT? This is bothering me so much!!!! I want to cry!!!   Every laughter, plate of food, hug, toy, ALL TOO MUCH. I want to forget the good memories. I don't deserve them. I only wanted pain. Why????? Why you dumb bitch??? You should've been an alcoholic too!!! I want to die die die. The shame and guilt keeps nagging. I want to stop thinking. Reality hurts. Please... WHY COULDNT I HAVE BEEN HIT AS WELL? I. HATE. YOU. Look at what I am now!!! AT LEAST BE CONSISTENT.

Maybe I just want to be tragic and honorable? Who the fuck knows? I'll fucking kill myself.
My day is full of mental pain, for no good fucking reason.
