Reoccurring Suicidal Thoughts**Background/Intro**

As a background, I've never really had any history with mental health except for the time in 6th grade when I gave up on myself, and stopped trying with my schoolwork. I felt so ashamed with myself, but my parents were very supportive and helped me get through that time. Ever since then, I started taking care of myself, and my schoolwork, which has made me pretty happy throughout the years. 

But now that summer's over, I'm going to be starting college soon. Everyone asks me if I'm excited, but I'm not really. I honestly feel like I'm just overthinking, and once I get adjusted , I'll feel better. But for now I've just been feeling down about a lot of stuff. 

 

**Part-Time Job**

I've never handled change really well. This summer, I got a part time job. I got to meet a lot of wonderful people, and I got super used to the routine. I also built a PC with outside help, which was very exciting. And overall spending time with the people I care about made me feel really happy.

**College**

A part of me is excited about college and beginning my major as a computer scientist. However, I am starting to doubt myself and my capabilities. I've done good in math, but never superb like Lindsey Lohan in Mean Girls. Also since I had full-time job for most of summer, I procrastinated a lot of my school's orientation/new student duties out the window because I was working all the time, so I literally crammed absolutely everything I had to do in the last month. This made me feel stressed, unprepared, and disappointment with myself.

**Self-Disappointment** 

I simply feel lazy. Ever since I've quit my job (Quit so I could focus on school when it started), I've just been staying up late, sleeping in, eating, slowly finishing up the rest of my orientation work, and whatnot. I went to the doctor's for an appointment, and they said I am now 8 pounds more from my usual weight. I tell myself and everyone around me I'm just relaxing before school, but I feel really guilty and selfish. So I think I'm gonna start biking outside everyday.

**Parents**

As I'm starting college, I'm also a new chapter in my life. And that means I'm getting older and my parents are too. Being so close with my parents, I cannot imagine a world without them. I tell them pretty much everything and they comfort me when I feel down. But I've just been thinking a lot this month, and it's so hard to think that my parents probably won't be there for long to see my children if I ever do decide to have children near my late 20's/early 30's.

**Friendships**

It doesn't help that I am obsessive over friends as a whole. It's a big secret of mine, but I just feel uneasy and doubtful of people having dealt with several bad friendships in the past couple of years I"m definitely wary of people. I'm not trying to be edgy here, but I truly will get myself pretty anxious and nervous over stupid shit because I feel doubtful. Even checking up to see if they're lying, or not. 

**Conclusion**

I came up with an idea a couple weeks ago that if I were to kill myself, I wouldn't have to grow up, or experience the death of my parents. I'd never have to face the responsibilities of adulthood.

 I was just feel sad and disappointed with myself at the time. I know I would never kill myself, or ever harm myself physically because I hate gore. But the thoughts don't go away. I'll feel good for a couple days, but then I'll continue to keep beating myself up over the same things. Repeating the same loop of self-doubt and sadness.  

I'm sorry that this is messy and it sounds silly. I felt like I just needed to tell someone instead of writing my thoughts in bullet points on a google doc. Anyways, I made loose titles for each paragraph.
