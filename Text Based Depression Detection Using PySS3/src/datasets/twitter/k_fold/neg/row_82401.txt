The thought of living for several more years depresses me...Before I talk, some context: I am 16, and it probably seems like I don't really have depression or am faking for attention, but have been diagnosed with clinical derpression and am on meds. 

Exams are soon, and since around a month ago I have been fed up. Life is an endless cycle of getting up, working and going to bed. Once exams are over, I will eventually have to study for more, and then more after that. Every day I will have to go to school and study - nothing changes, it's all the same words in a different way. Then I get a job, and it will be the same routine every day: get up, work, eat food, play video game, go to bed. Rinse and repeat. Nothing is enjoyable any more because it's all so old and recognisable. Even things I used to love, like playing the cello, have no appeal. 

I feel devoid of emotion - even though I have not started a job yet, I feel like an animal pacing around its cage, hoping to discover some exciting new part of the cage that I have never seen before, but that's impossible. I am trapped in this same old cage I know so well forever. I also feel like an animal in the sense that nobody cares about your feelings when you are working - you are just an insignificant pawn in a bigger scheme and have no free will - you can't just break free and frolic in the fields like a wild creature, you are stuck doing labour whether you like it or not, like a horse pulling a carriage, or an elephant in the circus.

What's the point of bothering to get up if nothing will ever change and life becomes a grey routine? What's the point in trying if I will have to keep living the same mediocre existence for another 50 years until I have had all the life sucked out of me from this mind numbing monotonous routine we all have to do? If this is what life is like, I genuinely think I am better off dead.
