I don't know how to fix my life.My life over the last 2 years has been difficult. I was at university studying for my degree in second year. But I got mugged at knifepoint by 2 people outside my accommodation. After that I found it hard to leave my house. My partner at the time bullied me about it because I was weak for letting myself get mugged. And weak for being affected afterwards. I was diagnosed with PTSD. Shortly after I had switched courses and just before starting my partner cheated on me, dumped me, then made false claims that I was harassing her to the police. I was arrested one morning at 6am and was later released at 3am the next morning. All charges were dropped and my ex was later charged for making false allegations. It was the start of my new course and my mental health had gotten to a point were I didn't leave my room for months. I don't remember much about that time apart from occasionally getting a take away because I was too scared and paranoid to leave my house. I went home and left university for good after that at around February last year. Since then I've gotten various minimum wage jobs and my life feels terrible. I don't have any friends and I don't speak to anyone apart from my family, i still have panic attacks about my ex, about being mugged, about the police showing up to arrest me again. I feel as though I can't go on like this. My life is ruined in every way. I can't go back to uni, I'm alone, I'm depressed, I'm anxious all the time, my dreams will never come true, I want to be a tattoo artist but I'm struggling to draw lately. I just exist. I've attempted several times last year but didn't succeed. Lately I've stopped trying. I feel like I'm waiting for death. Nothing can fix how I feel. Nothing can fix my life.
