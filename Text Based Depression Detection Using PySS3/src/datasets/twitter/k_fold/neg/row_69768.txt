25 and my body is broken I can't imagine what I'll be like in 10 let alone 40 yearsIm 25 y/o male and the past 6 months I've had pain in my hands and fingers develop so badly I barely finished my pharmacy degree, developed foot pain that I can no longer run and get sharp pain just WALKING. Now my knees, hips, elbows, neck and back ache. Everything is such a mission.

This disease has taken away everything I love. I can't do mma anymore, can't do any sports, physiotherapy and swimming hurts me for God's sake. I JUST WANT TO TYPE WITHOUT PAIN is that so much to ask? I had to quit my dream job after 7.5 years of study, I never even got the chance to work full time. I would have been a millionaire in 2 years due to opportunities given to me when I was able bodied. I gave up my social life, sports and relationships to get that job and now I give it up for pain.

Now all my savings are gone, my social life is shit. I can't even play playstation as a distraction because my hands are screwed. My parents think I should 'just be more active'. My gf loves me but I don't wanna burden her anymore, she should just leave me. I want her to because at the moment I feel like she's the only thing keeping me from taking my life. I want to get a hotel fill the bathtub with Ice and end it, at least my organs will be helpful to someone. 

I tried doing uber even and my fucking hamstrings developed tendonitis.

I used to want to be an mma fighter, a rich entrepreneur and be surrounded by beautiful women then as I deteriorated, I just wanted to get married and work full time and raised a family. Now it seems that is not even in the cards.

I was blessed with everything to make it, except for good joints and I'm so bitter about that. 

Tl;dr disease has taken everything, just want to die now.
