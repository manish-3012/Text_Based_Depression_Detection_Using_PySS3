Please help meI'm (21M) on the edge right now. I need someone to talk to. I don't need advice or anything - I have a therapist for that, but someone to vent to for a minute or two since I won't have a session for a week and I feel like ending it tonight. Preferably someone who has a post history and isn't a troll. 

Mods feel free to delete this, if I'm a lost redditor.
