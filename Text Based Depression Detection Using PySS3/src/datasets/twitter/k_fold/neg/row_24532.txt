I'm fuckedIt's my first semester of college and I was severely underprepared for this. As it looks I have a final essay to write in 10 days(which isn't too bad). But by the looks of it the only way for me to pass my physics class is with a 100% on the final. Which is impossible. I feel like an absolute failure. I have no idea what to do.
