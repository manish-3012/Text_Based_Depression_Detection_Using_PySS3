Feel like giving upI am a failure. All my life I would study study study constantly, and I was a straight A student until grade 11 when I left home and became homeless. Then I met this guy and he fucking pimped me out and took my money. I ended up finishing high school and onto university but Iâ€™m so fucked. I make enemies wherever I go. I feel like an attention seeker. I wish I could just go and die somewhere where no one would ever find my body. Iâ€™ve tried to OD in the past but it never worked. Iâ€™m alone I have no friends to hang out with. My family hates me. I canâ€™t even work my fucking job without having panic attacks and feeling like Iâ€™m gonna cry. Iâ€™m such a fuck up and all I want is to kill myself. Iâ€™m fat, ugly, mean and stupid. Theres  no point to life anyways weâ€™re all gonna die eventually. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can hold on I know Iâ€™ll never feel any happiness again so why bother.
