I'm a mistakeThere is no reason I should be alive. I'm short and ugly and stupid and worthless. I really hate myself , and yet every time I have tried to kill myself something stops me. So far I've been living for other people, but now certain people have left  me and shown that they truly don't care. No one cares about me. Why should they? I'm annoying and bothersome and stupid and a bore to be around. I should have never been born
