passively wanting to goI've been stuck in a rut for around a decade. i used to be wildly suicidal and actively trying to hurt myself (alcoholism, reckless driving) but now that im older but still stuck in the same unchangeable situation it's becoming a dull ache i dont even try anymore i just hope it happens accidentally i daydream of car crashes, oven explosions, drowning idk if its an improvement or another facet of giving up
