There are people whose lives are significantly worse than mine, but most of them don't even consider suicideI feel like a garbage human being for wanting this. I read stories of people raped nearly everyday by their parents, or who've had their entire family killed in accidents.

And here I am. Nothing tragic, no trauma. Does this just make me weak?
