Depressed or just impatient? I'm  more or less set financially for the rest of my life (only I don't have  a lump sum and it's more like a basic income in amount) and every time I  think I'd like to have the social lives of my acquaintances/friends,  something horrible happens and I think "Wow I'm glad that isn't me, I'm  really well off".  Yet I still have the lingering feeling of life not  being good enough.

I could  probably really use some more friends or a girlfriend but even getting  partway there is emotionally and mentally exhausting to the point where I  think it's not worth it.  That's where the impatient part kicks in I  guess.  Heck, if I had more weekly money I'd just hire escorts and/or  strippers and not have enough of a break to tell myself that it's all  fake (Though I did spend some time around a stripper who seemed  genuinely into me as she wasn't interested in money as long as I didn't  come in when the place was packed/she was in a position where she was  losing money by not seeking out a customer).

So, what do you do when someone is absolutely sick of life yet doesn't have the patience or perseverance to make it better?
