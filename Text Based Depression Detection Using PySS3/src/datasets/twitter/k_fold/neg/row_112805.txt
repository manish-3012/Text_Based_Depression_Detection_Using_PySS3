I was doing so well, then she brought me down againI was making so much progress and actually starting to enjoy life again, then I saw her on friday night at a club. She was ignoring me. Fair enough. Last year I threatened her with suicide, acted like a child, harassed her, did absolutely everything wrong. We haven't talked in about two months. So I went up to her at the end of the night and said hi, said I thought I should be civil.

The next night I texted her asking if she still felt that weird about that she couldn't just come and say hi. We texted back and forth. Basically she said I'm a narcissist, a spoiled brat, an idiot, everything that's true. Then she said don't ever contact her or talk to her again or she's going to the police.

I want to die. I've been in bed for the past two days and I can't see any other way out. I just want to kill myself. Please help :(
