Wednesday NightI think this is it. I'm going to hang myself on Wednesday night. I have a church service to play at 6:30pm, and after it's done, I'm going to stay behind and hang myself from the balcony. I'll be found the next morning, or sometime overnight.

It feels good to have the end in sight. I know it will be hard for people at first, but they'll get over it, and it will be better in the long run. I'm not afraid anymore. My affairs are in order, I have good life insurance, and am worth more dead than alive.
