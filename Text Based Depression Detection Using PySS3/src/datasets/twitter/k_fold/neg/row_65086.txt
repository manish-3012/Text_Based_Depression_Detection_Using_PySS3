I Post And Try To Help People Here, but I'm Tired.I don't know how much longer I can go on. I"m tired. I'm sad. My future looks bad. 

I want to cry right now. I try really hard to offer other people hope that post here but how can I offer hope to other people if I don't have any myself?

I can't look them in  the eye and say "Life will get better." in any certain terms, because, I can't know that, and I can't say that. 

How in the world do other people on here think they have the ability to lift others out of the dark? I used to be like that. Suicidal people would get annoyed with me when I tried to be optimistic with them. 

They called me a "happy shiny". 

I don't know you guys. I've tried for what seems like a long time. I've gotten on meds, gone to psychotherapy, but I....

Yeah. 

I'm going to go cry now. I don't think I have a good future ahead of me. I don't feel loved for who I am. Hope is a lie told over and over again until you realize it for what it is.
