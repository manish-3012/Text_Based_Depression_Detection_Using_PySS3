Things I need to do soon1: Jump off my second floor porch, crushing and killing my brain.

2: Lie down in the middle of the street and get crushed by a car.

3: Find someone with a gun and shoot myself in the head.

4: Find some sort of opioid and take too much of it.

5: Jump off the nearest bridge and crown.

6: Get crushed by a boat. Or anything. 

I don't want to live anymore. Since somehow I am fated to not undergo the "suffering" and "misery" and universal empathy and sympathy cancer would bring, these are my options. There are zero downsides to my death, ZERO. My aunts and uncles and cousins and college friends wouldn't actually give a crap if I died because EVERYONE gives a crap when you die. I just wish something or someone would take me out first.
