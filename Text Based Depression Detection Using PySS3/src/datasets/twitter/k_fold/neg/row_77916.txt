Unmotivated to liveFrom the age of 8 until now I have lived my life by immersing myself in books/tv/video games because real life has never been attractive to me. I only like the thought of accomplishing something meaningful - exerting myself, spending countless hours striving for some faraway goal, but in practise, when I do accomplish something I do not feel fufilled or happy or proud, all that pain was for nothing. nothing in my life feels worthwhile.

I don't care about other people, infact I dlsike everyone I come into contact with, I  do still enjoy being validated and people staving off my loneliness, but it doesn't bother me if people my life go away or die it never has. I have never connected well with humans, I have no friends offline or online now.. I don't want them.

I grow older, and the joy I once had of living through fictional characters has dulled, most of my days now consist of staring blankly at a computer screen or walking around my city, I have tried to fill my day with many new experiences and activities, this works at temporarily distracting me from suicidal thoughts but does nothing for my happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

earlier in my life I would fend off these suicidal thoughts with the hope that one day I will be happy; one day I will be indepedent, own my own home and have a loving wife. but now I am indepedent, I'm wealthy, and I got to experience falling in love with someone.

I think if that "love" thing worked out, I could be content living another 20 years, but now I have nothing to protect or work for. I managed to find the one human being I could love that, but they are dead now so, nope, atleast I was fortunate to experience love(albeit it wasn't mutual), I have no interest in ever being in another relationship.

 I'm very comfortable with dying now, but I'm in no rush, I'll live a few more weeks or months of this tedious existence and wait for something to happen.

I am approaching the end of my life, my next suicide attempt there will be nothing holding me back. non-existence is a comforting thought.

Perhaps if coronavirus or some asteroid/nuke kills a few billion people then the enusing chaos would make the world exciting enough to live in.. otherwise I'll be dead sometime this year.
