you guys might be my last resortI didnt know how hard it would be to get help. I emailed Samaritans and no response, I am 25th in a queue right now for lifeline crisis chat...

Im just so alone. I have lost so much in the last year. My friends, my son, my job, and I fear I am going to lose my husband next due to my depression and anger and sadness. Im at my breaking point. and I dont know what to do.
