I've done it..Throwaway because my boyfriend is a redditor. I ruined everything... I have people who seem to want to be friends with me but I push them away simply because I don't want to have friends anymore for whatever reason... I have fucked up literally everything I have ever done... Hurt everyone I have ever loved and yet they still love me... I don't deserve their love... I wonder if I even deserve life anymore..... I have always wondered that... I have no ambition to do anything anymore. Everything has been taken from me partly because my lack of motivation to do anything in the first place closed up opportunities. I am selfish but I am afraid to hurt others. Even though I keep hurting them... It hurts me to hurt people but I do it anyways. Why? I don't fucking know. I want to change but it is an impulse. I ruin everything. I don't want to die... But I don't want to live... I... I want nothing....
