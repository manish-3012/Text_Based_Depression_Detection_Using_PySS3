My Cousin committed Sucide.He was 25 years old. Loved computers and was absolutely brilliant. He has a toddler-age son.
Three days ago he hung himself in his basement. No explanation, and no warning.

I...I just don't know where else to go. We weren't close but... I really looked up to him. He was frighteningly intelligent. A computer genius. I majored in Computer Network Administration in college because of him. Although I never told him that. I'm 5 years younger than him. As children, we all spent a lot of time together. I was usually around his sister, but always snuck into his bedroom to watch him on the computer. If I was quiet, he let me stay. When we grew up, everyone just kind of went their separate ways. I seen him on occasion and chatted, but never really tried to re-connect. I guess I was a little intimidated by the idea. 


I just... I want to know why. What was so fucking bad?!
What could have made him abandon his beautiful son? What could have made him leave his family behind? 
I still expect a call telling me it was some kind of mix up and he isn't really dead.
Maybe if I knew why, it wouldn't hurt so much. Maybe I could stop thinking about it. Everyone tells me that it wouldn't help. But I still just want to know.

I've spent the last few days trying to comfort/support his siblings. Because I feel like I don't have a right to be this upset. Like I'm not closely-related enough to be falling apart like this.

Yesterday I went on a hike. Stood at the top of a waterfall with my toes hanging over the edge. I tried to imagine how bad things would have to be for someone to genuinely consider jumping. Even being on the edge.... I couldn't think of anything that would make me want to die.

I just want to understand. 

(I'm sorry. I hope this makes sense. My head is in tatters right now.)
