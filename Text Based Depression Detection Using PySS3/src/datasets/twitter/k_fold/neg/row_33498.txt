This isn't worth itI'm not sure where to turn at this point. The only thing that has kept me from killing myself is the pain it would bring my mother. 

I don't contribute to this world. I only make bad choices and pretend it's what I wanted all along. I have no motivation for life. No real connections. No real friends. Aquantences a plenty, but no one I could call right now. I don't want to bother them.   

My medication works sometimes, but it's mostly just a front till it all comes to a bubble again and I burst. I actually called a suicide hotline tonight. I apologized and hung up. 

My only sister hasn't talked to be in three years. I'm not certain why. I think it has to do with my boyfriend who is not up to her standards. Not really up to mine either but it's better than being alone. I also don't want to be abandoned, like I have been before but I don't want to be with him. I can't find enough funds to leave. 

Idk where I'm going with this. Just reaching out I guess. I just want someone to tell me it's okay to let go. To leave. To stop feeling. I just stop being. It's not like I want to be dead, but I really don't want to be alive. It's such a strange feeling I've had for over 20 years now. 

Can anyone relate? I don't need to be told my life is precious or has purpose bc it's doesn't. I really don't bring anything to anyone. Constantly pretending to be happy and help anyone who asks, but it's all empty. I wonder sometimes if I am a sociopath. I feel bad when others do but I don't want to be bothered to be that involved. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so fucking sad all the time, even when things are going well bc I know the bottom is about to drop out. I'm just so tired.
