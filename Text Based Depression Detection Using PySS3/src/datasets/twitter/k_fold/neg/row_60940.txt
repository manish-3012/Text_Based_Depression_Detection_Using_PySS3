Need Ideas.A few months ago I had submitted this --&gt; [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/vq0m6/im_kind_of_lost/) to /r/Suicidewatch and was getting help from people for it. 

Most of the time I would vent to my ex because she was a person who already understood me quite well and also knew what I was going through. She was helpful with getting me through even if she didn't know what to say I could still vent and be understood. 

Well recently I saw she ended up getting into a relationship and I can't vent to her anymore. I know it sounds stupid but what I mean is, the thing we went through was bad and I want her to be happy in the new relationship she is in. I feel like if I bring anything up it could damage what she has now. I'd rather let her be able to move on instead of dwell on what happened. 

I don't have anyone to vent or help me for one reason. I'm terrible and always have been at discussing how I feel what's wrong and so on. She was able to pick up on what was wrong with me speaking gibberish or grunts. For everyone else I feel like I have to give a novel of an explanation for them to begin to pick up on how I'm feeling. Because of this it's all bottling up inside and causing me to have emotional spikes. I can be happy for a bit then my mood just drastically changes to where nothing is enjoyable.  I've tried talking to other people, family, friends, counselors. And it just isn't helping. 

My question is there any techniques to help replace what I had. I've tried the things I love. I got back into skating, writing, and drawing. All they do is numb the feeling for the time being. My writing and drawings usually have something to do with everything that's happened or I write out how I feel but that doesn't really do much. Has anyone had to fix their emotions on their own. Please spare some help. I just don't want to spiral down like before.
