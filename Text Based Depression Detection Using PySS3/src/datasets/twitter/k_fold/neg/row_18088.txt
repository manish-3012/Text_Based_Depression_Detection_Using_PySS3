Im slipping away, and Suicide is getting closer.I really have no reason.  I've been depressed ever since I was a kid, and I'm 14 right now.  I have extreme anxiety issues, and have been diagnosed with A.D.D and aspergers syndrome.  I don't understand people, I'm an introvert, but I'm lonely.  It doesn't make sense.

My family is wonderful and loving, and I just waste my days away playing video games.  It was my only escape, and now, I don't even like them.  I'm constantly bored, and school is terrible.  I'm not bullied, but nobody talks to me, nobody really considers me their friend.

I think I'm just going to slit my wrists and end it all tonight.
