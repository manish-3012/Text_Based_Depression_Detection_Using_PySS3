The triggerWhat's gonna pull yours? I've been asking myself that lately, Is dumb because I already have the answer, thanks to my high morals and principles no matter how fucking sad or tired or fucked up in the head I be, we can't kill ourselves unless we have this 4 conditions 1.)  No more economic status, nor house, nor a job, basically homeless 2.) Dead end, can't sell drugs, can't rob people, can't shoplift 3.)No one's gonna be there, no one that gives me a chance to put myself on my feet 4.) The other side better or worse.

Until now we've done so well, you kow leaving from besides our probably non-existing feelings cause at this point we can't feel shit, and that's sad(Heheheh ironic), but we are not killing ourselves because of those 4 what about you? Can you avoid to pull it, What's gonna pull yours? Ask yourself that. At this point, remember, this life we have is ours, no matter if someone gave it to us, IS OURS NOW, killing ourselves is not selfish is a fucked up right, but rather than a right is more of a gamble, a high one, if nothings on the other side, well shit. we lost. we lost big time. and we should be afraid. Ah and yeah We are not killing myself
