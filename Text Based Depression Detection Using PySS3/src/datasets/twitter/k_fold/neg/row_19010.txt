I guess I will never have normal relationshipsI hate my mom she still physcyally hurt me I am 20 years old. People bullied me now I am afraid of people a lot. I am full of anxiety. I want a life without my mom and I will have, my father will buy me a new house. But all of those traumas are real. I hope I cam find people who will love me this is all I want. I also believe in God so much and I hope.
