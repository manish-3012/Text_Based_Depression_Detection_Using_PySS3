It feels like it's just a matter of timeTo start off, I'd like to say that obectively, I know that I have family and friends to live for and that I have some qualities if I can come out the other end of depression. However, I my feelings and thoughts tell me otherwise. Lately, I'm thinking about ending it because I'm not worth it. I'm thinking of a quick death, but I'm not really worried because of those thoughts, although they are very unpleasant. I'm quite sure that I wont' take my life because I'm telling myself I'm not worth it, although sometimes I'm happy that I don't have access to stuff that could endanger me.

But that's not the point of my title. I have a feeling that this struggle of knowing that if I could come out the other end and the suicidal ideations is wearing me down. I'd like to come to peace someday and that's where I see suicide as an option. Not to opt out of life because I don't like it, but because I just can't deal with the the struggle anymore. It's like two world colliding and I'm in the middle of it and everytime they collide, I take a hit, and I don't know how many hits I can take eventually.

I know it won't happen in the near future, but I can't say what will happen, if I'm still in this situation in a couple of months or even years. I have so much respect for everyone, that is going through this for such a long time and still going on. I don't know if I'd break at a certain point.
