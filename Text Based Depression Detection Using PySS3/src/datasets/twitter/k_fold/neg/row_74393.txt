I just can't bring myself to do itI'm kind of just, at this point, waiting for things to get bad enough that IDGAF and do the thing. I'm just waiting for that push. The point in which I snap.

I know realistically it won't be successful if I'm not low enough, and I'll probably just end up in the hospital/ICU for awhile until they can lock me up in a mental ward but I feel the natural chain of events is just for me to slip up before anything can get better
