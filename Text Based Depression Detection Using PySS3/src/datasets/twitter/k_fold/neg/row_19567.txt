Is loneliness a legitimate reason for suicide?Life is pretty boring and shitty when youâ€™re alone. Iâ€™m 32 without anyone I can call a friend; no family and estranged from parents and Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend before. 

Obviously Iâ€™m a pretty shit human because thereâ€™s no one who wants to be involved with my life and subsequently I am bored out of my mind and feeling unfulfilled in every aspect. 

So is it a legitimate reason to die if youâ€™re lonely? I feel like I have reached an age where making friends and finding a girlfriend is now impossible and since I am pretty stupid and donâ€™t ever have anything but menial jobs Iâ€™m not wasting a career either. 

Loneliness honestly hurts because it tells you a lot about much of a useless and worthless human I have to be that I can have no one care about me. Obviously I hold zero value. 

Iâ€™m getting a tattoo soon of a wizard which I discovered means someone who reached 30 without ever having a girlfriend before except I will have a second image inked where the wizard is dead hanging from a tree. Iâ€™m getting my loser status officially branded on me for all of eternity.  

I feel like itâ€™s approaching time though and I wonâ€™t even make it to the session.
