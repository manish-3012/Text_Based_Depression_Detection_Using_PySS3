Losing hopeI'm 19, my family loves me, I'm very successful academically, about to go back to second year of law school after a 6 month break, I have no financial troubles whatsoever (aside from a lack of independence, living with my parents), and, to be honest, I have never been more suicidal in my life.

I've had diagnosed depression since 2012; this was triggered when my dad had too much to drink and we got in a physical fight (me being female and much smaller than him, it was not fun). I've been on antidepressants for the past 6 months, currently on 20mg of citalopram. Despite everyone telling me that it'll get better, every episode of depression seems to worsen. I become abusive to my friends, especially one in particular who has been very supportive. I cry constantly, switch from being happy to suicidal and back again in under an hour.

My habits have become so bad that the only way I can think of to get attention is by telling people I feel like committing suicide. While this is true, I know it's highly manipulative, and makes me feel worse. My only coping mechanism for any negative emotions are thoughts of self-mutilation and suicide.

I don't know what to do. I know that if I continue to act like this, I will drive away all my friends. (Pretty surprised they haven't told me to fuck off and die already.)

Is it my medication that's the problem, or is it just my ingrained attitude from 2 years of constantly feeling suicidal? I feel closer and closer to killing myself each day. Only hanging on because my mum would never recover, and I have two rescue cats.

I feel helpless and alone. Please help?
