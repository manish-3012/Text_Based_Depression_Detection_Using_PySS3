I hate lifeLost my boyfriend of 7 or so years today because he's not happy. I wasn't good enough for him. He told me to pack my bags and we'll figure out what to do when we go home in 2 weeks.

Just got off my period

Just had a stressful week of birth control because of travel

Currently not home but travelled far to visit our parents

Lost my job

My dad died a couple years back

My birthday is at the end of the month

We are leasing a place together

I have nothing left
