The more I think about it, the more im convinced that suicide is not a big dealIt really just doesnt matter anymore. Im reminded of it every 10 min or so that i dont want to live. Reason? I just can't stand myself. Its hard to find joy in life when I feel like Im trapped in something that I abhor and have absolutely no control over. Maybe its mental illness, but I just know that fundamentally i will never accept myself. Its ridiculously shameful to see myself grow bitter and uglier over time. I just want nothingness. People say its the dumbest thing a human can do. But is it really? Nobody gets to decide that. I did not like my fate, so Im deciding to end it. What I really wish for is to spend the last week of my life with the very few people closest to me. Tell them about what Im thankful for and laugh with them about the fun memories we had.... and properly say goodbye to them while they do the same to me. But no.. they'll probably drag me to a mental institution because it is absolutely not allowed. They'll say Im being too dramatic and lecture me on why life is so great. Its just... it all doesnt matter anymore.
