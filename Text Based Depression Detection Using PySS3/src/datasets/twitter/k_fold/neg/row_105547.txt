I'm not doing well and in an increasing amount of distressI have the means to kill myself but I am so afraid to survive. Everything that I feel is bad and scary because I am chronically ill but no one cares because it isn't physical. At this point I know better than ever how to kill myself but I am also more worried than ever about surviving because my girlfriend would surely break up with me if I survive again. I can't tell her about it either because I don't want to ruin her mood I need help I need to get rid of myself
