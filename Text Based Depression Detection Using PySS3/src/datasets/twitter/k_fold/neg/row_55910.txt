wtf is wrong with meplease help. everything is falling apart. I started my new job last night and ripped my apart. I don't know if I can do this anymore. I hate myself. I have all the resources to get better but I can't do it. I can't. I am weak and selfish and stupid. everything is falling apart. Nothing anyone says or does helps. And my friend just told me that I am a complaining bitch who doesn't do anything to solve her problems. And he's right. I am so useless and whiny and stupid. I don't have it in my to help myself anymore. I hate myself and I want to die. What do I do? I'm dying inside. I am exhausted physically mentally and emotionally. I can't do this anymore
