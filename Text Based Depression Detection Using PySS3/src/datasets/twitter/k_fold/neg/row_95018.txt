i want to die, but im not suicidal or depressedim spiritual, and i have been doing a lot of research on death, ascension, the shift, the human consciousness and what not lately. and i dont want people to get the wrong idea that im depressed and suicidal, because im not. im for some reason very interested in dying and curious about what happens after death. as of right now at age 19 i can honestly say that im not sure i can do anything successful in my life. i know those words make me sound depressed, but im not. i genuinely believe this world has nothing to offer for me. i dont even see myself being financially secure in the future with a beautiful wife and kids. i moved to los angeles 4 months ago to pursue my dream in becoming a professional skateboarder, but im slowly starting to realize that, that dream is out of my reach.. so im trying to think of something to do with my life. i always wanted to explore the world and do research or study animal and plant life, or do something with nasa.. but obviously that is very difficult and im not going to college. i can say though i might be feeling this way because i have extreme social anxiety, not to the point where i won't talk to anyone new in public, but its almost like whenever i have conversations with anybody i can never have an intelligent conversation with them and i feel like im stupid, or inexperienced with life. any feedback would be much appreciated guys, thanks for taking the time to read this.
