Anyone else thinks that school is too much when you are depressed?I'm sitting in class now, having mental breakdown and all I can think about is suicide. I have 3 more years before my education is over and this idea is horrible. Thinking about job isn't better because I won't go to collage and probably have shitty job if any in the future. Anyone else have or had simillar thoughts? I can't take break from school in any form and every day I have to spend here is terrible. Time teachers want me to spend at home learning a lot of hard yet useless things doesn't help really. 
I really think death is the only way to escape from this shit.
