I don't know what to try or hope for anymore.My entire life just completely shut down more than 10 years ago, when I was 16. My anxiety is severe enough to stop me from going outside entirely save a handful of times, and a bunch of doctor visits the last few years. Tired of my worsening health problems with no answers or help.

I've tried pretty much everything I can try except for medications which I don't really believe in, and honestly if I have to hear another person recommend them I feel like I'm going to slit my throat. 

I can't make money or i'll lose my insurance because my "household"'s income would be too high (not even $30k a year), not that I'm able to make money in the first place, but that simple fact stops any hope of that ever changing. 

I can't enjoy things or have hobbies. Literally all my days spent is just wasting time on the internet trying to make it to the next day. For what? I've never had close family relationships, purpose, or meaning in life. I'm ugly as fuck, failed basically everything I've ever attempted.

Because my only form of therapy comes through my medicaid insurance, there's only 2 "clinics" in my city that I can go to see a therapist, and I tried them both and the 4 therapists I saw between them were so deeply unhelpful. Didn't even get the choice to choose which thereapist I got, and could only go once a month.

Idk. I just don't feel I have any options. Things never get better for me. My entire life has just been one massive spiral downhill and I'm sick of it.
