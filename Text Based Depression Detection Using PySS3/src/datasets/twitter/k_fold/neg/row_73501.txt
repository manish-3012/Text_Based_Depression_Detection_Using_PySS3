I fucked up, can I just die in my sleep now?I want to apologize if this post is poorly written, I usually write pretty well but I've been struggling to be coherent lately. 

I made the decision a couple of years back to stay in this shitty little rural town. I thought I wasn't ready to leave, so I figured I'd stay and work on myself a bit.

Turns out that was the worst decision I've ever made. I even had adequate funds to get out of this place. 

During that time I've lost everything I remotely valued about myself and with our absolute lack of facilities, there's no way I'll ever get back what I lost.

No access to medical facilities where people don't treat you like garbage, no access to healthy produce unless you want to travel three hours to civilization and three hours back, no access to any music or art facilities to help me get back to what I actually enjoy. And no people really worth spending time with.

I hate my body. I hate my appearance. I hate that I can't sing anymore. I hate that I can't perform decently anymore. I hate that I can't dance anymore. I hate that I've lost my fitness and health. I hate that I've lost everything that I worked so hard to achieve. I hate myself. I hate what I've become and I hate what I've lost. I just want to die. I'm stuck here and I can't handle staying in this shitty town any longer. 

Why the fuck should I live a miserable life which gives me nothing in return regardless of how hard I try?

Like, I've got an adorable catto and some great friends that live (VERY far away) and I don't mean to be ungrateful but I'm sick of living a life I hate just so I don't hurt anyone.

Living solely so you don't hurt people is a pretty shitty life in my opinion.
