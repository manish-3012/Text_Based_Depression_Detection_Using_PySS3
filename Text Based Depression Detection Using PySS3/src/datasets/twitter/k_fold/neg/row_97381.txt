I think about it all the time. (trigger warning)It gets harder and harder every day. I wish I was dead every moment of every day. I self harm just so I can see the blood and fantasize about actually cutting deep enough. I'm alone, in constant pain and I feel like no one in my life cares. I've been hospitalized twice and I should go again but I can't be away from my computer. I don't even know why the hell I am posting. I am just sick of being alone. overlooked. an completely loathed by the person in the mirror.
