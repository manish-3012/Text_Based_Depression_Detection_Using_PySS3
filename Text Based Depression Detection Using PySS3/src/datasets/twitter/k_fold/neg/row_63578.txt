I can't do this anymoreI feel like I can't live this life anymore. I feel so alone and hopeless. I'm 24 and I have no friends and am floundering at the only job I could get after college. I still live at home and I feel I'm so socially awkward and anxious that I will never be able to make friends or live a productive life.

I don't know what else to do, I've tried talking to everyone from my family to a therapist and nothing seems to help. 

I'm not really expecting anything by posting this, I just really needed to write it down and get it out there.
