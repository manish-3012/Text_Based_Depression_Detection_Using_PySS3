Don't lie on the depression screeningAt least for my district, it's time for depression screenings. Whatever you do, TELL THE TRUTH ON THEM. They only exist to help you and get you out of this mess. Before you say "You're not even depressed! How would you know what is and isn't useful?" These tests and screenings have been proven to successfully detect depression a majority of the time.

TLDR: Once your schools have their depression screenings, be truthful.
