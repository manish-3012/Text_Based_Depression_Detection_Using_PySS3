I'm constantly distracting myself and I think I'm losing itI'm doing drugs multiple times a day.

I recently relapsed and started doing ketamine again (I had been clean 8 months).

I think I tricked myself into thinking things were better and that I was ok for a while. Now my pyschiatrist says he suspects I have Borderline Personality Disorder and it feels like my world is crashing down.

I tried to kill myself a couple weeks ago. Part of me really really wants to right now. I just want to get high and slit my artery.

I feel numb all the time. The anti-depressants turn me into a robot but if I come off them I get overwhelming depressive episodes.
