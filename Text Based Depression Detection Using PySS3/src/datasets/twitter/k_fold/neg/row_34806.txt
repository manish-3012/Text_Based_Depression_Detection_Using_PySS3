giving upPOCD has exhausted me to the point where a lot of time I can say I truly hate life. Most times I truly seem to believe I'm a p*do, since it's like the facts are working in that favor. I lull myself to sleep at night by fantasizing about being admitted into a psych ward, where I can't hurt anyone and all I do is sleep, eat and live life without having to worry about how I might hurt others or be a danger. I don't think that's normal since most people wanna get OUT of a psych ward and wouldn't voluntary turn themselves in with pleasure. Today I woke up next to my 4 year old sister (my parents had work and I was babysitting). She woke up crying and while calming her all I could do was worry about groinal responses and my anxiety when I was calming her down. After she fell asleep I did too, except this time I woke up with an anxiety attack. I calmed myself down by repeating the ABCs and thinking of ways I can off myself quickly. I don't think that's normal or healthy, calming yourself down by thinking of suicide methods. I'm exhausted and I don't know what to do. I'm terrified of telling a therapist, who in their right mind would say "I think I'm a p*d*"? I hate getting out of bed and most of my days are spent in it. I barely eat and I've become dehydrated. I'm tired and I don't know what to do anymore other than give in and end it
