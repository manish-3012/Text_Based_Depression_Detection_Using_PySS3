What if suicide becomes your only option?I'm on medication, I go to therapy every week (in theory), and I've tried ECT.  I just can't go on, anymore.  I've been working really hard to pay off all my debt and I've realized I'm way over my head, I make monthly payments, but I'm at the point where I can't afford those, anymore.  I've burnt through the inheritance that my grandparents and aunt left me, and most of my retirement account (I'm almost 30).

I can't ask for help, I think suicide is my only option.
