Only reddit knows.I'm so close to killing myself and no one knows but reddit. My confidence and self esteem are at an all time low. I don't even want to be alive for my own daughter anymore, that has to mean something. I can't tell me fiancÃ© or she'll freak tf out and that will in turn only put me farther in the ground than Im already in. Maybe if I force an oncoming traffic accident and die it won't look like a suicide and they can have the proper closer they need and I'm sure it'll suck for everyone else at first,but I sure it'll all be better for everyone else in the end...
