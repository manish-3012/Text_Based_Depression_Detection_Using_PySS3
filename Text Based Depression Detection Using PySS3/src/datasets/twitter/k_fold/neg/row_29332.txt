Not gonna lie, feeling so down and tiredLast couple of months I m feeling down and I feel tired all the time, my life started to be so boring and its like I m living the same day over and over again and even if there is something new, nothing makes me happy anymore. I m in the process of trying to quit smoking too, but I feel thats not gonna happen ever. I m in the mid-twenties and I feel like its gonna be like this for the rest of my life. 

My life was fun before, its not like this is chasing me for my entire life, I dont know what happened that I started feeling this way, but its horrible feeling. I get angry very fast, I cant handle the things I could before, without getting angry and having urge to smash things around me.
