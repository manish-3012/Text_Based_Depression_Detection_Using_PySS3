Started talking to someone on Tinder. Never met, just shared daily stories and what not. She said sheâ€™s suicidal. Not sure what to do.Sorry if this is the wrong place to post but reading the sidebar, seems like it should be allowed. 

So a month or so ago I matched with someone on Tinder (19F). She said she was looking for friends as she was still healing from her past relationship. I was cool with just friends so we started talking and turns out she was abused in her past relationship. She kept emphasizing that she had no friends (she currently goes to school). Iâ€™ve offered multiple times to hang out and do stuff together but she always declines. She mentioned sheâ€™s been considering suicide and I tried to discuss it with her and it ending with the fact that sheâ€™s going to see a therapist in a couple weeks. 

Fast forward to today, she sent me a picture of her and her ex that she set fire to. I again offered to meet up and she said she doesnâ€™t feel the need to. She keeps saying thatâ€™s sheâ€™s only gonna be alive for a short time and I asked about her therapist to which she responded that they turned her away. No further details. Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s about to block me or something because she said â€œgoodbye [my name]. It was nice knowing youâ€ And that Iâ€™m invading her privacy by asking if her parents know about things. Now I have no idea what to do here. Apparently her parents/sister know sheâ€™s thought about suicide, Iâ€™m not too sure (she wouldnâ€™t give me a straight answer). 

All I know about her is her Snapchat id, Instagram id, and her snapmap location occasionally. I have no way of contacting her family or anyone. She has a couple people tagged with her in insta pictures. Maybe them? Im guessing sheâ€™s not in touch with them because she has mentioned multiple times that has no friends. Iâ€™m travelling rn and on the other side of the world and Iâ€™m scared. Any advice would be helpful.
