Iâ€™m going to be homeless at the end of the month. Iâ€™m so scared.In just a week, my â€˜friendâ€™ is throwing me out of her house. I have nowhere I can go. I canâ€™t go back to my family, they already threw me out. My mom said she would beat me to death if I came anywhere near her. I have no where to go, and all I can think of is ending it.

My city has a high rate of sex crimes against homeless teens, and thereâ€™s nothing I can do. I donâ€™t want to be raped. I donâ€™t want to be abused. Iâ€™m only 19. I donâ€™t want this. I want to put a gun in my mouth and never have to worry about anything ever again. Iâ€™m so deep into this pit of hopelessness, and thereâ€™s no getting out of it.
