Fuck it. Killing myself in a few hours.It has been a while since I've posted here, I was almost proud of it actually but now I'm back, as per usual. It wasn't me getting better, more like, i learned how to exist in my misery.
I've recently discovered how shit of a person I actually am. I've fucked my life up and I'm fucking everyone else up. I've  fucking killed my girlfriend inside. I've slowly seen her withering into nothing but a husk trying to deal with my fucked up head.
My family admitted the other day, "We don't even know who you are", that's how "close" we are. They couldn't even tell me a colour i like and to be honest, i don't blame them. I've been a huge let down and a total failure.
Turns out my "friends" don't give a shit about me. When in hospital nobody messaged, despite knowing, and ended up shit talking me behind my back. 
I have no interest in living this life any longer. It's just not worth it. 
Just need to make finishing touches to my note and then, tell goodbye I said hello. 

There's no point. I'm lost and alone in this world that keeps telling me i have to do this on my own but i cant. I can't just go outside and meet new people. I cant just write, i cant. I just cant. I have always agreed with the phrase, "do what you will, when your will is done". I kept telling myself people need me, but they dont. And even if they do, it's not a reason to suffer like this. I've lost too much and too many people. 

Why did you all kill yourselves? I could've held you, said that i love you, i could have helped. If only i knew something was wrong. You never even said goodbye. Just that i should die. And i will. And i will fucking beg you to forgive me every second of it.
