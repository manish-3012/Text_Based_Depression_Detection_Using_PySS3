Long story short, my parents were abusive, i am the youngest of three accidents. My mom was emotionally manipulative, my dad was physically, spiritually, emotionally. Like if you see the wikipedia for narcissistic parent, my dad is everything they list. My mom is alright due to her making up for her abuse by trying to be an actual parent throughout my life, she tries her best. My dad cheated on my mom, had a kid with the random lady and lost his job so oops.

I have never really been a social outcast, I make friends very easily and with that I had a way to avoid my home by being outside with others. Even with my escape, I still was miserable. I always feel like "happiness is temporary, depression is eternal"

I tried killing myself almost a year ago. Literally like, a day from now will be the year anniversary. I've been working hard for a while, with a sidejob at one point, I'm a second year at an animation college, I try to balance everything with my social life. I just, cant handle it anymore. My constant depressing and suicidal thoughts are making me feel really empty inside and sometimes I get used to it, other times it makes me want to drag my nails through my fucking eyeballs.

I'm burning out of steam and I can't fucking take it anymore. I'm really tempted into going outside right now and jumping in front of a fucking car. i just cant.

I just feel like my life is crumbling behind me and everything i've worked for has no real meaning in general 

I am too tired to try to fix anything 

I just want to stop
