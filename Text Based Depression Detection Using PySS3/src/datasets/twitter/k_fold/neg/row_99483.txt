So tired of allJust canâ€™t do this anymore had a good day without suicidal thoughts and now it gets worse than ever like always.
I just donâ€™t have the energy can't even keep a job for a week without puking after 2 days because of stress.
My meds wonâ€™t do shit, no energy to go to a therapist(canâ€™t even get my thoughts clear enough to talk so itâ€™s useless most times anyway) 
And i have no one in my life that supports me or even likes me all just want money if I donâ€™t have it they donâ€™t care.

Canâ€™t even feel normal for a whole day I guess life wants me dead already...
