My cousin wants to kill himself on his 30th birthday, that's tomorrow. Please talk to me.For a few months my cousin has told me how he doesn't want to live anymore. He said he's made a pact on his 30th birthday that if he's not happy he will kill himself. His 30th birthday is tomorrow. I've been there for him through this whole thing, stayed up all night just talking to him many nights. He texted me last week saying he was sitting in a van with a rope ready to do it, his girlfriend contacted me saying he's sent her goodbye message and she was scared and I'm the only person she can think to talk to because I seem to be the only one he can talk to. I managed to get him to go home and sleep it off, after ringing his dad and even ringing the suicide line which rang him to speak to him. He went to a cliff area two days ago and just sat there for 6 hours contemplating jumping but someone saw him and sat next to him.  
Reddit, I know nothing I can say can change his mind but if he doesn't anything I am going to feel like there was something I could of done.  Is there anything I can say to change his mind?  I've begged him to go to the doctors but he has no faith in them. I've begged him to speak to his dad but he said he can't. I'm scared of losing him, I'm scared of it turning my family upside down, I'm scared it will break my uncle and aunties heart and I'm terrified that I will live with the guilt that I could of done more. He might not even do it, I hope he doesn't. I guess I just needed to speak my mind to strangers.
