Iâ€™m too lazy to liveI basically donâ€™t have the will to do anything besides watch youtube/tv/movies, play videogames eat, smoke weed, and drink. Itâ€™s all iâ€™ve been doing for the past 4 years and iâ€™m not even 18. I dropped out of highschool freshman year and have been trying to push my self just to do anything whatsoever that could help my future in anyway, but I never go through with my plans. I have pretty bad general axiety due to past situations, my general fears of life, and the years of daily smoking. I canâ€™t drive due to my crippling fear of killing someone and potentially going to prison or dying. Iâ€™m about to be an adult sooner than I know it, and iâ€™m terrified to the point where I think about it many times a day. The thought of how much money iâ€™ll have to spend on taxes, bills, mortage, and everything else makes me want to vomit. Iâ€™m scared of having no future, yet I have no drive to do anything besides lay around and slowly kill myself. Iâ€™m a walking breathing contradiction and I hate myself for it. Thereâ€™s no reason I canâ€™t be doing productive things, I just donâ€™t, and it feels like I canâ€™t. I hate it so much and I want help. Just to be clear, I have no current plans on committing suicide, but if I ever got into a bad enough financial and general situation as an adult, I feel like I wouldnâ€™t hesitate.
