Seeing everyone else better off is the real trigger for me.Basically title. I barely have any real friends to start, but just seeing how everyone around me is doing better at least in some ways just makes me want to kill myself for the sake of saving the pain for rest of my life.

Perhaps the worst of it is seeing your sibling being better at life than you in every way. He is going to better school, getting better gpa, has ridiculous amount of friends, has had success with girls, casually goes to vacation with his friends during holidays. But me? pretty much the opposite. Barely passing my classes, no friends really just people I talk to occasionally because we have the same class, no experience with girls whatsoever, and every weekend is me playing games all night in my room. 

I've tried to "go outside" as suggested. But I've never been a risk taker, and my self-esteem has been rock bottom since high school. I couldn't make any friends let alone a girlfriend and surrounding myself with people who are better socially than I am didn't help either.

I have no future, and no one to share it with even if I did have one. I'm thinking about ending it all when I graduate college, which won't be too far from now. Maybe sooner if the pressure gets higher. My only concern is that I'm too much of a pussy to even do that, so I'm secretly hoping that somehow I just die in my sleep. In the very least, I deserve painless death.
