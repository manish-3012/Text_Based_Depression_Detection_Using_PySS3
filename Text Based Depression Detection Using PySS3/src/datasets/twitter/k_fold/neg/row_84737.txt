Sometimes I just want to watch my life burn to the groundI want to give up on everything. Wake up in the morning and be a worthless degenerate, a parasite on society. Do nothing but whatever feels good until everyone I've ever known and loved gives up on me and I spiral into my own self-destructive fantasy. Watch my Mom with tears in her eyes, after so many years of struggling to keep me alive, turn away from me forever. Lose my job, lose my school opportunites, lose my girlfriend. Let all of it go, for nothing. Just because I wanted to. Finally, when it all comes to a plateau, and I'm sitting alone, cold, and broken, I'll kill myself.
