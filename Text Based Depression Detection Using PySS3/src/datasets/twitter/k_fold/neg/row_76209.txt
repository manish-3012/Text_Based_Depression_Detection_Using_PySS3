My reasons to end it.Male, just turned 23. Still living with my parents due to medical issues.

1. I can't even shit on my own. I have to use enemas and sometimes it can take well over an hour for me to go to the bathroom. I've been doing daily enemas for 4 YEARS.

2. I have a foley catheter put in now (as of today) since I stopped being able to pee on my own for some reason.

3. I'm extremely depressed and horribly anxious (can't even hold a conversation with most people) and have been since I was 14.

4. I have fibromyalgia and am in pain daily which makes me seek out painkillers just to feel like a normal person.

5. I've struggled with drug addiction and am falling back into it again, particularly benzos.

6. I have crippling PTSD that I just can't get past to move on in life.

7. My personality lately sucks due to all the frustrations and medical issues and I really don't think the world would miss me much. CERTAINLY not the current me. I live with my family but don't really "live" with them. I just stay in my room half the time.

8. I also struggle with a ton of anhedonia, so even when things in life should seem better, my brain still isn't convinced that that's the case.

Ugh. I want to stop existing. I didn't ask for this. Nobody did. And yet it happened. This world is cruel.
