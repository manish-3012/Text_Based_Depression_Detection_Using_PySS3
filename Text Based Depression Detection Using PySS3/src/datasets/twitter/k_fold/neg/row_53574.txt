It's finally "set" in my mind.Life already is hard enough. I'm 17 and in High school. I have a few friends that I kinda hang around with at lunch, but nothing serious. It's been like this all through out high school. 

Including, i've never actually had a relationship with a girl or had sex. Yah some people say you shouldn't worry about sex in high school, but it matters to me really.

On top of everything, I have a small dick. And from what i've read around online, is that 16-17 is typically when your penis stops growing. I'm a few months away from 18 and I just don't think I will be able to bare the humiliation of my small dick.

I'm 4.5in length and 4.9in for girth. 

I see people over at http://pegym.com all starting with 6 inches or something, and girls think that's an "ok" size.

At this point, I don't see any reason for me to even get laid once, but to just suicide. I'm more serious about it this time than I have in the past I feel. I don't know if I should hang myself, or take a shit ton of pills to go away. I was thinking about planning an intentional car accident on myself (by myself on a road with nobody on it).

I have around $1k-$2k to spend on myself for this project... So the most pain free, and clean way of killing myself, i'd like to know if I could...


I have a twin, and I really debate on killing myself for what it'd be like for him by himself...
