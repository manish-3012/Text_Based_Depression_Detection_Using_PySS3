Suicide plan/last actNot a throwaway Because I'm not hiding reality

I have become content with my suicide. I was thinking of a final act where I go to a children's hospital and buy everyone a ton of toys, and then drop off food at the homeless shelter, then give my last dollars to homeless people on the street before I kill myself in front of a hospital so they can harvest my organs for sick people

Would be nice to give back and help those who actually want to live
