Haven't ended it yet, thus I am back.Hey all, another shit day here for me to ponder about why i strive to live...
it feels hopless, like a never ending cycle of good and bad; usually id be able to cope with the bad and cherish the good. Now a days my coping mechanisms seem to be at a loss, as if they are overloaded, i dont know what to do.


University, im making an attempt at it, i passed one of my midterms waiting on my other marks, yet cant get it in me to do this assignment

Life, is okay my girlfriends angry because i always hit bowls in the morning and has thus been ignoring me since 9 and is now in the shower.


Simple things like above cause me to feel useless, a failure, i really want to jump off the balcony of her building right now.



Why am i the way i am? I have never had a bad life, no significant trauma as perceivable to my conscious experiences. I cant seem to get the idea of death, and being 'destined to die', my mind will not allow me to escape what it sees as the inevitable, the ultimate fix to all.

Maybe i am doing drugs to mask my misery, sometimes i feel i smoke marijuana harder to supresss emotions. Im upset, i hate myself, i feel inadequate in life sometimes.



I dont know why or how i get into these episodic natures, where everything turns to gloom. They linger within my head but i am usually able to fight off any urge i actually have.


Im sad, im not fully suicidal, but im lost i know i cant die, i know i want to. Im struggling to find a way to live, and wondering if its all for nothing at the same time.
