Yay, I'm back in the loopholeYou get rid of suicidal thoughts for one day and the other you begin another month long streak
To be clear I've had suicidal thoughts from the end of September to a few days ago and now, after these peaceful days, I'm back at it
As always my friends don't believe me, thanks Vale. And it's sad because I could decide to end myself any moment, as I have everything I need to do it:
-GoPro, as I want to record it
-Will of living, the last bit, it could save me
 
  
 
 
Update on my thoughts
If I will do anything I will cut my veins and stuff on my left arm
So that they can possibly do something useful, else I will die
