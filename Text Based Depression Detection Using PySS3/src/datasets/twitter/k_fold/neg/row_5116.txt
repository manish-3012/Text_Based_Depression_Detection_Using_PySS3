Iâ€™m about ready to die.You heard it. My husband refuses to accept the thought of me being trans. My husband refuses to have sex with me. My children are dead. Itâ€™s all my fault that theyâ€™re gone. Iâ€™m ugly, disgusting, mentally ill, retarded, and just an overall piece of shit. What is wrong with me? What did I do? It just takes one fucking cut. I promised my damn husband that I wouldnâ€™t cut myself. I fucking promised! I donâ€™t want to keep it anymore! I donâ€™t want to live! I just need purpose... Iâ€™m just a useless waste of space...
