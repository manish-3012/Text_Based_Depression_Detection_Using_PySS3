I've got the gun loaded, the pills picked, and diminishing reasons to not use them.At the same time that I wonder why I'm posting here because people serious about killing themselves don't ask the internet for help... They just get on with it. 

I have the wit to know that a month ago I wouldn't ever have been here... And then everything went to shit.

I thousands in debt, depression has led me to missing an health insurance paint meaning I'll be without it for at least a month (and thus dealing with withdraw), my family can go fuck a goat, my friends have all moved away, the pain robs me of my everything and the drugs take the rest.

Why shouldn't I end my objectively provable suffering? Why should I continue to hurt every day, with every movement, every breath? Why should I put up with the powerlessness my body compels upon me when I have an option that solves all my problems... All of them,  current and potential. Why should I avoid the finality and peace of not hurting any more?

I'm just not interested in finding out the myriad ways my body will continue to degrade. I'm tired of being dicked over by incompetent doctors. 

I'm tired of witnessing my country turn to shit and the people march happily toward their own deaths oblivious of the torture they compel upon others. 

I'm tired of watching my parents descend into dementia and not being able to so anything but witness. 

I'm tired of telling the truth when lying fixes everything for others. I'm tired of being told to be moral by immoral dickwads. I'm tired of stupid fucks wasting their health and then lecturing people on how they struggle with eating to god damn much food and how that gives them the insight into my life because their fucking knees hurt.

I'm tired not getting laid because I can barely move myself, let alone slap an ass correctly.

I'm tired of not being able to sleep for days at a time. 

I'm just... Done

Fuck it. I'm out.
