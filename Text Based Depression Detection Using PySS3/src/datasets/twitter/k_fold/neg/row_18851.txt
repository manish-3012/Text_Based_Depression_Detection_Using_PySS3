Losing myselfever since i was a teenager i always thought about suicide, im now 27years old. i feel like im losing myself and i cant fight it no more. i cant sleep, dont have energy to cook or clean. i get mad at my child for every little thing which i know isnt right. i try to set goals but have no motivation at all to do them. i lost my mother last year and wonder why not me why her? i feel like the only thing keeping me here is my child but its hard because i cant be the mother my child deserves. im scared because i know im losing myself to a battle i cant fight. i feel so alone. im scared if i go to a doctor for help they will take my child away from me. i dont know what to do, i feel like a huge failure
