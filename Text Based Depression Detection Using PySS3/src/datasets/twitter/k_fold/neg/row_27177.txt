Iâ€™m such a loserExcuse the long incoherent rant/vent, Iâ€™m just in pain and have nowhere else to turn to.

My life is such a mess. Iâ€™m only 20 years old and Iâ€™m already severely disappointed in myself and how my life has turned out. Maybe thatâ€™s way too young to feel this way, but I donâ€™t see things getting any better.

I suffer from really bad anxiety and self esteem issues. This along with the stress that comes with most jobs make it very difficult to hold one. I actually just got let go from my last job because the stress and the anxiety hindered my work performance so greatly that I wasnâ€™t able to perform up to expectations. My grades at college are also plummeting, as Iâ€™ve lost all of the motivation and strength to do the work. I just feel tired all the time and it leads to me not doing it.

I donâ€™t have a car. Iâ€™m stuck in the house all day and have no means of socializing aside from the internet. I have no friends and nobody that cares for me outside of my immediate family, and itâ€™s been this way for years now. Iâ€™m alone 95% of the time and itâ€™s made me very lonely and depressed. I wish I had the money to Uber places on a consistent basis or the energy to walk, but I just donâ€™t.

By extension, Iâ€™ve never had a girlfriend either. Iâ€™ve never even been friends with a girl before. Iâ€™m just such an unlovable loser that they want nothing to do with me. I donâ€™t blame them, nobody wants to be with someone whoâ€™s ugly, has no social skills, no car, barely any money, and no life. 

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My life has been such a disappointment and itâ€™s all my fault. I hate myself. At the same time I feel like I donâ€™t have the right to complain since there are so many people that have it worse, and that makes me hate myself even more. Iâ€™m shocked I havenâ€™t committed suicide yet, itâ€™s not like anyone would miss me anyway.
