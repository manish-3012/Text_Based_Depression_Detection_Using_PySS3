Iâ€™m ready to end my life right now.I just turned 20 and as of the last few weeks Iâ€™ve had serious thoughts of suicide. Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide before and going as far as leaving a suicide note, but had never acted on it. This is the first time Iâ€™ve felt compelled to post about this or tell anyone for that matter because the thoughts are getting worse by the day. My life isnâ€™t horrible and Iâ€™ve been doing very well for myself since becoming an electrician and have had a solid group of friends for years. For some reason I feel an emptiness and my depression is getting worse. Iâ€™ve been having recurring nightmares of me dying in very traumatic ways and have been crying a lot. I donâ€™t know what to do and I guess this is a last ditch effort of turning for help. The one thing thatâ€™s stopping me from committing suicide is thinking of my mother and knowing how she would react. Sheâ€™s a recovering alcoholic who just got over a divorce with my father and has really gotten her life together since then. I donâ€™t want to throw a wrench in her life and her having to grieve over her son who decided to be selfish and killed himself. Iâ€™ve been thinking about that a lot and my mom being the only reason I havenâ€™t done it, but Iâ€™ve been justifying suicide more often than not now. I need serious help and donâ€™t know who to turn to.
