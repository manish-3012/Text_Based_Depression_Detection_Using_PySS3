DAE constantly wish for an accidental death?I feel like I'm too much of a coward to kill myself. But I find myself constantly wishing I would die in some sort of accident. Any time I'm in a situation where death is a possibility, I wish it would happen to me. Just me, I don't want anyone else hurt. Perhaps crossing the street I get hit by a vehicle and die, or something falls on me from above. 

Maybe that would hurt my family less too.

I don't enjoy feeling that way but it's always there.
