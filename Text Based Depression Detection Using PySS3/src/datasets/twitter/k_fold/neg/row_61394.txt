I'm tired of losing peopleThe last year has been hell. I was almost burned out of my house for a second time. I lost four uncles, four aunts, and two classmates. Earlier this week, the day before my eighteenth birthday, my favorite aunt died. She died before I could see her. My grandparents are both in failing health and my parents' marriage is feeling the strain. 

I'm so fucking sick of losing everything. I'm sick of losing people, sick of being alone. I pushed away all my friends and purposefully was as mean as I could to get them away from me. I'm not going to lose anything else on someone else's terms. I'm taking things into my own hands.
