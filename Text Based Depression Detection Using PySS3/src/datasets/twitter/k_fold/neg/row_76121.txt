Feeling hopeless and trapped in my miserable lifeI'm 26 years old soon to be 27 in a couple months and haven't accomplished anything worthwhile in life outside of becoming a mom 2 years ago. I don't have my bachelor's yet because of so many roadblocks (financial, anxiety and depression making it hard to make the lifestyle changes needed, my ASD, family problems, stupid things like that). My boyfriend and I are barely intimate anymore because we never see each other and he's just tired on the weekends, and he's ridiculously paranoid about another pregnancy at this point even though I have the Paragard. I am living paycheck to paycheck in a place that's too expensive but am stuck there until the end of next June. I have tried repeatedly putting in applications for other jobs (even making cover letters and all), yet hear nothing back except for emails saying "we decided to pick a candidate that was more qualified" bull. I make about $16/hour after shift diff but this is barely cutting it with my bills. Boyfriend doesn't make a whole lot more as a bartender.

I've tried counseling through a program at work but I have the bare minimum Medicaid, that's it and only get 6 sessions a year. I went to counseling when I was 16 after I tried to kill myself by way of overdosing. Suicide is a door that's been opened and have struggled to close for the last 10+ years. Thanks for listening all, hopefully this rut ends because I'm running out of the energy to fight just to survive in this crazy world....
