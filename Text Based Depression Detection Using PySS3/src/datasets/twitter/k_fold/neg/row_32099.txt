The only thing keeping me from killing myself is unreasonableI've been depressed for my entire life. All the people that I love are starting to give up on me, and I'm left with no one. I've wanted to kill myself for a while, but the one thing holding me back is that I want to lose my virginity before I die. However, I'm starting to realize that it's impossible. I have aspergers, severe depression, extreme social anxiety, paranoia, and I have a really small penis. There's no reason why anyone would even consider dating me, or even talk to me. I'm wondering if I should just stop trying and get my life over with already
