Why have I fully given up but still not killing myselfI fully gave up. I'm doing anything anymore. I am SO absorbed in the idea of killing myself and being saved from endless suffering. But why am I not killing myself? 

I think about this everyday. This is how it ends. I'm going to kill myself, and be done. But I CAN'T.

Whenever I *actually* get to do it, this idiot in my brain says that I have potential in life, blah blah blah 

This SUCKS. IT SUCKS. Agh
