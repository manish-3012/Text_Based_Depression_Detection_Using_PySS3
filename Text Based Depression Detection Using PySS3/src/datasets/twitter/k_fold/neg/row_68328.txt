It's not worth it anymoreI'm a few years shy of 40. Over the years, I tried seeking help. I was in therapy for my depression &amp; anxiety. It got worse after my dad died, and progressively worse after my mother died earlier this year. Family cut ties with me after both my parents died. My own sister only wanted me around to look after her pets, she could honestly care less if I died since she's always been vocal about wishing I was dead ever since we were kids, even my parents wished they'd have either aborted me or abandoned me because I was such a disappointment to them. I've tried reaching out to friends, but they cut ties with me and view me as a burden. I've tried making connections even with strangers and that doesn't even work. Either they want money or they're superficial and care only about a persons looks than give a damn about them. 

I have no one. No one that wants me, no one that cares. I'm just alone in the world, and there's nothing worth living for.
