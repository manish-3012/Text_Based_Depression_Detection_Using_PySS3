Tomorrow is the worst day of the year for me... and this is why...[Andrea](http://i.imgur.com/4QZPh.jpg)

She was 17. It's been 3 years and the pain is just as bad as the day I found out. I'm just hoping to motivate someone who might be in her position to please get help. You have no idea how taking yourself away from your family and friends will impact them. I was a close friend of hers and there is a piece of me that has died. I feel so much sadness when I think about her. I can barely remember how she sounded, her mannerisms, our memories... So fellow redditors, if you are in a place of darkness please, PLEASE reach out. I would have done anything to have helped out my dear friend. ANYTHING. Go to your friends, family, a counselor, hotlines, or fellow redditors... nothing is worth your life. 

April 12th sucks. :(
