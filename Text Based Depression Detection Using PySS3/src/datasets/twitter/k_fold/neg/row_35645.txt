I'm not ok. Someone please help meI'm not happy. I'm not ok at all. My life has gone to shit, I have no one. I'm lonely, even though I have a girlfriend. I'm so tired of living and I want to die. I can't function properly, and I cry so much. I can't sleep, and I barely want to eat. I'm thinking of ending it all. I just need a shoulder to cry on, I just want to feel loved and safe. But I don't feel any of that. I hate myself so much and I need someone, anyone. Please help me
