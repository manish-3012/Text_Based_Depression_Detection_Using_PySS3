Tired of being transWell, amongst other things. But it feels like that's what makes it unbearable, if I was cis I would at least have a dick. But instead I have depression, ocd, autism and no dick but lots of dysphoria and live as an unemployed loser in an institution, it's just... too many things at once, you know? I can't start T until I've been stable for six months, and not being able to start T makes me want to kill myself, it's a vicious cycle that probably will never end. I've wanted to commit suicide since I was twelve, that's a decade in a little over a year. I've got so little hope left. I'm tired. If I had the means to do it, I would, but because I live where I live, there's no access to knifes or medicine. I just go through everyday trying to make the best of it, but it's useless, I'll always just be a burden for everyone, myself included. Society would probably be better off without me, the money they waste on me could go to people who actually could do something with it. 

And would you believe throughout this whole thing, in this second, I've had compulsions to reword things or whole sentences, because life seems to love to mock me. I'm about done. 

I don't really expect any answer to this, but I wanted to write it somewhere, even if no one cares about it. Not sure if this should be marked nsfw by the way.
