this is it, im doneim gonna buy a rope in the next few days and ill keep that fucker by my side everywhere i go

in the right moment i will go and fucking hang myself. im done.

i am done crying to myself because of my abusive mother

i am done crying because my father abondened me

i am done crying because i am failing academically

i am done crying about life

this is not worth it anymore. i simply cant do it anymore. its too much to bear. i dont wanna wait a few years for it to get better. id rather be dead.

im just so sorry about the people that care about me. i love my friends so very dearly. you are the reason i kept going at all.
