I feel like everyone's against meI want to kill myself because I feel alienated from the world. I feel like everyone's against me and that people want to abandon me. I feel like society hates me just because I'm me. They're all against me and treat me like I'm a bad guy. They want to hurt me and watch me suffer and laugh at it. People hate me and would never have any love for me.
