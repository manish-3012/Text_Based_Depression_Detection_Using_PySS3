Iâ€™m at a point where I hate my life. I donâ€™t even want to live anymore. I just hate being alive.Iâ€™m not writing this in anger, but in sadness. Being alone all your life. Having people tell you hurtful things. I donâ€™t even want to talk to other people because theyâ€™ll think Iâ€™m â€œattention seekingâ€ or â€œfakeâ€. 

Growing up I was the punching bag for my brother, literally. Heâ€™d throw slurs at me and slam me into the wall, leaving me with bruises. My father would even hit me and my mom. I hate it when people say you should depend on family. I hate family. They arenâ€™t worth anything to me. 

Friends arenâ€™t worth anything either, you tell them youâ€™re problems thinking that theyâ€™ll be there for you but they turn their backs and stop talking to you. 

I put a smile on my face so people assume I have no problems and that Iâ€™m always happy. But for me, itâ€™s a defense so that no one can really know how I feel. 

My family calls me â€œfakeâ€. But I act the way I do because they treat me like Iâ€™m worthless. At school I can be who I really am because I donâ€™t have that same weight on my shoulders. But if that makes me fake then so be it. 

Thereâ€™s just so much hate inside of me. Growing up in a toxic household has made me hate everything in my life. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll find happiness. Iâ€™m so tired of trying to hold on and trying to be happy. But now that Iâ€™m stuck at home, my life has been living hell. I canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of everything and everyone.
