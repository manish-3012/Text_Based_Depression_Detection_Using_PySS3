where are the solutions?dear god I have googled over and over again ways to get out of a suicidal low and never find shit. i donâ€™t want to call someone. that gives me anxiety. i canâ€™t call to make an appointment with a therapist at 12:30 am, so i just cry myself to sleep. 

i want a solution that works quickly, something to either distract me or heal me a bit from the shitty feelings/lack of feelings.

what are your â€œquick fixesâ€ or simple things that help you get out of your funk, even if itâ€™s for a little while?
