Sorry if this doesn't make senseI don't really speak english that well and I'm an absolute mess nowadays so I don't think my writing will be that good. Since my uncle killed himself when I was 14 (i'm 23 now) suicide was something that never left my mind. I've been through so much stuff since then from failed relationships to close friends leaving the town to pets dying to bad professional/academic experiences, suicide has always been an idea that was present for me. Sometimes it was just a whisper, sometimes it was a roar and I think nowadays it's so loud it's deafening me.

I just don't like to be alive anymore. I'm just fed up with keeping it going. I don't want to keep it going anymore, I spent way too many years of my life forcing myself to make things work but I'm just tired. I have this huge collection of failures, of things I regret, of traumas and situations I don't like to remember. I just feel like now I failed at absolutely everything and there isn't really anything else than die for me right now. I spent too much time and energy into all those things that turned out going bad, I'm simply not willing to try everything again.

I failed at graduating (it's my seventh consecutive year at college for a course that takes five to graduate) from the career I chose for myself and it was so difficult to make my parents understand I didn't wanted to do what they expected me to do. I failed as a son, I failed as an older brother (and pretty much as a father figure since my father doesn't live with us). I just have too much things hurting me from all those years that nowadays I don't function as a human the way I was supposed to do.

This is not the future I wanted for me. I never had any grandiose plans of becoming rich or having lots of expensive stuff, a car, a mansion, stuff like that. I always wanted so little, and even then, I failed at achieving that. 

I don't really believe in people anymore. I stopped believing in love many years ago, but nowadays I'm starting to question if something like friendship exists at all. People just hurt each other. And I know I hurt other people too. It makes me feel worse at myself. I feel like I failed at everything I believed it was correct. I just can't live with all this guilt. I always wanted to prove people wrong and show them that kindness and solidarity are important and possible. But then, trying to have a heart in this heartless world is impossible. They cut your wings mere seconds after you spread them. 

But it's not only me, there's the others. People just fail at being humans. They constantly need to belittle, to hurt, to humiliate the others. I started taking anti-depr meds when I was 11 because I was constantly bullied at school. I don't know if friendship exists at all or if it's just me that sucks at having friends. People just don't care about anything else other than themselves. I had so many asshole people as friends because I felt lonely and I needed to be close to someone. When I started finding people with whom I could actually "connect" with, people with similar worldviews and interests, I notice it comes to a point where people just stop caring about the people they call friends. It comes to a point when "friend" becomes just an empty word. I always was very shy, I always had problems with socializing but nowadays I simply don't want to interact with people anymore because I know all people are the same.

With all honesty, I think it would be fair to me that people get hurt if i kill myself because it's exactly what they have been doing for me all those years. I want people to feel bad at themselves and show them how hypocrites they are when they pretend they are great humans and stuff. 

I'm sorry for writing all this stuff that not only might not make sense in english as well as being a bunch of random stuff with little correlation between each sentence. I'm not even proofreading stuff because having to think of all those things again hurt me. I just wanted to tell someone that. I'm pretty sure those are my final days.
