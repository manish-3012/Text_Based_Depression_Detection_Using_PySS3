I'm not suicidal (anymore), but I just want to kill myself out of spiteMy life is actually going pretty great for once. Well, it did until my parents decided that I am too lazy and that they'll throw me out on my next birthday in june.
Lazy, aka I found a job, applied to several universities and studied. Lazy. 

My mother is untreated BPD and is the worst fucking bitch you can know. She goes from lovey dovey to monster in seconds.
We're eating peacefully and suddently she starts yelling.

And every time she's yelling she tells me to just kill myself.
And honestly, I really want to do it. Just to spite her. To hurt her.
She thinks words have no consequences and always excuses her abuse with "I was angry".
But her telling me to give up and self harm made me do exactly that. Of course she yeleld at me for it because she's a child, but you know.

She says I'm the only joy in her life. That I am the one thing that stops her from offing herself.
And I want to rip all joy she has away from her.
If I am what brings her joy I will end myself to make her miserable. To show her, her abuse and words had meaning.

I am usually not like this. I try to be understanding and I hate bothering anybody. I want peace and quiet.
But she just knows how to push my buttons and turn me into a spiteful asshole who wants to do harm.
