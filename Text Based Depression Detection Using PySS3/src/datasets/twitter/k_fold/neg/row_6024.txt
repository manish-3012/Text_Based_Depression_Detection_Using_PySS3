I'm not sure what to sayI guess a part of me just wants to feel connected to something, wants to feel anything. I don't know if this is appropriate for this sub, since I'm pretty sure I'm not in immediate, gun-to-my-temple-right-now danger of suicide, but I'm just so lost. It's becoming increasingly difficult for me to fake happy. I'm just so tired. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't know where I'm going with this. The honest truth is that if it weren't for the fact that my family would be devastated, I'd have done it a long time ago. I feel trapped.
