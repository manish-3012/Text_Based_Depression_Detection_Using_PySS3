I have nothing goodSo I (16 M) went back to school today (I live in England) and I was hoping it would be good and Iâ€™d have something to do but, due to covid, I probably wonâ€™t be able to see my friends much at all. Iâ€™m already feeling really shit so this makes everything way worse. I canâ€™t kms bc it would hurt others but I really want to just stop existing. Thereâ€™s nothing that makes me happy that can happen right now. I love seeing one of my friends and we were going to have a â€˜movie nightâ€™ but that canâ€™t happen. I really just want someone / thing to kill me so I donâ€™t have to live in this shit life anymore.
