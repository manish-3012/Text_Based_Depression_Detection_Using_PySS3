Sadness but also something to live forIdk who I want to rant to, I really have no one, but I really don't want to continue this life. I cause people to get mad at me all the time. It's so lonely having no one to be close to. I fuck up constantly. I had bad friends before and I left all of them, and I left my college and now I'm all alone. I have my family but I ruin their house because I'm messy because I don't function well and I guess I'm not a good child or sibling to them. I help my extended family, but I also fuck up with them. And I regret every word that I say. It's tiring, I'd just like to sleep forever. 

I guess the only thing I'm alive for right now is my plants, I really love them. I want to see them grow. I'm growing baby succulents and they're so cute. If I died, they would die because my family doesn't know how to take care of them, and I'm not sure if they would want them anyway. 

I guess I just want to live in a big house by myself (so that I don't ruin any more relationships) with big windows so my plants can grow well, where it's a little warm but not too much because I don't love heat. I want cats and I want to draw for a living. I mean in a perfect world. I wish the afterlife would be just like that so I can go away and be happy.
