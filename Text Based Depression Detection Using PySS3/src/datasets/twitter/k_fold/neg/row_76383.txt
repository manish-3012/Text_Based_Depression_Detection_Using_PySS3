I just took 10 pills + alcohol.  Can I finally die now?I found my roommates' pills.  I want to die.  I took them all.  I want to die.  Can I die now?

Edit: I am still here. It didn't work. Roommates found me this morning. Lied to them and told them I was fine and had not taken the pills so I didn't have to go to the hospital. 

Edit again:  I am still still here. Confided in a friend. Will be seeking help through my job which offers free therapy. Said friend will be holding me to that.
