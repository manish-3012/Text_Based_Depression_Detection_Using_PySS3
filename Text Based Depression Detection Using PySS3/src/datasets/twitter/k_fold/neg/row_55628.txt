I ruin every relationship I get inI have never been so suicidal and heartbroken, there is no one to even comfort me. 
I ruined my relationship with my bf and omg I hurt him so much, he was feeling depressed and I pushed him away and made him feel bad about it. 
I am such an awful person, everyday I pray I don't wake up in the morning but tonight I am honestly thinking about killing myself, I am a cancer on society no one will fucking miss me. I just can't get over what I did to him he was suicidal and needed help told me he didnt want to live to be 25 and I did nothing fucking nothing. 
I deserve to be alone.
I deserve to be dead.
He deserves better then me.
I hope when I die he finds it.
