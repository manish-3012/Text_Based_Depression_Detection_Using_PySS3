the only reason i haven't overdosed is because i can't afford to start taking drugstitle. i've never vaped or smoked because i get addicted to shit fast and of course, because i don't have money. i wish i could find the motivation to start bc i know it could help but i'm just binging on food instead, gaining fat like shit then barfing it all out 

anyways how's life
