A new type of suicidal thoughtsFirst off, might as well give some basic information. I'm 21 and I've been plagued with these thoughts since I was in my early teens. I've been through years of therapy, tonnes of different anti-depressants and anti-psychotics, none of it really seemed to help that much at all. I've just learned to live with it. Even after going through all these different professionals I've still never been properly diagnosed as having anything other than a slight anxiety disorder. 

I do like therapy though, it's nice to have that, but since I'm out of work for the next month or so, I'm out of therapy until I get my insurance back and I haven't been on any pills for over a year now.

In the past I used to idealize suicide as an escape from the pain and monotony of living, but lately it has become a much more intriguing idea. Nothing is necessarily wrong in my life, in fact things are going pretty well. I hang out with my friends as much as I can, I'm doing well in my college courses, I have two possible internships lined up for the summer, I go back to work in a month or so as I previously stated, and lately I've been hooking up with this girl every other weekend or so when we both are free. Despite all this I still constantly live with these suicidal thoughts.

They just seem to be there, as they've always had. The more I think about them, the more interesting it seems to actually go through with it. I honestly just want these thoughts to stop. Everything is perfect and I hate it because at the end of the day I still wish to not wake up the next day. I exercise frequently, I eat healthily, but I do smoke cigarettes and drink. I do not know if that's a contributing factor, honestly it's been something that I've picked up in the last year and a half to help pass the time and help cope with the stresses of juggling relationships with friends and family, work, and college courses. 

In short I want to commit suicide as an escape from having suicidal thoughts rather than as an escape from living and I have never experienced this before. I do not know what to do. Maybe it's because I have too much free time now, maybe it'll go away for a little while when I go back to work, but I highly doubt it'll go away fully. 24 hours is a lot of time and I try to use it as to the best of my ability with reading, exercise, writing, Netflix, video games, school work, classes, hanging out with people, but no matter how I do I'm still left alone with these thoughts and I'm getting sick of it. It's as though I don't know how to be happy.
