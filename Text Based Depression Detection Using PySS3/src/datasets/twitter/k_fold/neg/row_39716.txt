How can I make this easier on my parents?The last thing I want to do is hurt them. I love them so much and the guilt of this all is destroying me. However I never asked for this life, and I've been thinking long and hard about my decision and it is without a doubt the best option for me at this point. So is there anything I can say in a letter to help them understand, *anything* I can do so they don't suffer once I'm gone? They will still have my brother, and he has a much, much more promising life than mine so I feel that they will be fine in the end. But I just want to be sure.
