I think Iâ€™m ready this time.I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this, as Iâ€™ll probably leave something physical, anyway. Probably just to yell at a wall, and if I post it, probably to give some explanation to the people that are expecting things of me here. 

I donâ€™t mean to abandon anyone or anything. Not that I think Iâ€™m that important or that it matters all that much. I just donâ€™t want anyone else to think that this was their fault. Because itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s mine. 

Iâ€™ve been extremely sad for a very long time. Iâ€™ve tried again and again to get help. Iâ€™ve tried to improve my home life, Iâ€™ve tried moving, Iâ€™ve tried furthering my education and getting new jobs. I tried leaving my church, I tried being independent. I tried therapy and venting and seeking out validation and none of it matters. Itâ€™s all so much effort and all I am is tired and miserable. 

I hate myself so much. I hate all of the things that Iâ€™ve let happen to myself. I hate how much it affects me. I donâ€™t want to be myself. Iâ€™ve never wanted that. But I think this is the first time that I genuinely donâ€™t even want to be alive, anymore. 

I tried to kill myself in middle school, but I fucked it up. And I realized that I wanted to really try. I told myself for years that all I needed to do was wait until I was older and independent and had control of my life. But I donâ€™t have control of anything. I still hate myself, I still donâ€™t want to wake up in the morning. I donâ€™t want to die, I donâ€™t think. I just donâ€™t want to exist anymore. 

And before I was afraid but I think now Iâ€™m even more scared of continuing. Thereâ€™s nothing here for me. I feel like a life insurance policy thatâ€™s about to expire. Thatâ€™s my only value, and itâ€™s about to run out. My mom is sick, she could use it. I donâ€™t have anything Iâ€™m working toward anymore, anyway. Any excuse I had before seems so trivial now. I wonâ€™t care when Iâ€™m dead. I donâ€™t even care now. 

Nothing is better. Nothing will ever be better. Itâ€™s nobodyâ€™s fault but mine. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m compatible with any of this. And thatâ€™s my fault, too. Thatâ€™s where the weight falls off of my shoulders, I think. Just admitting that I did this to myself. That no one else can help me out of it, no one else can fix it. Just me, and I already know that I canâ€™t.

Anyway. Just wanted to thank you guys, I guess. You really tried to help me, youâ€™re all wonderful. And Iâ€™m grateful for all of the time that anyone ever put toward me. Iâ€™m sorry it went to waste. Better luck to you.
