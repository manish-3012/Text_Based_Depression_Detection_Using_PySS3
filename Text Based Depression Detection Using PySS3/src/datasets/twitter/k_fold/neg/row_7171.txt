Crippling loneliness and being unlovableThat's me. None of my friends at college would miss me if I killed myself. They've all got eachother. Meanwhile I have to sit next to an annoying shit. 

My mum wouldn't miss me. I cause her more pain than happiness. I'm rude when I'm stressed and I'm stressed all the time. She hit me yesterday.

My cousins, aunts and uncles would not miss me, I'm pretty sure.

My ex used my kindness for her own gain. I doubt she ever loved me. I have no lovable qualities. 

I pushed away my friends who aren't at my college. When I was going through a hard time a while back I relied on them and only spoke about my problems. They hate me now, I'm pretty sure. I could try to reconnect but I don't want to bother them. 

The only people who would miss me are my dad and brother. They mean the world to me, but things are starting to really get on top of me and I don't feel like I'll be able to change any of it.
