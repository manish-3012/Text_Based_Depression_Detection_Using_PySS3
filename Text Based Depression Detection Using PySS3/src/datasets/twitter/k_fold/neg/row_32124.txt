Not even scared of suicide anymore(15M) Iâ€™m suicidal as fuck. And I keep on thinking how peaceful it will be if I just end it all, I get a sense of peace when I think about it and fuck itâ€™s so ecstatic. Itâ€™s like the biggest high you could ever get, I just feel clear headed, warm and happy. 

Iâ€™m apparently a ticking time bomb, but is that really such a bad thing? Is it really that bad that I just want to end all the mental pain and suffering I deal with.

If I just bought a gun right now, And put it to my head, Pulled the trigger. Would it really be a mistake?

Is the pain and mental torment something that will go, because I want to live but itâ€™s so hard with the amount of pain I feel. I have a therapist I see, and Iâ€™m seeing her soon again in person (corona had me on calls instead). Should I tell her? What will happen if I do? I just want whatâ€™s best for myself and right now that feels like itâ€™s ending it all.
