I don't plan on living much longerI don't care about life anymore. I donâ€™t think it can get any worse but the peak in my life was 7 years ago. It doesnâ€™t look much brighter further along. I donâ€™t plan on finding out if it does because the answer is probably no. I keep a rope with me at all times. On a bad day Iâ€™ll just slip somewhere isolated and tighten it around my neck. I donâ€™t care how slow it is.
I have a fucking collections of problems, ADD, Psychosis, depression, self harm, suicidal thoughts. Lately my psychiatrist has been thinking I might have an anxiety disorder. I donâ€™t care about those problems anymore because I have an ultimate solution to every problem Iâ€™ve ever had. In therapy they always said to remove yourself from the situation so I think Iâ€™ll put it into practice.
I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this. I donâ€™t expect anyone to notice it. I donâ€™t like venting. I love ranting, I hate the world and canâ€™t fix it but this isnâ€™t really a rant. Maybe in some part of my mind I want help. I donâ€™t want help. I donâ€™t want to be locked up a 4th time. If I do I can just strangle myself there. 15 minute inbetween checks is more than enough time. So I guess I just want to leave a message behind. 
So here it is, my message, I wonâ€™t say society killed me or some pseudo-deep qoute. I killed myself. Looking at the earth and if I would want to live on it, I would make the same decision. I just want death.
