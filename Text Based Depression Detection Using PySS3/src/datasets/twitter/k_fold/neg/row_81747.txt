Everything bad hits me all at once, disappointed so many people, and I just don't want to be a burden anymore.I've always been extremely emotional and I've always taken everything to heart - I respond really badly to criticism. Back in high school, I was a complete mess - I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts, but as I progressed throughout I've gotten better. That was back in 2013. This year, after 4 years, those same depressing thoughts are back. In the last few months I've really disappointed family and friends. I'm really starting to believe that people will be better off without me, I won't be a burden on them anymore. I don't know if I want to kill myself, but I really feel like it isn't a bad idea. I'm just so tired of being a constant disappointment to myself and to others. I'm sorry if this doesn't make any sense to anyone or if anyone finds that I'm making a big deal out of nothing. It's my first time posting something like this online. I'm not ready to start talking about this to anyone I know, I'm scared that I'll just be more of a burden.
