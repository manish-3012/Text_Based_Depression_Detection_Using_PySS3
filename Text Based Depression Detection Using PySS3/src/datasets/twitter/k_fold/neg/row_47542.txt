I can't stand hearing "I am sorry you are feeling this way" shit.You know what I hate most in this sub and in society in general? That when I start sharing something bad,negative experience, people say "I am sorry you are feeling this way". No, you are not fucking sorry. You honestly don't know me and you don't feel fucking sorry. I get sick to just stomach when I hear it is read it. What the fuck do people expect this phrase will make me feel like? Better? You do realize people that this "I am sorry you are feeling this way" is a complete bullshit unless someone who just wants to whine and complain abd then after getting attention keep living their life till they want attention again? 
This fucking stupid phrase is another reason why some 9eople don't want to talk to anyone and just go and kill themselves. No one needs your fucking sorry. No one needs your pity or sympathy to be honest. People are so much pain inside that they just want to end it or stop feeling this pain by erasing all their past,all their memories, coz their own mind is a prison. Your fucking "I am sorry you are feeling this way" makes it only worse. Rant is over.
