There sure are a lot of these, don't know why you'd care about mine... but here.I hate myself and want to die.

I'm ugly. I'm fat. I have a shit job. I can't support myself, much less my sick mom. 

I think most people who know me/see me in public would like to see me die. I know, really they don't give a fuck one way or another, but if you gave the average Redditor a picture of me, the comments would mostly be  -  "Go die, fat bitch."

On top of all that I left my husband because I cheated on him. I don't want to go back. So that's just one more reason why Reddit would love to kill me in nasty ways.
