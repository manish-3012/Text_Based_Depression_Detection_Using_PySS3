Crying.. Again...I feel so unbelievably terrible.
Just when I thought my life was coming together, it comes crumbling down again.
When I finally start to feel better about myself and my life and like a capable adult and my family was wrong about me, life comes to drop kick me in the face and remind me that I will always be shit.

Eve worse, I can't stop thinking about how life was going to be with my ex.
He was in school, getting three really good degrees. I knew with him I'd never have to stress about money. This just makes me feel even worse because I realize that I would be using him. And I know the reason I miss him lately is because of the fact that I'm broke and about to be fucked and I just hate my life.

I want to fucking die.
