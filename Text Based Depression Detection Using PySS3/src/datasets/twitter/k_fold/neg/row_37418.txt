A.T.BThose are my initials. 
I still plan to end it.
Just don't know when.
Sick of feeling like a burden.
Don't feel I have support of family or friends.
I live someone dearly, probably the only reason I'm still here. Well him and my grandfather.
I wrote this as my eyes begin to year.
Why do I feel like I'm such a waste that I simply don't belong here. 
When I end it I'll make sure to show all those who "cared" so they can see inside my head and maybe wish they actually helped me before I dissapeared.
