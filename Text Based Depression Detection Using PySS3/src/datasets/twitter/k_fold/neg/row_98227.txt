Something off my chestOld people scare me, they always have. I went into a nursing home a month ago and the whole place was sad. Their bodies and mind betraying them, people who had no say in the matter sitting there- rotting away second by second and day by day. It's always scared me, or maybe sickened is a better word?

I want to live, but I don't want my body to rot slowly over time. I'm seeing it happen to my mom, and I can't think about it, I tried. I'm getting older, but I'm still young and I feel the storm approaching. 

I was driving home the other day, and was in a decent mood. I passed a cemetery and a thought crossed my mind. It was basically a thought of my own mortality. How I'm here- still alive, on my way home to eat a little ice cream and do some homework. And all of those shells laying there in that hill- lives I know nothing about. What is there story? 

I felt ill. 

I really do want to live. 

But I don't want my body to get old, 

and I don't want the ones I love to go back to the universe. 

Or in a more realistic approach, I don't want their brains to rot in the dirt.

And I don't want any of you too either.
