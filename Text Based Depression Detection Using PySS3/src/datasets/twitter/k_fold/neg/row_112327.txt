I should be happy. Depression won't go away and I can't take it anymoreI've made so many steps to make myself happy and I'm finally in a position where I should be.I moved out of my parent's house and to my dream town. I'm living self sufficient and in paradise. I often find myself marveling at how perfect my life is right now.

But every fucking night I get the same feeling of helplessness and loneliness that I just can't fucking shake. Every future task feels so fucking impossible and it keeps hurting more and more, night by night. Sometimes during the day I forget about it completely but right now it hurts bad enough that I don't want to wait for that to happen.

I'm worried I'll do something stupid. I have no friends here so I just really need someone to vent to. Anyone. I'm afraid of myself
