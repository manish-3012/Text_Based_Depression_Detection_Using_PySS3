I havenâ€™t told anyone I want to dieI fucked up big time and I want to die. I have a massive amount of debt and I wonâ€™t be able to pay it. I donâ€™t see a way out. 

I have a few friends who know about the financial issue but they donâ€™t know I want to die. My SO (Who is depressed and is struggling with suicidal thoughts too) has no clue. 

My heart is racing. I really want to die guys, I really really do. I want to slash my wrists now but I know I wonâ€™t do the cut properly. My hands are shaking. I want to go to the lake and drown. Or die of hypothermia. I want to throw up. I want to throw myself in front of a moving train.
