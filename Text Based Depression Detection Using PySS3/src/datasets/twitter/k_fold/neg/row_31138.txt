Killing myself Sunday nightI don't really want to, but it's the only way.

A year ago I had been recovering from anorexia, which I did successfully I may add. Reached a healthy stable weight. Worked through all my behaviors, and most of the thoughts.

However, around that time I started to get sick. It's a long story, but at this point I'm essentially crippled. There's so much wrong with my body, and everyday fucking day is hell. 

And yet, I could maybe live with shitty health. Unfortunately, my endocrine system has been really wrecked. There's no treatment (as most of my hormone levels are in normal range, even though I have a ton of hard, physically evident symptoms), one of which is rampant weight gain.

In 8 months I've gain 60 lbs, 20 in the past month. Literally nothing I do helps. Two dieticians are confounded as to what's going on. Because of the nature of my condition, it's not going away any time soon.

I'm losing my mind because of how fat I've gotten, and I'm only getting fatter. Body image is the one thing I didn't fully work through, because I was able to accept my healthy weight, but this...I'm too fat. I have to die.

I know it sounds crazy. It's the most asinine thing, killing myself because I'm fat. But I can't live with myself like this. Therapy has stopped working. Don't suggest meds.

I bought a gun, will clean the house and pack my stuff, then unless something happens, I'm doing it. I can't live with being fat.
