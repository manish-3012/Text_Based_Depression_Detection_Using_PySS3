Is it weird that i can have sex without emotions?Someone asked me recently if i felt anything/had emotions because i told them i had previously had sex 20 or so times in the past 3 months with 8 or so different people and i didnt really care for them. I dont think about them unless im horny and im only with them if its fun otherwise i stop seeing them, meanwhile alot of them got really attached to me and even harass me to come see them. Am i weird? Is this just me? I mean this is how i treat most people i guess
