Nothing interests me so whatâ€™s the point?I have no desire at all to play the stupid game of being a wage slave for most of your week in exchange for shit pay and two days off. There are no jobs out there that are tolerable enough for me to want to stay at. Every job I get I always dread talking to the people I meet and I dread doing the work itself. But itâ€™s not like I have options since realistically this is the only road for most people. Itâ€™s so fucking depressing and I donâ€™t know what to do. Life is already a pain but add wage slavery for no real gain and itâ€™s a fucking nightmare. I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™ll be able to hold on because thinking about my existence and what Iâ€™ll be doing is too painful and it kills me.
