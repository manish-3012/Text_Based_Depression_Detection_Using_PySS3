Need EncouragementIâ€™m really struggling really hard. My self esteem feels at an all time low and I donâ€™t have anyone I can talk to. I donâ€™t have family (they disowned me) or any friends, most of them have told me that they want a â€œbreakâ€ from me and when I ask for comfort lately it only frustrates and annoys others. Everyone seems to have a reason Iâ€™m a terrible person and I feel like Iâ€™ve been rejected by everyone in my world and they all have a reason they donâ€™t want to be around me. Iâ€™ve been told thereâ€™s no trust that I could be a better version of myself, just that Iâ€™ll be broken always and make the same mistakes and never learn. 

No one knows just how bad I feel, or really cares. Iâ€™ve gone 6+ months before without anyone even trying to contact me in any form. If I donâ€™t say anything, no one says anything to me. 

Even some encouragement or compliment would just make a small difference in my life right now. Where do the lost and broken go when no one cares about them? Am I really that bad of a person? Should i stay away from people so I donâ€™t keep hurting others?
