Not afraid of dying, afraid of survivingThe days have grown long, cold, dull, and grim.  The loneliness is too much to bare, I am so empty and numb.  I do not want reasons to not die,  I want reasons to live.  I do not have anything anymore, I have nothing more to go on for.  My family made me this way, my friends will be  okay.  I am sick and tired of feeling like a constant burden, my  existence is selfish, all I do is take from and destroy those who  surround me.  My depression has never been worse and I have never felt  more alone and afraid of the future.  I do not want to get stuck in the  corrupt human life cycle of working, having children, growing old with your significant other, suffering, and then dying.  If I have to live my  life like that, I would rather not live at all.  My future is not a reason for me to live, it's a reason for me to not die, and living without happiness is not living at all, it is surviving.  I want to be happy again, I want to find peace within myself but I am too weak, too sad, and too fragile to save myself.  I need help, please.
