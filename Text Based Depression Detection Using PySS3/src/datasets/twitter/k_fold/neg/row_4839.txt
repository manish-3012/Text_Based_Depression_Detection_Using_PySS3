Life is making useless efforts, oooops!I'm not complaining about anything but then this is all I can feel for the past few days. A lot has happened to me in the past few years and I can't put in words what all I've been through. I am even below the rock bottom and I am genuinely hurt but not complaining of anything. 

The only thing that I think of is, what's the worst that can happen? A person will die right? But this thought will never scare anyone who is already begging for death. 
Then what should I care about? I've nothing to lose but I've lost everything already lol. I know nothing would ever work out for me because life isn't obliged to treat me good lol. And that's perfectly fine. 

But then why this endless pain and suffering? I'm numb already. 
The maximum that life do to me is, kill me and I already wanna die. So, isn't it a win win situation for life? I'm ready to offer life what it seeks from me. Then why this constant fight between me and my fate? I'm not against what it wants of me. It wants to kill me, yes I want the same. Then why this 'pushing me to the edge' thing. I'm at the edge, just kill me now. ðŸ˜‚

How can I make my fortune and god understand that they don't have to put any efforts anymore, I'm in for what they want. Indeed, I'm in for something even extreme. Ugh, wish I could pass this on God. ðŸ˜‚
