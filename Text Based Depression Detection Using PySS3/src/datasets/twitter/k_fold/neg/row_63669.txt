i'm tired and done with lifei hate philosophy and psychology and how it's become mainstream and now everyone's making value judgements on other human beings. i wish the internet was never ever made or i was born earlier or i wasn't so reliant on the internet due to being a programmer. at least i wouldn't have to be bombarded by 40 conflicting views on how to live life and each one saying that they're morally superior and calling other people pieces of shit. at this point i'm praying that the real world will give me some actual confidence to shake this shit off but i highly doubt it
