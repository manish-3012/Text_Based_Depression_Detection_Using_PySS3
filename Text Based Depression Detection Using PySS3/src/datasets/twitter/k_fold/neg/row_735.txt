its a roller coaster that won't endthis happens every couple of months or so. I have depression and anxiety. I would like an actual assessment but thats for another discussion.

im in the middle of a deep low and I just am tired of the never ending cycle. i feel everyone would be much better if I wasn't around, or reliable. Ive been out sick for three days now. stomach flu plus this worsening deep depression.
im so tired of living. nothing will ever change. nothing will ever get better. doctors will never listen. its all a busness anyway. I work in health care. there is nowhere to go.
