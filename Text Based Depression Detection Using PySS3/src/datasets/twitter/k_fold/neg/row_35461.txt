Why are people so fucking selfish?I donâ€™t get it. Iâ€™ve been getting out of my comfort zone and complimenting people. They just seem uncomfortable. I wish people would have more empathy. A good example of this is when a classmate committed suicide. There was a memorial held for him by a friend of mine, and guess what happened next week? No one talked about him since. Thatâ€™s a reason why I canâ€™t do it. People genuinely donâ€™t care.
