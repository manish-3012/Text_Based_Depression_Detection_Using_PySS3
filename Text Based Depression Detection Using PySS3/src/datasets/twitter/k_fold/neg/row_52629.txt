What's the most considerate way to commit suicide?I'm not looking to be talked out of suicide. What's the most considerate (for friends, family, law enforcement, whatever) and painless way to commit suicide? I don't want to make a big mess or shock anybody, and I'm considering keeping my suicide a secret and just making it seem like I decided to go off the radar and vanish. Problem is I'm not creative enough to think of something. Maybe something that ends with me sinking to the bottom of an ocean?
 
Thanks
