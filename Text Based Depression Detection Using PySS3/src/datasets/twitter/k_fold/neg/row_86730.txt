I'm heavy with my own griefEveryday is a struggle. I've stopped taking my medicine and I've gotten suicidal again. I have no friends that live near me. I know I'm a disappointment to my husband. I can't find a job with my degree. So I'm stuck at a low paying job. 

I'm just hoping if I can stay off my medicine long enough I'll have the courage to finally hurt myself. I don't want to go back to the hospital. I just want this to be over.
