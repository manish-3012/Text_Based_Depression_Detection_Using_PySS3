Is it normal to feel like this?I feel like life isn't for me. I don't care enough about anything or myself to do anything in life. I don't think suicide is that serious. I can't find anything to live for. 


I have nothing to lose. I'll probably end up killing myself one day. Nothing is causing me to want to kill myself but I think living is extremely boring.
