when is enough enough?nobody needs me. nobody would notice (at least for a few weeks) if i went missing.

i'm at the max safe dose on my antidepressants and still want to die.

over the past few years i've realized that the best thing for EVERYBODY I LOVE is to not be around me.

i'm sick of pretending i'm fine so i don't draw attention to myself. i'm sick of smoking weed just so i can fall asleep...and the weed doesn't even help the anxiety anymore, anyway. i'm sick of being completely alone, with nobody i can call on the phone to talk to and nobody i can go visit just because i need a hug.

the weed doesnt help anymore. the doctors don't help anymore. my medications don't help anymore.

i can't call the suicide hotline ppl cuz they are dicks (one actually told me to "just do it already"). i can't go to a hospital because, if they put me on suicide watch....i miss work and lose my job and THEN i kill myself... even if they temporarily manage to get me calm again.

i just...i dont have goals anymore. i'm just going through the motions. i'm a psych major and i keep telling myself "just give it one more day, the pain will lessen back down to manageable"...but it doesn't. it hasn't. 

at work they moved me away from my emotional safety net. i'm now completely alone. i was invisible all day. completely invisible.

nobody needs me. so why stick around??

i want my loved ones to be happy...and near as i can tell, they are. without me. now is the perfect time...because nobody is attached to me, nobody needs me. i wouldn't feel any guilt i i did it now.

i'm already a ghost figuratively. 25 years of dealing with this depression. i just want to fall asleep and never wake up.

i know i'm only posting this because a part of me still wants to be talked out of it...but please don't take it personal if none of you can. i have doctors and therapists...if they can't save me, you probably can't, either.
