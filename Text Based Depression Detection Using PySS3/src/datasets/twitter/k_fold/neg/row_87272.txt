I can never catch a fucking break.Around this time last year I was in a really dark place. I was 18 failed my 3rd suicide attempt. 3 days after I was driving down the road in my POS vehicle I had at the time that I was constantly repairing and it broke down in the middle of no where. I had a complete mental break down that week. Failed 6 out of 7 college classes.

I started seeing a therapist that I absolutely loved, started working on bettering myself, got a new car, and transferred to a bigger University that was 2 hours away. Both my therapist and I realized that would be best for me. It was even better that I could take my 25 credits from that college and to my new University and leave my 1.8 GPA behind and get a completely fresh start since that didn't transfer. 

And damn was life great. Found a new friends (never really had that before), found new interests, bigger city that I love, got my own apartment, and loving the whole college experience. 

2 weeks ago I went in for a simple 250$ car repair that later turned into 2,300$ and depleted my entire savings account. And yes before anyone says anything it was stuff that needed to be done, not just a mechanic trying to get more money from me. 

Fast forward to today, my car is not going back in tomorrow to get part of what was repaired two weeks ago replaced again ( faulty part ) but my car is also starting to make a weird ass noise and based off the noise and other factors it looks like that repair could also end up costing me 8-900 more dollars. 

So now I have to find a way to find that money asap so I can comute to class that's 15 miles away, and work since my job requires a vehicle with out loosing my sanity. 

For once I'd just love a fucking break. When ever shit starts to go right for me it just gets fucked up. I've always tried going above and beyond to help others, I've always fucking been there for people. Why the hell can't shit just go right for once.
