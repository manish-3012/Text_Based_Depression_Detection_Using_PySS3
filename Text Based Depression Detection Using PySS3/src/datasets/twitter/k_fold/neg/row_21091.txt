Kind of excitedthat I'll be jumping off a cliff tomorrow or Sunday.   


I've been a NEET (not employed, in education, or training) for 3 yrs. I have been intentionally making poor decisions to entrap myself so suicide would be the only option lol. Really didn't expect to live to 25 (almost 26), was hoping I'd die at 16. I'll probably leave my phone and stuff at home, and bring only bus fare one way. I'm thinking of stuffing my driver's license into my mouth then ducttaping it shut so they can ID me later for ezpzs. If anyone wants to see, it's Niagara Falls (Canadian side), I'll probably aim for that old concrete building below the cliff.  


If someone does come, let me know, I can plur you a 3D kandicuff before I go.
