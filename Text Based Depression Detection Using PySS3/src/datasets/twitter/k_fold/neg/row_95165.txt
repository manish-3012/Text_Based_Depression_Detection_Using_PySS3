I have a date for itI posted here a couple days ago that things were getting to be too much to ignore, and well, now they are. The search for a house is literally impossible, the council will take years to find me somewhere and private is a no-go because of negative stigma amongst landlords towards people who need housing benefit, and itâ€™s honestly the last straw. Even if I did find somewhere itâ€™s still only a matter of time until the next thing goes horribly wrong in this farce I call a life. And Iâ€™ll still be totally alone. So Iâ€™ve set a date, and if I donâ€™t find anywhere by then, which I wonâ€™t, then Iâ€™m doing it. I just need to figure out how. I donâ€™t fear death, but I do fear pain, and failure. So yeah. I donâ€™t even know what the point of making this post is, I guess I just needed to say this somewhere
