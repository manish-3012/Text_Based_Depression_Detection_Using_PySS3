I feel like the only reason I'm still here is because i haven't finished my suicide noteFor a while, I talked to friends and never would've committed suicide because I thought I couldn't have done that to my parents. I never told them about my depression or suicidal thoughts and only talked to a couple friends about it. They were excellent in supporting me and lately I thought I had been feeling better but I'm realizing that its actually just me caring less and less about everything. I don't really care about anything anymore and the only prevailing thought in my mind most of the time is to go home and end it. After I finish writing my notes (I'm writing one to each of my friends and one to my parents) i provably will send the emails and finally be done with this awful life. I don't know what to do anymore and I'm out of things to try to hold on to.
