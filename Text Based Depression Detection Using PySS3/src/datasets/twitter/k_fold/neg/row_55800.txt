Crippling Depression for 2 yearsI can't take it anymore, I feel exhausted and tired all the time. I feel like the world is trying to tell me I have to do something very bad to ever feel like myself again. I have no reason really for my depression, it started with a bad breakup and apparently I never could heal, I don't even care about that girl anymore but my pain never stopped. I take medication and go to therapy and it literally doesn't have an effect on me. I've looked for answers everywhere and I get nothing really. I feel like my life just got away from me and now I'm not even living really. I really want to kill myself because I feel like the universe isn't giving me a choice anymore. My life is hard for no reason. People will say it gets better but it doesn't ever. Why doesn't anything I do help? All my friends left me without trying to at least communicate with me first, I had the same group of friends for 8 years and they were like my family and they just left. I am at my worst now, I am overweight and have a terrible posture, no girl wants to get near me, no one wants to really be my friend. It feels like there is an agenda against me, like people think I'm the devil. I can't do it anymore, please help me just a little. All I need is a little help
