I just donâ€™t want to be here anymoreIâ€™m so sick of myself. Iâ€™m sick of who I am. Just thinking about how much of a worthless piece of shit loner I am makes me sick. If only people knew how little I think of myself. If only they knew how fucked up my head is. Theyâ€™d want nothing to do with me. But most people donâ€™t suspect a thing.

Iâ€™ve just had enough. Iâ€™m done with myself. I want to be destroyed until thereâ€™s nothing left.
