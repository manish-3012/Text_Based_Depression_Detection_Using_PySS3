I wrote a letter to 12 year-old me.Hi Pal. Weâ€™re at our witâ€™s end and itâ€™s just about time, but I wanted to talk first. I remember being you. I carry you around with me. I wish I could protect you from the pain that youâ€™re going to endure. I remember some days that you would be outside and look up at the clouds and wonder what youâ€™ll be doing in exactly 10, 15, 20 years. Wondering if older you will look up at those clouds and remember doing it when you were a kid. Having some sort of connection through time. 


Iâ€™m sorry that everything turned out to be so much less meaningful and hopeful than what you had in mind. I donâ€™t know where we went wrong. I donâ€™t know what choices we could have made to have the future you hope for us. We never become an astronaut like you wanted.


I know you often feel alone. Those thoughts in your head â€“the scary cartoons that haunt you at night, the horrible thoughts you have about people you love â€“ Iâ€™m sorry to tell you that they never really go away. They just change as you get older. Youâ€™ll try a lot of different things to make them go away, and they just wonâ€™t. Youâ€™ll meet other people who claim to suffer from similar things, but deep down youâ€™ll never really know if their suffering is the same as yours. 


Iâ€™m sorry youâ€™re so worried about hell. I know you promise God that youâ€™ll read the Bible and love him and you hope that thatâ€™s enough. I know Mom and Dad will try to reassure you, to tell you that God is love. But youâ€™ll only ever see him as a hateful monster to be feared, and eventually you wonâ€™t believe in him at all. Thereâ€™ll be some peace in that. And this IS something that other people go through. Youâ€™ll find them, and theyâ€™ll make you feel better about it. 


Youâ€™ll keep being confused about whether you like girls or boys. About why you like to feel like a girl sometimes. Youâ€™ll be embarrassed and it will hurt, especially in high school. Youâ€™ll say a lot of mean things throughout your life to hide the pain. Lots of people go through this, too. Iâ€™m sorry that you wonâ€™t really have anybody to talk to about it until youâ€™re older. Eventually society will become accepting of people like you. Youâ€™ll realize that you wish you had been born a girl. I wish I could say that you find some peace with it, but you wonâ€™t. Itâ€™ll cost you the only relationship that was ever meaningful to you. For what itâ€™s worth, youâ€™ll have an extremely pretty and wonderful girlfriend for a few years, and sheâ€™ll make you very happy even in the sadness. Youâ€™ll wish you could have married her and had a wonderful life together, and you'll wonder why other people get to have that when you don't. 


Your relationship with your parents is going to be rough. Youâ€™ll have a lot of yelling matches. Youâ€™ll disagree. Theyâ€™ll be unfairly harsh sometimes, especially in your teenage years. Youâ€™ll fear their judgment and disapproval and while youâ€™ll know they love you, youâ€™ll always feel like they kind of hate you, too. Itâ€™ll start to get better toward the end, which will only really make you feel worse. 


Donâ€™t blame them too harshly, though. Itâ€™s not really their fault. To be honest, I think thereâ€™s something very wrong with us, pal. Youâ€™ll go most of your life feeling like you annoy others, wondering why you donâ€™t fit in and why people dislike you. Youâ€™ll feel like your friends will secretly wish that you werenâ€™t part of the group, and eventually you wonâ€™t talk to them anymore even though they grow up and remain friends with each other. You wonâ€™t be able to connect with your coworkers, and youâ€™ll work in silence while they become friends. For a couple of years after you graduate high school itâ€™ll seem like maybe youâ€™re finally getting things together, but it wonâ€™t last. Youâ€™ll feel terribly alone all the time.

 
Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re committing suicide. I know you canâ€™t even imagine that. But you face a lifetime of loneliness and unhappiness. Iâ€™m grateful for the good times youâ€™re going to have. Iâ€™m glad that you have no idea how miserable things will become, because it would ruin the good while youâ€™re still able to enjoy it. Itâ€™ll be whatâ€™s called a â€˜small comfortâ€™, but youâ€™ll at least be grateful that you were able to have friends, love, and a family at all. You'll be grateful for your new little sister who makes your world more tolerable, even though you feel guilty about making her life worse by being a part of it. 


Maybe in the next life weâ€™ll meet, and I can apologize to you for screwing things up so badly. Stay strong, kid. Itâ€™s a bumpy ride.
