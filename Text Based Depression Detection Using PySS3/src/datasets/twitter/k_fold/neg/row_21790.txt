What's the pointLife is blizzare. We are taught from a young age to get up and work to earn money and to spend money. But what is the actually point of all this crap?
I feel so tired everyday, anxious meeting new people.. I feel like I lack any control over my life. I constantly overthink everything and when people tell me something or talk to me, I completely forget becsuse I'm more worried about how good my reaction to their story is.

Life is sickening and people are robotic, so again what is the bloody point?
