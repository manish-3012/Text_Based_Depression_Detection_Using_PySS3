Holy Fuck i just don't know.I just honestly don't know anymore.. Life's been pretty fucked the past few years. All i want is too be happy and not stressed or sad. 
But it's been week's maybe month's since I've been truly happy.

I'll start with this Fucked up freshman year of high school  skipped school all the time smoke pot and cig's  well toward the end of freshmen year I got something called alopecia lost all my hair in about a year in half. 
Lost all self confidence quit my favorite sport that i played for 12 years,put on about 25 pounds. I  pushed all my friend's away at least i quit smoking weed, but I dropped out for the rest of the year because i didn't know how to deal with it. Gave up on girl's had this one that lasted for about a year but i still told myself even that i was able to get a girl that i wasn't good enough for any girl that i was fucking ugly now because of the alopecia.

sophomore year was a little better started going to school met my dream girl even though she was my friend's sister and went to a different school  everything was pretty good for about 2 year's then we got caught sneaky around now i'm banned from talking to her (senior year now) she's a junior  I'm over it though just shit's fucked up now im back to saying i won't find myself a girlfriend ever  that i can't find a girl  most of my buddy's are in college now 
so like every other weekend i go there to party and just get beyond fucked and hook up with random girl's that mean nothing to me. and i don't want that I want to find a girl that I love and can call mine. I feel like i won't ever find a girl that i like or that accepts me for me. I just want to be gone.

My dad stopped talking to me when i was in about 6th grade and i don't really care but my mom want's to sue him for emotional damage and the only thing that hurt's is when he gets brought back up
I just wish i wasn't around now i wish i was i was gone.
