My cheating boyfriend left me after giving him a second chance because he was â€˜too hurtâ€™. Iâ€™ve had to give up my cat due to my working situation and I come home to an empty house after every camp shift. Itâ€™s soul crushing.I want to die. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore about anything. I know him leaving was good but Iâ€™m so devastated and lonely all the time. He abandoned me and left me with an apartment I can barely afford with a lease I cannot get out of. I have some friends I can talk to but when theyâ€™re not there I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. My mind always drifts to suicide and I canâ€™t make myself stop. What should I do?
