Death will mean freedom because it will be nothingness, and that's all I ever wanted. Why would I want to live forever or have an afterlife since life is so painful , isn't that a continuation of pain? I think about suicide all the time but I'm too much a coward and my mom of courseI don't know when, but I am certain I will die prematurely. Not now, not today. I sincerely hope that someday humans live a better life than today but I was not lucky enough . I've read different descriptions of heaven, some people said they die and they are surrounded by loved ones, but I don't want this. I want nothing and how humble can that be ? I pray that whoever reads this finds half the joy I will find in death, because death will mean the suffering here ends.
