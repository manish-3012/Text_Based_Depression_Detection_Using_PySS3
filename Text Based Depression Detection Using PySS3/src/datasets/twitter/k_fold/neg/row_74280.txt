goodbyeWell I just wanted someone to SEE me and see what it is that is the truth.  My husband only gives me love when I cook, clean, have sex with him, serve every meal,  work and work and work.  My daughter living at home is awful to me and treats me like garbage and he sides with her.  I have no way out.  I am done.  I took a ton of pills tonight.  I did throw up but it was only liquid and dinner - no pills.  I guess it is meant to be.  I feel unloved and invisible.
