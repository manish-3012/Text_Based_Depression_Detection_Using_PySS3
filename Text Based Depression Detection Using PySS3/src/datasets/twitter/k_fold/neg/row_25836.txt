Just wondering, anyone got a decent thing worth living forIâ€™ve already attempted suicide once, in fact just got discharged from the psychiatric ward. And itâ€™s pretty clear to me that Iâ€™ll never not be depressed, so why the hell should I continue living.

I actually got better, for some time. While I was in the ward I was actually happy and hopeful for the future, but it only lasted a couple of weeks. Then back to good old depressed. I fairly certain Iâ€™m just cursed to always be depressed. So why, why should I continue living
