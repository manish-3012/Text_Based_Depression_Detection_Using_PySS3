I don't know if I can keep going.I have been suicidal since I was 7. It started when I moved to a new country and lost the ability to talk to my family and all I had here was my mom. Around this time my father and mother also separated. And that's around the time I started fantasizing about my death. Next my half sister was born and I started to feel like I was burdening my family. I hid these feelings because I didn't like telling people if I felt any type of negative emotion, anger,sadness, etc.

Fast forward a couple years and I had to prevent my friend from committing suicide. The stress from that event made everything unbearable and I started cutting to relieve some of the load and it worked. Last year, I stopped cutting due to a promise I made to someone. And I was trying to get better and stop my suicidal thoughts. I told my mom how I felt and she ended up ranting about how my generation is "f**ked up" and that I shouldn't feel like this. And that just further confirmed that I and the way I feel is a burden and I shouldn't talk about it. I want to die but its illegal here and if my attempt doesn't work then I could be thrown in jail. I've already attempted once and failed. I'm starting to think theres no hope of feeling better. I've just felt so hopeless and tired of fighting to live. I really don't want to be here anymore.
