ThoughtsI've been thinking about suicide for about 3 years now. I'm a recovering drug addict and haven't had cravings to use since my last spree. Just thoughts of ending it. My last binge ended with an intentional overdose. I didn't want to wake up. I just wanted to fall asleep and be done. I have had very good days, but mostly apathetic days. Occasionally I've had bad days. I'm 4 months clean now, but I feel like I'm only staying for those who love me. Things that used to excite me aren't fun anymore. I don't do much. I don't see a therapist anymore because why pay for someone who you will tell the same thing every week and then one week speak your mind and be committed. I never want to go back to the hospital. My family has watched me go through two near death experiences, both self-inflicted, and I just don't want them to go through that anymore. I just don't want to do life for me. I want to dream forever and just never wake up to the real world again. Or just have lights out. I'm cool with that. I'm having thoughts today and I think it would be helpful to talk but don't quite know to whom. So thanks for listening.
