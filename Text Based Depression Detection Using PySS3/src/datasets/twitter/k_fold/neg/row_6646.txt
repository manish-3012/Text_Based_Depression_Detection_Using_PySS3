First and Last Post.Sometimes I feel like pain is going to go away, but I know it's not

unless I can figure out a way to deal with it, I'm probably going

into my garage and starting the car. I hear that is the best way to

commit suicide. Seems peaceful enough, but if I truly actually

intend to kill myself, is this guaranteed? Any better ways to try

dying in a peaceful but certain way? I just don't want for it

ending up being a huge mess for someone else...............
