I went to a gun range todayEvery. Single. Time. I reloaded the magazine, I contempted doing it. It would have been so easy. My instructor wasn't evem looking at me half of the time. I'm not sure why I didn't do it. I had family with me, so that might have been it. I wasn't depressed like I usually was. But it would have been so easy. Just a quick fire into my head and it would have been over. I would gather to bet I will die in that building someday, just not today.
