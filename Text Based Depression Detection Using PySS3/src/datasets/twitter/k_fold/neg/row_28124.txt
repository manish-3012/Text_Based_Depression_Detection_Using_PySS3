I donâ€™t knowI really donâ€™t know where else to put this. Iâ€™ve lurked for a really long time and I truly long for the end. I donâ€™t see how anything can get better. My dad has a firearm downstairs and I could easily grab it but the fear of my family actually feeling sad overwhelms me. I hate them and they punish and belittle me. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Should I end it? Iâ€™m just scared and sad all the time
