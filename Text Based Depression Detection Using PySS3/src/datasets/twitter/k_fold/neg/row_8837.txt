I'm so lonely I want to die. I can't stop dreaming of death or things I can't have.I just want to be loved. You know feel it I just want someone to hold me. all I've ever wanted was a girlfriend since I was 15. I've tried and tried after countless rejections and public humiliations I give up. I can't compete with people anymore . I told myself if I'm still a lonely wizard Virgin by 30 I would kill myself but i don't think I'll make it that long. I have nothing left in me. I want to die.
