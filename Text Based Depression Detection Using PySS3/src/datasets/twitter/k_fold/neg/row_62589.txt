I'd like to walk into the lake and never look back.Since my break up this past June, my life has been a literal chore. Wake up. Go to work. Pretend to care at work. Go home. Drink. Take Seroquel. Repeat. On Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays throw a 50 minute run in there.

It's a drag. I gave every bit of energy I have into my relationship. It didn't work. I was crazy. I have lost touch with reality. The hardest part is I am aware of what I need to do for myself to get better. Very aware. However, I don't have the will nor desire to do so. It all doesn't matter to me anymore. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am the only one responsible for my life. I am the only one who can save myself. I have no desire to give a shit anymore.

There is a lake near my house I run around often. It is a beautiful lake. I just want to jump in it one day. Jump in &amp; never come back.
