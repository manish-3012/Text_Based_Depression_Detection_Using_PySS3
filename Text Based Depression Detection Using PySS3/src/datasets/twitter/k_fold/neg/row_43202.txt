help me please help me understand that this is ok. please I'm having a small mental fucking breakdown over this and I know it isn't really a big deal but my cunt brain is against me.19M

Alright I'm just gonna let it out. Whenever sex/romance comes up in any form, I feel extremely bitter and sad, especially when it's involving teenagers. Teens always seem to have a casual sex life and it makes me feel like shit, just the thought of high school students having sex is so alien to me. I'm not saying it's wrong, it just makes me feel like I'm doing something wrong. fuck. I haven't had any sexual or romantic experiences in my life and whenever people that are my age talk about sex and romance I get very bitter and resentful (I won't hurt anyone calm down). These topics come up a lot since I'm in college. I feel so fucking behind everyone else. Everyone has some experience and I just feel like a fucking idiot. I should mention that I have a fairly rough past, especially in terms of home life, which absolutely contributed to my current problems. I recently got semi-ghosted which fucking hurt me a lot. I feel like I'm not capable of love, or being a sexual person (other than masturbating lol). No girl has ever had a crush on me or thought I was attractive. By 19, every guy has been at least given SOME hint that a girl liked him, I haven't gotten shit and I'm sorry if I sound entitled. Please help me please.

Thanks &lt;3
