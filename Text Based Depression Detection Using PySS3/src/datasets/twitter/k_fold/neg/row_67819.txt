Dear RedditI am currently drunk, watching Tokyo Ghoul, and eating sprinkles because I have a sweet tooth but there is nothing else sweet in the house. I am alone. I failed out of music school and boy was it public. I wander the halls like a ghost, and everyone reacts to me as if I really were one. The friends I did make Iâ€™ve managed to push away. I talk to no one.

Iâ€™ve realized that nothing genuinely interests me. Iâ€™ve ingrained the thought into my head that I will find a way to end it but I never do. Iâ€™m 23, with nothing to show for it. I broke up with my last boyfriend because I didnâ€™t want him to see me like this. Iâ€™ve spent the last month prepping myself for failure, hardly getting out of bed because I am convinced itâ€™s going to end soon. I spend a good portion of the day researching potential suicide methods (because itâ€™s strangely comforting) and poring through r/depression and r/suicidewatch to remind me that Iâ€™m not alone no matter how lonely I feel. 

Iâ€™ve fallen into these long-term depressive states multiple times before and got out of them - only to find myself in the same exact spot. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m writing this right now. I guess Iâ€™m just rambling to get something out there. 

â€œIâ€™m a loser baby, so why donâ€™t you kill me?â€

I wish.
