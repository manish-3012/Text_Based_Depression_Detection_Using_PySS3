I donâ€™t even know nowIâ€™ve been sexually abused from ages 3-10 by multiple family members. When I was 14 I was assaulted by my first boyfriend, and when I was 17 I was drugged and raped on camera. I was emotionally, physically abused and neglected all of my childhood. Iâ€™m 18 now My self esteem is literally non existent. I canâ€™t keep friendships. The only person I have is my husband. I married an older guy and he cheated on me a lot for a very long time with other high school girls, he promised me he had stopped now but I donâ€™t even know. My father is passing away and he wonâ€™t see me. My father abused me and wouldnâ€™t speak to me after I was forcefully removed from his care. I only have one friend who I see very rarely. I feel as if Iâ€™m the ugliest person alive. I lost 65 pounds this year, from starving or purging and I feel as if it is still not enough. The only things I love are my husband, and my pets and a few other people. I donâ€™t believe my husband would miss me, he has told me before that after a spouse dies you are supposed to move on. I think he would be okay. My animals would not though, he would forget to feed them or give them to a shelter. I canâ€™t have that happen. For now I think I am only alive for them. I love them, they are my babies. Iâ€™ve been crying all night tonight and I just wanted to disappear, but I am trying so so hard to hold on.
