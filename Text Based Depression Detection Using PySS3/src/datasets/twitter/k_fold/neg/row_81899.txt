I tried to put up a shelf at my in-laws house and ended up just drilling holes in the wallsAbout three days ago I moved into the wifeâ€™s parents house due to the fact that I canâ€™t control impulses, resulting in so much debt that we canâ€™t afford the rent. Personally and as a family weâ€™ve made out that weâ€™re doing it so we can save for a deposit for our own home, but my wife really knows whatâ€™s up.

So cut to today and the room Iâ€™m sleeping in really needs some shelving for books and a television. I go to Homebase, get the wood and come back surprisingly confident for someone  whoâ€™s very self aware on how shit they are at diy. But, after twenty minutes of drilling holes into the wall and knocking in wall plugs only to have screws turn round and round with no end and get stuck in the plastic, Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that Iâ€™m absolutely good for nothing and I might as well just do the world a favour and fuck off. Good old me, canâ€™t even put a fucking shelf up. Spends money I donâ€™t have to the point where my family have to leave a perfect home, albeit not our own. Lost the ability to strike a decent conversation with someone as Iâ€™m so worked up that theyâ€™re probably thinking iâ€™m a wanker. I canâ€™t see why I need to live anymore, I know everybodyâ€™s really insignificant in the grand scheme of our world, but fuck me, I might as well of come out my motherâ€™s womb as a tick. My family might be sad for a while, but In a couple of years when somebody else comes into my family whoâ€™s not such a failure theyâ€™ll realise I made the right choice.
