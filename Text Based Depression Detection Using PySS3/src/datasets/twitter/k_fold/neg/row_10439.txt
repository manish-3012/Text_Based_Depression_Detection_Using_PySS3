I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™ve been depressed ever since 8th grade. I always cared what people thought of me and I tried changing who I was just to fit in. But now Iâ€™m 19, and these thoughts are clouding my head. Everywhere I go itâ€™s like my brain tells me to fall off the bridge or throw yourself into that car. I donâ€™t know how to stop it. My life has never been easy, I donâ€™t think anyoneâ€™s life has, but back then, I would tell myself, â€œstay alive to hear your parents say theyâ€™re proud of you when you graduateâ€. Clearly, they never told me that, they never told me they loved me or that theyâ€™re proud of me. In fact, they would tell me how easy their lives would be if I was gone. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I have no one, no one truly loves me, no one is there for me. They only say they are when something tragic is about to happen, they would tell me how much they would miss me, but they never show it. I know I need help, but I want to hold on a little longer, just to see if my life isnâ€™t actually shit.
