I wrote my suicide noteI feel a major loose end is tied and now Iâ€™m free to go.   I donâ€™t think that many tears will be shed for me which is what I want.  I wish I have the courage to just do it.  Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™ll fail at this too just I like I failed at everything else.  I feel like I only have one chance at this.  I want it to look like an accident so I donâ€™t hurt anyone.
