16 Years old, I want to die.Every day I wake up. Every time I go to bed. Every second of the day. I think about it

I was curcumcised as an infant as part of American barbarism. I've been restoring my foreskin for 8 months. And I have made so much progress. And I've been so much happier. But now I've relapsed. I feel there is no hope. I will never be whole. I will never know what is like to be a real man. And I can't live with this fact. 

I have so many people I love. So many people that love me. It's so hard. But going on is harder than letting go could ever be. I hate America for what they did to me. Every beat of my heart is full of hate. 

One day I wanted to move to Finland and be happy there. But Finland is too good to be true. The requirements far too steep. I will never make it there. Why even try. 

One day I wanted to have a kid so that he could see what it's like to be a real man. With his foreskin. I wanted to have him with my girlfriend who I love and does everything for me. A girlfriend who has been nothing but supportive of me every instant of every day. We have been dating for over 2 years. She will be the hardest goodbye. 

I shoot Airguns for sport. I own an FX Dreamline. My pride and joy. I love that damn gun so much. It's only perfect that she be the last thing I touch. 60fpe to the head will be more than enough to stop the pain. I've seen what it does to coyotes. I'm no stronger than they are. 

Goodbye world, I wish I was dealt a different hand. I wish I was born in the EU. But alas. I was destined to die. I love myself, I always have. But I hate the rape that other people did to me. Other people killed me 16 years ago in that delivery ward. That was the day I died. October 7, 2004. May I ever rest in peace. I can't wait to finally be free.
