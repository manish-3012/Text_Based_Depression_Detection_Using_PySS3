Kill mePlease kill me 

I hate life and have ever since my uncle died... I hate when people say that they know the pain even though they are the happiest person alive  

They donâ€™t know the fucking pain I go through every day trying not to fatally cut myself or hang myself.... itâ€™s like no one is here for me and Iâ€™m in this fight alone even though there are people who â€œcareâ€ 

They donâ€™t care at all

They just want me to feel better so they can stop worrying and go on with their life 

Iâ€™m really thinking about ending it all tomorrow night 

If so then even though I donâ€™t know you 


Good bye
