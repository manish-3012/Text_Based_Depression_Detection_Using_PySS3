i am too tired to make a throwaway. i dont want to live a second longer. i am ending it"Just shut the fuck up, toomanyhorses, quit whining"

Yeah you wont have to hear my whining anymore. It's over. 

I am a month shy of 18. I have wanted to die since I was 14. I have attempted suicide once. 

Fuck right off, nobody wants you around

Nobody cares

I'm going to take all the antidepressants and antianxiety meds and whatever else I can find. I'm going to do it at 1am tonight. 

Are you now? Pussy bitch you don't have the balls for that You'd rather do whatever makes you suffer the most, and that is continue living. 

School year ends in two months. i cant think of writing any exams

It's either now or then. Now or then. Now or then. 

Now.

J and V, you two are the only people I have ever truly loved. 

Mother, you tried, but you end up being what drove me to this corner. 

They'll find tomorrow that all the pills are gone and they'll find my piss-soaked body and when I come to, I'll be flogged. 

I hope I die outright.
