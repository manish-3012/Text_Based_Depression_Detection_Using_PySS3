All it takesAll it takes is one little trigger pull and no more worry, no more dread, no more hard work, no more suppressing painful memories, no more seeing the shame in their eyes. One little trigger pull and all my problems are solved permanently. Why is this so hard? I have plenty of reasons to do it, I don't want to live a minute longer, I'm so isolated that only my mom would care but she would move on quickly as her faith is strong .

Gotta channel this self loathing into enough rage to get it done. 40+ years was long enough.
