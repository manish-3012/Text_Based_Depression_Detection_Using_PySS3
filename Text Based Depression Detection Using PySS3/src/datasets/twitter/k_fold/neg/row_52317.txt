I tried to hand myself but the noose was too lowSo I could stand on my toes, I mean I've tried hanging myself so many times now, I know that if I can touch the floor then I'm gonna abort as soon as it gets too painful. But I don't see anywhere else to hang myself... It really sucks. I just took off some stuff from the window that's there to prevent people from jumping out and I realized that it's probably not far enough up for me to die. I am probably more likely to just break a bunch of bones. I really hate this.

I always try to kill myself if my friend doesn't come online 3-4 hours after I wake up. I feel so guilty about it. I can't take it. My friend feels like he is a drug to me and that's probably true. If I wasn't so traumatized about people rejecting me because of my prior drug use I would probably go back to that again, at least just to overdose and then hang myself. I figure If I combine two lethal things, its much much much more likely for it to work.
