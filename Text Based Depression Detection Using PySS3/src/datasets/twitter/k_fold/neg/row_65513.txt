Lost my way, and my will to liveI am a bad person. 
Just like my father, he scares my mother with his temper in which I'm the same way 
Speaking of them they're probably divorcing and I don't know what to do there 
I lost my girlfriend because I cheated like a scumbag. 
Surprisingly for the most part she's forgiven me and we talk like a couple 
A thing you could call it 
But I don't know if she'll ever take me back 
It makes me question my future 
"You're 15 stop worrying about girls."
I hate that 
I can't put it into good enough words on how important and crucial she is to me
You know how when you power on your tower and your monitor does too?
Yeah 
That's a pretty clever way to put it I think 
The thought of her being with anyone else makes me feel sick 

I want nothing more than her not a billion dollars not a my dream to go to NYU not my dream car not my bed not anything 
I know as long as I have her I'll feel safe she always made me feel safe 
why did I do it? 
I don't know 
That other girl got in my head 
That's all I can say really 
I'm in pure complete love and no one will believe me because of my age but 
She's my sky my stars and my moon 
This isn't a teenage crush 
this is the girl I want to grow old with 
Out of everyone I want her I don't have to know anyone else 
But I fucked up and I don't know where to go 
She's my other half 
The sun to vegetation
The reason to a cause 
Letters to words 
I need her other wise nothing makes sense Essentially is my point 
My life without her is a broken mirror and a broken record 
A broken soul 
I don't know if I can do my life without her 
This shit is everything 
She is my heart and I want to give her everything 
I lost my girl and I don't know where to go 
I'm lost and disgusted with myself
