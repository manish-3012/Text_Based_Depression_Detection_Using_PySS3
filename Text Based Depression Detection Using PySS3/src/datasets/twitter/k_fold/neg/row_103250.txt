Oh godMy parents were arguing and divorce was brought up again and I snapped and yelled at my dad then barred myself in my room. I had some beers and tendies and I got drunk. It felt amazing, I forgot everything and I was ok for a while. Once I came down I had to go to the store and pretend I didnâ€™t do anything. 

But now I constantly have the urge to want to feel that â€œnothingâ€ that being drunk gave me. 

So cheers to being addicted to alcohol at 15!
