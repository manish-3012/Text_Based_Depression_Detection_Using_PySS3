I feel like a failure, I want outI tried to hang myself on the door today. I had 4 attempts, 4 failed attempts because apparently I have too strong neck muscles which I automatically contract to leave air flow for long enough for my brain to activate alarm systems and force me to get up before I lose my concious.  Next step  will be exit bag I guess - tomorrow I should be able to gather all stuff I'll need. 

It's strange - I'm not sad or in pain. Actually, I feel nothing.  I don't have any purpose of live, I have no long- or short-term goals, no dreams, no hobbies. All I have are pressure from society for doing certain stuff in certain way and time killers(like video games) which don't even giving me joy, but they make time pass faster. It's like I'm not depressed, I just don't want to live anymore. I don't want to punish anyone with my decision, I don't want to point out someone's bad behavior towards me or anyone else, I don't want to make it dramatic. I just want to "log out".
