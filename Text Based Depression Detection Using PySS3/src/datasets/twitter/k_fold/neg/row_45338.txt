So what if I'm "just a kid"This might sound whiny to some of you "adults" but here we go  
just because I'm "just a kid" doesn't mean I don't hurt, that I haven't been hurt, it just means I haven't lived as long as you. But god it feels like I'm repeating lifetimes over and over. I don't have the strength to off myself. I'm constantly watched by the people around me, "when's he gonna start crying" "is he going to breakdown today" then when I go home  I don't even want to write about what it's like at home. so stop treating me like a kid that doesn't know better, that's a message to everyone whos ever hurt me especially my "therapist"
