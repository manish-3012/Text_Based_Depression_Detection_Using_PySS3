This is it. If it doesn't get better by the time I'm 17 1/2 I'm committing.Tired of living in this viscous circle.

"oh wow I found a dime on the street now 6 months of agony"

I know for certain that what they've been telling me is a lie. "Oh you're just a teenager yada yada it'll get better" stfu. The last few years were horrible and it only get worse. 

"You have so many things to be grateful for!!Â¡Â¡Â¡!!!" yeah wow I barely passed a math exam, I don't know when the other shoe's gonna drop. 

So, by the time I'm 17 1/2 and it hasn't gotten any better, I'm committing. 

I'm proving it to you, I'm telling you that.
