At the end of my rope...I just woke up to my (37M) wife (35F) crying because of me complimenting women... In these messages, I gave props to them, didn't flirt or offer any form of relationship or sexual interest, but this Jas been going on for 8 years now... Before this year, I hadn't done this shit before, and honestly, my marriage has been sexless and romance lacking since our infant son died in 2012... She threatened to leave me because I had been looking at other women, and yes, I know, bad husband, blah blah... But trying to explain to her that she has someone else if I go, but I have no one if she left... I would literally have no reason for living... As I would lose her and my stepdaughter... I love my Stepkid as much as I did my full blood son, and if I lose them... I will almost certainly join my son in the next life... I am NOT an attractive man, and have nothing to offer anyone else in this world, so if I lose my family, it'll be the end of me.... I can't stop having panic attacks.... I hadn't been this way until she nagged me about cheating for 8 years without me so much as glancing at another woman.... I hadn't done it before, nor would I do it again, but she will never stop this... It's killing me to stay, but I'll die if I go....
