Iâ€™ve lost almost every reason I had to keep livingIâ€™ve thought about ending my life so many times over the years, but Iâ€™ve always had something stopping me. I knew if I did it while I was in high school my mom would most likely be the one to find me. I couldnâ€™t do that to her especially since we had both found my dad after he died. I live on my own now in a completely different state. For the first few months I used little things to keep me going but I just canâ€™t handle this anymore. I live alone, I donâ€™t have any close friends, and my self esteem is at such a low that I canâ€™t even bare the thought of leaving my house for groceries or work. Iâ€™ve tried my best for so long to remind myself of all the good things I have going for me, but I know that any happiness I experience is short lived and my reasons to continue have all disappeared. I want to end things but Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t want to die alone and I donâ€™t want to fail at my attempt whenever I end up following through.
