If i don't die, it's not seriousNo one takes me series since young ages, when I was determined to die and kill myself, because of my upbringing. Now I'm 26, and cut my wrists, saying that i will kill myslef doesn't make difference.
the only way they will take me serious and get hurt its if I go through it.
I have told them I would kill myself many times, I have tries through the years, but no one care. They "save" me from it, and no even a word from my parents I heard.

I thibk my main reason its to die, so they can learn 

And also so the pain on me go way. I can take anymore living all the time with the pain. I don't want to try or cry or do a new treatment, I just want the noise and the pain to go away. And if this means, as a plus, that i will hurt them, so be it
