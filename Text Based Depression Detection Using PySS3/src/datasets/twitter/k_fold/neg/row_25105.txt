Hopefully I can fix my existing problem tonightAs much as I donâ€™t plan on being around long enough for it to matter if I lift some pills, I donâ€™t want people to know that was one of the last things I did. While I donâ€™t give very many shits about what people think of me, I for some reason care if they remember me as a thief. So, I get paid early tomorrow and Iâ€™m going to get some pills then and try to stop existing tomorrow night.
