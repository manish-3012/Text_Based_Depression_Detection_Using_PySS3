â€œA day that starts good day always ends bad and a day that starts off bad always ends badâ€
I can't fucking take it anymore, I'm tired of being me, I'm tired of being my family's failure. I fucking hate it. I am now worrying and obsessing about school starting a month from now and probably will feel way to overwhelmed. I donâ€™t want to go back but if I donâ€™t my parents might shame me. I'm alone, no one cares and I can't do anything about it because I'm a fucking coward and I can't tell anyone about it. and I'm too scared to commit suicide so I'm fucking stuck here. I wanna end it so bad but I'm too scared. I just want to be happy and not feel so flat. With school starting soon I only assume the worst.
