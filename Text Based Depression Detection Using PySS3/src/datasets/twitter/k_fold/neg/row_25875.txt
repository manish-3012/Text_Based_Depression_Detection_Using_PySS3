I just feel terribleIm falling back into suicidal thoughts. Now that my own mom is depressed , the lady who I thought was strong and independent, everything's getting worse. As the youngest in my family i feel like I should be bubbly and make everyone happy, but its just getting harder... i just wanna cry and stay in bed , staying out of everyones way.  I can't take it anymore in this house i wanna leave . My dads blaming everything on me and im trying to get by but i cant i just cant. If i left everything would be easier for them. They wouldn't have to worry , nobody would have to worry about me at all
