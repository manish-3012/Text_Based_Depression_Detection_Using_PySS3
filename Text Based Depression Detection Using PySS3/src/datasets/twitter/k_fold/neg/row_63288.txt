We live in a fucked up worldFirst of all If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re pretty strong to keep living this life because Iâ€™m slowly reaching my limit, my existence is something ive loathed since i was 15 (25 now) and Iâ€™m fed up living in this corrupt and disgusting man made rat race system. Iâ€™m probably bitter because i dont have any purpose and I missed out on doing what I really wanted to do in life but still I just dont have the motivation to keep going on. Iâ€™m just living for my friends and family and its eating me up and building strong resentment in me. People keep saying stay but i dont want to is there anything here except fleeting bullshit? Are we not all going to die one day? Honestly the day i day will be the happiest day of my life. Iâ€™ve never cried or been sad at anyones death the way i see it they are lucky getting to leave this existence. I hate life in this world so much that Iâ€™ve vowed never to bring kids into this world, Iâ€™ll consider adopting. I feel so much pain that i have to keep living when people who truly want to keep living die, its almost like im a waste of life, it should have been given to someone else.
