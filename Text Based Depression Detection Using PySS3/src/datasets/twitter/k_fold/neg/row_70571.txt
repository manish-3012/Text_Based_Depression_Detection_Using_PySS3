I'm so lonelyhello there, i'm a 19 years old depressed borderline (officially diagnosed). i'm on 3 kind of medications (lorazepam, sertraline, aripiprazole) since months and i'm on therapy since 1 year. the last few months were okay but now i'm feeling bad again and i don't know what could i do with this feeling... i mean what more i could do?? i have an extremely healthy lifestyle but my mind is keep trying to kill me because i'm lonely. i mean not really but i feel lonely and that's why i'm suicidal.

i have people to talk to and they understand my pain but it just doesn't help. i can't describe this loneliness but i can't cure myself with friends and with love and affection. this loneliness stays with me and time to time it tries to murder me. 

the worst is that my doctor said that she will send me into the hospital again if my suicidal feelings won't go away soon. and that's bad because hospital is a boring place.
