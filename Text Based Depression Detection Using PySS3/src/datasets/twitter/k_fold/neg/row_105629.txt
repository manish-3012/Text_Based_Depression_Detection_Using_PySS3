Alcohol sucksI donâ€™ remember pouring my last drink but itâ€™s already gone. I donâ€™t even like drinking anymore. 
In my brief moments between intoxication and hangovers I see the issue, I see that I need to stop drinking completely to live a good life
Fucking plot twist, I see that when Iâ€™m drunk &amp; hungover anyway. So I guess Iâ€™m drinking because of withdrawal? 
Iâ€™m already pouring another. I hope I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow
