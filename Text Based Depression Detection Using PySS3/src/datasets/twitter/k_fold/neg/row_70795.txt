I dont know what is wrong with me.I am 20 something years old and everything is good in my life. I am in university have good friends and there is not anything that bad that has happened to me but every 1 or 2 months i feel like taking my own life and i feel like that for a week and then i feel good for a while and then again these stupid thoughts and feelings come back. I was literally on a ledge 1 hour ago. 2 of my friends have taken their lives but that is not the reason i feel like this i have felt like this since i was a teenager. But every month or year i get worse or more likely to do this. It is hard to explain but i am the funny guy in my group of friends but still this stupid thought and feelings come up. I donÂ´t know what the fuck is wrong with me and also i dislike people like me that are so selfish to do it and ruining the lives of they're family and friends . I realize that people that have shitty lives will read this post and think that i am a whining little cunt. DonÂ´t worry i also think so. :)

I wont reply to this thread but i will read the comments. I made an account that i probably will not log in again to keep my anonymity.
