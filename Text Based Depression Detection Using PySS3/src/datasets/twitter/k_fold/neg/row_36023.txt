Wow I'm actually doing thisI never thought this would be me. In HS I was so scared of the idea of suicide that I made myself a promise that I would never take my own life. So much for that. Today I've drafted my second suicide note since September and I'm pretty much ready to "leave." I bought a big bottle of brandy and I plan to use alcohol poisoning as ny escape route. I'm scared. Idk what's going to happen but I do know that everyday I wake up feels worse than the last. I need liberation from the everpresent pain.
