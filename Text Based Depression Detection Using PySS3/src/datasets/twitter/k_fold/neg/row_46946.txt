Pretty sure i've just screwed up and lost my job. The urge to throw myself in a freeway is #large right now.It'd be nice if the stakes weren't, "lose your job, lose your house and everything you've worked hard for" but I've been barely skating by on credit debt and just never pulled myself out of the hole I dug myself into by supporting a lazy asshole ex when I should've been padding for emergencies.

Got sick a few times and I'm pretty sure I've just lost my job for this last callout. I'm kind of a retard, so I probably won't get hired elsewhere. I genuinely liked this job a lot, it's just that I'm unfortunately human and prone to getting sick, especially when I'm stressed and said POS ex really went out of his way to stress me the fuck out over the breakup so that's a thing. Idk, I know. Excuses, excuses.

Excuses are all I'll ever be. I deserve this. 

It's 3am and I can't sleep. I've been pacing and screaming at myself all night when I should be resting and trying to get better, but nothing is helping and all I want to do is self harm and I can't make my fucking brain turn off
