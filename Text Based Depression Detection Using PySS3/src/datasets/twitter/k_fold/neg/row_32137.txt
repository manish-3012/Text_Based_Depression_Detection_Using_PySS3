Iâ€™m starting to feel that killing myself is inevitableIâ€™ve suffered 22 year old male with depression and suicidal thoughts for years. I have multiple attempts but Iâ€™ve always feared death. Recently Iâ€™ve accepted death and donâ€™t fear dying no more. These past 2 months have been the worst Iâ€™m constantly getting panic attacks. I have trouble falling asleep and even get up during the day. I have no motivation to do even the simplest of things like taking showers. I just want be  in bed all day. My younger brother noticed this pattern and he mentioned that he had a dream that I killed myself. He wants me to get help and others have offered to be there for me but I just push everyone away. Itâ€™s like I want to be alone but I donâ€™t at the same time. I just think itâ€™s inevitable that I kill myself itâ€™s just a matter of when.
