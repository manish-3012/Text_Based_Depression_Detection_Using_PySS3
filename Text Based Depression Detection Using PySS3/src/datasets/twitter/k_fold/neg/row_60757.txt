Depression and loneliness. Suicide seems my only option15/M

I am anti-sociable, but I have 1-2 friends to hang out with. I was always a too good person, who always did favors. I am afraid to speak to anyone who I don't know, because I might be annoying. I don't talk to anyone when I have nothing to say.

I have had girl problems especially the last 6 months. I genuinely love this girl, but she says she only sees me as a friend. Although, she does nothing to keep me as a friend of hers. I sometimes think I am a ghost or something. I don't matter. i don't have any influence on my classmates and despite being the best at maths, no one listens to my advice.

I am extremely depressed today. I just sat right next to her, and she just invented an excuse to leave.

I am only good at computers, and try to learn programming or play video-games to get distracted, but I only seem to be thinking of her.

I am bored to be lonely, but I don't search for any other girl. I only need her.
