My life is in crumbles.I need some support...with no friends to speak to I figured maybe reaching out to strangers will help me.

This is the toughest point my life has ever reached. And Iâ€™ve actually thought about suicide. My girlfriend of 4 years left me. 

We have a 4 month old son together and it kills me now knowing Iâ€™ll only see him on weekends/my days off from work.

I was never perfect in the relationship I had my flaws. I struggled to get it together after becoming a father and I admit I was wrong for that.

We originally were on a â€œbreakâ€ where she told me I needed to change how I was and I did...I changed everything. 

But it turns out she just didnâ€™t love me anymore. 4 years of memories now rest on my mind, tormenting me. Itâ€™s taken a toll on me while Iâ€™m even at work.

I look through old Facebook messages and look at how it used to be...and now everything reminds me of her. I told her I wouldnâ€™t be okay.

Iâ€™ve had thoughts of suicide before, but never actually wanted to until now...and I have no one to talk to..
