Stuck in a Downward SpiralI honestly wish I wasn't here. My life has been on a constant downward spiral for the majority of my existence, and I just wish it was over. Counselling doesn't work and my GP essentially told me to "man up".  I've always been told that I had "so much potential". Even if it was true, it's all been wasted anyways.

I just feel like my existence is so detrimental to other people, and it's hardly like it's worth living for myself most of the time either. As much as I hate to say it, if suicide wasn't so difficult to execute painlessly in the country I live in, I already would've been gone. But at this point, I just wouldn't go through with it, because I've passed the point of thinking I deserve a dignified exit.

I don't know why I'm rambling, or if I even want help. I just want it off my chest.
