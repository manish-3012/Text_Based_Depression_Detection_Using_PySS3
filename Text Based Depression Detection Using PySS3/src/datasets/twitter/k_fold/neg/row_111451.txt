What's the point of life? I'm tired of living.I wish I could just not wake up one day. I want to die. Life is so hard. Day in day out I'm survivingâ€‹ but I'm not living. Why can't we just live off of the land. I can't get a job. Even if I got one why do I need to spend 8 hours doing something I don't like. Everyone around me is progressing. They've got careers or nice families. But I've got nothing. Usually people get at least one and the lucky get both. I've got neither. I've got nothing. What's the point. Why live.
