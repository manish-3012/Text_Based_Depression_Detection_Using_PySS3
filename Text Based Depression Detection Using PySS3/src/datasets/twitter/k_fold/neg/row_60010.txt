The pain outweighs my fear of deathAt this point. I'm pass the point of no return. I need to get out of here. I been depressed for 10 years, it took 4 years to finally open up about it. And I was sent to a therapist, group therapy. I improved begun to exercise, eat healthy, medititate, I was in a good place. The symptoms were less and I slightly improved . But it came back after breaking up with my boyfriend 2 years ago, it came back with revenge and now this time i been thinking about killing myself. I can't shake the feeling anymore, the pain outweighs the fear of death and facing the unknown. I can't digest this pain anymore. I'm ready. I just feel bad for the pain I will be getting ready to pass on to others but they will overcome it with time. So my question is, how many sleeping pills do I need to take to die? Please just help me. I been researching on ways to overdose  on sleeping pills. I had enough. Too much suffering, soceital pressure, terrible teenage life that haunts me. I just want out and relief at last. So how many sleeping pills? Thank you
