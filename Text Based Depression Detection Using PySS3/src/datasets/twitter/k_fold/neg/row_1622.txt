I think I'm dyingThis morning at 1:00 I took 750mg of sertraline in hopes of dying before going to bed. Ultimately I woke up at 8:00 am and suffered the consequences of a sertraline overdose. I couldn't leave my bed till 4:00 because I was so dizzy I couldn't walk in addition to bad tremors and sweats. I didn't bother calling the authorities because I don't want to be put in a phych ward. I know that without proper treatment od's can lead to death and it feels like I'm dying. I feel sleepy in a good way and my heart is beating hard but slow. It's actually very peaceful. I'm going to put on some music and try to go to sleep, dying in my sleep should be nice. Not sure if I'm dying but I think I am.
