Rage. So much Rage.Just....Im sick of it. Im so #!@$ing sick of it. I can't cope right now, and just spewing it all on here is the last thing I can think of. 13ish Hospitalizations. So many med changes. No IRL friends. Sister's pregnant, and getting married this year while I sit here ready to pull A Stupid Move ^((TM)) in this fucking group home. Im wired as fuck, the idea of taking care of that/myself PISSES me off somehow. You know that moment when your asleep, and your not dreaming but know you're asleep? GIVE ME THAT! JUST GIVE ME THAT SWEET FUCKING FEELING OF CALM!  


Im so fucking done of being angry.  I want PEACE.  The only thing stopping me is that I don't fucking know whats on that other side. Knowing my luck it's more anger.  


  
I cant go to friends anymore. Its not worth it. NOTHING IS WORTH IT.   


  
JUST. LET. ME. DIE. YOU. STUPID. BRAIN.
