Philippines is a shitty place to depressed inI've been diagnosed with clinical depression. I did my best but I feel the void, she is calling.

Worst, my case is not taken seriously. Not even by my girlfriend.

I've been spiraling down recently. It's hard to keep holding on. It gets harder every day.

Vaping helps me relax. I tried meditation. I tried antidepressants but that made me fat and now people tend to make fun of me.

I really need a buddy right now.
