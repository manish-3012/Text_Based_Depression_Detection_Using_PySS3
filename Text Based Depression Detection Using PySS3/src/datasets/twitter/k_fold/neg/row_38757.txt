Tried cutting myself with a pair of kitchen scissors, might go take some pills idk[Since my last post didn't get much response](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/kemlbh/please_someone_out_there_fucking_help_me/), I'm just at a complete loss for words.

I tried lightly cutting the tip of my thumb with a pair of kitchen scissors to calm myself, but I was too sweaty. But now that things have calmed down I'm about to go do it right after I post this. I'll try not to make it bleed this time.

I wish I had the will to throw shit and knock these goddamn fuckers upside the head. I wish could beat and throw furniture out the window just to avoid hurting people. I'll probably to just do it in silent.

Please, someone help. I don't care about battery or assault charges anymore, as long as I don't do any permanent damage I don't give a single fuck.

I'm probably gonna take apart the Christmas tree and toss it outside just so I can avoid trying to actively kill myself. I hope it doesn't get stolen bc it looks kinda nice (I'll keep the lights and decoration inside)

I'm glad I don't live in a household with guns or I'd be dead.

(If police are called on my home I'm immediately committing suicide idgasf what hotlines and other bullshit say â¤ï¸)
