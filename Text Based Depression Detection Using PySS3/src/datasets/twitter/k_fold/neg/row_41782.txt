Made so many mistakesCousin brushing me off, telling me to stay positive and just leaving me. Buying him shit all the time to make him happy and he can't listen to my problems. The only things that keep me from ending it is my family and the possibility of there being nothing after death. But God I just want to put my head in the noose and kick the stool, slowly losing myself until I'm no longer there. I cry every night and day. It's so hard to see if people really care because the reactions that they make seem fake, but in the end I could be wrong
