MourningTwo weeks ago I met a girl at a small get-together at a friends house.  Our boyfriends were talking shop, and we hit it off, chatting for a couple hours.  She had the most vibrant, cheerful spirit of anyone I've met in ages.  This girl radiated happiness and positive energy, but not in an affected way -- she was truly genuine.  She drew my introverted self out and made me feel comfortable in a group of people I didn't know very well.  She told me to find her on facebook so we could swap recipes, etc.  I've been super busy with work the last couple weeks and didn't follow up. 

Today my boyfriend found out that she hung herself 3 days ago.  There was no note.  Everyone is stunned.

Whether you know it or not, people care about you.  Even if it's someone you just chatted with for a bit at the store, a party, school, whatever.  You mean something to someone.  You've touched somebody's life.  Don't just check out.
