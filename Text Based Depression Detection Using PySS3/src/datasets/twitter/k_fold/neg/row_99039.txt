Just feel lifeless and completely detachedSuffered severe isolation and health issues during my teen years that have probably permanently destroyed me. Although I'm studying again and trying to socialise more I'm still far behind every one.

In addition I have an asymmetrical jaw that gives me TMJ pain, insecurity, very slightly (annoying) and speech issues. Because of my past lifestyle of sleeping all day/doing nothing/feeling stressed for 9 years I also have terrible neck and back pain. I've been lifting weights heavily for 6 months and am in solid shape but I feel so weak inside and in chronic pain all the time. 

Also a virgin and dealt with severe porn addiction that makes me paranoid I won't be able to get hard if I ever have sex with a woman. Although this is more of a psychological issue based on my addiction. 

Even if a girl seems into me I push them away. Recently I've also been dealing with severe/painful swallowing issues, not sure if it's acid reflux, damage from a past hanging attempt or some fucked up infection but it's adding to my suicical feelings.

I think I'm going to give up soon. I just don't care about anything and feel completely numb and dissociated.
