How does life insurance work for a suicide? (16f)I know funerals are really expensive and my family really can't afford that.  Is it true that the insurance policy won't pay if the death was on purpose? 

I have a plan to get around this. I'm allergic to wasps and I've noticed a nest in my backyard. I can make it look like an accident, but would they (the insurance)still consider it a suicide?
