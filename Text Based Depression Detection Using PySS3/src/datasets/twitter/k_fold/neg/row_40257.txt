Wrong place to ask...but oh wellYes like the title says this is the wrong place to ask this and yes it seems desperate but I am sadly, I'm looking for a girlfriend. I'm looking here because I'm tired of talking to girls for a long time and once they get a glimpse of the darker side of me they immediately say "you should see a therapist about this" no shit bitch, but they never understand that therapists don't help every patient. Some people need a friend or girlfriend/boyfriend to help them get through their bad moments, so I'm looking for someone who is like me, a depressed girl who I can talk to about this stuff, someone to hug me, for me to cry on because I can't be in my head anymore because I know if I keep living there I'll kill myself soon, so if you're interested just say hi I guess thanks
