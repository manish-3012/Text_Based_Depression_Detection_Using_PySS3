Iâ€™m so awfulI (17f if that matters) have a tendency to use my friends as therapists. I donâ€™t mean to do this and I apologize and I feel so awful. I just canâ€™t stop. While itâ€™s not an excuse, I have adhd so Iâ€™m really impulsive and I have to verbally process my feelings and I like having a response. I have a therapist, Iâ€™ve tried journaling, Iâ€™ve tried mental health apps, nothing ever satisfies my need for validation and response and advice like people and especially my peers do. Itâ€™s my fault and Iâ€™m not trying hard enough. Iâ€™m tired of being awful. Even typing this I realize how victim-y Iâ€™m being when Iâ€™m not the victim Iâ€™m the abuser. I know I am and I hate myself for it. I donâ€™t want to be a bad person and itâ€™s too late I donâ€™t know why I struggle to change because itâ€™s simple, just donâ€™t be a bad person. It kinda seems the only solution at this point is to get rid of myself before I can even open my mouth and hurt others. I donâ€™t even know where to start that I feel so bad for doing this to my friends. Iâ€™m just a burden
