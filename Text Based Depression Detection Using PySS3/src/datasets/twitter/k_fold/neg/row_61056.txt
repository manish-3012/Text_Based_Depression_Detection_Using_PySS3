Why even continue living?Haven't had a friend in 5 years. Never had a girlfriend. Turning 20 in January and still don't have a single social media account because I have nobody to add anyway. I have aspergers and feel like it's impossible for me to accomplish anything socially. I was even tempted to asking a girl in one of my college classes to lunch, but turns out she was 6 years older than me and probably sees me as a kid, so I didn't even bother. I tried befriending one of my former programming professors and he ended up ghosting me after a few texts. I tried lifting weights to boost my confidence and ended up injuring my knees and lower back because of my terrible squat form that I spent weeks on trying to perfect. I even failed a fucking elementary algebra class in a community college for christs sake.
I feel so stupid and inadequate.

The only reason I'm holding back from killing myself is my family.  I've been wanting to kill myself since I was 10 years old. I'm thinking of just doing it, I know my family will feel horrified, but it's better than feeling this way for another 10 years.
