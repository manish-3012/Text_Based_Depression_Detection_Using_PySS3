How can I help my friend seek out professional help.Hi everyone, 

I'm asking this because I took action after getting a suicide note from my buddy and prevented him from shooting himself. Between me and two other friends, we've arranged a way for at least one of us to be there with him for the next couple of days. I just want some advice about how we could work with him to realize that he needs to work with a professional to get better. 

The inciting incident for all of this is his wife leaving him. They tried to separate for a while, to clear the air and what not, but she ended up in a relationship with another man. 

I welcome any advice anyone might have. Thanks for everyone's time in advance.
