Why can't these thoughts just go awayOut of nowhere these thoughts of slashing my arms open came while at work. It doesn't help that we have an endless supply of fresh box cutters. I can't shake this. No matter how much I try, it keeps coming back. I tried to kill myself once, when I was 16. I can't even manage to feel bad for wanting to die right now. I should.... I have a family and kids. I should feel horrible.
