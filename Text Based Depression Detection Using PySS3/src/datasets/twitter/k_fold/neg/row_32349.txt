I think the universe has malicious gods and they all like to bring me despairSince transitioning publicly I've been unable to find work because my country  is full of trans-hating bigots and given an eviction notice. I would have had nowhere to put my belongings when I am.

I was offered a job and then told to wait a month before they'll bring me on, then at the end of the month told me they closed the position.

The day after I got my eviction notice, I got a job. I was saved. Turns out I wasn't - I spent the last of my money on office appropriate clothes and was fired after two days for 'not meeting expectations'.

Every despair I experience is tailed by a spot of hope, only for it to be cleverly, almost *intelligently* crushed with an even greater despair. I'm certain I'm a cosmic plaything and I don't want to be their toy any more. I'm out of options and don't want to know what fresh seed of hell they'll plant in me after this one.
