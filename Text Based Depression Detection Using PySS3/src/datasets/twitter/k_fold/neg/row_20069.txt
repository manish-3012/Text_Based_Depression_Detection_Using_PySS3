I want to hang myselfMy life has been spiraling out of control for years but just now I've hit complete rock bottom. At the start of my 8th grade year I started to cut myself to help deal with the verbal and physical abuse my parents cause me. Around that same time I realized i was bisexual.(I'm a boy) I was having troubles with depression and suicidal thoughts. But nothing was going that badly. Then my sister attempted suicide during winter but she survived. I lost it the only person that cared about me was 50 miles away and I couldn't even talk to her. So 1 month later I attempted to hang myself. I kicked the chair but had a knife in my hand so I cut the rope. All I remember was that I threw away the rope and told myself I would never do that again. 1 year later I'm here. 3 weeks ago my dad beat me and then left our family. The friends I have at the time are helping me get through this but I've complexly snapped. Today My mom told me that my father was coming back by the end of the month and said she didn't care if he beat me again. I'm thinking about killing myself because I don't want to destroy my family any longer and I know that my death will cause a lot of sadness amongst my friends especially since I'm bi and another friend of mine is bi I was hoping if I dated him he would bring some happiness into our lives but I know that will never happen. HopefullyI can live on in their hearts. Sorry for ranting I just have been dealing with a lot.
