i cant believe im considering itbarely anyone talks to me anymore. even less ever wanna hang out. the only girl i ever had just treated me like a last resort in case no one else was around. my mom is always hard on me. im never good enough for her. i cant live in the same house as her anymore. tried seeing if i could live with a friend but that is just not an option for her. i would run away but its really cold right now. im definitely trying it when it warms up though. even if i get in trouble with the cops. i just wish i could die so i could just be reborn as someone people actually liked and who didnt have so much pressure on him everyday. fuck.
