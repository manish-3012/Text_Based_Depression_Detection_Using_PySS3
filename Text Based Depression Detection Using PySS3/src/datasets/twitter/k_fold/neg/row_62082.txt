So thinking about it, why the fuck am I still functioning?I have no drive, nothing I really particularly want to do. I want to be a really big and memorable figure but what are the chances of that happening, and I have no specific goal I want to pursue.

I honestly would have just killed myself years ago if my parents weren't still alive. I just don't want to make them sad and die before them, so I'm just running out the clock.

Tick tock, tick tock, when's the day nobody will be around to care when I die? How long is it gonna take? 

I just live because I don't want others to be sad, but why do I even care? I'm not living for myself so why do I live? Just for timed experience? Just because I might as well? Why shouldn't I just stop functioning?

I just... don't know anymore. I just... don't care. I'm sorry for any of this sounds cheesy or something. I just don't know what to do.
