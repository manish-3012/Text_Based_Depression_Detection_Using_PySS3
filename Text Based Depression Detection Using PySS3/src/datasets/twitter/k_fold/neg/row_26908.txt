Tried killing myself after my mom found out I failed a subject in college. Experiencing the feeling of â€œclose to dyingâ€Iâ€™m a pre-med student and my mom found out I failed chemistry at one of the most privileged universities in my country. I got straight As and Bs in my other classes, but why did I fail chemistry? Because Iâ€™m emotionally unstable I was depressed as shit that day so I just passed out on my bed and didnâ€™t bother to study.

I ruined my parents expectations. My goal was to graduate with Honors and now Iâ€™m just that misunderstood defective sibling whoâ€™s always behind the shadow of their successful (in my case) sister who did graduate with honors and  has a scholarship in Korea mastering industrial engineering.

Yesterday I felt I almost experienced death itself. After crying my eyes out feelings of deception and extreme hunger and dehydration. I turned of all the lights in my room, no source of light could be seen. Grabbed both my hands and began chocking myself as hard as I could slowing the blood flow of my necks veins as much as I could while feeling my face getting hot and my face muscles becoming numb and suddenly I started hearing my synchronized heartbeats ringing loudly though my ears feeling like my face was about to explode while the noises in the exterior around me began fading slowly. 

It was scary but exciting at the same time. I realized my door wasnâ€™t locked so I stopped. And after opening my eyes I feel a comforting peaceful feeling I rarely had ever felt of unconsciousness (something I had only felt before medical procedures microseconds after anesthesia). I felt like I was already dead inside, but physically alive.

Going to end this soon. A shotgun to the heart hopefully.

TL;DR: tried killing my self and had a close to death experience.
