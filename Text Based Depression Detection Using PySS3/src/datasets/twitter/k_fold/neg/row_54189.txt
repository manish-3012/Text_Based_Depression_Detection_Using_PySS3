I'm a weak cowardI was given an opportunity for advancement in my place of work which required an interview.

Now I've always been incredibly anxious but I really wanted to do it so I applied. I successfully gained a  interview but declined because YET AGAIN my anxiety got the best of me.

I'm sick and tired of being so terrified of advancement and change. Now everyone at work knows I'm a coward.

I do enjoy my current role but I would like to advance. But if I apply again and find out I have another interview I won't be able to eat, sleep or even function properly. 

I really don't understand how people can  function so well and do these things. I hate my life.

I've taken loads of propranolol and I hope it kills me.
