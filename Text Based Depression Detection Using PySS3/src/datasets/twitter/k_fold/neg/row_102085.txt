Iâ€™m all aloneI wonder to myself if they even loved me in the first place. I try to open up to my family and they seem to turn my insecurities around to hurt me time and time again and same goes to any friends I have left. Iâ€™ve felt with depression since middle school and my parents didnâ€™t really care then why should I be surprised that they donâ€™t care now, or maybe Iâ€™m just a spoiled ungrateful piece of shit, I canâ€™t tell. But one time last year I fell in love and was happy for the first time in a long time I thought the pain was over, but she found out who I was and now she hates my guts part of me thinks that she never even had mutual feelings, after that I wanted to flee out of state with my dad and he abandoned me in a shitty and expensive apt 6 months later I move in with my mom then she leaves with her bf to El Paso. I want to die but I need something painless I canâ€™t deal with anymore pain itâ€™s too much.
