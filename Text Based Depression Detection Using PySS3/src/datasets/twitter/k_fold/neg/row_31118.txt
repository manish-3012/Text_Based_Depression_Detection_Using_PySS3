I'm so tired of trying.Fuck this. I'm so sick of always being the fucking bad guy and I genuinely feel like I make every effort to do everything right. I'm just an easy target so people take shit out on me. I can't ever be the person I or other people want me to be so fuck it. God damn it why did i even fucking try for so long anyway I always knew this was how it was gonna happen. I'm so sick of people this world isn't worth being apart of
