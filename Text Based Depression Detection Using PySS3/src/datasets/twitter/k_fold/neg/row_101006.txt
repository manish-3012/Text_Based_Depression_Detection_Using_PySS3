Iâ€™ve completely given upHello. Iâ€™m 15, female, and have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years. 

My story is pretty pathetic, and is mostly just me whining while other people have it so much worse. But for those of you who think itâ€™ll help, Iâ€™ll do my best to explain. Sorry, it may be a bit long. 

When I was 10 years old and going into 5th grade, I was entering middle school at the same time (grade 5 was the first year of middle school for people in my area). I went to an elementary school that held students that could go to either of the 2 middle schools close by. All of my close friends went to the other middle school, leaving me with only my older friend and neighbor at the time. She took a turn for the worst, and began bullying me to look cool in front of her friends. On top of that, I was bullied by people in my class for being weird and having no friends. When I tried to reach out for help, my parents told me to suck it up &amp; get over it, while my school counselor ignored me. My teachers were also fed up with my drop in grades and lack of focus in class. Every night, I would begin to fantasize about running into the kitchen and stabbing myself with a chefâ€™s knife. I had no idea what suicide was. 

After 6 months, I eventually made a friend, and began to recover. 

At the end of my 7th grade year, we were planning a long-distance move. I wasnâ€™t too worried, and made sure to watch my mental health very carefully. 

I made friends very quick in my new school, and was happy for the first few months. Then it all went south again. 

My family was staying with my grandparents until we could get a place of our own again, and they would somehow find a way to tear apart everything that kept me sane. It felt like I was constantly being watched and judged, and if I ever made a single step out of line, they would turn my whole family against me. It was hell. 

After a year, we moved out into our own place, but this required changing schools again, so I had to say goodbye to my friends again. 9th grade was a horrible year for me, where I just felt depressed all the time. Now, Iâ€™ve been harming since January, and have nothing left to live for. Iâ€™m looking for any way out, but thereâ€™s no active railroads close by, no harmful medications for me to OD on, and no rope to go hang myself with. Iâ€™m completely trapped. 

Iâ€™m looking for someone who can just tell me Iâ€™m not crazy. But I donâ€™t need anyone to try and talk me out of it. It doesnâ€™t get any better. Iâ€™ve lied to myself for too long. People will pretend to care as long as youâ€™re standing right next to them, but the second there is some way to bring you down, they will not hesitate to hurt you instead. Can anyone relate to me?
