When I was a child and told my dad I wanted to kill myself, he said I was selfish.I was just a little girl, but it was only the beginning of my problems. I told my dad how I felt and I remember him sitting me down and telling me how selfish it is to commit suicide, and making me feeling even worse, but trapped and feeling like a shitty person. Now Iâ€™m 28. Wonder what he would think if he knew those feelings never truly went away. And maybe one day, I can just be gone. Selfishness be damned.
