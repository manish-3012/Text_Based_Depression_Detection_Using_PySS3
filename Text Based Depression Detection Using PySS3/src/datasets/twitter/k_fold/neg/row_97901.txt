too ugly to be alivei am so ugly i don't want to live like this anymore. i haven't had a picture of me taken that i didn't want immediately deleted since i was eighteen....i'm still young but my face has already changed drastically and i have an extremely droopy eyelid i just hate the way i look so much i don't even want to go outside. i told my friend i was upset about being uglier than someone who really hurt me and they said they didn't want to comment on it because they know it's true. the person i think of as my best friend doesn't even care about me and i don't really have any friends. there is no reason for me to be here nobody wants to be friends with or love someone who is so ugly
