After a long period where I though I had recovered I am yet again deeply ingrained in thoughts of suicide.I have even gone as far as preparing notes for individual people like my fiancÃ©e and planning how I would do it. I feel the need to cut but promised my fiancÃ©e I wouldn't hurt myself and at 20 this seems like an issue many will call me childish for.
