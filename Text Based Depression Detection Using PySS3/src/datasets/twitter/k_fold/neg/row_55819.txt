Feel like I'm getting closer every dayI have mental health issues, not a surprise but not sure how else to start writing this. 
For the last month I've had very high suicidal ideation, almost obsessive and there hasn't been a day where I haven't thought about it but for the past week I've progressively gotten worse. I've gotten to the point of deciding how I would do it, planning tying up different aspects of my life so that everything is ready. Planning what who would receive my possessions. 

I'm now at a stage where I flat out want to do it and plan on it I just don't know if that'll be tomorrow or next week. It doesn't scare me, it's a little relieving thinking about it. 
I have made attempts to talk to people about it but it was either brushed off or a quick sympathetic look and then nothing. I have also been in contact with my doctor about how I feel and they've referred me to a professional but that was 4 months ago. I've also been to therapy before and it freaked me out and I left.

I don't even have a lot to complain about in my life rn, I have a partner, a job, great grades at university, friends. But no matter what I do I'm still desperately depressed and I'm sick of it. I've tried mindfulness, self help, medication and I always end up back here in the end. 
Don't get me wrong I have been through hellish trauma in my life. I won't go into detail because it's a very sensitive topic and I don't want to trigger other people who have been through similar experiences. I'm just done and to be honest I'm not sure why I'm reaching out, maybe a part of me still wants to live but everything else is too loud in my head.
