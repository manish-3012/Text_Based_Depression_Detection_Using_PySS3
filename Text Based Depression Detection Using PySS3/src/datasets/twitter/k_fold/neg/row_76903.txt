I'm a burdenMy girlfriend has supported me for four years now. She works while I blunder through school, she stays with me while I say I want to fuck other girls (not that that will happen) and she even does my homework when I'm too in my own shit to bother. She's hurting herself by staying with me. I don't even know if I love her, or if I ever did. If I could kill myself in the past so she'd never met me, I would do it. Now I'll just hurt her, just like everyone before her.

I'm completely dependent on other people for my happiness, my goals, my discipline. I'm not a person. I'm a burden. I should end it soon so she doesn't grow old and alone.
