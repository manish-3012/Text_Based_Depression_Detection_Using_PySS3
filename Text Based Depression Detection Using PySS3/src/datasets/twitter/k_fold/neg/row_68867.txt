Iâ€™ve got nothingSo I fucked up real bad, I got into some stupid shit. Itâ€™s my fault and I know it. When I was 16 my older brother tried to kill himself, a few times. It broke me. Like seriously broke me. I donâ€™t know how else to say it. And Iâ€™ve tried everything to get better. Honestly. Iâ€™m 25 now. Iâ€™ve done therapy. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to him and heâ€™s fine, honestly heâ€™s doing so well. Iâ€™ve done well too, Iâ€™ve worked hard somehow. But Iâ€™ve fucked it. I got into drugs. Bad. And a lot. I have a good job so Iâ€™m trying to recover and make it work. But I keep falling back in. And Iâ€™m in debt. A lot of debt. But nobody knows. And Iâ€™m scared. I have some life insurance. And a death in service policy. My family would be supported. My best friend and girlfriend would get twice my salary each. Plus some more. I keep thinking of hanging myself recently. Itâ€™s the predominant thought in my head. Does it hurt? How do you do it? I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m pretending to manage. But I canâ€™t keep pretending I have 30k of debt to repay. And I donâ€™t know how to do it. But if Iâ€™m gone, nobody will mind? The debt will go. Theyâ€™ll get the money to help themselves. Right?
