Exhausted.I struggle from bpd. Got into a fight with the husband tonight and it got physical. He choked me so I punched him. Ran downstairs and got a butchers knife to my throat to get him to back  off.

It was probably my fault and I deserve everything. Either I am leaving tomorrow or I am somewhere else. I canâ€™t keep feeling like my thoughts donâ€™t matter. The thing is I canâ€™t trust myself to see any sense in anything so I am pretty sure if I die that everyone will be better off. I egged everything on and I am sick. I hate myself.
