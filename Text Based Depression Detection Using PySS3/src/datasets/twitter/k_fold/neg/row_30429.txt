Someone I met through a video game (GTA) keeps talking about committing suicide and his bleak existence.Hello everyone,

I'm being presented with something I truly have no clue how to react to.

While playing Grand Theft Auto, I met this gay guy in Australia.  He was a lot of fun, we talked on the microphone and exchanged messages.

The next day he told me he has tried to commit suicide twice and the third time would be the "lucky" one. "It just has to" he says.

He often says things like "I'm boring you", "I'm annoying you", and he talked about how he's been physically attacked for being gay.  

I asked him what are some realistic options he has but he always ignores those questions and continues to tell me how horrible his life is, like having attended a funeral yesterday and being approached by "haters.'

Though, the few positive things he talks about are how he owns an enormous house with so many rooms, pretty much a mansion.  It sounds exaggerated, though who knows, it may be true.  When he gets like this, it feels like he's talking at me, not with me.

Last night, he lost it when other players joined us.  He said I was the last reason he smiled. 

I don't think I can help the guy, we are in different sides of the world.  I have my own personal issues and I can't deal with this.  At the same time, I feel bad blocking him.  I can't be responsible for his actions...

Any thoughts?
