Iâ€™m f*ucking nothingI havenâ€™t wanted to live for the past year and a half, I spend 12 hours a day, awake, laying in bed too lazy to even end this sick twisted game. I wasnâ€™t even supposed to be born, my mom  was on pregnancy pills and later got into a serious car wreck (her ford suv was upside down), I failed suicide by breaking only my foot and not my legs or my neck (25 ft onto concrete with a horrible landing), and Iâ€™m too tired to even slit my throat or plunge a kitchen knife into my bowels. I wish someone could just run me over, shoot me, something. I donâ€™t want to be alive and I mostly never did.
