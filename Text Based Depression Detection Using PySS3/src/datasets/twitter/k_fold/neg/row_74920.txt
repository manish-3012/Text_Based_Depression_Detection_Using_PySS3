I'm not sure what there is left to say.I don't really have anything left to say. I just don't see a point to continue on. Every year I thought it would get better, middle school would be better then grade school; high school better then middle school; university better then high school. I always prolonged it because I thought maybe if I tried something different each time, befriended different types of people- joined another club, changed something, this hopeless feeling wouldn't follow. Yet, it has. University is the most lonely I've ever felt. Not that I'm not surrounded by people, I just feel utterly unconnected to them. Now as I sit preparing for my last exam of the semester, whilst everyone else is out partying, it strikes me again; the pointlessness of it all.
