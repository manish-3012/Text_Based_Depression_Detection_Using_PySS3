I can't try anymoreI think about ending my life and i don't even get sad anymore. I feel nothing. All the pills I take doesn't even touch how empty I feel. What else can i take to fill me up? All i do is throw myself into so much work i burn myself out, rinse, repeat. I just don't care for myself anymore. I don't enjoy living. I dont enjoy nature. I don't enjoy reading, and when i do read it takes me months to finish a book. I just don't care anymore. I honestly feel I am better off dead. The fight I've been fighting is so hard and it has no real end, not really. I will never be as happy as i was before it all happened. That in itself is a death that i mourn for everyday.
I keep him in a box of letters and photographs and birthday cards and a pregnancy test and i hide him away under my bed. I even kept a shopping list because I liked the way he included the particular brand of soap I liked. I can't look at them, but i can feel it pressing into my spine, into my dreams when i lay down at night. They itch to be poured over; to be held close or torn up.. but i can't do it. I just lay there.
I don't know why i keep these things anymore. I don't know why i breathe at all.
