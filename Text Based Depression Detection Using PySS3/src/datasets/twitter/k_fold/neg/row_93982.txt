Got a crave on for the graveAfter so much irreversible damage and so many disappointments, I have come around to a new understanding of life. Life is not meant to be happy. 

Whatever happiness we may experience, in youth, or at  other times, is a passing fancy. Even the happiness of the most happy person eventually comes to ruin in old age. But by then death is nigh, for others like myself however, it is nowhere near nigh enough. 

I am almost 30 and daunted by the fact that there is still so much suffering left for me. I still have so many years and tears to look forward to.

The only reason I am alive at this point is to secure the futures of my children. But all the same, I dream of my day of death with eagerness. 

God knows how I feel, He and I both know my unhappiness is my own fault. I do deserve to suffer, and I accept that gracefully. In fact, it is my honor to suffer. I would rather suffer my sentence in this life and have a clean slate for the next. I'm not foolish enough to think that I, or anyone, is exempt from the laws of nature and spiritual justice. 

It's funny how so much pain causes you to not fear death. In being so depressed and suicidal all the time, I have actually become a very brave person. I am almost recklessly courageous, and I try to use that for righteousness, but it is only because I have nothing to lose. The world i so fucked it perceives good as evil, so you do end up being martyred and rejected, all because you follow the archetype of Jesus Christ by telling the  truth to people who love a  lie. 

I wonder if the devil tempting Jesus to jump 700 feet is anything like what I am going through. The bible says that it crossed the mind of Christ himself to jump off of a cliff. And that it was a temptation. 

I pray for death to come constantly but I know God won't let me rest or wimp out yet. The mind is a powerful thing and I know that my body will eventually give out just from me mentally not wanting to sustain it any more after a certain point. The will to live is key and without it you will wither away faster than if you cherish life and your flesh. 

I know God will eventually be merciful to me and let me die.
