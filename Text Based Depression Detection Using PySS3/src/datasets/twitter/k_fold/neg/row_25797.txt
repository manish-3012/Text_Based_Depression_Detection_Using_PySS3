I can't stop myself.I am going to do it. But I have other options. I need to get out of the house. During the night when everyone's asleep sometimes I ride my bike downtown and get high and try to commit suicide. I never works. I want the thrill again. But right now I do want to die. I don't want someone to rescue me anymore. This is my final notice. I love you all.
