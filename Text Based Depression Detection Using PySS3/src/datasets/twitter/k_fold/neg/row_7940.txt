enough of this shitty placeive had enough. im sick of peoples shit. and i got denied poor peoples health insurance because i have no dependents. a year too late because they slashed it from the budget last year! yay, no adults without dependents can get this health insurance they paid into through social security over a number of years. what a deal! we get their social security payments for years, and when they're down and out, we deny them help! yay, that's a great way to cut budget costs. i'm sure some smarky mba thought up that budget scheme, in that weasels infinite wisdom (lol!). i am not going to stand living in this world another week longer. denied as a beggar, that is the lowest i will sink to, i will not sink lower, i will die now. fuck them.
