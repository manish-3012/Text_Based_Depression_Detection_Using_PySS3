I just dont want to be meI dont want to die, i dont want to not have a life like a normal one with friends, my family, studying something interesting, having a romantic partner. But thats not me i cant make friends, im not interesting ,literally i have no personality, im not intelligent enough to understand things so i see no point in studying, i just hate myself so much and everything around me. its not that my life is bad there's so much worse but i cant see myself being me for much longer all i feel is frustration with my looks school family whatever and im so tired
