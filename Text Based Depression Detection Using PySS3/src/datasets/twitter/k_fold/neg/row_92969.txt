I'm exhausted and want this mental pain to endI was raised in a cult-like environment with an incredibly controlling and psychopathic father. He made us move constantly to the point I was never able to connect with anyone. He did not want me having any friends. I literally had no one to talk to growing up. About the only one I was able to form any connection with growing up was my mom yet she wasn't exactly good for my personal health. She often threatened suicide to get a rise from my father (and he seemed to egg it on). I recall in sixth grade having to rip a pill bottle out of my moms hands before going off to school. Soon after this incident she went to a mental hospital for an extended period of time. My father would tell this to anyone he encountered because he seemed to like the attention he got from it. He loved when people felt sorry for him (and would take advantage of this sorrow in the process).

In my early twenties, I tried to kill myself. It wasn't a call for help. I was committed to it and it should have been successful. When I awoke several days later in the hospital, I was furious. If you've ever seen the movie Dalida you might know what I mean. It's a true story about a singer with a very troubled life. Her first suicide attempt was unsuccessful. When she woke up in the hospital, she felt death itself had rejected her. To her, it was as if death itself didn't even want anything to do with her. That's exactly how I felt when I woke up from my failed attempt.

I'm more exhausted now than ever before. Just last night I had a dream in which I was on a beautiful beach. The palm trees were blowing in the wind and the temperature was perfect. I was surrounded by people watching the waves, which would normally make me uncomfortable, but I couldn't have been more content by it all. It was as if we all had something in common and we were already life long friends. A woman eventually approached me who almost looked like an angel and handed me a bunch of pills. She didn't say anything, but it was evident she looked happy to see me. I took the pills without giving it a second thought. I suddenly felt the familiar rush I got during my first failed attempt. It was beautiful. Everyone around me suddenly turned my way as if to welcome me home and then... I woke up to the coldness and loneliness of my jail cell of a room.

I'm so exhausted. I can't get this dream off my mind. It's as if its an invite to finally get rid of the mental anguish I've been living with for so long. I agree suicide can be an irrational response to something that is often insignificant. To me, though, it seems like the only way to truly feel free.

I don't even know why I typed all this out. I just needed to get these thoughts off my chest.
