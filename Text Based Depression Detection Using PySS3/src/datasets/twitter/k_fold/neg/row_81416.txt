Not sure what to do anymoreI recently left a job a number of months ago because I couldn't handle leaving my old job where I felt safe. I stupidly went back to it.  I make a lot less than I should, but I've been there for over a decade. I went into a deep depression when I left. When I came back I was good for a little while.. but now I hate myself for leaving the new job.

I think about it every few minutes. I can't get it out of my head. I'm in therapy, and it's not working. This is the 3rd time I've tried seeing a therapist. It has never worked for me.  Not on meds, but I've done that in the past multiple times.. that didn't work.

I've been rejected by women for being diabetic. It's hard for me to exercise without my blood sugar dropping all the time., so it's hard to keep in shape. I'm very socially awkward on top of that. I'm 35 now and have never kissed a girl. When I was younger some girls wanted to date me, but like the piece of shit I am, I didn't do anything about it due to anxiety.

My house's foundation is sinking, and I don't have enough money to fix it. That new job would have helped a lot, but I became so depressed and had so much anxiety that I couldn't handle it. I'm just waiting for major issues to occur.

I have to give a speech at my brother's wedding. He's younger and is moving on with his life and I will never get to be married. I'll never have kids or any that. I'm not going to risk passing this disease on to anyone.

I don't even know where to go on from here. I've tried to improve my life so many times. I tried going to therapy, didn't work, tried meds, didn't work, tried going to a new job, didn't work.  I had friends at one point who were helping me get better, to be more social. There was a girl we hung out with, who I thought liked me. I found out she was just being nice because I was shy and went out with another guy in our group. They got married and moved away. Another guy in the group recommended me for that job I went to, I left it and I feel like I made him look bad, I haven't talked to him since. I know he was mad at me. Now I only have 2 friends total. I'll do something with them maybe once every 3 months.

I just keep getting beat down over and over again.  I even have to fight with my insurance company all the time to get the insulin I need. I spend my weekends getting drunk alone. I've lost interest in any hobbies I had before. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't want to kill myself, but at the same time I'm really getting sick of being beat down all the time.
