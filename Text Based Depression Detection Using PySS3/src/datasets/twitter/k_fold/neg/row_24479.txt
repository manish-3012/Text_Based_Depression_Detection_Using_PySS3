Ive tried 4/5 times since mid March.Like the title says, ever since March 13th I've tried 4/5 times. Each time was with pills. First time I got the dosage wrong. Every other time I went well beyond the mld for the many medications I've tried to kill myself with. And when I would eventually wake up I'd be disappointed. The mld for one was 500mg-1000mg, so I went 3500mg+ but no luck. Currently in IOP, have a regular therapist, switched my anti-depressants, still don't feel any different. 

The trigger was my wife leaving me on March 13th.
