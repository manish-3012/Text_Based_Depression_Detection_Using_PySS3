I attempted suicide a couple days agoA couple days ago i (20M) thought it was my time to go and so I decide to try to go overdose on Tylenol. At one moment I had regret taking the pills, so I called one of my friends to ask for help and I eventually went to hospital and ended up okay. I was really lucky with not having an physical problems to come out of it. I am really happy that I had such great friends that convinced me to go to the hospital and save my life. I am now recovery and doing well. I also realized that my life has a lot potential ahead, but even knowing this I still have thoughts of killing myself. I just feel really guilty for evening thinking these things. I doing all my typical coping mechanisms and seeing a therapist. I guess I am just wondering if anyone else feels or felt like this and have any advice to keep going.
