Nothing says I love you like hanging out with the person who bullies your friend.I quit life for 4 years and Iâ€™m just now coming back to real life. The second I come back I get bullied and now my friends are hanging out with him. I know itâ€™s selfish to wish people picked your side but damn It pick my side. I know heâ€™s your friend too but youâ€™ve seen how mean he is to me. Idk what to think.
