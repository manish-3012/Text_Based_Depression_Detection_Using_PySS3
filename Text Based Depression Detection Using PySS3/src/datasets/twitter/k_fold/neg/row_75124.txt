Getting stoned doesn't even work anymoreHiya. 38F here. I have several mental health diagnoses and a history of trauma. I've been on so many different psych meds over the last 20 years, none of which worked. I gave them a fair chance as well. I took the time to get them into my system, upped the dosage and nothing. I've also been in and out of therapy, with a little bit of success. There's much, much more to that story.
The year I turned 30, I discovered weed. It has gotten me through some really rough times when absolutely nothing else worked. All of my negative thoughts and worries were extinguished and I felt like I could breathe. I didn't want to die.
Unfortunately, all good things must come to an end. It doesn't work anymore. I'm high right now as I'm typing this. Fuck, this sucks. Maybe it can help give me the courage to follow through this time...
