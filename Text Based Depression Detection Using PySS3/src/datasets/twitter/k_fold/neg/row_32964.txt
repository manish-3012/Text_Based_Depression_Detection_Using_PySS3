Things that are preventing me from talking about my problems: Pride/Shame. Stigma. Fear of judgment. Not wanting to be a bother.I feel like I'm failing at this whole being-a-human thing. Like, you're just supposed to "get it," and I don't, and so something must be wrong with me.

But I am reluctant to reach out for help because I don't want to be pitied and I hate feeling like a burden to others.

So, it's a Catch-22 of needing support to stop feeling bad but feeling too bad to get said support.

When I am in a dark placeâ€”which is often these daysâ€”I don't really want anyone to see me like this. When I'm struggling, I prefer to struggle privately.

Can anybody else relate?
