How long did it take for anyone to notice?I'm 18, I've been very suicidal for over a year. I'm so much worse than I was a year ago, but no one has noticed or said anything to me. I'm really anxious to say anything outright, but it's really obvious that I'm like this.



I've felt suicidal on and off since I was 12, then it got worse when I was 16 and here I am at 18. I've never had any form of help, no one has ever said anything and meant it. They do to others, I've seen it happen, but I don't matter. I might as well just kill myself and never worry about anything ever again.
