Depression and no one aroundI've been dealing with depression for a year now and have had nobody I can trust to talk to. Two people have said they'd be here for me. The first berated me and dragged me down further. The second will barely ever respond. I have nobody to trust. I'm going to grow old and die alone, which is my biggest regret/fear. And what's worse is that nobody cares. I've never had anybody care for me. I owe it to myself that if I'm going to die alone, I won't force myself to suffer for years and years.
