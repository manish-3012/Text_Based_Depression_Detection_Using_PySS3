I wrote my goodbyes. I am just waiting for the final inpulse to end it.The only joy I can experience comes from thinking. All my life I have struggled with a bad primary education and a learning dissability. I have tried for so long to overcome my weaknesses, but I have accepted failure. I will never be the philosopher I wish to be. My philosophical pursuit has driven the people I love away from me, because the unpleasant nature I have developed through my struggles. I had planned to write many things, but ultimately leave behind a few ramblings of an inferior idiot. I don't want to die, but I have nothing left. I went for psychological treatment for a while, but it will never cure me of my pursuit. I just have debt and books. I can't hold down a job because I find everything but philosophy intollerable. I was a good university student, but mentally collapsed when my girlfriend of six years, my first love, left me for another man.

I don't want to die, but I don't know how to live under these conditions. And I made a typo in my last post. Wonderful.
