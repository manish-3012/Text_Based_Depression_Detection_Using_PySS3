I feel like I've never had a purposeNo matter how bad things get and how miserable I am, I can't seem to force myself to get up and find a job. I just don't see any job that leads to anything but me quitting because I can't handle it. I'm not qualified or good enough at anything I'm actually interested in to be able to sustain myself off of it (I make art but not enough of it). I don't have a car and I don't have money for one. I don't have a degree and I'm already in so much debt from the first time I tried that I'm afraid to go back and fail again. I'm scatted brained, I'm weak, and I couldn't live off of disability even if I had the energy to apply for it. I feel like I have no answers, no job prospects, and I'm incompetent at everything. It feels like all the doors are closed before I ever even got to live my life. How am I supposed to make money when everything you make money from, I can't do? How do you go on living when there's no hope for anything to get better?
