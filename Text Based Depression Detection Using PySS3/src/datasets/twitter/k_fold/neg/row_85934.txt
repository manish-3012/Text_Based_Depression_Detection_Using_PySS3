the resources suckEvery single resource, even if they say they have online chat or cal you, requires you to pick up a phone.

I'm never going to do that. I don't do that to even do anything in my life.

I want help, but I'm so ashamed to get it, for real, in my "real life." I know I shouldn't be sitting on the toilet in the middle of the night thinking how much better off my spouse would be without me, but it happens. And it's night. I Can't call. I won't call. I'll just try to keep it together, pretend that I make progress on my goals for my master's every day. In reality I am so miserable and unhappy. 

I don't have much energy left. He deserves so much more than me. There doesn't seem to be that much argument...
