My life wasnâ€™t supposed to be this wayIâ€™m sorry for the wall of text but maybe someone will read and might actually understand where Iâ€™m coming from

How did everything go so fucking wrong? I have a huge extended family who has shown me nothing but love my entire life. My parents love me too, but honestly sometimes I resent them for the emotional trauma they put me through when I was a kid. I have always been the scapegoat of the family, whenever something went wrong I was somehow to blame. Enduring this for years made me hollow, timid &amp; unsure of who I was. Middle school was hell, I had friends but I also received relentless bullying from a few people, which left me a fucking mess when it came time for high school. Freshman year of high school on the first day, a girl walks up to me and says â€œYou know youâ€™re socially awkward right?â€. Fucking. Traumatizing. It wasnâ€™t all bad though, freshman year I met the love of my life, (although we wouldnâ€™t date until after high school)  and we were best friends all through high school. Besides her though, I would spend the next three years with almost no friends. Iâ€™ve made some terrible mistakes, shit that keeps me up at night. Iâ€™ve been a terrible son, brother, friend, boyfriend, and person. To cope with my constant existential anxiety I either use my phone, weed or drink to keep the suicidal thoughts away, but sometimes all three can make it worse. I canâ€™t always be a good boyfriend to my girlfriend because of how suicidal I am, but I truly love her so much. Iâ€™m sorry if this is messy because I feel like Iâ€™m at the beginning of a dissociative episode. I just want to be at peace, but Iâ€™m afraid death wonâ€™t bring me peace, just eternal torment
