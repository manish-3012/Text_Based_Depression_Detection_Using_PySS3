I'm so close to the edgeI just don't know what the fuck to do anymore. For years I've been on all kinds of medications, been to therapists, psychiatrists,  had brain scans, called the hotline. I just don't have it in me anymore. I've taken this "life" thing as far as I can. It's like a sick game, and this depression is the final boss fight that I stand no chance in winning. I think it's time to accept defeat and turn it off.
