What's the point of even doing this?I have major chronic depression, I've attempted suicide in my life at least three times, I've planned out my suicides more than a few times. I'm constantly thinking to myself now, "What's the point?" We all die in the end, why should we delay the inevitable, I'm tired of this bullshit and I want it all to end.

I'm even starting to plan out what I'm going to do, wills, everything. I'm just sick of that constant nagging in the back of my head, telling me everything's worthless, no point in trying to do anything at all. I don't think anyone would miss me, not even my best friends if I were to spontaneously disappear tonight or tomorrow.

They'll hear about it and be all like "Aw man." Then show up at the funeral for 3 minutes, I'm sure, and leave and move on like I never really touched their lives. I want this to end and I don't know what to do, really.
