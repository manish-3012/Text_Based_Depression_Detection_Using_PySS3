I wasnâ€™t supposed to make it this far.Long story short, Iâ€™ve been struggling with thoughts of suicide since childhood. I had a couple years of recovery, but after I just turned eighteen last week, it all came crashing down; I wasnâ€™t supposed to make it this far. I told myself Iâ€™d commit suicide if I didnâ€™t get accepted by a university and I actually did get rejected by every single one I applied to, but at my parentsâ€™ behest I applied to a rather prestigious school that I had no hope of getting into through clearing and lo and behold, I got in.

It feels dishonest. I donâ€™t deserve it. I donâ€™t meet the requirements, and Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™d survive in such an institution anyway. God knows itâ€™s a waste of money, since the only thing keeping me from drinking bleach is the watchful eye of my parents. Cutting doesnâ€™t do it for me anymore, it just feels.... routine, and Iâ€™m running out of discreet body parts which my parents wonâ€™t see the scars on. Drinking works, temporarily, but at some point you run out of alcohol and get existential again, and then puke your guts out. 

I know itâ€™s cowardly, self serving, and narcissistic, but Iâ€™d rather go out having everyone think that I was capable of great things, only prevented by having died an untimely death, than to live a miserable life battling my own mediocrity. I know I cannot do this, at this point everything about the outside world terrifies me. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ll cope once lockdown is eased and Iâ€™ll have to go to school, and god forbid, talk to people and pretend Iâ€™m alright so I donâ€™t scare away prospective friends. Not to mention Iâ€™ll have to cope with a completely changed world where nothing makes sense anymore and Iâ€™m utterly alone because no one else knows what the hell theyâ€™re doing either.

On the bright side, if Iâ€™m gone, my parents wonâ€™t have to pay that ridiculous tuition fee. Living out their retirement in luxury without fear for their finances is bound to ease the pain of losing a child.

I donâ€™t really have much to live for. Even my regular coping mechanisms are unhealthy and push me ever closer to the precipice, and if I should lose my footing.....
