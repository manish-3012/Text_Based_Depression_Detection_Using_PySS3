Imagining Ways to DieOver the last few weeks, I've stopped self harmimg, at leat until tonight but instead of self harming I've been looking up ways to kill myself: carbon monoxide, hanging, a gunshot, cutting, pills, or any combination. It scared me to be honest and the more I think about it the more it scares me but the more I want to do it. I just want life to end. Cut out. Have me fade away and be another one of the billions already dead. I just want it all to be *over* already.
