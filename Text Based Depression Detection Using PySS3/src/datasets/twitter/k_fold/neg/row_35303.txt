Sincerely sorry ðŸ’—Iâ€™m sorry mom for not being perfect 
Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m the problem a burden to everyone 
But if you knew my reasons why Iâ€™m still depressed suicidal scared feeling down all the time 
Thatâ€™s not easy to carry everything 
You know i tried to get my life together i failed 
Iâ€™m sorry for everything that i put you through 
I know Iâ€™m the problem 
Just need to get ride of myself
