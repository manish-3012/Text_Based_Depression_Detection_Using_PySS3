I don't know what my problem is..No matter what I do, I can't seem to stay happy. I have a bunch of friends who love me. I have a loving trans boyfriend. My mother loves me. My step-dad loves me, even though he is kinda mean. But not matter what, I can't keep myself smiling. I always get so upset over small things and I attempt suicide a *lot.* I lost tack of how many times, and I have countless scars across my body. I don't know what to do to deal with this... I'm coming here to ask for help, if there is any for me. And maybe I'll find someone else like me and, who knows, maybe even make a new friend...
