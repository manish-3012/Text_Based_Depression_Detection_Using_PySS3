How the fuck do people get decent job these days? Being unemployed makes me so suicidalEverywhere I go whether online or in person everyone wants 50 years experience  and 10 masters degrees! Fuck you to buddy I'll just stay an unemployed loser living with my folks until they kick my sorry ass out and die on the streets! I guess I should accept the inevitable.
