Suicide plan in the works.Iâ€™m done with my life.  Iâ€™m a complete screw up and obviously unworthy of anything. Iâ€™m literally done with living. Thereâ€™s nothing more I can do to help myself nor fix everything. Iâ€™m still going to be wrong in everything I say or do to everyone from here on out. So Iâ€™m done. I need to be at peace. I need to make preparations prior to my planned suicide. Iâ€™ve already let two people know. I look forward to being in peace.
