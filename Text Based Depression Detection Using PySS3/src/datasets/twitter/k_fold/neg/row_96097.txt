Life is so long yet so shortI sit here everyday trying to comprehend my own life. Remembering past memories of my life. Thinking of my current situation. 5 years ago seems like nothing but a lot of things have changed but it also feels like forever many things seem the same. I seem incapable of being happy with my life and I always wonder where exactly I made the wrong choices or if those choices were wrong and if my life is better or worse from them. Life is so meaningless yet the most meaningful thing. I'm sick of these contradictions and grey areas in life. I just want a clear set path to find happiness. Was my problem never finding a good hobby in my youth? Was my problem not pursuing the hobbies I already had for a career path? Was my problem my inability to connect with anyone I talk to? Was my problem that I locked off my emotions and am barely even human anymore? So many different paths could place me at so many different areas of life. I just wish I know what happiness is or at least how to start finding my own. It just feels like I was destined for misery. That I will never have a chance of happiness or connection with others. I will just suffer until I can't stand it any longer. I really just want someone that I can rely on and be there for me. I feel like I'm always there for my "friend" but she couldn't care less about me. Even if I do truly connect with someone I know our paths will split eventually and I just can't mentally take that. So in the end no matter what I'll be alone, miserable and broken.
