is it safer for me to smoke or be 130 lbs at 5'2 with constant binge eating disorder&amp;#x200B;

I want to fucking kill myself because I am 20 lbs overweight and I can't stand it anymore. i have seen countless specialists, therapists, nutritionists/dieticians, docotrs and etc

i have been both anorexic and obsese its been 9 years and i am 24 and my entire youth has been wasted with eating disorders

i dont fuckin care anymore i cant even write it all out i need a vice

i will either start smoking cigarettes like a normal person or kill myself

is it healthier to smoke cigarettes or be 20 lbs overweight casue if they're both the same ill just smoke and live that life

yeah i already called suciide hotlines every night for4 years who fucking cares i just did a weed gummy and it didnt even fuckin help nothing helps im so sick of trying
