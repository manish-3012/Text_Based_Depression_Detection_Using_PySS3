I called the Suicide Hotline 3 times tonight...but I couldn't bring myself to say anything.

I don't think I'm going to hurt myself tonight but goddamn, I've never felt so alone. Like everything is crashing down around me.

In the last 2 days both of my parents have asked me if I was thinking about suicide. I didn't have the heart to say anything to them. I just told them it was fine, I was just stressed out. 

It's just so hard without a support system, you know? Nothing has gone right lately. My job situation is horrid. I have no friends or family nearby. I can hardly afford to eat right now. I'm just at the point of "why even try" and maybe it's dumb, but I keep hoping something will pop up to give me a reason to want to live.

I don't actively want to kill myself, I guess, but I don't actively want to be alive either. I don't know how to bring that up - to my family, to my boyfriend, or even to the Hotline.
