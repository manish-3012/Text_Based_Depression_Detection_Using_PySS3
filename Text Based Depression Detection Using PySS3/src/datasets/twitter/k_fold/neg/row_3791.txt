Losing the will to live...This feeling has been ongoing for the past 11 months and I feel as though itâ€™s coming up to that year mark where Iâ€™ll finally have the courage to end my life. Both of my parents are dead, my father died of drug/alcohol related illnesses on my birthday, my mother committed suicide last year, I donâ€™t have any sort of fulfilling or meaningful relationship with either of my 2 brotherâ€™s, no other family members. Friends? Only two although I keep them at an arms length to avoid burdening them with how I really feel. My ex-partner of 3.5 years decided he couldnâ€™t be in a relationship with me by leaving a note on the living room table. Iâ€™m currently unemployed and registered homeless. I have lost count the amount of times Iâ€™ve rushed myself into A&amp;E seeking professional help for my mental health. After being assessed at a later date, theyâ€™ve come up with the conclusion that I have recurrent depressive disorder and adjustment disorder. This was almost 2 months ago, there hasnâ€™t been any support or follow up since then. 
I guess I naively thought perhaps maybe there is some sort of lifeline or that eventually things will get better.... but the reality is, it doesnâ€™t and Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m tired of crying every day, Iâ€™m tired of living a life I donâ€™t want any part of. People often tell me â€œOh youâ€™re so young, youâ€™re only 24. Things will get better. Time heals all wounds.â€ but why canâ€™t I shake this feeling, life will not get any easier and it is certainly not worth living especially when each and every day is just another day of suffering. I canâ€™t do it anymore, itâ€™s just become too overwhelming. The only reason Iâ€™m writing this is because I spend a lot of time on my own and I find myself consumed with a lot to say/type but I never get the chance to and this is the perfect platform to express myself without judgement. I donâ€™t want or need your advice or sympathy, I just want it all to end.
