My life is definitely going down the shitter lolIâ€™ve been studying hard lately for school. Every single day after 3 pm I study in 1 hour increments with a 30 minute break to collect myself. I think its working but I donâ€™t know how much its going to improve my gpa. I really want to go to a good school and if I dont Iâ€™m just going to feel like such a failure. 

If this music thing doesnâ€™t work out and I donâ€™t end up going to a good college I think I know what Iâ€™m going to do. 

The only reason why Iâ€™ve been staying alive is because I want to see if I can have a successful career when Iâ€™m older. I fantasize about suicide everyday without failure.
