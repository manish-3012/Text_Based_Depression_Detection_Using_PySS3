Unspeakably lonelyLost my wife of 7 years. Cheated on me and pretended she was a lesbian to cover it up. I know that nobody else is coming. There is nobody else for me. This really is the end. I am drunk as fuck and I don't give a shit. As soon as my mom goes to bed, I am going out to kill myself. Jump off a bridge.
