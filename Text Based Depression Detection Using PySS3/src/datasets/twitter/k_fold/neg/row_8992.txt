No motivation to commit suicideHello, i've never tought i'd get here. Wow.... Lot's of fucked up things had happened in my life (they r that fucked up that i dont want to mention them here) I have no friends i doubt that anyone cares about me. I still go to school (yeah sure laugh in the comments). Well actually my parents care about me and i don't know why but automatically i act normal when im with them im scared to tell them how i actually feel inside. I kinda wanted to visit a psychiatrist but i never convinced myself to do it. All of this shit was building up inside me and trust me i would do it but i just cant get over the tought of what would my parents feel or think like maybe they would blame it on themselves. Another reason is that my grandma passed away about a month ago so pretty much both financially and motionally my parents are fucked my death would completely destroy my mom and her wallet. But im no fucking better i dissapointed her everyway i could and theres still things she doesen't know about me. I just dont know where to put all of the shit thats inside of me i'm literally between nowhere and the feelings inside of me are destroying me. Would i be a dickhead if i just did it idk leave a note that it's not their fault or smthng? I tried so fucking hard but no one ever noticed it and fuck it im tired.
