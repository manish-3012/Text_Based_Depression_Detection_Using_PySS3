I am doneI'm currently in a quite safe place where I am happy. This Sunday however I have to leave and go back to my abusive household to finish highschool, now the airports might be closed and I don't know if I can make it back, the schools might get closed so maybe I won't be able to graduate this year and have to repeat an entire year because of bureaucratic bullshit. I can't handle another year there, the anxiety makes me want to kill myself :/
