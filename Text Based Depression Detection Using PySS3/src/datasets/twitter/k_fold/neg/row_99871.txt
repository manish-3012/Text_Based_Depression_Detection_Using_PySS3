This dog is broken, beaten and has very little fight left in it.Edit: Going to sleep and will report back as soon as I wake up.

Edit2: as stated upon waking up I'll report back. I am awake.

I don't know what to say. I have never been good with explaining my own feelings to people because everyone that has always said "No matter what it is you can talk to me" has always turned and said "Man the fuck up" or something to that sense. My step father and mother were the worst for that. Most friends would just dismiss it, which now brings me to the fact I never had any even though I was there for them when they needed someone. 

I constantly have thoughts of doing myself in. As dumb as it sounds I always enjoyed the dreams where I was about to die, and the thought of just doing it. I often when walking places think about just walking into the middle of the street or jumping from that high bridge or laying on the train tracks. 

I have been trying to "fake it till I make it" smiles and happiness and nothings wrong, but no matter what I do I still feel everything I do in my life is merely a fuck up. I feel that I can not do anything right it is always wrong. I am always greeted with disappointment in anything I do. I am losing this fight with myself slowly. Always joking I would be dead before I am 30 is slowly becoming a reality as things just spiral down the drain as I watch hopelessly as my mind and thoughts become corrupted. I have seen myself go from a joy filled little boy to this bitter life hating man. The little that remains is fighting its hardest to remain in control.
