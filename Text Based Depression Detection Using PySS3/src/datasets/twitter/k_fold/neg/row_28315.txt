To anyone who thinks there alone and suicide is the only optionIn 5 days it will be the first month since I lost my best friend to suicide and in 30 days he would have turned 20

He was amazing he didnâ€™t think so but he really was. he thought he was alone and no one cared he told us the first time he tried it that when he did eventually do it we wouldnâ€™t care and that no one would come to his funeral, two years went by and at 8am on the 4th of November I got a call that changed my life and broke me. I was in disbelief when I got the call I didnâ€™t believe that he was gone when I got to his house it was like he was just out and would be back later, that day I had to call every one of his friends and listen to there hearts break as I broke the news to each of them. the next night I went to the crash site and seen what you had done and it started to feel real when I seen shattered blue car parts everywhere that night over 50 people stood around that tree in tears. A few weeks go by and Iâ€™m reminded by him with just the littlest things Iâ€™ll see something and want to message him about it and remember and my heart breaks all over again. On Tuesday was his funeral and the worst day of my life it started with an open coffin viewing for me and his family my heart dropped and it was finally real when I seen the almost unrecognisable month old body of my beautiful best friend every time I close my eyes or think about him not being gone the image of what I seen is there and it haunts me. Later the funeral started and I listened to everyone that he made an impact on in his short life hearts break, his brother and I held the front of the coffin as we walked to to the car and every face in the room I looked at was in tears, as we walked into the cemetery I looked back at all the people behind us and over 100 people were there all hurt and all cared about this beautiful man who thought he had no one, after they lowed his coffin I took a white rose up to the hole said my final goodbyes and I love you to him and it fucking hurt. 

Now everyday I go and lay by his grave for an hour everyday and talk to him about all the things his missing that he was looking forward to.

I just want everyone to remember that suicide doesnâ€™t end the pain it passes it to the ones you love and remains.
