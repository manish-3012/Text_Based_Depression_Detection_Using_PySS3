Anyone else in a similar spot?Just letting themselves slowly rot away until it gets too much then just offing themselves? I just everyday avoid all responsibilities, eat, play, dont work, dont go outside, dont see family. I know theres no getting better for me, theres too many physical issues with myself that its impossible to get better so im just hanging on trying to do whatever i can still enjoy while it lasts. I basically either at one point let myself go insane or kill myself. Ive thought about becoming a monster once i have nothing and noone left in my life, thats my last resort when it all falls apart but again id probably just rather die and get it over with. Just sucks, all of this wouldnt of happened if my parents knew anything about nutrition and raising children. I try to not hate my parents but fuck their stupidity pisses me off. Never have kids if you have no idea wtf youre doing...
