Does the phrase â€œsuicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problemâ€ not make sense to anyone else?As with any other problem, why would you only solve it temporarily when you can solve it permanently and never have to worry about it again?

Part of some terrible advice I received today, along with â€œcheer upâ€.  If only I thought of that before!
