It should have been a wake-up callI've been suicidal for ten years. Last year a girl I knew pretty well jumped in front of a train. That was already a hard time in my life since I had family affected by hurricanes and my old dog died. I was searching for something to help me feel better. As luck would have it my childhood friend visited from England so we got the gang back together to chill for a few days. Then on the last day my friend got a call that HER childhood fried was dead. I knew the girl pretty well but the loss took a far greater toll on my friend. Suddenly I was faced with comforting a grieving friend while in the midst of my own exacerbated, suicidal struggle. Somehow I found the strength to be there for her even though I was in crisis. I started thinking that if I did anything everyone would link the girl's death to me. I felt even more trapped, but that's why I'm still here.So many people were affected, even my my mom became visibly angry. In a way it confirmed for me the reactions the people closest to me would have if I did it. But guilt only got me here. Not even a year later and I can't stop hating my life. I still yearn for peace and I live as if I'm already gone. I thought that event was going to be a wake-up call but I'm beginning to think I can't change how I feel.
