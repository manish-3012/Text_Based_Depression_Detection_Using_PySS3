Almost jumped 2 weeks ago. Thinking about it daily and my goal is an easier method.I posted here a couple weeks ago with intent to end my life. I ended up driving 12 hours over the weekend to a tall bridge. I walked to my planned jumping location but couldn't do it because I was too scared. 

My goal was/is then to find an easier method because the only reason I'm still alive is because jumping is too difficult for me to do. The thought dominates my life. It's my life's goal. 

The reason is mainly because I began experiencing psychotic symptoms during my last year of university. I believed I was in a computer simulation and that there was a giant conspiracy against me. I ended up doing some embarrassing, shameful and illegal things which will follow me forever and prevent me from having a relationship in good conscience. I must stay alone for my entire life,  unless I want to live a lie of a relationship. I also ended up abusing benzos and alcohol for a full year. This has had a profound effect on my memory and ability to function. 

I started my first full time job after university recently and I can barely function. It's only a matter of time before I'm fired. I'm not cut out for software development anymore. I often forget what day of the week it is. I am barely getting anything done. 

Living a solitary life with constant pain and regret and self induced mental slowness just doesn't sound appealing to me. My life was supposed to start now but instead it stopped. I no longer feel like a member of humanity and Western culture. I failed and I don't really have any options. I don't know what to do. 

The thought of suicide dominates my thinking. I freak out almost every day and repeat to myself that I will end my life to calm myself down.
