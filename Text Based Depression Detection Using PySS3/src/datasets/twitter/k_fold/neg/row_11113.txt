I can't stop being a garbage human.I try to treat my friends well but always fall short. I'm currently in the middle of trying to break up with a really great guy because i just know he's not the right one for me and I've been sleeping with someone who I'm codependent on emotionally. I want so badly to just run away from all the problems I've created for myself. I'm surrounded by all these wonderful people that I keep lying to about who I really am and it's getting exhausting.
