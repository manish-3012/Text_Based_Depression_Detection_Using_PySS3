Anyone out there want to give life a chance, for a game?For a while now I debated making my own SW thread, about how depressed I am etc.  Then I realized, if I wrote one, it's unlikely anything would change.

I put together my thoughts on what would make me want to live life.  I aspire to work on an independent game, either 3d or 2d.  For PC, iPhone, Android, it doesn't matter.  I want to make some terrible game to practice, and work my way up to something that could make money.

Is there anyone out there, 2d artists, 3d modelers, programmers and the like who are depressed and want out, that could pull together to make something to want to live life?

I am 25, in Washington State, and ever since I was 12 years old I wanted to be a 3d modeler for a independent game company.  I have worked with 3ds Max and Adobe Photoshop for 12+ years.  My works have been added to a independent game, and an established Korean MMO free of charge.

As I get closer to the edge, I realize I dream more and more of being successful, today I just had the thought of giving something a try.
