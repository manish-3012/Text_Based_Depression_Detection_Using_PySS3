Itâ€™s only getting worse and worseI had I delete my last account on here as someone was stalking it. I donâ€™t exist to anyone anymore, I just vanished and nobody noticed. I have no one left and I feel horrible. I was in an inpatient program involuntarily for five days and they made m feel like a freak. Someone really close to me wonâ€™t let me talk to them but they reported that I was going to kill my self right after I got out of the hospital. No one cares and no one actually wants to help me. They only say itâ€™ll get better and donâ€™t actually help. I might just end it on the twentieth.
