I have met THREE other people in the last 8+ months. Reddit conversations has become a desperate substitute.That's the exact number of people. My mother, step-father and grandmother.

I'm 23. I live in a house in the woods, 2 km to nearest neighbor, 80 km to nearest city. I have one semi-interaction a day which is dinner with my mother, but we rarely talk.

Other than that, it is just Reddit, Youtube, Reddit, Youtube... I have so little interaction that I end up reading conversations I have had on Reddit over and over again because it gives me some kind of stimuli. I pat myself on the back for my responses. However most of my conversations is about suicide, which just makes it even more sad.

I tried living in the city but I couldn't handle being around people, the anxiety was too strong. I feel so incredibly ugly and like a freak. I am ashamed of my face. So I moved home.

I have bought Pentobarbital online, it's the euthanasia drug that vets and docs and executioners use. I know that as soon as I have a fit of anxiety again I will most likely chug it due to impulsive rage... I don't always feel like there's no way out but when I have anxiety attacks all I think about is how I can kill myself.

It's a sad life.
