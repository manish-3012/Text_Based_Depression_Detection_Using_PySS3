Anyone else have a to do list? As in things I need to do before I die. I'm a procrastinator so technically my list is keeping me alive.
 I've been working on it slowly, things like get rid of most of my stuff( I hate the thought of my landlady  going through my personal items).
  I'm so depressed I don't really think I'll get everything accomplished before biting the bullet ( no pun intended).
