Self harmed. Feel like a burden to everyone.I'm so done with life. I'm so tired if this pain. I love my boyfriend and he's terrified I'm going to kill myself constantly, nothing I do makes that fear go away. 

Relapsed and self harmed. I feel horrible and a burden. 

He wants me to go to the hospital and I don't want to. I'm terrified of being trapped. I'm terrified of being there for weeks. Am I not going because I don't need it or because I'm terrified to? Does he want me to go because I need it or he's terrified of me not to?
