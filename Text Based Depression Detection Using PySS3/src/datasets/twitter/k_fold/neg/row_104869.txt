Another day, same shitIâ€™m sick of living not only am I sick of living Im also at the point that I get tired of people trying to help me, my mom desperately wants me to get better but also she knows it canâ€™t get better, she sat next to my bed and kept talking about what I wanted in life, why I always stay in bed 24/7 and after 30 minutes I was done I told her I wanted to die, she took it with a grain of salt because Ive told her mutliple times that I didnt wanna live anymore but I never proceeded so she doesnt take me serious. Well she should becauae its over w Im done w  this shit Im done w being a 21 year old guy with no education barely any finances no willpower to do anything struggling with my ostomy Crohnâ€™s disease depression and anxiety Im done Im done Im done if I dont kms soon Im gonna go mental I have to go through with it this shit is killing me, literally this depression is going to kill me and I dont want that to happen so I need to kms before I go crazy thats my plan I just turned 21 a few weeks ago I actually wanted to kill myself before my 21st birthday but didnt Im probably gonna kms either this summer or at the end of fall or beginning of winter this is my last year.
