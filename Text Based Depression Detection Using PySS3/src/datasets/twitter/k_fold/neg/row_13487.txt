I don't know why I'm bothering posting, I just wanted to have someone to say goodbye to.I just think I'm ready to go. I'm so alone and I don't want to do this anymore. My sister took my antidepressants away, since I haven't been taking them, so I have a bottle of Erythromycin and Doxycyclin Hyclate. I also have a little bit of alcohol maybe that'll take the edge off of it.

I don't have the guts to do it any other way...

I haven't decided if I'll leave a note yet, or not...
