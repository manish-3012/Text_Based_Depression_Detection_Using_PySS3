Very worried. Getting very realistic dreams where I commit suicide.I'm a 30(m) guy, about to get married in Feb to a girl I've been dating for 6 years. My personal life is great, and I recently got a new job which pays exceptionally well.

There's a bit of work stress at where I currently work (I'm on my notice period) but not too much, and anyway I'll be gone from here soon. 

Last 2 nights, I've been getting dreams where I end up committing suicide. I woke up sort of depressed and for a second after I woke up I even thought that it really wouldnt be that bad to die. 

I don't know who to ask and I don't know why I get these dreams. Should I go see a therapist?
