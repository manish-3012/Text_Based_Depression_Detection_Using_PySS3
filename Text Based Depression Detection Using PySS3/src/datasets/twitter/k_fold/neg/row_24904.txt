I tried killing myself again. I dont know why i couldntI was just there, ready to jump but i kept staring at the emptiness, worrying about what is the next thing after death. Darkness doesnt look that terrible but why am I so afraid of just suffering a couple minutes to reach it? I remembered that in two weeks i have an appointment with a shrinker and that yesterday i collapsed,smoked a couple cigarettes and called my LDR boyfriend. I wondered what would happen with my sister, whom i adore a lot. What about the plans of seeing again my lovely boyfriend, who gets out the best of me? Few minutes before, i had a phone call with a friend that just appeared at college, after having exchanged places with another school. I dont know how long i stood there, up the little chair that i used to eat my food when i was a little girl, thinking. Before that, i grabbed a knife and imagined cutting my veins, not doing what i enjoy of just making me little cuts in my arms, harmless. I even wrote just a phrase in an empty sheet "i had to do it" and signed. I wasnt even feeling that sad but there i was, planning on how to kill myself and failing to. Im so miserable.
