What is the least painful way to go outLast year I told my dad I was depressed and he said I was spoiled and weak. I told my mom and she told me to pray to god. I got into religion early in this year but realized how bogus it is. I need fucking therapy or something but my parents donâ€™t believe in mental illness. I am completely financially dependent on them and in the middle of my undergraduate. I sick of this petty life. I have a job prospect but if that doesnâ€™t go through then Iâ€™ve decided itâ€™s probably best to just end it. What is the least painful way to go out.
