Anxiety is ruining my life. I don't want to die but I'm not sure there's any way to get reliefI can't function anymore. I can't put gas in my car, get groceries, go to work, etc. I'm exhausted from the constant jumpiness and worrying. 

I can't get therapy; I have far too much suppressed trauma that I'm scared to unleash. 

I never feel at ease or safe. Idk how long I can do this.
