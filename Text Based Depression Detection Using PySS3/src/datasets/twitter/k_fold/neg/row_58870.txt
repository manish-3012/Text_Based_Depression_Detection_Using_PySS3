I feel like I lost my soulWhen I was young I felt I had one. The whole world seemed full. Then I had a nervous breakdown as a teenager and had serious depression and after a few years of that I started to feel like I didnâ€™t have a soul anymore. I felt completely empty. And it hasnâ€™t changed. I still feel lost, like my soul left my body. I feel something akin to empathy, Iâ€™m not really sure. Things make me sad, or at least I think they do. Sometimes things make me cry, but I still feel empty. 

I feel like a totally different person from when I was a kid. Like I disappeared. Iâ€™ve tried to come back, but I donâ€™t know how. It feels like a hopeless task. I feel Iâ€™m doomed to live a soulless life forever. Every now and again, like tonight, I remember. That hole inside me aches and I remember what used to be there. Like a friend whoâ€™s been gone a long time. I miss it.
