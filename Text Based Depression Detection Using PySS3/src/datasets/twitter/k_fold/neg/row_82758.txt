Really letting go of myself tonightGetting my fix of Marylin Manson. Third day of a seven day binge. Gone beyond seven days by now tbh. Canâ€™t remember the last night I was actually sober. 

Getting lost in the music. Lost within this depression. I ainâ€™t gonna fight it. But I wonâ€™t let it kill me either. Gonna linger here until I find my calling. 

Iâ€™m just speaking my mind. I self loathe a lot. I like the idea of lying down and letting these drugs consume me into nothingness. The music deafening me. Escaping my pain for a while. What a perfect night. 

How many of you are with me? Have felt similar feelings? I know Iâ€™m not alone.
