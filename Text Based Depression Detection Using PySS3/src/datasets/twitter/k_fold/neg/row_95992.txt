It's getting bad againthings were going well my friends were talking to me regularly and i felt good about things. but now this game DayZ is getting popular and my friends are playing it and they can't even spare me a hello, and I feel like i'm being irrational and me trying to get their attention is making them want to ignore me more but I really can't take this i'm completely alone i miss my friends and i don't know what to do.
