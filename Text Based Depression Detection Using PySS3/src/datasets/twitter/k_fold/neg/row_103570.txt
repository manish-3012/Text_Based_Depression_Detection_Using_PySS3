Giving upIâ€™m 19 years old, 7500 in debt to friends and family because of a gambling addiction, they think the money I lent them is for school. I have no way of getting that money back to them. I havenâ€™t been genuinely happy in seriously about half a year. I hate everything and nothing brings me happiness for more than a few seconds. One of my family photos shattered when it was in my suitcase on a flight, probably from the bag being thrown around. I took it out and put it on my counter and it sat there for a few days. One of the days I saw one of the large shards of glass and it sent chills through my whole body because I knew I was that close to grabbing the glass and just killing myself then and there. The only thing keeping myself from doing it is knowing that it will tear my family apart. Every day tho Iâ€™m inching closer to just doing it. Iâ€™m ashamed and embarrassed of myself. I feel empty, and genuinely sad and worthless more and more every day. Iâ€™m so sick of everything and I donâ€™t want to be alive at all. People think my life is so amazing and interesting because I moved away from home to pursue my dreams, and Iâ€™m very good socially and make lots of friends easily. But now Iâ€™m back home because of the virus, and honestly itâ€™s just making everything worse because I donâ€™t leave my house, I donâ€™t talk to anyone right now because I donâ€™t want to, and Iâ€™m just in my head all day every day thinking about the debt Iâ€™m in to my family and friend. And how thereâ€™s no fucking way Iâ€™m going to be able to pay it back. Not even sure why Iâ€™m writing this, not really even a call for help. I donâ€™t want help. I just want everything to stop. I hate myself and what Iâ€™ve done with my life.
