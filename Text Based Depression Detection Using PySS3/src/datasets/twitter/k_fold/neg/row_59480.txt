Dealing with potential terminal illnessIn two days I am getting results for illness which shortens my life by half. It has no cure. Only possibility is to manage symptoms. Just to be clear, it's Huntington's disease.
 
The whole process took an incredible toll on me. I've been suicidal for the better part of the year. 

Luckily I managed to never attempt suicide, but I've been very close several times. 

I am not sure if I will be able to handle being tested positive and facing such demise, slow and painful death over years.
