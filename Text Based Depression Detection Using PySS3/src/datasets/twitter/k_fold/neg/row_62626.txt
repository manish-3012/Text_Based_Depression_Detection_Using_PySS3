I found someone making it worthwhile, and now that's overMum died, dog died, my relationship ended after a year.

Got sectioned for suicidal thoughts because I couldn't handle being alone. 

Got a bit better, met a girl online. Good conversation, really good. Days turn into weeks of chatting and things are getting quite intimate.

Then she goes to a friend's for a week, she comes back and texting resumes. I ask about the week and it's all good. Then after a few days she says the friend was a guy she met online and fucked. And she wasn't going to tell me.

She was so sweet and we got on so well, unlike anyone else online. And now I'm devastated and thinking I can't be fucked to carry on this never ending shitshow
