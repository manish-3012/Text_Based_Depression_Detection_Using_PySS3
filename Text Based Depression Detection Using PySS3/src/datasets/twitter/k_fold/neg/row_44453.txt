i cant do shit anymore:)ive gotten to the point where i hardly even smile anymore. at the beginning of the year, i was always this loud ass, super fucking ADHD, smiling and laughing (still somewhat dying inside) hyper girl, but then i just lost everything. It started when my dad got arrested early november. then the dog ive had for pretty much my entire life died. A few months later my boyfriend of 4 years dumped me 3 days before my 18th birthday, all of my friends completely stabbed me in the back (they all now hate me) and i literally have fucking no one. Ive always been somewhat under weight, and ive been bullied since day 1, but now its even my "friends" who treat me like shit and push me around. Im losing them all slowly and im scared. i cant be alone again. Im on lexapro, and i contemplate just taking the whole damn bottle and downing some vodka then slitting both my wrists open pretty much every fucking night, and i just cant do this shit anymore. i have no one to talk to bc my mom doesnt give a single shit about me.
