i think i need help but i don't know what to say (incoherent thoughts, please understand)this is my first time writing in any psych support subreddit so i don't exactly know what to write. i might not be coherent here because i'm in the middle of today's panic attack, so id like to apologise to anyone reading this. i have thought of killing myself or dying early since secondary, and i've always believed it would come soon, but i was only ever waiting for it and never properly planning anything. i also regularly get images in my head of myself accidentally (or intentionally, and these days, often violently), whether emotionally or physically, hurting myself and the people around me. they don't have to be people i know, but it's usually the people i love because they're the ones i have around me the most. i tried reading about those things and i've kind of been able to deal with those pretty well on my own, but recently my suicidal thoughts have become more concrete. i was watching a music compilation vid for escaping your hometown or something of the sort after my only class today (uni online like most of the world), and it encouraged the viewers to imagine themselves running away from it all and taking a break. i first imagined myself going to my favourite place, but then i saw an image of me going to the rooftop and running from everything, then jumping straight off of it. im scared ill end up doing it. if i do, i dont know if i want my parents to see what i wrote here. take care everyone. whoever you are, i love you.
