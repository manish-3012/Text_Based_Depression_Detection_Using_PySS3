I am alone, always will be. I think I'm gonna go check out now.I have never been with anyone and I know now that I never will. I am more repulsive(physically) than I realized. I have nothing to offer anyone other than laughs and compassion but apparently that isn't good enough. So I'm done, hopefully there's something on the other side...
