I don't know how to help them, and I'm running out of time.A friend of mine wants to kill themselves. They're preparing to kill themselves, in fact, and have concrete plans to commit suicide within weeks.

I'm running out of ideas.

I've read your talking tips and risk assessment guide, and I've tried as best I could to follow them.

They're made it clear that their family is unsupportive, and that they have no friends left. They don't seem to have any external support, and in fact mostly seems to have contact with people who think they're an attention seeker. My friend believes that about themself, and believes that's why they deserve to die.

They're a minor, and they live on the other side of the planet. I know their name, but not their address.

Is there anything I can do to help? They're just a kid. Please, I don't want them to die.
