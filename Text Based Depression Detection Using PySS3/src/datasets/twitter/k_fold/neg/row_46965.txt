ScaredIve been thinking of ending my life for the past month or so, ive tried sleeping pills which didnt work. 

Today I scaled an abandoned factory building with the intention of jumping off. I have been planning this through in my head the past week or so and it seemed so easy in my head. 1 step, a few seconds and its done. When I was actually up there today I couldnt bring myself to jump. It was so scary I almost threw up, just the thought of falling and having no clue what would happen next. 

The stress that im going through is eating me alive I just want out but im scared of death. I like existing but living sucks.

What do I do?
