HelpEvery day I contemplate suicide. Every night I think about it. Everything was shit from the start. The one little semblance of happiness that I had was a loving relationship. I destroyed that. My earliest memories are of domestic violence. I ended up emulating that in a smaller but still abusive way. Every day I regret it. 

I just wish I didn't feel like the bad guy all the time. I've been places, I've done things, I've helped people. Something in me tells me that nothing will get better, that trying to be happy is an exercise in futility. I'm 23 years old. The only people who keep me from killing myself are my dog and my cat. But the pain is too much to bear sometimes. I want to die in my bedroom with the door closed so that they won't lick up my dead body and have to be put down. 

If only I could turn back time. To the moment where I lost my mind. And just take a deep breath and then hug you instead of reciprocating your rage. I wish I could've been better to everyone in my life.
