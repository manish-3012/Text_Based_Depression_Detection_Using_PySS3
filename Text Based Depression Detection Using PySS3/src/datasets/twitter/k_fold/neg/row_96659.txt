Need some companyMy partner of 3 and a half years told me she doesnt love me anymore. I was getting severely depressed and shutting myself off and i dared to tell her how i felt and that it didnt seem like she cared or loved me anymore.

She said she loves me but shes not IN love with me, for a few months now. Leaving me alone was bad, but this... we already have a house and baby together. I waited the first two years before doing any of that to make sure she wanted to be with me, and now that we have it, she wants out. But we still live together rn. And it hurts so much to see her but i cant kiss her or feel her or tell her i love her.

I cried myself to sleep the past few nights. Tonight she got called into work early and i was just so paralyzed that she had to take our son to her moms. I dont know how much longer i csn last. I close my eyes and only two things pop in my head. How to do it, and the thought of her being with someone else while i have to see it because of our son. Im alone right now. I dont know what to do.
