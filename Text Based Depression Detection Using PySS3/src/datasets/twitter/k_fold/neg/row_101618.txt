Sick of working a dead end job for little pay. I just can't see a way out anymore.I don't know where to start. But I will say I am at the end. I just cried for an hour straight. And I can't decide what to do. I was unemployed for around 5 months after the pretty decent job I had closed down. I was never rich, but I was making around 50k a year and was only working 40 hours a week. I was pretty happy, more or less carefree than anything. The business closed down, and I had two surgeries in a months time which put me behind a mound of debt. Which when I think about it literally hurts my heart, and feels like a giant weight on my chest. Even though I had insurance, I still owe just shy of 7k. 

I was able to find a short term solution for joblessness, and I now work around 50 hours a week for just around 24k a year. I cannot afford to do anything outside of work and sleep. The job itself is absolutely the most miserable job I have ever had. And this includes waiting tables,call centre, and just about any generic job you can think of. The people I work with are miserable, and it has been a challenge just to stay positive. And now I think I have lost that challenge. I apply to at least 10 jobs a day in my free time. Just hoping for anything to bite. The worst part of my job is that it is just random fucking shifts. One day I will work 5pm-1am and then the next I will have to be back to work breakfast at 7am-2pm, then the next I will work a double from 10am-10pm. That may be the thing that is wearing on me the most. I am unable to see my friends and family, and I feel so alone. I am off work today, it's a random Wednesday. So who could I hang out with at 3pm? No one. Everyone else is at work etc. I am not trying to be overly dramatic. But I just need somewhere to go and someone to talk to.
