Goodbye.I've finally decided this is the end. I don't want to wait anymore for things to get better. I loved her. I FUCKING loved her. It's been so long and I can't find anything close to as good as what I had with her. I don't want to suffer on this fucking planet for another day. I've had enough, I'm ending it all tomorrow. Goodbye.
