If I was right, then why?Why is suicide thought of such a bad thing? I've been told people will get hurt if I do kill myself, but I find no evidence. I attempted, and told the people I thought deserved to know, and after I recovered I didn't see any sense of empathy from them. Some even doubted me and demanded to see my fucking hospital papers (which I don't have, since my dad keeps them somewhere and now won't even acknowledge I exist). So, it comes to say, why is it considered even bad when everything I have said to try and justify actually does justify it? Isn't a personal right? After all, this is my fight, and I choose whether or not to end it here or continue, not anyone else's.
