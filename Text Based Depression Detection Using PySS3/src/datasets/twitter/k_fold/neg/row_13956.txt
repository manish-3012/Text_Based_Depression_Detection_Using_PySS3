Made my decision. The world got just more beautiful and I am happy I'll die.I plan to heavily overdose on acetaminophen and combine it with carbamazepine (initially, I planned to hang myself, but this way of dying is too abrupt and I am afraid of permanent brain damage if someone discovers me early). I will spend my last hours (or days - acetaminophen will probably destroy my liver slowly and the pain is going to be excruciating but I don't care) surrounded by nature. In a forest. The only place that brings me joy.  

I am so happy that after so many years I made my decision. It's beautiful. 

Good luck to everyone else.
