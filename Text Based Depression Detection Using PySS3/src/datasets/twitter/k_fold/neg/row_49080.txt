I've about had it 

The title says it all.

It feels like everything for me right now is going downhill in ways Iâ€™ve never seen before. None of my â€œfriendsâ€ even text me back anymore, and Iâ€™ve never felt so alone in my life. Iâ€™ve always had issues getting close with people for as long as I can remember, but recently itâ€™s gotten especially bad because now my best friend isn't even responding to me. If she does itâ€™s maybe like one or two words. I tried to talk to her about whats going on, but she sounded very disinterested. School has been especially rough this year too, with my school originally being hybrid, going only 2 days a week with much smaller classes, but going full remote recently. Before COVID started I had pretty good grades and was ready to take some college courses this year to save some money on tuition. However, this year has been very rough on me, I can hardly focus at home with my ADHD and I canâ€™t understand anything and my grades have gotten so bad, I had to withdraw from receiving college credit. I feel so unbelievably stupid right now, especially since I donâ€™t even know what to do after high school now that Iâ€™ve all but had to abandon my life plans. My job wonâ€™t even put me on the schedule recently, I have no clue why, but Iâ€™m concerned they will fire me soon. Iâ€™ve only ever had one other job about a year ago, but after I was let go from being a seasonal worker, it took me 11 months to even get a reply back from this place. I feel like absolute garbage constantly, I havenâ€™t eaten in 5 days, and would be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t highly considering calling it quits on life. Iâ€™m sorry if this seemed really mopey, but no one else will talk to me so I decided to come here to vent. I appreciate those who read this.
