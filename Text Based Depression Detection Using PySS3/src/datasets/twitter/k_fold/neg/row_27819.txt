I was so happy and now all I want to do is dieI started taking mood stabilizers a few months ago. Ever since then I am rarely depressed. I completely stopped being suicidal after years of it and I finally felt good living every day. But after being sexually assaulted for the second time, I want to die. I want to disappear and never have to feel any of this pain again. It took me so long to get over the first assault and I was recently battling it again because for some reason I kept getting triggered by it even after it was over a year later. Then I get assaulted a day ago and itâ€™s a million times worse. I canâ€™t do this again. The pain is too much to bear. I feel disgusted, humiliated, ashamed, depressed, traumatized and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to be okay again. I donâ€™t have it in me to fight anymore. Iâ€™ve been fighting through so much, my nental disorder, the emotional abuse of my stepdad, the trauma of my dadâ€™s and friendâ€™s suicide, and so much more and I thought I could finally get through it and now Iâ€™m back to square one. Killing myself would be so easy.
