So I have this friend...And she's better than me at absolutely everything. I've struggled with depression since second grade, but I know reality when I see it, and for once reality looks even grimmer than what's in my head. Long story short, if I do anything, she's already accomplished it and done it twenty times better than I did. I used to be valedictorian, until she came along--and now she's shoved me down into the middle of our class. I was elected to a secretary position for a student organization, and suddenly she, in her presidential position, took over all of my jobs and won't even let me do anything; everyone is constantly fawning over her and how much she does and then they look at me with disdain as if to say, 'what are you doing, you worthless slug? Get off your ass and help her!'.

I tried to make it into NHS this year, and not only was I the only one of my friends without a form filled out to the very edges with activities and merit, but mine was only about half-full. She filled two. I'm a journalist for Model UN, but she's the Vice President. I wouldn't even be upset if she wasn't a bossy, whiny, spoiled bitch. I wouldn't be upset if everyone actually had a logical view on her instead of adoring her blindly just because puberty has done her well. It's gotten to a point where I'm just done. I'm well aware that I'm a failure, and for some reason the world just sees fit to rub it in my face. I'm done living in it. I have no hope for a career and no plausible future. No one would even notice if I just didn't show up at school one day. I doubt they'd even remember I existed long enough to come to my funeral.

I'm sick of being invisible, the last choice, useless, and hated. I'm just sick of living. The only person who will miss me is my boyfriend, but even he will forget about me in time.
