I wrote a poem about m depression please be nice itâ€™s my first oneSome people say theyâ€™ve had it tough 
Well As a kid I would often look rough 
For My mother was a useless junkie
Too hooked to get off the stuff

She Ruined me and my brother 
Destroyed the future we had 
And for that I hate you mother 
Youâ€™ve made me really mad

My head now spins with thoughts 
Most of them arenâ€™t very nice 
And all of this could end 
With one faithful slice 

But although my head is fucked 
And I canâ€™t see the light 
Thereâ€™s always another way 
You just need to fight..
