Finding it troublesome to live...Today I was driving down the highway overpass and had a thought of suicide. There was some traffic and there was an opportunity for me to get out of my car and off myself on the overpass and jump. Really high height. I have no motivation to live life. The days seems to fade in and out between work and my bed. I don't want to do this anymore, I don't want to live anymore.
