It won't get any better.I can't get better.

My meds are no longer enough.

I am numb all over.

I can't take care of her anymore. My mom depends on me and I can't afford to leave her, she has taken or destroyed everything I own. There are no homeless shelters near this new place. There are no anythings.  Calling the police to tell them that she threatened to hurt me did nothing. They even put me thru to the chief of police himself who said sorry this is a "family situation" so you need to call her doctor instead of the police. Her doctor is an 86 year old fart who sleeps through his psychiatry sessions and believes every flattering word she says.  "I'm talking with the President on Facebook. He flirts with me."  Dr: "Oh that's so nice." SHE IS CLEARLY DELUSIONAL. WHY WONT ANYONE DO ANYTHING. WHY WONT ANYONE HELP ME.

I keep writing and rewriting my suicide note. I want to tell them to put her away forever when I'm gone. She doesn't need to hurt anybody else.
