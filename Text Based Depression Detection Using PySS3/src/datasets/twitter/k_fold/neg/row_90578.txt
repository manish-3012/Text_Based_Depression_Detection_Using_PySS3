Feeling calm for once...Just an update for you guys.

Feeling very calm right now. Don't have many suicidal thoughts at the moment...not many thoughts about anything in fact. 

I want to wish everyone here a happy Saturday.

Can each of us do something nice for ourselves today? That is my challenge for all of us. :)

Take care.
