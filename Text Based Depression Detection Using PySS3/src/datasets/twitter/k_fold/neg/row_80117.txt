I have no reason to keep going.My fiance is breaking up with me. I have a physical disability and I make minimum wage. I can't afford to live on my own. I have no friends and I can't run back to my abusive parents. I'm 25 with no skills, only a high school education. My mental and emotional state can't even handle a decent job.

I'm completely fucked. I've started over so many times because of my abusive family. I can't start again all over again. There is no point in living. Everyone I has loved and cared about have left me. I want a point to keep going, but honestly, even my knowing my dear little sister will suffer without me isn't making me want to still deal with living.

I even called a suicide hotline and they were more concerned about my father's physical and emotional abuse and calling CPS since my sister is underage. (She's the golden child, thankfully he'd never hurt her) Even the goddamn people who are supposed to help didn't even want to help me. I really am all alone. What is the point anymore.
