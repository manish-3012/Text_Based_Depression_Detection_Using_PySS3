Iâ€™m afraid I accidentally encouraged suicide as a teenager?Iâ€™ve suffered from unrelenting feelings of depression and anxiety since childhood. Iâ€™ve also suffered from dissociative thoughts.
I donâ€™t have a single friend, nor did I have lasting relationships growing up.
I have never had the INTENT to COMMIT suicide, nor do I have the intent to harm others. Since fifth grade, Iâ€™ve wished I could stop living. I essentially view life as pointless. Iâ€™ve been suffering for years and all I see is an endless road of suffering. 
Anyway, I feel guilty and like I donâ€™t deserve to live.

Eight years ago, an Anonymous user wrote in all caps on Yahoo! Answers: â€œIâ€™m going to commit suicide.â€ I responded: â€œOkay then. See you, I guess.â€  Iâ€™m almost certain that I was not trying to validate suicidal intent, endorse suicide, or make him or her feel worse. I think that I believed that if someone is ready to end their suffering, and there is no way to reach out to them, what more do I do? I may have viewed their post as insincere or attention-seeking. Or maybe I believed that the person had made up their mindâ€”perhaps I believed that this was final. Or I perhaps I felt that it was misplaced. On another comment to a different user, I essentially said, donâ€™t post this here. We are not psychiatrists, meaning we cannot help you. On a third occasion, I mentioned that the user was not the only one with such feelings. On another occasion, I basically stated my opinions: that life is not worth prolonging or living. I stated that we will all die one day, whether we are young or old; in the distant or near future.
I didnâ€™t actively encourage anyone to end their life, I simply stated my opinion that life isnâ€™t worth living. I didnâ€™t want to harm anyone, I think that I just have a nihilistic, extremely negative worldview. But now Iâ€™m worriedâ€”what if someone committed suicide due to my posts?
