When does this struggle end?To anyone else who was/is suicidal:

When did your life turn around for the better? What happened that made you believe life is still worth living?

I want to live, for my friends and what little family I care about. But I don't know if I can. Life just keeps throwing obstacle after obstacle at me. I can't seem to enjoy life, I can't get out of this financial, emotional and physical slump, and every time I seem to be improving, something sets me back. I'm not into drugs, I don't drink heavily, and I have a decent social life. I try to be kind and caring and generous and I love to learn and always have, I just started going to the gym again. However, I just can't be burdened with these never ending problems life is throwing at me. Does it get better? I just want to be comfortable, financially and mentally. Maybe I need to move out? I'm only 19 and still trying to go to college, I have a decent job but I would be fixed to a really tight budget living on my own. I know I *could* do it, but if one thing went wrong again I would be right back where I started. Something always goes wrong though. I can't do this again and again. Life is so repetitive right now, going through the motions each day to try and bargain for happiness in the future.. I am just tired. Tired of not getting anywhere. I only have a few people to live for, is that worth it? Will my life ever improve so that I don't wake up wanting to end this struggle myself? I'm trying. I really am.
