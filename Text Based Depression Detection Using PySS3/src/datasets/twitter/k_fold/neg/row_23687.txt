I donâ€™t want to live anymoreEvery year is the same. I work my ass off in school, but always have the worst grades out of my friends, then I lose motivation, become more self destructive and either plan or attempt suicide over the summer. I donâ€™t find any joy in life, how could I? Iâ€™m worried about everything, I donâ€™t feel like my self and I recognize my own fucking reflection. I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m ugly or decent looking, I have scary as fuck moments where I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m dreaming or not, I always feel like Iâ€™m fat, even though I logically know Iâ€™m underweight. I canâ€™t pay attention for over a minute, I constantly feel like shit, Iâ€™m too scared to talk around most people, my family isnâ€™t supportive or even nice and no one believes any of this. How could anyone find life enjoyable if they had the same circumstances as me? Not to mention that the world is a horrible place, I live in a first world country, and there is still crime and death everywhere. Itâ€™s constantly being talked about, but no one does anything, other than tweet about it. I canâ€™t handle school, even though Iâ€™m in the easiest classes and Iâ€™m on an iep. I donâ€™t care enough to even want a future and Iâ€™m convinced that I will end up homeless or living in my sisters basement if I donâ€™t kill myself. I do nothing other than listen to music and play video games all day, itâ€™s boring, but itâ€™s the most entertaining thing that I can do. I get more self destructive everyday and I either starve or cut myself just for the hell of it half the time. I really want to die, but I have to live because Iâ€™m to much of a coward to kill myself and I donâ€™t want my sister to have to deal with my death.
