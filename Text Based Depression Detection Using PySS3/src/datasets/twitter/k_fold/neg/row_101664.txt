I feel very out of place in this world, it's getting late.I just feel more disturbed by reality, more than ever before. Nothing feels right anymore. I feel guilty for the strangest reasons. I want to go back to a place that no longer exists; physically it is there, but at an emotional state it is does not exist anymore because time has passed and things have changed. 

I do not like growing older. I wish I would have made good use of the incredible sadness I had. Now I don't think I feel much. Or enough to do anything about it.
