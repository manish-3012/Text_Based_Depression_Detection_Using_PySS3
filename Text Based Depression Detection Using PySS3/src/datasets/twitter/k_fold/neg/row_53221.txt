The worst part about SI..Military guy here. Long story short, it isn't for me. It's driven me to have frequent suicidal ideation. I've lost a career because if it, but for now I'm still stuck in the military system. 

I wouldn't classify myself as at risk; I simply won't do that to my wife. As bad as things are for me, I can't imagine giving her that grief. 

So the worst part of SI, no one believes me. Often I feel I want to do it just so people would have taken all the help I've requested seriously. Instead, I'm called a malingerer. I'm labeled as one trying to con the system. I'm treated as a criminal for not having the will to deal with job stress anymore. I've given up fighting for what I believe in and getting what I want, aside for a discharge. 

I feel like I'm downing. I feel imprisoned. I haven't been seeing any help for the last six months since the only outcome is more restrictions on the limited freedom I have. As soon as you mention suicide, you're targeted for "help." Not one of my superiors has wanted to help; they just want to cover their assess in the event something happens. 

So yeah. I'm not in a great place. If anyone wants to chat a bit (military preferred), shoot me a PM. I could use a stranger to vent to. I feel bad telling my wife (who is suffering from depression), and I don't want my few friends to see me like this. Hell, I don't want the world to see me like this, but like I said, I refuse to return to military mental health providers.
