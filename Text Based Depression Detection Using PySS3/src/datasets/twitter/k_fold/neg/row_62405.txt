I'm done.Today was the final straw for me.
My previous friends turned against me and started berating me over Skype for no reason. One threatened to bring brass knuckles to school. They made me apologize. Now I find it hard to see honesty in anybody, all they've been doing for months is being sarcastic and fucking around with me. I see that in everybody now, I want to get rid of that thought.
I have finals coming up that this prevented me from studying for.
Today I learned that I probably won't be moving away from this place I hate so much.
I'm now finding it hard to trust people at all. I want this to end.
I tried fixing everything by blocking people on social networks and cutting off communications, but what happened is still there.
