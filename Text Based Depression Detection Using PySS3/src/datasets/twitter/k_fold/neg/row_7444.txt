41%It's been a while since I first posted here. Things have changed arguably for the better since then. I  started an apprenticeship, didn't end up homeless  or starving to death like I wasn't far off from back then.

But I feel worse than before.
It's always been one step forward two steps back for me.

I identified the root of my unhappiness with life back then. I'm trans and I feel incredibly out of place. So I decided that I didn't want to die without at least trying to transition and living the life that looks so promising. I pulled myself together and got myself some income so I could pay therapy and whatever else I needed to survive. 
And then I found out that there is simply no help in my area. Nothing. I begged the local lgbt centre for information and help. But they couldn't help me. Now I work and earn money I can't even use on something that's relevant to me. I'm working for nothing. I don't live a life right now, I'm just enduring agony for the hopes of a future that has been immediately crushed. It will take me years to actually get somewhere and I can't continue this any longer. I've got no support, no actual friends, a cold mostly bigoted family and no one to relate to anymore. I'm extremely isolated and lonely.

I really tried my best but I don't want to go on like this. I desperately needed the help I couldn't get.
Now I'll just be another number on a fucked statistic.
