My mind and body are shutting down and preparing for death at this point.I told myself I would wait until November when I become penniless and homeless before I kill myself, but at this rate I'm not going to make it that long. I'm going to cancel a job interview because I don't have the energy or mental capacity to do one anymore. Without a job I become homeless, but even then I can't do it. I can barely talk to people on the phone, and I'm expected to suit up, almost kill myself in rush hour traffic, and go through a strenuous technical interview when I get there? No way.

My body is resigning itself to death and I no longer have the energy to do anything anymore. I can no longer concentrate on anything, and am beginning to lose track of what day it is. Most of the time I'm just in bed wasting away. I have nothing and no one to live for anymore.
