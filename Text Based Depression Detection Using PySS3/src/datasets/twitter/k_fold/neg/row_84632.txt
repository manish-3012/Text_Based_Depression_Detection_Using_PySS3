I wish there was a simple, painless, and cheap way to do it.I used to think of it as an option and wouldn't think past that. And then as the time gets closer I get so stressed over the details. I likely can't buy a gun since I've been institutionalized. It's tougher than I thought. I was so ready to do it a couple months ago but my brain was so scrambled I could barely get out of bed.
