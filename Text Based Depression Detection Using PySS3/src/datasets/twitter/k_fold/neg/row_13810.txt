I walked in on my little sister crying because an online friend of hers was going to try to commit suicide. What can I do to help?I've never had suicidal thoughts or had a situation like my sister, so I don't really know what I can do. She knows that her friend lives and California (we are in Illinois), but that's pretty much it. My sister said her friend didn't end up going through it after she told her that she cares about her a lot, and that lots of other people in their friend group care about her, as her friend's complaints were that no one loved her.

I'm not sure what to do. I gave my sister a hug, gave her some stuffed animals and talked to her about it for a bit. What else can I do?
