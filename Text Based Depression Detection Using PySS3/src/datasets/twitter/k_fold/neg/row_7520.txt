Work is fine, home life is fine, but......still depressed, because "fuck you", says my brain.

Depression isn't the only ingredient in the clusterfuck cocktail, but it's the one I'm feeling most acutely at the moment. schizoaffective disorder as well, and (according to pdoc at least) borderline sociopathy.

Home life is fine. Work is fine. By and large, things are fine. But, y'know, chemistry. I tell ya though, it gets exhausting after so many years. Turning 35 this week, and it's a song and dance I've been doing for a long time. I'm wiped out. Barely any fight left.

I used to be angry at how much self-hate I had, but pretty much over that. It doesn't matter how much I exercise to improve my self-esteem, or how much better I get at a given skill, there's always this nagging "you're not good enough, and never will be" sense, following it all around. I'm tired of being angry about it.

Bleh, no sense clogging up an already clogged up section with a novel.
