Keeping on going or dying?I am debating in my own head if I should keep on going. For what? I am feeling better right now but in one hour the cycle will begij again and even if I feel Better for a month it will all happen over and over again and I will feel the pain. I am busy with pulling myself out of being suicidal. That is not a purpose in life. That is trying to live to not make my parents and family sad when I die but I don't find happiness in this life.
