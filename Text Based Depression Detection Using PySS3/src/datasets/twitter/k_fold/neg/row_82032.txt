Iâ€™ve realized one of my major issues is no one listens to me with compassion...After extreme self harm to the point of hospitalization I feel like no one has a heart anymore. I feel like most of society is oblivious to the suffering of the world and especially their own. 

Most people try to bury their suffering, I am trying to let it all out and it has made me extremely compassionate. But now I feel like I have no one to listen to me with any form of compassion and I feel so extremely alone.
