Love.I recently have been going through more then I could ever wish upon my worst enemy. I want everyone to know, my name is Jay, and I deeply love all of you and everytime you think suicide is even an option in life, to think of this post. Everytime you think of suicide, think about 1 way you could share the largest amount of love and grace to a world that hasn't treated you right. You're not put in this situation to go out easy, you're here to express extreme love and grace your heart has. Now go. Go find how much you can truly expend in this world. I love you, and I know many more people do, they just aren't thinking it at the same time.
