Not okayNot even a little bit. I joke about being a bad liar, but I am really good at putting on my happy face and pretending. The only time I feel remotely okay is when I am high or drunk, and by the end of the night, I crash hard and feel worse than before. 

Nothing is getting better. I've been doing everything in my power to be better, but nothing works and I continue to fuck up everything I touch. It's like the universe is telling me it's time to just kill myself already and stop burdening the people around me with my depressed, awkward bullshit.
