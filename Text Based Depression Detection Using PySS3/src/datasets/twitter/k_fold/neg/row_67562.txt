I've been thinking about how to do it for a while...Now that the time is getting close, due to this virus... Not sure still on how. I have a local shop that is still open and I could get a piece and do it the quick way. There is a local train I could always catch. Three or four people take it every year or so. I put off having everything in place, and now we are a day or two from full lockdown. I did have this dream about Chris Cornell, and exactly how that must have looked. That sounds like a terrible idea though! My parents will be very upset though. They are older and really panicked about this whole thing. And I can't stop shaking. My feet are constantly freezing, I shake all day and my heart is racing. Then every few days I will feel like I have a three hour adrenaline rush, where my muscles feel warm and my heart beats really heavy. Then I get really tired and take a nap that feels really good. I'm 46, and have been basically putting off being serious about this for a while. And I always pictured something like this causing it. I would rather explain to my parents about the situation, so they understand. If they found out though, I think they would seriously not make it. I might break the ice by hinting to them, or just explain that arrangements aren't necessary. This still doesn't feel real to me. It is a constant panic attack. I know the difference - I used to get the random panic attack. Now - it would be impossible to have one. I've been in one for two weeks.
