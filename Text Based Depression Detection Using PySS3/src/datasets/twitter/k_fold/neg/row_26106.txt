IM SO DONE!!!!!!!1 week ago I told my parents that I'm suicidal and everyday since then someone has called me to see how I am doing and I told them I had a plan on killing myself and that day my dad turned my room upside down to find my razor. He found it . I was going to use it to kill myself that night. WHY WONT THEY JUST LET ME KILL MYSELF. I don't want to be hear anymore. 17 years is long enough for me.  My perants won't even let me in my room in the day alone for more than 10 mins. I just want to die so much.
