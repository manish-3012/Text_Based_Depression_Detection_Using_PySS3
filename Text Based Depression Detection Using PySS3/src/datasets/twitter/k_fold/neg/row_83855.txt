Might have lost everything...My life sucks, I have failed college, I quit the sport I loved because I was bad at it, and all I have done to my life so far was playing videogames... I have 6k hours just on steam alone (spent a lot in non steam games as well), And im just 20... Finnaly found love, found that she liked me as well, I couldn't belive when that was happening  to me.... But I might have ruined everything because im an idiot... I don't know how to talk to people... I did not insult her or anything but I've hurt her many times mostly because I always hide stuff from her because im afraid to her but then I end up telling everything I feel and it hurts even more I guess... All I want in life is to be with someone and I think I might have lost her tonight... I have seen this happening to by Godfather... He wakes up with a cigarrete in one hand and a beer on another... I'd rather die than live the whole life alone with minimum wage job...
