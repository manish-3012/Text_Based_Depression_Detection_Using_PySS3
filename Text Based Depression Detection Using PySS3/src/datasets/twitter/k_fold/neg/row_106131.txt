Always close to the end of the lineI hate my life, I hate my job and I hate my marriage and they are all perfectly good.  My life is comfortable, my job is pretty easy and I make lots of money and my wife - while a little distant and somehwat cold after a few years of a dragging marriage - still is loyal, attentive, and here.  I have no other logical conclusion - when I think about what EXACTLY I hate about any facet of my life I cannot put my finger on it.  Eventhough my life seems relatively cushy and even blessed I am miserable and suicidal very frequently.  I dont guage how my life goes in terms of when I am suicidal and when I am NOT suicidal because I almost always are close to the edge.  I judge the success or failure of the day or the minute with HOW CLOSE i am to suicide.  I have been very very close - a whisper away - and other times I am just thinking about it.  It is problematic when I start really getting deperate because I had someone intervene in my life to stop me from committing suicide when I confided in her - but I really wasnt looking for the police to show up at my home - I just wanted to talk to someone.  I needed to know someone cared.  She left my life after that - she said I was too depressing to know and never spoke to me again - this is a woman who loved me at one point mind you.  I honestly believe that the only people who can HELP people who are suicidal are people who have ALSO been suicidal because only we KNOW what it is like.  Only we know what it is like to want to die and to still get through it - people who have never wanted to do it may think they know what to say or what is the right things to say but they dont.
