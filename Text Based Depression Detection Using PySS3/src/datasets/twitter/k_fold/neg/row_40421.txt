constant anxiety and sadnessi have felt nonstop anxious for the past few weeks now. i have small periods of time that its milder but usually it comes back quickly when i start to think/ i dont have a big distraction. school is the worst. i want to do well but my anxiety and suicidal thoughts distract me too much from paying attention and doing my work. 
it's hard to breathe and my lungs and stomach hurt. i have nightmares. i can't stop overthinking and worrying and usually my anxiety ends up me thinking about suicide and how/when i will do it and what would i write in my note. 
i wrote an actual note a couple of days ago. i have had depression and attempts for many years but i havent actually gotten myself to write a note ever before. i probably had the note for a couple of hours but then i ended up destroying it. i also have weird thoughts after "being happy" for a moment then thinking "i can kill myself now, it's okay. i'm okay with that" .
