I lost my girlfriend to youtubeI have been talking to this amazing girl. We were friends for a few months but since I turned 16 we decided to date since neither one of us has really tried that before. On the side I made YouTube videos and streamed and became slightly successful. I quit for 9 months however but I was depressed that I didn't keep going. Her and I were still together when I started doing it again, but I started losing time for her. It was bad, like I only would talk to her for a maximum of an hour a day and she never really had my full attention which atleast from the ones I have talked to doesn't roll with females lol. Anyway I feel like it's too late. She really doesn't want to talk at all anymore and I don't really know what to do. Idk.. like I never would have thought something so small could tear me up so much
