I'm depressed for seemingly no reason.So I live a pretty decent life, I have a nice family, a twin brother and an older sister, and my mom and dad. We live in a small but decent house. However my mom and dad are getting a divorce and that's putting a huge strain on the family. I have friends at school, they're all pretty nice. I'm a fairly attractive person, and have a few guys and girls at school who like me. But I just feel numb. Like nothing I do has any meaning I have struggled with self-harm and an eating disorder in the past, I've kind of corrected myself. We have a family farm that I visit (my biological mom and stepdad) every second weekend. Its a three hour drive and I go via public bus so it sucks. When I'm old enough to drive I want to. Drive everywhere, the feeling of freedom would be amazing. But instead I'm here living my mediocre life. I'm just tired and numb. I could go to the school counselor, but I don't see the point. My previous therapist was really nice but treated me like I was fucking stupid. I just can't everything is so hard and I have no one to talk to. Goodbye, maybe tonight is the night. Can someone please talk to me? I'm only a young teen so everyone just disregards my problems ' oh it's just teen angst' I don't think teen angst is wanting for everything to be over, I don't thing teen angst means I am incapable of feeling happy. It's just hard. Goodbye, and thanks for reading this whole thing. Please someone talk to me I'm so alone rn.
