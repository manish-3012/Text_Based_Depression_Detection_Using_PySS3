Married, 1 kid, #2 on the way, suicidalI have family and friends but no one seems to care. I finally got the courage to tell a few people I was thinking about suicide and it didnâ€™t seem to matter to anyone. I told my husband who I share a child with and have another on the way and he didnâ€™t even care. He didnâ€™t seem to care about having to raise our child alone or that she wouldnâ€™t have a mother. I donâ€™t want to continue living if this is how life is. Someone caring would be nice but I just donâ€™t want to be sad and in pain all the time.
