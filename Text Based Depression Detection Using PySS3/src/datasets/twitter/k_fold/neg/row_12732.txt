I have decided to do itIâ€™ve decided to take my life. Itâ€™s not today, or this week, but a few months from now. I have almost finished my goodbye letters, and Iâ€™m meeting the people I care about for the last times this fall and winter. They donâ€™t know that this is the last time weâ€™ll see eachother. 

I have actually told a few people that Iâ€™m mentally in a bad place, and that I would need support. Most said among the lines of â€Okay please tell me if thereâ€™s anything I can do!â€. But itâ€™s empty words, cause even after I told them what I need they wont do that. I dont think Iâ€™ve asked for to much, like unrealistic stuff. All Iâ€™ve wanted have been someone to meet. Not for days or hours, just for a coffee when Iâ€™m really down. 

So Iâ€™m lonley. I just dont have any friends, and Iâ€™m not anyones first choice. In all my friendships Iâ€™ve realized that the friendship is so much more important for me than for the other person. Iâ€™m never invited anywhere, unless itâ€™s a big enough event that not inviting would be rude/bullying. But if it is something smaller, like a birthday dinner, Iâ€™m not a priority. No matter if I invited them to my own. 

Iâ€™ve tried connecting with old friends, and new people Iâ€™ve meet at work and had some sort of friendship with. With workfriends Iâ€™ve realized that Iâ€™m only good for talking to at work where their real friends arenâ€™t. I still try to reach out to people. Sadly the answer is always â€maybe next weekâ€ or â€Yes! We should definitely meet up!â€ and either cancel or being to busy. My former best friends have moved on with their lives, and one even admitted that I just dont fit in with their current life. I dont have a partner, and every relationship Iâ€™ve persued have been rejected pretty soon. 

So Iâ€™m not going to be missed, I wont be a missing piece anywhere, because no one counts me in the first place. The only people right now that would be affected are my mother, grandma, and one sister. But I know that my current existence is a burden for them as well, with them always worried. When Iâ€™m gone it will be a definite for them. Yes, it will be a sadness, but theyâ€™ll be able to relax in that. For others it will be maybe a sad period, that someone they knew died, but it wonâ€™t have any bigger impact on their lives. 

I have a date, and a method that wont hurt anyone else (so not like a train or building), Iâ€™m still deciding between two places, but both of them would be okay. Iâ€™m saying my goodbyes, have my will and funeral planned and done.

I just needed to get this of my chest, I feel like I cant talk to anyone. I just feel so relieved to tell someone everything, even if itâ€™s a stranger on Reddit.
