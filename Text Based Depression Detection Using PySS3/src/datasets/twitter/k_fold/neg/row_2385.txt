I have my first real final exam tomorrow which I havenâ€™t studied for, and I feel like I want to kill myself rather than taking the test and failingIâ€™m doing a dual credit college algebra course, and itâ€™s going to end tomorrow morning. Other than this course, Iâ€™ve never really done a true test before. My school finds different ways to see if we learnt what was taught in class. But not having done tests before, this class was such a hard introduction to a college level course. 
Tomorrow is my final thatâ€™s worth 30% of my total grade. I have to take it at 9:00, so I canâ€™t study any more at this point. If I get anything less than 75%, I will get an F in the class. Iâ€™ve tried studying for the test but none of it is working and Iâ€™m 100% sure that I will fail. Iâ€™ve never taken a final and Iâ€™m not getting any help on studying tips or anything from anyone around me. They assume it will be fine. Theyâ€™re wrong, I know it wonâ€™t be fine.
If I fail this class, my GPA will plummet and I donâ€™t have many other graded classes Iâ€™ve done, so this one will affect my entire GPA. Iâ€™m not going to be able to get into college. And if I canâ€™t get into college, what the hell am I going to do.

Iâ€™m the only one in my family who isnâ€™t some super smart A+ student who is top of their class and who already has scholarships for college. Iâ€™m a failure. Iâ€™m shit. I should just die if Iâ€™m going to ruin my life like this. If my life is going to go to shit, so I might as well take control of the situation and kill myself... Itâ€™s already been really hard this past year for me. In January I started getting really bad periods of suicidal ideation. It happens every week. It already take so much strength to prevent Iâ€™m ok. Itâ€™ll be easier to kill myself at this point...

But I donâ€™t actually know if I can do it. Iâ€™m still teetering on the edge of cutting my wrists tomorrow while my parents are out, or taking the test and ruining my life and disappointing everyone. 
What do I do...? I donâ€™t really want to die yet, but I still want to kill myself... and I know I canâ€™t live with myself being a fucking failure. I just feel so lost...
