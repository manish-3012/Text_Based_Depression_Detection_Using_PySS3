I'm so lost as a personI don't know who I am, I don't know what I want out of life. I feel so fucking lost. My partner of 2.5 years, who I lived with for 2.5 years, who is the love of my life left me and moved out a month ago. I was already lost as a person before him, but I thought he was my saving grace when I met him. Instead I lost myself more by wrapping my identity so far into him and our relationship. I feel like I helped him find himself enough that he was able to overcome depression and anxiety, but that he decided to not do the same for me.

Now that it's over and he's gone I can't stop crying looking at the physical spaces that he used to occupy. All I can think about is trying to rearrange my space or move to a different apartment to help, yet I have no money. 

I've been working a new job for 8 weeks and still have yet to be paid. I have little motivation to work, and some days I can only get 2-3 hours of work done. I have no sense of direction and have actively avoided working on my PhD for months. I do not know what I want to do with life or what type of work that I would be happy doing and that would be fulfilling. I want to quit my degree because I have failed at trying to finish it but I'm fearful of the repercussions and that I have no alternative plans.

I just feel so lost, so without direction or purpose that I keep finding myself here in this forum. Reading stories of others, some similar and some different. I don't have any active plans of suicide but I can't stop thinking about all the pills that I do have or the fact that I can access drugs to O.D. on. I'm honestly scared that I have lost the will to live and that I'm going to fester on this planet, making no positive impact and being only a burden. I hate this, I hate this so much. Thanks for reading and for letting me vent.
