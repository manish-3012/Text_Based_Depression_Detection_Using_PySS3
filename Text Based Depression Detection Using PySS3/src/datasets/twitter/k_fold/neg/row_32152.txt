Not temporaryI feel like every time I talk to someone or I seek help on a website, Iâ€™m told that my suicidal thoughts are a permanent solution to a temporary problem. But this isnâ€™t temporary. As long as I can remember I have hated who I am as a person. Iâ€™ve hated my personality and so had everyone else. Iâ€™ve tried to change it for 22 years but I canâ€™t. Iâ€™ve tried therapy, medication, treatment... it all just numbs the feelings. When I want to cry and I canâ€™t get tears out and I know itâ€™s just because the medication stops the tears but not the underlying hatred I have of myself. No one likes me and I understand why. I donâ€™t like myself either. And i canâ€™t find a way to fix that.
