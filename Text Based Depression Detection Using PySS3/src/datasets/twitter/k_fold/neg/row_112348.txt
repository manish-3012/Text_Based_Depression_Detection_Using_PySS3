I've never been closer to ending it all than I am right now...I'm just so overwhelmed by everything. I lost my job, I'm struggling with money because my roommates can't manage their own money and understand our situation, I could lose my apartment and if I have to move back in with my parents, I'll have to say goodbye to my social life and I'll probably end up in jail for attacking my mom's husband, I have tons of work and other basic things for life that I need to get in order because I was too lazy to do them when I was younger, I have no motivation for my hobbies or a career because everything is just work, and I lost not only the strongest love I've ever experienced but my best friend too because they were one in the same.

I don't know what to do anymore. I can't even focus on my interests or hobbies. I've been laying in bed for probably a week now and just ending everything so I don't have to deal with it sounds better and better each time I wake up and remember my life.
