Need some advice please..I wasn't sure where to put this, so I'll put it here.

I need some advice on what might be wrong with me. I'm currently 19, and this has been happening probably since I started highschool.
My mum has bipolar and my dad has depression, im not sure if thats relevant though. 

I get these extreme mood swings, I go up and down many times during a week. When I'm up, I'm crazy. I'm non-stop talking, bursting with energy, affectionate and over react to things. When I'm down, like right now, I feel hopeless, like noone could ever love me, like I NEED someone. I think about cutting all the time, although I haven't done so in about 3 years. I think about just ending things. Ups usually happen during the day when I'm at Uni, mon-thurs, and downs always happen on the weekend when I have nothing to do.

I know WHAT happens but I don't know the WHY and it drives me insane when I'm down like this, I feel terrible and usually end up crying for no reason all night and hide in my room, tossing up whether to do anything about it or not.

It's not like my life is bad at the moment. Everything's going fine, great. Definitely feels like its something I can't control, which is scary.

So for anyone that's read this whole thing, thanks. Any advice on what might me going on with my head is greatly appreciated. Could I have borderline personality disorder?
