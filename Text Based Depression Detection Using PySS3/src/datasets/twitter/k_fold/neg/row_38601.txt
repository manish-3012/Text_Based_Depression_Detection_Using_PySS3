How did you get better?Iâ€™ve dealt with depression for around 7 years now. I overdosed twice on pills and drowned myself in alcohol since coming to college. Iâ€™ve been clean for about a month now and I thought that things would get better. Back when I was drinking I got straight Aâ€™s and was motivated and now that Iâ€™ve stopped my depression is the worst that itâ€™s been in 4 years. The main stressor is that I was sexually assaulted by one of my fraternity brothers back in September and Iâ€™ve just now been trying to work through it, without the help of any substance. I feel hopeless right now and itâ€™s hard for me to find a reason to keep going through the motions every day. I donâ€™t want to be talked out of anything because honestly whatever I do is going to up to me. I was just hoping to hear from any of you how you managed to heal and what that looks like. Did you get back to â€œnormalâ€? Are you at a new place in your life? Did it get easier or did you just learn how to cope?
