So, how's your day going?It's currently Saturday for me after a long night of tossing and turning, my sleep schedule is fucked. What about you though? Anything interesting going on? Even the smallest thing. I'm bored, and actually trying to have a conversation might take my mind off of my depression for a bit. I usually just lurk like a lot of people so, guess I'm desperate. If your day isn't going so great that's ok, I'm sending positivity your way &lt;3. That unintentionally rhymed.
