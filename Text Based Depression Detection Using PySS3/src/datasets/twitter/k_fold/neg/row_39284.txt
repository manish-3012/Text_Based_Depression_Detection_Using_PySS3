InsignificantYouâ€™d think (more technically; I thought) that attempting suicide would be more larger than life and a bit more dramatic. I mean, itâ€™s literally The End.

Itâ€™s not. 

Itâ€™s humiliating, confusing, extremely painful, and exhausting. And then you realize that nothing in the goddamn world changed. You realize how insignificant you are in this society, that despite all the pain and suffering you were going through, not even a single leaf on a branch has gone out of itâ€™s place. 

At first you feel tiny and weaker than youâ€™ve ever felt. Then, you feel a weird comfort in these facts. 

Nothing will change.

Not the breeze, nor the sky. 

Itâ€™ll all still be there even when youâ€™re gone.

This gives me comfort. Itâ€™ll be okay even if Iâ€™m gone. No one will care, no one will notice. 

All Iâ€™m doing is leaving a house that I never owned and giving myself a more suitable living space.

Life to death.
