I don't have a reason to commit suicide, but I can't think of a reason to live eitherI'm in my thirties so I'm past my prime. I already make more money than I can think of crap to spend it on, so raises and promotions mean nothing to me. I find my days off work to be boring, so I don't really look forward to retirement.

It feels like my life is already as good as it's going to get, and will only go downhill from here. What is there to look forward to other than declining health?
