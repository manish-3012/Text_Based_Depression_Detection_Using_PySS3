HelpI know how I'm going to do it, I have my means and I've narrowed it down to two options. I've obtained the things I need to do this over several months, this is not an irrational, last minute thing.

I became severely ill years ago with a degenerative neurological disease. I'm in uncontrollable pain all over my body all day every day. I have a failing memory, osteoporosis in my 20s, other failures of Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy. I can no longer afford my health insurance. Without it, I don't know how I will live. Applying for SSD in this state takes six months for a reply and they only accept 30%. 

I left my abusive partner of three years and had to move back in with my emotionally abusive parents. I've started selling my possessions. I tried to tell them a few days ago about the emotional pain I was experiencing and they told me that it was because I had stopped going to physical therapy for my neurological condition. They are both in denial and appear to believe that this is a curable condition.

I do not have the funds to move, if I obtain a job I will no longer qualify for disability, and I really can't do much work anyway. I went to a four year college, and have otherwise had an excellent life. 

But now I'm cornered. I don't have any friends or back up, I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm in between general practitioners, if I tell my new doctor about my thoughts they might stop prescribing my pain medication due to instability or simply not take me as a patient. I'm out of options.
