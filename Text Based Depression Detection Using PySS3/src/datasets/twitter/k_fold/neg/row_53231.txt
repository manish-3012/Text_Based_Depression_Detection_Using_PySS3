So tomorrow is my birthday...and I really don't want to be here. I was crying in the early morning today because I've acomplished nothing and I'm such a complete lazy-old-ass who doesn't want to do anything with their life but sleep. You may say I'm still young but I feel like a really old person and I don't even want to try. I still regret the day I tried to kill myself because, obviously, I didn't go through with it. Anyway, I was thinking earlier today that maybe tomorrow I could throw myself off a balcony. I'd be home alone until I had to go to meet a buddy for lunch so there would be no problem.  

I know I'm such a pain in the ass in this subreddit and this would be buried but there is no one in real life I feel I could talk to. I'm just hoping and wishing I won't wake up tomorrow because fuck birthdays, life and loneliness.
