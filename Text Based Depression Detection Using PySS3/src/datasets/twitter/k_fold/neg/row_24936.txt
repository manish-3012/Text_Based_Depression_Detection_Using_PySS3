I think I'm going to try to impulsively kill myself againLast year I attempted suicide on a whim. I think I thought about the entire attempt for 3 minutes tops, and then chugged an entire bottle of pills, resulting in an overdose. 

I feel the same as I did last year. I see the same warning signs leading up the attempt, and I think I might try again. If I do end up doing it, then I might jump off a bridge or crash my car into a tree going 90 mph. 

I'm not sure what I can to avoid it, so I might as well embrace the reality of the situation. People might miss me, but at this point I'm too emotionally exhausted to give a fuck.
