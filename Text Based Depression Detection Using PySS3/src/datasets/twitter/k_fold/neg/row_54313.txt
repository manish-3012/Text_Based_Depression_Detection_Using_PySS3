I will kill myself tomorrow morningTomorrow morning  im going to kill myself and end everything. I have nothing to live for anymore

Everyday Im suffering from living my live. I don't have anyone who cares about me nor have any support from anyone. My family hates me and my coworkers don't seem to like me. It seems like everyone is just getting further from me. Everyone yells at me and treats me like garbage. It would be best i left them all. My dreams and goals to. No one would care. Im not very smart and never had good grades, so I couldn't really advance in school and failed some of my classes in college too

I tried getting help with depression, but it didn't seem to work and now i feel like nothing will work for me.  

My life will never get better and things are getting worse. I just cant take it anymore and i wont to die. I tried many times before, im just too scared to do it, but I don't want to live my life anymore. I know people will cry, but im sure it will be tears of happiness that im gone forever. At least i wont be shedding tears anymore...
