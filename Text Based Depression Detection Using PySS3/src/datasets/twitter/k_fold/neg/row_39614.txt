Just tried to end it.Not really though. Even if I had succeeded I'd probably only pass out, since what I was doing was just a blood choke. Maybe that's good, it means I'm not really suicidal. I got my lighter out to burn my hand after that to feel something, but couldn't do that either. Used the hot metal near where the flame comes out to burn my finger a little bit, but it ended up just going numb after a bit, which is probably a metaphor. I just feel so dead. I don't know what I did wrong. I took my dog for a walk a minute ago, it was nice. I keep stopping typing because I don't see the point. I'm just attention seeking, I probably don't even want to die. 

fucking useless
