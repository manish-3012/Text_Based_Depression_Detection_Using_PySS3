I have no option but kill myselfI've backed myself into a corner and I've got no ideas left anymore. All I do now is sit around and waste time and delay my inevitable death. There is no way out of this situation other than by dying, I've ran out of escape routes I guess. I just need to build up the strength and confidence to take my own life and I won't have to worry about anything anymore.
