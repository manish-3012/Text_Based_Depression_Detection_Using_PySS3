My brain hasnâ€™t stopped racing and I need to dieI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s real anymore. My memory has been so warped by my anxiety and depression. Iâ€™ve been convinced that Iâ€™ve done absolutely horrible things and I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s real anymore, and I donâ€™t even care. I canâ€™t stop the cycle of panic and constant rumination. I need to kill myself. Because Iâ€™m in pain, and thereâ€™s a chance that I wasnâ€™t even a good person in the first place.
