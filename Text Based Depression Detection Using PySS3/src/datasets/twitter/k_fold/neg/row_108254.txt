The call of the voidRecently I've felt worthless and hopeless, ive resorted to cutting to try to keep my feelings in check, which works somehow.
Suicide has been on my mind a lot recently as an easy way out of the pain, but im too much of a pussy to commit.
Lately, however, the suicide has changed from an OD to more of a call to the void, ill be walking down the street and have an urge to just jump under a car, to just end it. 
Or even better, a train, theres a high speed delivery train nearby that's quite easy to get to, and is on my mind quite a bit, would the death there be instantaneous or near instantaneous?
