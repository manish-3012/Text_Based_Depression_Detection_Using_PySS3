Failing at lifeI say that the main of the reason I don't kill myself is because of my kids. But then I spent all afternoon on the couch, too depressed  and flat out no-energy to do anything. My kid was begging with me to play a game with her and. I couldn't even get off the couch. I am pathetic. They deserve so much better than me.
