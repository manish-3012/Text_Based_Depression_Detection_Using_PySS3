AloneFirst allow me to apologize this will be very much all over the place. 

This quarantine is getting the best of me. Its not helping that i became single at the start of this. I feel alone, dumb, unwanted, tired, anxious, .. a lot of things. I'm having a hard time thinking straight. Trying to keep myself distracted watching movies, playing video games but it all seems so uninteresting. I live alone with my beagle. I've always been in and out of relationships so being alone is not easy and all i want is to have someone to spend time with. I dropped out of college because i can't seem to focus on what i need to do and was doing poor in all my classes, pretty sure i have adhd but have not been diagnosed because i can't find a good doctor who can diagnose and help and trust me i have looked high and low for months which is very frustrating for me when all i want is to get my life together. I feel like a complete failure and it causing me to have suicidal thoughts. I keep telling myself "no I'd never do that" and i really do believe this but i can't stop having these thoughts. I've struck out with every girl I've talked to lately which isn't helping idk wat I'm doing wrong. I'm not hideous and pretty funny. I really hate myself and don't want to feel this way. I think I'm just rambling now. Thanks for listening.
