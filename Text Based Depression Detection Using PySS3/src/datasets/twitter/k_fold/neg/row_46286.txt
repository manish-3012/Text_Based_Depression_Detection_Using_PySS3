Iâ€™ve got a date scheduledI think this is it for me

Iâ€™ve got BPD and going through a depressive episode and I think I may have pushed my favourite person out of my life or I am about to because even though heâ€™s caring and kind like nobody else, I just canâ€™t subject him to any more of my bullshit. Iâ€™ve written two letters to him saying Iâ€™m in love with him or I feel deeply and strongly about him or whatever this enigmatic fucked up pure feeling is (weâ€™ve never said it to each other and I was very careful with wording) and I know this is not what he wanted. He wanted something casual. Heâ€™s from another continent, spent two months for work in my city, wanting just flings but because of me he stayed  monogamous (his own words) for the entire time we were together, and while we were together face to face my BPD didnâ€™t even flinch. Now itâ€™s all gone to shit. 

Heâ€™s way too grown up, he values me but he has no desire to commit which Iâ€™m even okay with, and heâ€™s rationalized me out of so many breakdowns which is why putting him through more just feel unfair and I canâ€™t cope on my own. Iâ€™m already numb and too tired to care, but after the letters that Iâ€™m going to send heâ€™ll have no desire to talk to me either. They are too honest and too raw and  too much what he never wanted, Iâ€™m sure, too whatever, it doesnâ€™t even matter.

Anyways, I think thatâ€™s it for me boys and girls. Itâ€™s been a fun ride. Iâ€™m just dead tired of cycling through the same whirlwind of emotions with different people, and coming back to being alone is fucking miserable. Iâ€™m so tired of this. Iâ€™ll miss my cat the most. I already have a date scheduled. Hope you have a  better life with your disorders and beat their ass and have a happy fulfilling life. I love you. Stay alive.
