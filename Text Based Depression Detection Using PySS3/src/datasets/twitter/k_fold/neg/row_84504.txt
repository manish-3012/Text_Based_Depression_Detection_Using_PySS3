ByeI go to a prestigious college in the northeast, which is kind of ironic since we're known for rampant student suicides.

I even knew about it before coming here but didn't care because I drank the kool-aid about going to an Ivy and how I'd be 'set for life' if only I just went.

Well yeah, it's just marketing and bullshit. I'm still miserable here, I'm 3000 miles away from home, and no one here gives two shits about me. 

I still get rejected from internship positions *regularly*, despite having a 3.7 in Math and CS, and having tons of shit on my resume. All the work I did in HS, all the work I do now, was and is for fucking *nothing*. 

All while other people with a lot less programming experience and credentials than me get spots at Apple and Facebook.

I spend hours on classwork, homework, studying etc. - way more than is healthy. I barely sleep. And yet still, I can only barely pull off average or slightly above-average grades, because everything is fucking curved.

I have social anxiety and can't talk to girls. I'm also pretty short and not very good looking, so girls won't really talk to me either. 

So, basically, I'm not good at anything, and I will never be happy or successful in any aspect of life, so why fucking bother. Even alcohol doesn't really make me feel better anymore, no matter how much I drink.

I know almost no one will care enough to read until this point, but if you are, I'd like to say bye. Don't really have many regrets, other than not ending this misery sooner. I hope you get more out of life than I did.
