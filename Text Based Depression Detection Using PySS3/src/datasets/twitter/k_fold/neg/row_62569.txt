It's been the same for the past few weeks.For the past 4 or 5 weeks I have been going to work and barely paying attention to anything what people ask me todo. I've basically been on auto pilot. Then when I get home after work and on my days off I basically just lay in bed and drink. No motivation to talk to people and do stuff. When I do have people that want to do stuff it usually falls through because they always ditch me and leave me hanging. I don't know I feel so useless and unwanted. Family has noticed and they are basically like wow your living a sad life. You needed to go to the gym and meet friends. I've tried that for the past few years trying to meet new people and hang out and trying to go to the gym. I just don't have the mental power to do anything anymore. Everyone I meet just leaves. Like I don't talk about anything depressing. Some people I have really connected with and the seem like they want to do stuff, but next thing I know they just ghost me. I honestly want to die all the time. I always think about it sober, high on weed, drunk it never leaves. The thought of being alone and no one there for me just makes me want to die. 
I've talked to friends and random people in the past about what goes through my head and they always seem to leave.
I'm really thinking about just killing myself soon. Just disappearing. No one will probably notice. There is one friend who helped me alot a few years ago when I feeling really shitty and wanted to kill myself then. Idk if I should just be honest with them and tell them that I'm going to just kill myself and I appreciate what they did or if I should just be a total asshole and get them to hate me so its less of a burden on them.
I don't know anymore I told myself I was going to wait to see how things turn out by 25, but recently it's just like I should do it now before things get even worse.
