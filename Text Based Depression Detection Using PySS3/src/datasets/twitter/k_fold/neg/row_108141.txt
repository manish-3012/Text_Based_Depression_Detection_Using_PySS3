I hope it's okay to post this in here.I'm 26 yrs old, for the last about 5 years now I planned in killing myself when I turned 27, over the last few years I've gotten engaged to a women I love very much and I wanna live the rest if my life with her. I struggle with really bad panic and anxiety attacks and soni stoped working this last april... lately I cant get these suicide thoughts out if my head... today I grabbed a razor and just felt it in my neck for a bit. Incant stop picturing it. I keep just picturing me killing myself and I dont know what I'm supposed to do... like i dont want to but i cant stop thinking about it and lately it's getting out of control.. i never planned for after turning 27. I'm terrified, what if I dint make it to my own wedding... what am I going to do though. I'm such a mess. I just feel like a waste of space. She takes such good care of me, but I'm so mental, idk what to do with myself.... I really do hope it's okay for me to post this here...
