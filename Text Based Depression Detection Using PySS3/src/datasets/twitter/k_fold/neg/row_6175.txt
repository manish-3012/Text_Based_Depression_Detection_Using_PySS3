Recent injury giving me a bigger reasonTore my ankle ligaments so I'm in crutches for months now(3rd time it's happened) I do nothing all day, have no money coming in to help my family out. I failed in college and have dropped out, an losing my job. Why even live? No Damn purpose anymore. I literally wake up everyday thinking if I'm going to commit suicide today.
