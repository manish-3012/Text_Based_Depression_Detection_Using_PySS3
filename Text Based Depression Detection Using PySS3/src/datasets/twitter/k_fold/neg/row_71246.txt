Dreading every deadlineI stay up late every sunday because I can't bear the thought of the weekend ending. Every minute at campus I long to return home. I am just drifting from place to place, and have to lie every time I'm asked about my ambitions and future because I really don't see anything. I feel like I am begging for attention whenever I bring it up, and yet I always want to talk about it. What's the fucking point.
