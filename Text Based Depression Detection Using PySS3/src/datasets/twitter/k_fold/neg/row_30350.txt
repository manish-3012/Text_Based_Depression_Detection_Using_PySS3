I need help but my mom doesn't think I need helpSo I'm a teenager and I suffer from some pretty bad depression. I started cutting myself about 6 months ago but stopped like 2 months ago. Then one month ago things got bad again and I started cutting again. I even one night tried to take my life by overdosing on ibuprofen. It obviously didnt work and I didn't suffer any bad side effects from all the ibuprofen. Things haven't really gotten any better for me and I'm still pretty suicidal. I don't want to be like this and I think I need to go to like a psych ward or something. About 2 weeks ago my mom found out I was cutting. She took away the knives she knew I had but I have one knife that she doesnt know about so the cutting never stopped. And I was going to tell her about the suicide attempt so we could get me some help but I didn't because of how she reacted when she found out I had been cutting. She was pretty upset but she didnt take me in to a doctor or therapist or have me put on any new medications. She just wouldnt let me be alone in my room with the door closed during the day. She said that would last until "this whole thing just goes away". I don't think she gets that it's not going to just go away on its own. She is always very stubborn and never likes to take me in to receive medical treatment for anything so I just dont know what to do. I need some advice for how I can get some help Because she won't get any for me.
