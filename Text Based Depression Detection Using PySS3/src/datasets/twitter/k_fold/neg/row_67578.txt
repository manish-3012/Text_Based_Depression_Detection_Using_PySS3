Advice neededAsking for a friend who's in school:
1.People in the classroom would talk shit about her and they think that she cant hear but in fact they are "whispering" really loudly.
2. The same group of people would openly express their hostility towards her by showing disgust at her presence and on some occassions make their dislike very obvious (when there are grpwork they would check to see if they were on the same team with my friend and if theyre not they would literally high five each other)
3. Whenever my friend tries to talk to them they would straight up treat her existence like air.
All of this rlly affects her as she have nvr been so openly hated before and worse of all she doesnt have any friends in school (im only friends with her outside school), and everyone seems to be spectators watching the show refusing to help just bc the grp of people who bullies her are considered "popular" and not to be messed with.
She became rlly fearful of gng to school, told her parents and me abt the situation but there was nth we could rlly do, as she is afraid of confronting them too, bc there is a risk of further elevating the situation. Now she cant concentrate on even her studies(she was a straight A student) as this constantly plagues her mind.

Im rlly concerned about her but not sure of what advice i shld offer as all advice so far seems futile.
