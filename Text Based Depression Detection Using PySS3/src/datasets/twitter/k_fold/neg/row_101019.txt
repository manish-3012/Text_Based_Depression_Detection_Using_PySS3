I did all the thingsI stopped using drugs, I went back to school. I graduated. I came out to myself and publically. I got a new job, a nice new apartment. 

And I am desperately alone. I have no friends. I spend my days in isolation, until I go to work, and then right back. 

I tried to kill myself in April but I didn't take enough. I'm ready to try again.
