Parent thinks threatening me will snap me out of depressionParent just threatened me if I didn't stop being depressed saying they'd get a cop and forcefully throw me in a public hospital for "acting up." This started because one of my siblings told my parent that they favour me and aren't strict enough.  So I was yelled at that if I didn't get out of it I'd be thrown in a mental home and stigmatised for my illness. They think threatening and scaring me will make me stop being depressed. Don't even think they see it as an illness just "me doing this to myself". Just do something you enjoy you'll be happy or get a life you'll be happy or there are people dying you are being ungrateful or it's just life I get sad too or you need to toughen up or life goes one without you or you aren't trying enough or other people have healed why not you? I'm just  tired of people around me not understanding and being inconsiderate I've tried telling them it's like any other disease but they just seeing at something I'm actively doing to myself.  
Dlubt they care they just look at me in disappointment.  I don't even know why I bother being alive.
