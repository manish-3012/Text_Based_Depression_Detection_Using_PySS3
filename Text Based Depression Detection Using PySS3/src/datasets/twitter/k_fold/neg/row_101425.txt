I can't handle these ups and downs. I don't see a future for myself.20 y/o female. College, work, long-term girlfriend, living with my parents. 

It's like I can't just feel neutral anymore. It's either on top of the world or useless scum of the earth. I'm either bubbly and full of joy and I can't wait to tell people how happy I am, or I'm sulking in the basement on the computer like I am now, or crying in class because I can't stand myself.

I get really paranoid. If my girlfriend ignores me, my heart hurts and I start wondering if she's fallen out of love with me. If my mom says something that was mildly passive aggressive, it just destroys me for awhile. I've been called stupid and useless and worthless and I just can't stop the feeling that those things are 100% true. I mean day after day I just give people more and more examples as to why I'm fucking useless to have around. 

Most of all I just don't want to feel like this anymore. I know those close to me will be hurt, and I know maybe there is some small use for me somewhere in this world, but it doesn't stop me from feeling the way I'm feeling. I hate the way I am. I hate the way I look, I hate my personality, I hate my voice, my humor, my quirks, I hate it all and I place no value on it whatsoever. And anytime people try to tell me the opposite I get aggravated. I just feel pissed off every time someone tries to reassure me that they love me and I'm important and all of that stuff. 

Nothing feels real to me anymore, everything feels like a dream. Nothing interests me anymore, I feel so fucking stuck and so fucking useless and I just want to go away.
