i want to diei hate school all the classes and homework and i canâ€™t tell my family because they would probably say something along the lines of oh suicide is selfish but i want this endless struggle that we call life to end i have been suicidal most of my life and i thought i was getting better but nope after my last class today i had somewhat of an existential crisis and i seriously debated wether or not to kill myself my friends think iâ€™m happy but iâ€™m truly not but if life is an endless stride towards death that is unavoidable why not make my death quick and easy 

but if you took the time to read this then thank you
