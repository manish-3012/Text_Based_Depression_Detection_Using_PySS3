Bye, finallyUnfortunately I no longer have faith in getting better or reconnecting with humanity. Mental health steady declining 4+ years now. Naturally, capability &amp; social life declined too.

I'm uninteresting, bitter, and jaded now, which is of course a great way to make friends.. so many despicable traits which seem impossible to reverse anymore.

Everyone else has purpose, belonging, social life. I just want to spare a small group temporary sadness. I have not shit to offer.

And I most closely relate with the most miserable people I see (mostly on internet forums since I have no life anymore). There's no place for ppl who stay this broken.. Fuck this crap.
