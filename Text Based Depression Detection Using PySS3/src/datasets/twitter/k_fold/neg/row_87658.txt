Any day nowIm a 21 F whos been secretly horribly depressed for a while now. I have people who say they care about me but when i really need them most they seem to vanish or not care as much as they claim to. Ive been crying myself to sleep every night for the last few weeks. No matter who i talk to or who i surround myself with i just have this terrible sense of impending loneliness that takes over when night comes. I havent been suicidal since my junior year of high school but im very much on the edge again and im so close to teetering over ....
