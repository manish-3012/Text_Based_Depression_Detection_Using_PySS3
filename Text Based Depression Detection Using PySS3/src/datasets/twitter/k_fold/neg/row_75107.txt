I've given up on life, yet I'm still alive.I constantly think about killing myself. I've done endless amounts of research, trying to figure out the methods that are least likely to fail. I've planned my suicide again and again, setting dates and writing notes, yet I've never gone through with it. Maybe I'm lazy, maybe I'm unmotivated, but mostly I think I am afraid of failure. I don't really know where I'm going with this.

Anyway, I feel like I'm constantly waiting. Waiting to magically get better, or waiting for the perfect opportunity to kill myself. It's like I'm stuck in this in-between place where I'm not able to get better, but at the same time I'm not able to end my suffering. Mentally, I have completely given up on living, I don't even attempt to live my life anymore. Physically, I'm still here. I don't know why I'm here, I certainly don't want to be here, but here I am.
