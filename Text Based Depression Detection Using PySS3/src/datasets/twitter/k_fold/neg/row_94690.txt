I did something bad and I can't deal with it.So last night on Aug 22, 2016 I went to go see a girl I was interested in. She had told me that she was high and that she didn't want to do anything more than make out. By now you can see where this is going, but me and her had originally planned on only cuddling and kissing. Once we laid down we kissed a bit and cuddled but I started to get more into the mood while she wasn't. I had no intention of it going further but in the moment I started moving my hand places. She told me to move them and I would but after a while I would go again. So after a while we are kissing and she moves her shirt down so that we can continue. At that point I feel like she's consenting. So after we do it I think she consented and everything was fine. She messaged me today and she said that she is pissed and that she may file charges against me.

It's my first semester at the college and I don't want to go to jail. I feel so bad I've been in my room all day crying panicking and cutting myself. I feel like it's better if I kill myself because if I go to jail because of this my parents will disown me and my family will shun me. I did something horrible and I know I did and I have never wanted to do anything like that to hurt anyone. I'm a nice guy I just made a huge mistake and I can't go to jail cause it will ruin my entire life and it'll just be easier to end it all!
