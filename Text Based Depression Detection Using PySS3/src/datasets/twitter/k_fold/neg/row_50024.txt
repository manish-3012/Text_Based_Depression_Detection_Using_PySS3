Tired of everythingI've been dealing with an abusive family for years. When I only thought that it was just my father I had to worry about, my mother, who was the one parent I thought who would be there for me suddenly turned on me too.
I've been outcasted, bullied to the point where I attempted suicide, abused by most relationships I've been (mentally and emotionally), and then abuse with my family (mentally, emotionally, and physically - physical ceased after turning 18).
Between everything, I ended up feeling worthless. I am never enough for anyone. That my friends and my boyfriend are just putting up with me because they pity me.
These feelings have amplified after my mother started dumping her true(?) feelings about me. The worse thing was when she brought up how I was a mistake (unplanned pregnancy) and how she wished that she got the abortion and that my father was right about me. 
I ended up being so depressed that I stopped eating for 2 weeks straight. I stopped going to work as well.
I can't bring myself to tell my boyfriend that I've gone back into depression and at this point, I feel like it would be better if I was dead.
