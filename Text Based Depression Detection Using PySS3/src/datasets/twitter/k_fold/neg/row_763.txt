I'm so tiredI feel no differently today. Thinking changed nothing. Talking changed nothing. Sleeping changed nothing. I wish I could go back to sleep. I don't want to be awake. I don't want to think anymore. Maybe giving myself a chance is a bad idea. I don't know if I can pretend much longer. I'll go numb for a bit. I'll act fine. I'll seem okay, but then it'll crash down again. I don't think it's fixable. I'm not part of this life. I don't belong in this world.
