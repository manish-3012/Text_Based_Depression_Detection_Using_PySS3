donâ€™t know what to dosometimes iâ€™m surprised at the turn on events in life. it feels like a never ending cycle of emotions too quick fleeting to ever settle in. i guess i wasnâ€™t cut out for this but. i am way too weak and sensitive to handle anything. iâ€™ve been reduced to a joke of a human being who hates myself more than anyone else could ever hate me. i am a pathetic excuse of life. i donâ€™t care. i will be the first to admit it. i hate myself so much. iâ€™m tired of being this way. iâ€™m tired of people doing nothing but playing me. nobody truly cares. i will care about everyone so much more than anyone will ever care about me. i still try to be the best person i can but when itâ€™s not reciprocated i get angry at myself. because iâ€™m not worthy of anything. i am a lost cause and know i will never find peace. i know it sounds like i am not even trying but nobody will ever know how hard i try and have tried for so long. i will never get how people do this. how do people wake up everyday and do the same thing over and over and over again. life never truly gives a break. you can get a physical break but mentally it never comes. there will never be a time i will be satisfied with myself internally or externally. i donâ€™t blame anyone for not wanting to be around me. i get it. i am disgusting and so alone. i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™m not trying to be dramatic i know iâ€™ve done this a million times and is easy to just write me off as some idiot who says these things without a brain. i may be dumb but i am completely in touch with myself and know where my morals stand. however i donâ€™t know where my life is going and at this point it will not go anywhere. i am so lonely and afraid and do not know how to go on.
