Please help me, I dont know what to doLets start off with the basics. I am 14 going on 15 and weigh 215 pounds and im only 5 foot 4 as a boy. I get constantly bullied in school and made fun of for my weight to the point where it just unmotivates me to do my work and i get so stressed that i dont even do it and now my grades are suffering. Teachers and parents arent doing anything about it. Not being happy about my self my family situation is where it really hurts me. My parents have been divorced for years and they really dont care about me. I have no aunts/uncles to talk to. Im pretty sure my sisters hate me. My brother lost contact with us and its almost been 3 years. My other sister fled the country. My dad is moving to fucking dubai and my mother doesnt want me having contact with him even though i do want it. Theyre going through some court bullshit about him not paying the child support and thats all i hear about. Everyone is concerned about themself but not me. Ive contemplated just dying several times and it just keeps getting worse and worse and i dont know what to do. My mom has no clue that ive been depressed for years and dont know what to say. When ever i try to bring it up she gets mad and starts yelling and doesnt try to support me and thinks im fucking retarded. I dont know what to do. Please help me
