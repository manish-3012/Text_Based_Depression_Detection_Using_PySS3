In crisisI do not want to be alive anymore. I want to give my son (7 months) up for adoption and just be done here.

I have novody to talk to and I can't do this shit on my own. I'd call a crisis line but last time I did that cops showed up and I went to the hospital.

Is 7 months old too old to give up for adoption, I don't want him to grow up thinking I didn't love him. I do t want to keep him because I am a shit mom a d don't want him to grow up to be like me
