wanting to die but not having the ability to kill urselfcan anyone else relate? 

i literally have wanted to die for as long as I can remember. i do not really enjoy life and I feel as if I am only attempting to enjoy it for those around me but I am genuinely exhausted at this point. i do not want to keep going, however after several attempts I am finding that I am unable to go through with anything myself. does anyone else ever feel this way idk what to do I literally just want to be hit by a truck or something on my way home from work but it never works out that way
