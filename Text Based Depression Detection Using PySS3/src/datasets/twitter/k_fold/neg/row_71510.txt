Solitary ChristmasToday is my first Christmas truly alone. I grew up bouncing from family member to foster home that I never really found any significant value to the holiday. Despite this I find myself deeply saddened by the reality that I'm a college freshman living in dorms over break alone. I had a close friends parents invite me to spend Christmas with them but I denied it due to how awkward I would have felt not understanding the bonds of his family's connections. The last foster home I was in got new foster kids so I had nowhere else to go for Christmas and without other family I'm just stuck. I don't really know what value there is in a life of loneliness and contemplation anymore. I've tried to bury my sadness in drugs and alcohol only to find the same thoughts become magnified. I don't know what to do with my life given I can't find happiness playing video games or maintaining my 3.5 GPA, I feel like everything is pointless without people to care about my successes. I know I'm too scared to attempt a more painful form of suicide such as hanging or slitting my arms but I feel if I ever gained access to enough medications or a gun I might kill myself. I wish I could talk to a professional but my membership within my college's Army Officer program would be revoked if the suicidal thoughts were to come up. Please don't give me advice about finding a relationship as I don't think my sociopathic nihilistic ideals would hold such a thing and they have caused many failures already. I'm stuck in a hole and I don't want to completely lose motivation.
