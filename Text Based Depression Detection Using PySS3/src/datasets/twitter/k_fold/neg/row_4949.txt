my life is a mess.so, i'm a minor, over 13 and under 17. for a young lad i deal with too much shit, like trauma, and i'm pretty sure i have symptoms of borderline personality disorder. which affects my relationships terribly.
the only thing keeping me alive is my best friend, except that he's dealing with his own shit too so we've been distant. i have lack of emotional permanence, which means that..basically, if someone isn't currently like "hey, i care about you." i don't believe that they do.
i don't wanna get started on my trauma and emotional/verbal/physical abuse from my parents. but that's a big part of it and it's affecting my life and personality.
i've been suicidal for..months now, i had a failed suicide attempt back in may and i regret getting help.
i just really don't know what to do anymore, i'm on prozac but that's pretty much all the "help" i'm getting. every night i try to kill myself and i'm genuinely tired of it and i have no idea what to do.
