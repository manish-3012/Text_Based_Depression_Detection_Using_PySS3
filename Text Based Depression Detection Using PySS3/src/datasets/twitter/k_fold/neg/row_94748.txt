Covid-19 brought me to the edge of suicideHello. Im 16 years old and currently living in Germany.

I struggle with depression since i was 10 years old but the last few years it was okay.

But since corona became a widespread disease everything in my life went horribly wrong. My parents are very close from getting divorced. I lost the contact to my best friends. And the school stuff is way to much stress for me right now. 

I just cant handle this ammount of stress anymore. I just dont enjoy my life anymore. everyday i wake up. i hear them arguing. i look at my phone, no of my friends texted to me. i barely eat and drink anything. all i do is just laying in bed, crying and thinking. I try to distract me with my phone from my feelings. but that only makes me even more depressed. I sometimes see the storys of my best friends how they are outside together. and that without me. I just want everything to be okay. 

I also was in therapy from 2016 to the end of 2019. I thinked its over with my problems but now im too scared to tell my parents about my problems and that i want the therapy to continue. Im too scared that i will make their situation even worse.

I dont know if i should say thats a positive thing but im just too scared to kill myself, because i had an failed suicide attemp back in 2016.
