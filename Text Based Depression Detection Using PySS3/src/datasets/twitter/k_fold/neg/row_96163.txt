Help, I think I wanna dieHelp, something wrong
I am afraid of the future, thinking about living on my own is frightening. I am a 27 year old living in Egypt. I am pretty under my parents thumb, but i have my own voice. 
I am supposed to be mature, but i am careless. I don't pay attention at work, i am doing other stuff when I am supposed to work. I don't do household chores. 

I have Maladaptive daydreaming disorder, which makes me dream. I run about, make faces and behave like a mad person.

I want to get married, have kids, but i am a afraid. Soe guy contacted me, and I had this uncomfortable feeling. I cried a little. and now I wonder if something is wrong or I am just escaping. I do that, revert to escapism when things are tough.

I am obsessed with writing fanfiction, desperate even, and i need to do it before entering life. 
I can't go to a doctor caue my parents refuse to let me. I don't know what to do. sometimes i think I wish i could die or commit suicide. I am so afraid of life, for me, it is filled wiht pain, hopelessness and suffering.

I am sure i will be homless, on drugs, abused or do aomething to myself. I don't want to live. during 2015, i dreamt of dying every day. but its different now.

I just wish someone can help me, pls. i don't have friends, and can't trust my parents. thanks.
