Iâ€™m tired.Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™m done. I get up, spend seven hours in school where I hate both everyone around me and myself, come home, and sleep. Maybe half the time Iâ€™ll wake up to get food, and then I go back to sleep. Life just isnâ€™t worth the energy I used to put into it; not when I get fucked over anyways.
