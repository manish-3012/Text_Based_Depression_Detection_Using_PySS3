By the time you read this, I'll be gone.My girlfriend hates me, she says I stress her out too much. My family hates me. I have no friends. Nothing is holding me back anymore and if I did have to choose something, sadly, it'd be a game that I play daily and the next game in the series. Sad, I know. My life has turned into shit over the last year or two. Video games and school are the only things I do, really.. But I don't really do school because I have no motivation. Anyways, now that I'm drawing this to an end, I thought it'd be nice to leave you guys with a song that actually fits my life perfectly.
