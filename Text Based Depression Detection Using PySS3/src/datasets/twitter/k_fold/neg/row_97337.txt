Rejected my soulmate cause I'm too fucked upWe dated for 4 months before.  I'm too fucked up to be in a relationship.  I can't even function normally anymore now.  I stopped eating, showering,  brushing my teeth, changing and washing my clothes,  etc... My time is near and I have to isolate and not get close so they can't miss me too much. I wish I could have had something good with him. But I'm so insecure and depressed that  he would most likely not wanna deal with the shit baggage I bringand how much of a sucidal emotional wreck I am. He thinks I'm more normal cause I put on an act in front of him but can't I hide it forever. He has no clue. Hope he finds someone who actually wants to live and has a personality besides depression/anxiety like me.
