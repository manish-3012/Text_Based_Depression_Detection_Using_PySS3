i'm tiredive thought about  dying and killing myself ever since i can remember anything at all. i want this to be an honest expression about my life without devolving to my idiotic and shameful victim mentality that is ingrained in all that i do. my username is about me. i am what has made me. ive taken a bunch of uppers so i can be as concise as i can and is apparently the only way i can even sort through what i feel the need to say in a calm and hopefully it all makes sense. i'm sorry for anyone reading this i'm already embarrassed and ashamed for it don't worry ive been trying to write this for days and days now. i urge you to stop reading for your own sanity and wellbeing. i don't want any sympathy, or pity. i originally was going to post this in one of the narcissism personality disorder subs or on suicidal thoughts but i dont want to be misinterpreted anymore or receive more humiliation or have anyone else feel worse by my words or instigate the possibility that i think i don't deserve it though by allowing myself to be mocked i am still causing suffering and it needs to stop.  i do not think my circumstances are unique or special but i do know  i will pay for this just like any other time in my life that i tried to express myself openly to the best of my ability without making everything a joke, although ironic i know now that all i was ever supposed to be is a joke that isn't actually funny. the game has been rigged from the start due to my own insufferable existence and choices i didn't even realize i was making. i'm at the end now.

how can i  be so inexplicably empty and full of lies and facades and guilt for what i am all at once? my brain is either racing full of intrusive thoughts or images or i'm nothing with complete mental fog. i don't understand how i can over-analyze everything, have extreme paranoia that i'm being monitored and watched and prodded and worry. i miss all the important details before it's too late.

i fit the roles expected of me that's all i can do anymore. i used to be able to tell myself it was for others, that no matter how bad of a person i am at least i was doing something under the pretense of helping somehow. i know now it's just selfishness.  i might have always known but never fully accepted it. i don't know. i don't know who i am or where the me begins from the survival mechanisms i either purposefully developed or have developed on their own.  ive lived under delusions my whole life. deep down more and more i've always been a parasitic coward and  even at a young age i pushed away people that cared for me. i didn't understand at the time what it meant or why i felt i  had to. i know now though. i knew there was something wrong with me at my core. i didn't want anyone to suffer 2nd hand trauma or whatever else due to how insidiously fucked up i was. around the only good people in my life then i could feel their disappointment, grief and also that they triggered past abuse memories and disortions all sitting there staring at me in the face and my own guilt for not being more brave during a certain time that most likely destroyed my friend. before the first time i tried to kill myself i did reach out. i did try to make them understand what was wrong,  and what was happening to me. it solved nothing but bringing me more pain, more guilt, more humiliation than i can describe.

my mother was an abusive alcoholic that mostly only knew how to scream at me, beat me shame me for every possible normal thing a human being is supposed to do  while ignoring me, leaving me alone for long periods of time.  chainsmoking and crying. my father killed himself. my whole rest of my family either ignored me or enabled my mother in every way possible. my sibling was just as abusive they were happy torturing me (molestation and rape was a daily occurnce for many years) physically, psychologically in any and all ways i can remember. he was forgiven for anything i was capable of telling about at various times because he was suffering the loss of my father, nothing about me mattered and was shown this.  they a long with my mother ganged up on me just to deny it all, he even had his friends to help abuse me (and no i'm not talking about namecalling insults or bullying even though of course there was plenty of that) . my mothers boyfriends mostly just ignored me all together usually unable to even spare a glance in my direction. despite this all i still loved them, i lied for them, i covered for them to my own detriment ( but now instead of seeing it as some altruistic sacrifice it was only out of fear). i didn't want them to suffer even though it should have been fairly obvious to anyone that was remotely in my life at all i think there were plenty of signs.  i was told repeatedly that if  i told anyone anything they, my mother would be put in jail that i would be sent to an orphanage and that i'd really know what it was like to experience true pain. my mother constantly told me horror stories of children that were made to live in these kinds of places. my sibling threatened worse abuse and enacted it when i fell out of line to what they wanted. the other people in my life were supremely religious and preached to me about how people are meant to suffer, forgiveness, to be grateful for what i have and so on. i didn't feel right exposing these things to them, i do not blame them in anyway whatsoever. the other people i cared for i did everything i could to seem ok and normal since i wanted more than anything to be accepted and loved by them, they were also affiliated with my family and for this reason i didn't feel safe here either.again i do not blame them only on myself for being a coward. so i learned how to pretend better. school was a different kind of punishment for me as i've always been stupid but i somehow mananged even there, for a while. the bruises, black eyes, speech problems,over sensitivity, emotional dysregulation, burns, scratches, crying about everything and anything whatever was easily diminished by my smiling idiotic face and friendly although irritating demeanor all came down to me just playing rough in their eyes i think. most of my peers wanted nothing to do with me and since i lack self awareness to a harsh degree i didn't and couldn't figure out why or how, it was like they knew there was something wrong with me.  i was laughed at, and mocked often but i guess not on a consistent enough rate to feel anything other than insecure really. it was there i guess i learned it was best to make a mockery out of myself before anyone could do it on their own. even when people arent laughing at me all i hear is laughter anyway so it for some reason made it easier to cope.  a bit later i devolved into not being able to do that so my brain decided developing one mental illness after another during this time and many suicide attempts.

i dont know or ever knew any of my motivations for doing anything. when i try really hard to think of what parts of me were good or anything decent about myself it must have come from a manicness of youth and delusions. at 16 i started not completely hiding who i was, what i felt, what i experienced and tried so  hard to escape from. i had friends, i cared about everything but everything seemed to just make me more traumatized and damaged the more immersed into whatever i could. i then dropped out of school completely, tried to kill myself a few more times, saved by friends. after spending the majority of this time in and out of hospitals, therapy and getting high every day i miraculously met someone that thought i had all the time in the world,tomorrow stopped seeming important.  that i'd just get better. that age didn't matter. i made damn sure they knew what i was and who i was but it didnt matter to them or even me, i felt love so i went back to the delusions to do everything i could to keep it, for me and for them. i thought i was getting better. i moved out, i worked multiple jobs. i supported myself my friends and even my partner. i gave everything i could until it wasnt enough. until i wasn't enough. i will not speak anymore ill of them as they didn't know any better either. i do not blame them. they are an amazing person and i always knew they were. even when i was being cheated on, i understood why.  i broke it off because i didnt deserve them. they pursued anyway. i wanted to be able to deserve them so i kept trying. i told them to leave me, so many times. to be with the person who they really wanted to be with who also really wanted them too. but they never fully did. later on we moved in together with our friends and by this point i was starting to break down and devolve. everyone got on each others nerves and there was constant arguing between everyone. nobody wanted to do their share, everything bothered me, having friends and people around me at all hours of the day and night drinking, the constant bombardment of smells, noises, new people and on and on started triggering me. my partner and i were arguing all the time as well. all my own friends had their own lives, were starting/going away to college, were partying themselves and or in serious relationships and working. i couldn't and cant drive (due to never pushing being taught then the few times i did try to  learn all i could do is shake from nerves and flinch realizing it was unsafe for me to drive anyway) and since all the money i  made while working went to living expenses it wasnt like i could even afford to save up for a car ( this is what i told myself for years, but i know now i should have tried much much harder to be independent) then wouldnt be able to afford i selfishly relied on my partner, as well as walked everywhere, took the bus to my shit dead end job. if my life isnt cliche, pathetic and shameful enough as it is i got pregnant at this time but didnt even realize it or know i was until i was almost 6 months. i thought i had stomach ulcers or something like that. i was so sick all of the time i could barely function. i had to quit my job or i most likely would have been fired since i was pretty much incapable of doing what was needed of me. i couldnt do what was needed of me as a roomate or a partner or a friend either. i didn't have insurance and couldn't afford going to a doctor and it was pretty much as if? if i was dying, so  be it. i didn't even consider the possibility of pregnancy until i started gaining weight in only the obvious place. my immediate thought was of course to get an abortion despite it being against everything i felt i blieved in. except..... it was way too late for that. adoption i considered and weighed it with my partner for it to come down with a very adamant and definite No, not allowed. i loved and wanted what my partner and his family wanted (and would want) even though i knew and always knew i never wanted to, or thought i was remotely capable of being a mother. it apparently didn't matter what i wanted anymore and honestly it never did. i didn't even know what the hell i wanted to begin with so again i can not blame anyone for the decisions i made (one of the many instances i was under the impression i was choosing altruism but instead it was just more fear and learned helplessness) and made alone. the pregnancy, the medical care and then the birth was traumatic, i was very ill and mentally sick, i was repulsed by myself more than i evevr had been in my whole life and going over in my head what i would be like as a parent. i felt ( and still do) guilt for what i knew i would already fail at.   not long after finding out i was pregnant and getting medical treatment i found out the gender and at the same time found out i was having twins. i'm glad i went through with it as fucked up as i am and always was they were and continue to be perfect in every way. they bring joy to everyone they meet, my partner, his parents and family who are some of the best people i ever met and have helped shape  them to be who they are. i am there and do everything for them to the best of my ability even though i know it can't and never will be enough.i thought i could live for them. i thought i could fake it for them, for my partner and my friends and lasted many years until the last few where i've completely lost control of maintaing any  dignity or sense of self i had left to keep going. i didn't know that adults that experienced abuse would be re-victimized by their own growing children. how every day of my life is a hell full of fear panic and pain  i can't escape how i desperately want to. how the most beautiful thing i ever done or will do in this life is tainted by me. how i literally have lost myself to others dreams and my own nightmares.

i pushed away everyone i was close to in some way or another due to paranoia over so many things, fear, not living up to the expectations expected of and demanded of me, and feeling like a burden and mistake to anyone i let into my life. at some point i began to actively self sabotage with what i now understand is narcissism, more learned helplessness and cowardice. i never physically cheated on my partner as i can't enjoy physical intimacy in any way as i just dissociate or berate myself mentally. i talked to people and took pictures of myself i don't know why i acted out in this way and the self hatred i feel is immeasurable i started burning myself ive tried thinking of all kinds of different reasons as to why but none of the reasons actually make sense because im brain damaged and i  don't have a soul. after i was confronted harshly by someone i hurt with my lies and in order to confront myself i told my partner what i did, because the amount of guilt i felt and created doing this only made everything  and my mental health worse as it ever had been and that would be obvious to any self respecting reasonable person, some part of me had hoped he would  abandon me so i could do what must be done. i stopped doing this and instead replaced it with a different way to fuck up by getting to know others, to befriend others under the deluded, selfish, narcissistic, co-dependent  belief to understand myself and for others to understand me.  i recently got some sense knocked back into me, have had a few episodes of psychosis trying to understand everything i told my partner what i have done again and offered to leave, instead i was taken to a hospital and released. i contacted a few womens and homeless shelters and put myself on waiting lists, but i don't deserve to be there either taking the spot of someone who needs it more than me.everything about me is wrong. my partner showed me mostly understanding and kindness despite everything and its just finally confirmed the only way for him to be free is to remove the parasite that's infected his and everyone ive ever cared abouts life. if i could be more sorry i would and i won't fail this time or anyone anymore.
