I donâ€™t even know who I am anymore. Iâ€™ve been abandoned by everyone who said they would never leave.When I (17, M) was 14, my best friend (13, F) took her own life. This destroyed my sense of innocence and childhood wonder and planted dark thoughts into the back of my mind.  Three years later, around September 2019, I left my parents house after constant fear of my alcoholic, bipolar father and a mother who had isolated me from all my parents friends after I came out as bi to her. I lived off the streets for 2 weeks, and basically used my body as a way to guarantee a place to sleep. I rapidly lost weight, going from 140 lbs to 125 unless than 2 weeks. This was an extremely degrading experience and made me feel more like an object than a human being. Iâ€™ve become more established now, and I stay in a â€œtrap houseâ€ with some pretty great friends, but those dark thoughts planted in my head so long ago have been doing nothing but grow bigger and cloud my mind. Last week I was diagnosed with PTSD and Depression, as well as seeing councillors for psychosis and a physiotherapist for a very severe concussion I had suffered earlier in September. As soon as my mental health wasnâ€™t fine on paper, my parents cut me off from my weekly therapy sessions and physio, basically giving up on me. Iâ€™ve never felt so abandoned, and the reasons I have to live seem to fade more and more every day. Thank you for listening.
