I dont want to die but I want to be deadI donâ€™t think I could kill myself, but sometimes I fantasize about dying suddenly in some accident. The thought of nothing, and my consciousness just getting deleted, just sounds so peaceful to me. Itâ€™s not that I want to die, because I feel like I owe it to my friends and family who believe in me to try my best. If only the knew the extent to which I contemplate death. I always think about how I didnâ€™t choose to be born, and how itâ€™s kinda unfair to be expected to live. I wish I never existed in the first place. I just feel so trapped. I donâ€™t even know if this post deserves any serious attention; the last thing I want is to distract from people who are in actual immediate danger. Because deep down I know Iâ€™m going to wake up tomorrow, and am likely going to keep waking up day-after-day. But every day I do wake up, it gets harder to be the person I need to be. I feel like Iâ€™m fading away, and Iâ€™m just becoming an empty shell of a person. I want to disappear.
