2020 - The year we lost everything... and more.Its interesting when I read on social media how people complain that 2020 sucks because they haven't been able to go watch their favorite movie, swim by the sea or go to their favorite restaurants.

I am from South Africa and COVID-19 plus a run of bad luck ruined my life. I lost my job 6 months ago. Company shut down due to COVID-19. In the same month, found out that my wife is pregnant - we've been married for 2 years. And in the same month, both my parents contracted COVID-19.

Fast forward to today - wife is heavily pregnant, both parents passed away and still no job. Just some odd jobs here and there. There are nights I pretend not to be hungry just so that my wife and my young brother can eat.

I never thought that someone as outwardly strong as I am could wake up earlier that my wife each morning to cry. I have to hide tears from my wife and hope each day I find some small job to do that can help us to eat.

Saturday I got a one-day job offloading trucks for 14 hours. Got paid R500 (about $29). We ate well but this week its back to square one.

To top it all off, I damaged my spine with the heavy lifting &amp; currently I am not able to get out of bed. Our neighbor took me to the doctor and he says I have a slipped spinal disc which will need some sort of surgery in order to re-align. To top it all off, the landlord is tired of the delays in rent payment and has asked us to move out at the end of this month.

I am trying to convince my wife to give the baby away once it is born. I know this might affect our marriage in the long run, but I can't let my child live like this. Savings all gone and now I think I might be physically incapable of taking care of my family. My wife has been asking for help from relatives too but I'm sure they are tired of us now.

We couldn't even afford ultra-sound so we still don't know whether its boy/girl/twins....
