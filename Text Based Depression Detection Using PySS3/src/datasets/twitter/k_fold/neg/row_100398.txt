I canâ€™t live like this anymoreSeveral years ago, I was in a relationship where I was abused almost daily and I hid it from my parents. When I finally got police involved I was able to safely leave. I got a restraining order, but he still went to my school because I live in a very small town so I never went back to finish that semester. I stayed at home and processed my trauma and lived with PTSD. It was probably the darkest time of my life. The next year I worked really hard and luckily got into a boarding school across the country. Leaving home so young was hard, but I felt like I finally found somewhere safe with people who truly cared about me. It is now my final year of highschool and the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us all to go home. I feel like I am being ripped away from a life I worked so hard for. No graduation, no senior play, no track and field, none of the milestones I have been dreaming of my whole life. I can feel the relationships I once cherished fading away. Now I have to live in my house in my childhood bedroom where I was repeatedly abused for years. No one knows how long this is gonna last and I feel so hopeless. I have spent so long learning to feel okay, and the moment I do, I am thrown right back into chaos. I have started abusing drugs again. I donâ€™t think I can do this anymore. I am constantly visualizing ways to kill myself. Boarding school gave me hope for a life and a career, but now that Iâ€™m back home I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m just destined to be another small town tragedy.
