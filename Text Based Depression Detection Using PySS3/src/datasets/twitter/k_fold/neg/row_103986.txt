Nothing really left for me to live forFor years, I've been struggling with suicidal ideations. I think my first attempt was when I was 14, homeless and living in a motel room by myself. From that year forward until now, I had attempted suicide numerous times. I want to say seven more times. Each time I had no consolation, I had no one to help. I struggle with this alone because I'm too afraid to come forward because I know I'll be belittled for it.
I'm just so tired now, everyday I tell myself to kill myself. That there's nothing left.
But this year, oh boy has the ideations gotten so bad. I can't go on a day without thinking about killing myself, no matter what the current situation is. And it truly sucks because I am afraid of death. So I'm perpetually stuck between wanting to die everyday and being scared into living another miserable day.
I dropped out, I started drinking and doing drugs to help ease with the pain that goes on in my mind. And I just pray that one day I'll be to inebriated and take a copious amount of drugs and alcohol, so that I'll be too fucked up to think about death but also die at the same time
