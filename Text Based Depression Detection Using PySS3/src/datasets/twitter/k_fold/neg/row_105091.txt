I wish that my life mattered more, but it doesn't.I'm currently 30 years old.  As a little background, I dealt with a short bout with depression during my teen years and eventually overcame those issues of not wanting to live anymore and feeling like life wasn't worth living.  I tried having a positive outlook on life for a number of years after my high school years, and for a while it worked but then a couple of years ago I just felt like a lonely life failure and heavy depression set in.  I haven't been able to get a career path going, haven't found or discovered any talent for a career path so I feel talentless.  Haven't been able make any close friends or long term connections, no one in particular to enjoy hobbies with to keep my mind away from stress of life going wrong.  Not once in my adult life have I had a long term romantic relationship or physical affection of any kind to hold onto, even though many people I meet have told me how wonderful of a person I seem but that doesn't seem to change the fortunes of my love life.

I went to a mental health facility a few months ago after I revealed to my parents that I felt like going through with taking my own life, just ending it.  Admittedly while the process felt like it dragged on a bit, it seemed positive at the time and I did meet some neat people going through similar rough patches in life.  People who just needed someone to talk to like I did, to not feel alone anymore.  I went through some different kinds of group therapy sessions and it was a good experience overall to be honest, the people working at the mental health center along with some of the other people admitted there helped me feel less empty than I had felt in a long time.  There's one person I still talk with occasionally from that place who's a great person, but the the empty void of not having any close connections or a significant other, or someone to enjoy nerdy hobbies with, still remained.

I didn't want to use any, but did begrudgingly get on some anti-depressants after leaving the mental health center.  Have been taking those for a few months now.  I followed through on seeing a therapist/life coach in 1 on 1 sessions around once a week.

I tried shaping things up with myself, looking for work or career paths online, anything in a sort of creative field or video game related field just to feel like I could try doing something with my life instead of feeling lonely and isolated all day with no talent.  I've tried finding some online gaming and Dungeons &amp; Dragons stuff to find people to connect with and become buddies with.

I've tried 4-5 different online dating sites with a paid subscription.  In the past I tried /r/r4r and OKCupid many times with no luck and rarely got a response.  I've continually tried putting myself out there to find a special someone even if on the inside it was hard to put up a positive image and a smile with how empty I felt on the inside, feeling like I'd never be interesting enough or women wouldn't want me for whatever other reason.

I've gone through the steps other people wanted me to do and have done my best.   I've asked for so much help the past few years, and no one is able to help.  Not even my therapist, who's a good guy and someone I can vent to but they don't have any concrete solutions to the things that are ailing me.  My mom just keeps saying "You just haven't found the right person yet."  I keep telling her not everyone does and that some people just die alone, and that someone isn't just going to magically drop into my life and be interested in dating me and accept me.

Now instead of feeling heavily depressed with a sinking feeling in my chest everyday, now it just feels more empty and alone with the anti-depressants taking care of some things but not making my life any happier.  I feel like I'm doomed to die alone.

*Nothing has changed, and I hate it.**
