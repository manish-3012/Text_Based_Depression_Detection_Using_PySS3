A Story of Survival From A Near-Suicide AttemptMy story starts some time around September. Going back to high school from a summer full of League of Legends and hanging out with friends as now a junior was pretty stressful. I never gave college much thought and didn't care about school too much. I'm pretty smart, able to coast through classes without having to study or anything, just listening in class. My brother went away to college, and so did many of his friends who in turn were good friends of mine. I didn't really get along with many of the people in my grade, so I didn't have many friends left. I have a significant family history of depression, and this was around the time I began to feel my own begin to worsen. For the first time also, I met a girl that I felt I loved. Tried to get things to work, never really did, so that also fed the depression. This spiraled downwards until around three weeks ago, in a deep and dark place, I had a knife to my throat. I still don't really know why, I just wanted to end it all. Escape all the pain that I went through with this girl and what I felt to be a lack of friends. Voluntarily, I admitted myself to a mental hospital for ten days. During that time, I realized how much I actually enjoyed life and the things that I had on the outside. Now, while I still feel somewhat suicidal, I have reasons left to stay, the greatest of which are my friends. I can reach out to them and get help. Now, I'm in therapy, keeping up with my medication. Now, even though I'm miserable at times, I'm still living on the face of this world.
Each day is a gift. That's why it's called the present.
