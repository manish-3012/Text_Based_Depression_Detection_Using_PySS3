Infatuated with the idea of suicide?Sometimes I have these really weird highs where I just really, really want to know how people I love would feel if I committed suicide? Like, during the highs I feel as if I have a purpose, and am genuinely, really intrigued. 

I start talking to myself while looking in a mirror as if I was talking to another person about their desires and passions, while I also speak to myself at the same time about how I practically lust over the idea of how my death would affect my loved ones, and how I yearn to be used as a metaphorical/literal stepping stone for others to achieve what they want. During these "highs" I laugh hysterically, cry, and drool as well. 

I've felt this way for over 3 years now, I personally have completely accepted the fact that I am a failure to my bloodline, and I honestly desire to know if I matter to my family anymore. I'm really sorry if this sounds really, really fucked up, I don't really have anyone to talk to about this.
