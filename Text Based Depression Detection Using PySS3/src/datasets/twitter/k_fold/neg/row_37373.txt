This day, pt 2I spent most of the firmly entrenched in my sanctuary in the dark watching every Disney movie I could find to try to bring back the better I had this morning. Didn't work. So I tried grocery shopping which only reminded me I am on food stamps. That then brought back that I am a leach. I fucking tried. Can I quit now?
