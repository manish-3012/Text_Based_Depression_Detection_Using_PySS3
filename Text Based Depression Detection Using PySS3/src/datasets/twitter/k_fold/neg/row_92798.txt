I failed everything. I am just going to die.Iâ€™ve ruined friendships and I canâ€™t find a way to fix them without ruining them even more. Iâ€™ve been such a waste of money and time for my entire life. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for 7 years now and take medication for 6 months. Iâ€™ve never wanted to die more than I do right now. I lost everything and everyone because of my dumb decisions. Iâ€™m coming here as a last resort because i find no reason for me to continue on hurting people I love and just constantly looking down on myself. Iâ€™m a toxic person and deserve to die in pain. I deserve so much pain and suffering. I know thereâ€™s people that probably still care about me but itâ€™s not worth it if Iâ€™m just hurting them in return. When I am gone, it would feel like a relief for my friends so honestly I want them to be relieved from my horrible presence.
