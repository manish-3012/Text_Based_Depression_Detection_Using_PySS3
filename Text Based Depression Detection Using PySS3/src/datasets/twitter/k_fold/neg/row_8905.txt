sixth post? idk. its time for the check in.getting so much worse. I've cried infront of two seperate groups of people this week. I never cry infront of anyone. I stopped finding joy in things. can't listen to music. I got off my game last night just to wrap myself in a blanket. ive had this constant background sad feeling since Saturday. even when hanging out with friends (less than ten people, sue me) I found myself staring off into space and realizing I was just not happy at least five times. maybe on a regular hangout day I'd do it once. I can not recall one moment where I was happy.
I'm just hoping that means I'm closer to actually getting the balls to do something because I'm definitely starting to break down in ways I havent in the last ten-nine years so. woo. go me.
