How can I keep going?I honestly can't stop thinking about killing myself. How I'm going to do it. Doing it so no one has to find me. At this point I'm in not only chronic physical pain but also chronic emotional/mental pain. Doctors keep telling me I just have to live through the physical pain. My parents tell me it's not as bad as it is and I should power through it. My partner is there with me in the hospital but doesn't even hold my hand. I feel like I disgust him and disappoint everyone else. 

I've tried reaching out for help but it doesnt seem that's coming my way. I get told that I'm a strong person and can get through it. The thing is, I've gotten through it previously and that's taken it's toll. My strength is waivering and I don't have much fight left. I'm self harming again but I can barely feel it over my normal pain. 

The only thing at this point keeping me here is my dog as I know no one will take care of him and he'll go to a different person. But even that is slowing becoming less of a tie. 

I don't feel happiness and certainly don't feel as if I'm loved. I'm just a burden people deal with and people just tolerate me. 

How do I keep going?
