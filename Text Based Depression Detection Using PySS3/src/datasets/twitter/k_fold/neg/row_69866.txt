Dealing with daily thoughts I'll be finishing College soon and starting a job, but lately, the last few months or so, I've had suicidal thoughts daily. I'm just curious to hear about others and how they're dealing with their thoughts. Most days if I just leave my apartment and try to walk or just distract myself that helps. I don't have any sort of active plan to take my life, so at this point I'm not really interested in doing therapy. I kind of just want to see how I feel after I graduate to decide any sort of plan of action. I've done talk counseling before and it did help and gave me some strategies to deal with anxieties, but the underlying depression has always been there. Basically I'm just trying to see what other people's motivations or grounders to their life. I don't want to die I just don't want to feel like this anymore
