I don't know how much longer I can keep goingI thought that I was getting better, but I've just been going back down the depression spiral and having an extended emotional breakdown. I feel like I'm just taking my medication out of obligation at this point. I've been lashing out at the people who are trying to help me. I hate myself so much.

I want to hurt myself; maybe burn myself with a lighter or go sit out in the freezing cold without a coat on. I don't know. I just want myself to suffer. I deserve to hurt.
