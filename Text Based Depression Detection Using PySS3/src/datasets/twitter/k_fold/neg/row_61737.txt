reoccurring dreamI keep having reoccurring dreams of something that happened to me as a child. It was a summer day, and I was over my cousin's house sitting by their 6 foot deep pool. I was about 5 or 6, and I remember sitting on the edge of the pool kicking my feet in the water. Then suddenly I was in the middle of the liquid death.

Now I don't remember how I fell into this pool of water but I do remember screaming for help, and my younger cousin could only watch in horror. Where was the adults at? I remember after a couple seconds of trying to stay afloat I gotten tired and I stopped screaming because my lungs was being filled with water. I don't know how long it was, but i remember just accepting what it was. As a kid, I did not know what death was. There was a strange comfort of just letting go. I stared up and though I couldn't see with chlorine water burning my eyes, I will never forget how bright the sun was and how quickly everything turned black. 

Obviously I didn't drown, but I did have to be resuscitated. A older cousin (whom I'm not close to now) apparently dove in the water and saved me.  

But in my reoccurring dream I was never saved. I stayed in darkness. Only to sink deeper and deeper. At first I considered it a nightmare, because I kept struggling to stay afloat. I kept fighting with every ounce of my will to scream and scream with no one around to hear me. Sometimes in my reoccurring dream there is people that I know in my life. They surround the pool of water and they watch this small child struggle to stay afloat. Maybe this is my personal hell? I do not know.

Whenever my body finally gives up on me I sink into the liquid as it envelopes my lungs. It becomes the opposite of chaos and noise. There's a peace in accepting what is happening to me. From that point on, it becomes a normal night's rest and the once nightmare is now a calming dream. 

I have to accept that I'm drowning.
