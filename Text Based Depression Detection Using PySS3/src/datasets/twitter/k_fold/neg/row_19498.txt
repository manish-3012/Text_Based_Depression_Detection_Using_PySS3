Carbon Monoxide??So I have been researching this a lot. Originally, I planned to do it by running a hose from the exhaust of my car into the window in the closed garage. Then I was reading on the lostallhope website that CO is not super reliable as a method due to emissions controls on vehicles. If I remove the catalytic converter on my car will it increase my odds enough?  Will it help if I take sleeping pills in combination?  How many and what kind?  All I have for drugs is Tylenol 3 and a few old Percocet.
I have checked the statistics on the most lethal/guaranteed ways to die but I donâ€™t have access to guns and hanging is not my thing. Also donâ€™t have funds or patience to purchase the most lethal drugs.  Also worried that I will chicken out if I tried jumping or hit by a train. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. Ever.
