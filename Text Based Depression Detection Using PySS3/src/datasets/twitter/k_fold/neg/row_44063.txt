A solar light saved my lifeI hugged my dog for what I thought would be the last time and proceeded to walk outside. There I was, outside smoking what I thought would be my last Marlboro red. I had a ridiculous amount of very dangerous pills on the table. I was shaking uncontrollably and sick to my stomach from being so nervous. I was sweating. Tears slowly rolling down my face because I get like this too often and I am barely handling it. Nothing has seemed to help. I just wanted it to be over. I was finally going to do it after years and years of ideation.

And then something caught my eye. A little light that previously hadn't been on.

It was the solar light across the street at the neighbor's house. Only one was working, and it was flickering. As if it were TRYING to get my attention...

Crying, I asked what it was trying to tell me. I stood there for 20 minutes all together, having completely ignored my cigarette. Every time I asked a question, it gave an indiscernible answer. I asked if it was trying to help me. Flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker, flicker. No answers I could understand...But in talking to it, I felt calm. I stopped crying and the shaking seemed to have subsided. I was and still am convinced it was there to help me.

That's psychotic depression for you.

Now here I am, listening to Year of the Cat by Al Stewart (The song is actually about a man who killed himself, which is ironic. I learned that right before writing this post). I'm realizing that I just might be okay.



*Yes, to those who will ask, I seek regular psychological treatment and am going to try and attend crisis support groups.
