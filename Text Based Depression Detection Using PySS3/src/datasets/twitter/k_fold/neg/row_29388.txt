LostOther people's lives are worse off than mine. I can completely recognize that. I just...I need to say something. I need to get my feelings out. Last night as I drove home from my ex-girlfriends house I did about 80 down a dirt road and let the wheel go as my car lost control and just hoped that it would be my time to go. My car ended up in a ditch fine and dandy. My thoughts, who would tell my ex if I got hurt or further more would anyone even tell? They all tell me to just move on as my ex and I are trying to work on things. I was abusive. I am a piece of shit. I never hit but I was a verbal asshole. I still am. The only reason I had a job and got out of bed was because of my ex and them making me want to live my life. I don't have that anymore. The only time I leave bed is to go there. We split up when I went into the hospital for surgery. They took our apartment and kicked me out, I lost my job and have nothing left. My mental state is going and I have no will for life. I miss them and like I said we were working on it. But we got into a huge argument tonight and I think that's the end of anything. I don't want to wake up tomorrow.
