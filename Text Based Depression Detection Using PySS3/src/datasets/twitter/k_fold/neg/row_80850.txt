Complete lack of motivation is ruining my life..Now, i understand that this isn't exactly related to suicide(although thinking about the situation has made me think about suicide).

So, i am an atheist, and this has basically lead me to believe that anything i do is useless and impactless, which in turn has posioned me to loose all motivation, to do anything beyond basic survival, which is absolutely killing my grades and other things in life. Of course, i always was a bit lazy, but this isn't laziness, i literally can't get myself to do some simple homework that is crucial to my passing of this grade, the suicide thoughts tie in to how boring my life will be if i get a 9-5 job, death at the end, etc.

I've always had tons of friends and girls are obviously interested in me, so stop me from ruining my life.
