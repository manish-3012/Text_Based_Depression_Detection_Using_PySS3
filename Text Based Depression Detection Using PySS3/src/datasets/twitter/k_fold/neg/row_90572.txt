Rant and also asking for adviceI donâ€™t really know if this is the right sub for this but here goes:

My living conditions arenâ€™t great. They arenâ€™t the worst but they certainly arenâ€™t â€œnormal.â€ My house is completely trashed. My mom has a chronic illness that renders her unable to leave the house most of the time and also creates some memory loss problems. My dad is pretty good but is overworked because of medical payments and making up for the loss of my moms income. My sister used to hurt me a lot, but even though thatâ€™s stopped for the most part I still canâ€™t trust her and I get really upset when Iâ€™m near her. Iâ€™m a minor and thinking about how long I have to stay here makes everything seem so bleak. I donâ€™t know anymore. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking to accomplish with this but Iâ€™m looking for advice I guess. I could use some outside input.
