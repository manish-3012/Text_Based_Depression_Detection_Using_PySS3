Sometimes I hope I don't live to see my next birthday.I'm sorry but I feel like I will be miserable and depressed forever. I've been trying my best to do what I can to feel better but I ALWAYS slip and feel sad all over again. I feel like I'm drowning- the more I fight to keep my head out of the water, the more I struggle. It's a little ironic because I'll be 21 next February and that's a big deal I guess and I'm sorry but it doesn't seem worth it to hang on. I hate celebrating my birthday anyway. I've noticed that in recent years, I tend to feel depressed during the time before and during my birthday. Not sure why. I know I'm probably not the only one but I wish I didn't feel like this.
