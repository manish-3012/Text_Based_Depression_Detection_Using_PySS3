Intrusive thoughts making me dangerousThrowaway account bc I've worked hard on my image. I'm 18F, live in Texas, and just quit my job (too many anxiety attacks) so I'm broke.

About two weeks ago, I started a new medicine called Escitalopram or Lexapro for my depression and anxiety. And it was fine at first, I definitely had fewer anxiety attacks. But now I'm having insane urges that I can barely control.

I was babysitting my 4 month old niece, and had an overpowering urge to chuck her. And I almost did. I barely managed to stop. Later, I was driving home from work and nearly drove straight into a brick wall. I caught myself, swerved, hit a curb and lost a hubcap.

I went to my parents and asked for help. My dad said it might be a side effect of the medicine and that I should schedule an appointment with my doctor to get things figured out. If it ends up not being the medicine, I should look into an in-patient clinic (his nice way of saying psych ward) or just head to the ER.

My mom was less supportive. She doesn't understand what's wrong with me and so she lashes out. She makes me feel worse. She keeps telling me to go to the ER, but she knows I can't afford it (I've had to pay my own way since I was 16. I've never had help with my bills).

So I have no money, no real support, insane intrusive thoughts, and everyone around me just keeps telling me the same thing. Go to the ER. Is there anyone out there who's in a similar situation? I'd like to feel like I'm not alone.
