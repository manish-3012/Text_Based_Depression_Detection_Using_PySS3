Wrote my note.As the title says. I dont really plan on telling anyone else, but I'd like to feel perhaps a little less alone for the moment before I go to bed for the night. I know you don't know me, I'm just a stranger on the internet, words on a screen, really. I'm 24. I have DID. I've been turning this idea over for a while, and I'm not the only one. Today, we uncovered some more trauma memories. I guess this was the last straw for us. We've lived through so much already, the idea that more has happened to us.... I cant really take that idea. I've been alive less than a quarter of a century and I'm burnt out on life. And its only gonna get worse. It always does. Yes theres good parts to life. But I just don't have it in me to stick around for any of this anymore.... mostly I'm sad that I'll be leaving my husband.... I love him more than words can say. And I know I'm the most selfish person ever for doing this. I wish I could hang on. But I've been hanging on for almost 25 years. I can't anymore. So I'm sorry. To everyone. Guess tomorrow's the day. Thanks if you took the time to read this.
