I need good suggestionsHi, ive decided im doing it tomorrow, but im not sure which way to go down. Have been thinking about hanging, cutting open my wrist with an axe, overdose on something, etc. I dont want to survive with serious injuries, so it must be a high success-rate, and favorable simple to commit. Please do not attempt at giving me consolement or be empathic, im way beyond that point.
