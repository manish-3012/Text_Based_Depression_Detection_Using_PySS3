Im 23. Each year is getting slower and slower, I don't see it lasting much longerI've basically cut all my friends out of my life for about a year now, I'm alone. I'm retarded. I haven't gotten laid in 3 years. I hate all people for the most part. I can't function in social situations anymore. It's like I'm too aware of how much I fuck up around people, I just can't burden people anymore with my sickness. Is there a way to live without being connected to society? I feel like I owe it to my parents to live even though I spend everyday inside, and when I get angry I take it out on them, I use to take it out on my friends but I have none left. I don't want to hurt my parents anymore, but I don't want to hurt them also by dying. How can I live a bleak life away from them? Or should I just kill myself already. I'm looking to find a gun, I don't like pain and I fear my brain having a ego deterioration after I die, I want to destroy my brain completely so I don't slowly die. I think a gunshot wound to the head would be the quickest way to go.
