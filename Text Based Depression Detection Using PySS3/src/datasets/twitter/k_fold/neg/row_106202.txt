All aloneMy gf of 10 years dumped me. We grew up together. Every day she told me she loved me. She was my only friend and she knew me better than even my own family. I never thought anyone would love me that way but she gave me hope that maybe i wouldnt have to be alone the rest of my life. 
Shes blocked me in all forms of communication and told me to never talk to her again. Im done being betrayed and treated like trash. I cant function i can barely sleep let alone function at work. Itd b better if i just killed myself and sav me a life of being disappointed  i know such a sad sob story but it hurts so bad im so alone and i have nobody to talk to or love me or want me around.

Im going to die by terminal dehydration. That way at least i can be content it wasnt a spur of the moment decision.
