I told her it's not her faultI made another Instagram account to tell her it's not her fault when I decide to go through with it. She instantly blocked me, which I deserve, but I just want her to have it so she doesnt get in trouble. I just want to say thank you for the people who are on here helping others, but there is no helping me.
