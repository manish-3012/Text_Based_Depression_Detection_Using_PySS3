ALL the time...Why is it i think about suicide all the time. And I mean all the time. I'll be walking to campus and I'd be looking around and wondering how I could kill myself with what I see. And every time i cross the street and a car is coming towards or just drove by, I always think "If only." Is there a way to stop feeling this way? I know suicide is a permanent solution to temporary problems, but it's also a permanent solution to a permanent stream of temporary problems.  I really want to go through with it, family is the only thing keeping me from it. what if that isn't enough anymore though?
