I feel like not feeling anything is better than thisI realize im drunk rn but i have felt like life is more of a burden than emjoyment lately. I have ocd and I'm constantly scared of hurting someone and I DONT WANT TO, why not just get a gun and kill myself to end the pain? (Im too scared to die if its not instant))
