This is no life worth livingIâ€™ve been fighting suicide for almost 20 years now. I am too exhausted and defeated to fight anymore. PTSD and anxiety consume my every breath. Not even sleep is an escape. I hate being alive. I hate waking up another day just to fight more. Every thought and breath are pain. On top of that I am a complete burden to my loved ones. I can never be a whole partner to my SO. He and our cats are the last thing keeping me fighting, but seeing how Iâ€™m affecting him is more than I take. He deserves better than a life with a depressed girl triggered by everything. I think no matter how hard I try Iâ€™ll never really be able to be enough. Iâ€™ll never be a whole person in this world. Iâ€™ll always be desperate for relief, yet knowing itâ€™s never coming. So Iâ€™ll never be okay as long as I live. Iâ€™ve always known there had to be a had a threshold to this suffering, and I think Iâ€™m hitting it. Iâ€™ve known how Iâ€™m going to do it for a while and have had my letter written for a while. I hate knowing the last thing I will do will hurt people, but itâ€™s par for the course anyways. At least itâ€™s one last time. And maybe if they really love me, they can be happy I finally have peace. Iâ€™ve never publicized feeling this way before. I know itâ€™s my burden to bear. Idk why Iâ€™m posting besides making a last ditch effort. Iâ€™ll probably delete this and keep going on in my misery... but one day... maybe a week from now maybe five years from now... I will put an end to this pathetic existence. I just know I canâ€™t take a lifetime of this. And sometimes it feels like I canâ€™t take another second of this.
