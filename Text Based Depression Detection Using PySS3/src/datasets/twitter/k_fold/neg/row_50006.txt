My friend wants to kill himself.My friend is a YouTuber with over 3 thousand subscribers, and he's been saying things on his community tab that worry me and his followers.

We've been friends for over a year and just yesterday he's been showing signs of wanting to end it all, one of them being faking his suicide while others are posts that exist just to bash himself.

I tried my best to reach out to him so he can get the help he needs, but he hasn't been responding to me.

I hope my friend is okay.
