I don't want to leave my catsWhat's bipolar life expectancy? Mine is 44. I am 100% full of humiliation and sadness and i can't take one more drop or i will burst. And there is more on the horizon, saying goodbye to my cats and my boyfriend of 21 years and moving back across the country, because he doesn't love me anymore. Since my career and friends are already gone, that makes everything. I'm 44 and on SSD (disability), and i can't think of a single scenario in which my life becomes ok again. Everything i wanted is gone and i can't accept the life that is now available to me. I think i am not going to say goodbye to my cats. I think it will all be over soon. It's the only thought that gives me any comfort. I wish suicide was less gross and painful though. I really don't want to hurt anymore.
