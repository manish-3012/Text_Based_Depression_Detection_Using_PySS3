Finally went to therapy and got a diagnosisWell after multiple depressive episodes through the years, I finally went to a therapist yesterday and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Each time I tried to schedule an appointment I always felt embarrassed, as if how I was feeling wasnâ€™t anything or one reason or another. Honestly I feel better now knowing that there actually is something going on. 

For the past few weeks I have had constant thoughts of suicide to the point that I asked my boyfriend to take away my razors. 2018 was the last time I had actually cut myself, so I didnâ€™t want to take a chance. Itâ€™s been tough, but hopefully after I get my medication early next week, things will start to get better. 

If you are like me and end up cancelling your appointments for whatever reason, just know itâ€™s okay to feel that way. Times are tough, but try your best to keep the appointment next time, no matter how hard it seems at first.
