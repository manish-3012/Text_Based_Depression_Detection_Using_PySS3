Could someone explain something to me?What part of "there isn't a day when I don't think it would've been better if I was never born" mean that my mental health is fine and I should stop seeing a therapist?

My therapist will probably kick me out since it's gonna be impossible to diagnose me with anything (their manual specifically says that my circumstances don't meet their criteria and that it'd meet it if I had made money on what got me into this mess).

I mean, at least make it one way or the other.

I was doing something that would meet their criteria for six and a half nights a week for months, but it only counts if it's your job. I used my free time. So according to them getting paid for something means your worthy of help, doing it for free means they have an excuse to kick you out.

But, who am I to say anything?

I feel like I don't deserve to live, but on paper I'm fine.
