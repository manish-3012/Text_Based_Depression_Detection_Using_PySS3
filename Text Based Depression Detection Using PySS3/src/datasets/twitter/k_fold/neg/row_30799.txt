i can't take this anymore i'm doneso far my life seems to only be going down the drain. i have no real friends, all of them are fake and never commit their time to talk to me, help me, let alone ask how i am. my love life is getting nowhere; every girl i meet just ends up ghosting me/not talking to me anymore after you emotionally get attached. my grades are horrible, and i've been kept back a year now. i don't have the patience or attention to be able to do well in school. i spend so much money to get a degree that i can't achieve, and this school is making me so poor. i can't get a job, nobody wants to hire me. let alone an internship, i can't even fucking get an internship. for years i always told myself that it gets better but clearly in my case it really doesn't. i'm in a shit space right now, and nobody I know cares enough to be able to be here for me. i feel like an alcoholic, i spend my money on booze to help me feel better when i want to enjoy my night. i have nobody to talk to,  nobody to cry to. clearly something is wrong with me because i can't affiliate myself with anything. i'm very self conscious about myself, my body. we live in a generation where you have to live up to people's expectations whether it be academic or social. i don't belong. i never did and i never will. i never had anyone be close to me. i never had anyone say i love you to me. i never get invited to events. everyone seems to be enjoying life with their loved ones. nobody seems to want to spend their time with me. what's the point of even being around when it already seems like you're not? the idea of taking my life away has always been around, but i don't want to kill myself, i'm scared of the pain and the mystery of what comes after. i always convinced myself to not do it but at this point tonight i've reached my breaking point. a world where i don't exist anymore.
