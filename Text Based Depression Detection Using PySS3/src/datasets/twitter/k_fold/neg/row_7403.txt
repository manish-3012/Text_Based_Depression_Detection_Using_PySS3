The pain never ends.It's been 4 years since this sadness in me has started. I end every day by laying in bed alone thinking how lonely I am and how pointless my life is. It's a never ending pain that I just want to stop. I dont think it will go away ever.. crying dulls the pain but I cant even have that. I try to get the tears out but nothing will come. All these sleepless nights get so lonely. Having no one to talk to is torture. Music doesnt help any more. Self harm is getting harder to hide. I'm alone. These scars on my body just remind me.. I'm stuck. not a day goes by without suicide on my mind. I'm to chicken to do it but I like to think that one day I'll do it. One day I'll be gone and leave this pain behind. One day... I wont be in pain anymore.. ðŸ˜ž "shorty dont know I'm broken inside wanna be six feet under fuck being alive"-Bad Dream.
