Im on fucking edgeIm a total fuckup. I ruin all my friendships with jealousy and just being a cunt. Venting alot but never taking advice. Im so fucking done. I feel like such an asshole too, the only reason im still here is because im too much of a fucking pussy to kill myself. I genuinly dont give a shit about hurting others anymore. I told one of my best friends im at my absolute lowest rn and she just responded with "Debatable, ive seen you worse". Everything fucks up, every fucking thing for me. The last fucking thing j had to look forward to is moving to Japan, dont ask about the details, i just feel living there would make me at least some what happier. But apparently theres barely any rights for lgbt, im bi. So fuck that. And im just done. I told my mom im depressed yesterday and shes gonna look for a therapist for me but its not gonna fucking change shit. Im still me. Im still living the same fjcking life. I cant fucking bare the constant fucking pain anymore. I am so fuckong lonely. I hate everything. Idek what to tyoe anymore even though i know im not done. I cant fucking do it anymore im so fucking fucked im so motherfucking fucked. Im fucking doomed. I cant be fucking happy. I hate it i cant fucking do it
