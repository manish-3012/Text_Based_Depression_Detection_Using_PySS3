NicotineUhoh just got hooked on nicotine to feel something. Numbs my body a bit and I know itâ€™s not good and that I risk getting really addicted but I just really want to die. Hopefully I kill myself and donâ€™t have to deal with the consequences. But holy shit I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I feel absolutely horrible. Iâ€™ve come so close but I just canâ€™t seem to find a good way to end it. I know I should just do it to get it over with because I just keep coming back here but oh well.
