I want out.There's a whole lot to say and not enough room to sat it. Simply put, I'm struggling. I know eventually I will have to grow up and be an adult and work and stuff but I'm so exhausted. I just want to sleep all the time. I want the meds to work. I want to not lean on my poor boyfriend who has more than enough on his plate. I want to not bother my best friend who has been invaluable but I know also with his own life to worry about. I want to not worry and overburden my parents. I want all these things because I am selfish and all I do is want want want. I feel like I never give enough. I feel like I never help enough to be worth it anymore. I just want to be selfish this one time. Just once. 

I'm so tired. I want out.
