My friend asks me why "it's worth it" to keep living. I know why I feel that way. I don't know how to say it.My friend's going through a bad time, and is questioning everything. Life's pretty shit for her, the guy she likes is off-limits, and she doesn't feel like her friends are there for her.

She came to me a few days ago. Asked me to explain to her why life's even worth living. Talked about how she can almost afford a gun. I did my best. Explained why I feel like life is best. Not sure I sold it.

Let's hear some stories. Life is amazing, give me some of your evidence.
