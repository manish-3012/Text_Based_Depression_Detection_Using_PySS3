Wrote the will10years of struggling with suicidal thoughts. Every kind of abuse. Drunk family,abusive family, bad life in the military and bad life after. 23 almost 24. Let narc mom convince me my mental health issues were because I was trans. Mind fuck took me 15months to break , ruined body, double fucked mind. Lot my shit and got a bunch of dumb tattoos. Best friend betrayed me.

Whats left?I've ruined myself or others ruined me since 12. I'm done with the pain. Wish I hadn't sold my gun. 

Wrote out my will, finished it today. Planned the funeral too. What method to choose? Rope too unreliable, no gun, bleeding takes too long.... 
 Should I rob a store?? I'm a half black (F) so I know they'll shoot at least once. Otherwise there is a river I could drive into but its downtown people will see
