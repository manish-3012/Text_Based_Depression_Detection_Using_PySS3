Why should I live...I mean, just why?
Life is pointless, nothing I do matters. At the end you die anyways. 

"But what about the people you leave behind?" 
I don't exist when I'm dead (r/noshitsherlock). 
My now existing me cares, but when I die it doesn't matter. My family would be sad, but they will also die too at some point. So it doesn't matter. 
                                           =

No need to live. I can die in peace. Yey. 
(Can you change my mind pls? I will probably argue with you. But maybe you can convince me. Would help me very much. I recently hit a new low...)
