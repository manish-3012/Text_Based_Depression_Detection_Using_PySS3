iâ€™ve voiced for years that the way my parents treat me is wrong, and having to live here makes me suicidal. they donâ€™t carei started telling them and begging them to help me get out of here years and years ago. my parents fucked up raising my brother and i. i got severely sick when i was in middle school, and i still am. so unfortunately my dreams of moving out when i was 18 was impossible, i couldnâ€™t work or go to school. i was tired of the abuse when i was younger and i even called places to try and get taken out of my home. i begged if they had family they could ask if i could stay there. i donâ€™t know their families and weâ€™re not close to them but i just knew i couldnâ€™t stay. i canâ€™t be myself and i get treated horribly. theyâ€™ve given me so much anxiety and depression. iâ€™ve tried fixing things and working with them and expressing my concerns and trying to change things. but nothing works. they refuse to see anything theyâ€™ve done wrong. they raised my brother horribly too and heâ€™s 25 and completely enabled and canâ€™t take care of himself. i have told my parents even recently that iâ€™m suicidal. my moms literally a psychiatric nurse and my dad a counselor. but they donâ€™t care when i say iâ€™m suicidal cause of being here. i have begged them to see that this place isnâ€™t livable for me for physical reasons and that i could never be happy here. youâ€™d think a parent would listen to their child and see beyond what they want and want to control, and want them to be happy and healthy. iâ€™m just so tired of fucking being in this house and not able to get out :( i wish i never had health issues and my life would be so different. i wouldâ€™ve left and never talked to them so i could live my life in peace without their judgements and disappointment. i just wanna be happy and healthy and iâ€™ll never get it. i feel like i should just end this all instead of continuing it longer. itâ€™ll never get better. iâ€™ve tried reaching out to places for help but nobody cares or can help
