I have literally no one.I can't talk about the deepest stuff that upsets me. 

Can't talk to my youth worker. He'll legally have to report those things. I'll get hospitalised and made worse.

Can't talk to my SO. She blames herself for everything anyway. Which makes me feel worse.

Can't talk to Reddit. All I get is 1 comment that doesn't help. Everyone who reads the comment upvotes it and doesn't give me any support. Which makes me feel worse.

I have no friends. The friends I have make it clear that they don't care.

Can't talk to strangers on the internet. No one understands.

My parents blame me for all their struggles. 

I don't see the point in living if help is impossible.
