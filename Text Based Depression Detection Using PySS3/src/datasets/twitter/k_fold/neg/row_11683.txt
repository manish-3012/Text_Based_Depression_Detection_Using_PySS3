Iâ€™m a piece of shit thief.Hi. Iâ€™m going to be honest throughout this post. I came upon very hard times recently, and had a terrible addiction that I have gotten help and gotten over.  Over the past 12 months, I had been writing checks to myself from a stack of checks I had from an elderly lady. The money was used %100 to feed my addiction (which i know is irrelevant and does not make a difference). About 2 months ago, after I got help and stopped my addiction, I also stopped writing the checks and have not done it since, and actually destroyed and got rid of the stolen checkbook I had completely also because I felt terrible, I just couldnâ€™t stop myself when I was an addict. recently was contacted by social services that they are investigating me for â€œcrimes against the elderlyâ€. And guess what? That elderly person is my grandmother. She cares for me so much and I did this. My mother found out today and told me â€œI canâ€™t even look at you Iâ€™m so disgustedâ€. I donâ€™t have anything. I donâ€™t have motivation, I am so fucking depressed that I was stealing money so I could feed my addiction to make myself a little happy for awhile. Iâ€™m so depressed I donâ€™t want to work, wake up, do anything. I want to sit in a closet everyday in the dark. Probably just end it so my parents arenâ€™t ashamed.
