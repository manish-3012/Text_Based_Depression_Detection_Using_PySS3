What happens if I tell someone I constantly think about killing myself?Any time I get my prescription re-filled, the doctor will ask me if I ever have any suicidal thoughts. I of course lie and say no, but what would happen if I told the doctor that I do think about suicide, daily? I assume my medicine will be taken away (Paxil and Clonazepam), but what about my career? I actually have a career in healthcare myself and I can only assume that if I end up committed somewhere that it will ruin my career. I'm in the kind of position where I can't just take an extended period of time off of work out of nowhere. And please don't just say "well suicide will ruin your career even more", I want actual helpful answers please.

Edit: in Canada, if that makes any difference.
