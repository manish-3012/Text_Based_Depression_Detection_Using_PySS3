Why should I care if they donâ€™tI always thought that my dad and my sister cared about me, well turns out thatâ€™s not true. :)
I was diagnosed with clinical depression and suicidal tendencies recently. Since Iâ€™m a minor I cannot admit to a mental hospital myself, so the psychiatrist asked my dad to call and discuss the situation with her. I told that to him, at first he seemed understanding and sympathetic but itâ€™s been almost a week and he hasnâ€™t called her, saying that he forgot or he doesnâ€™t have time. I think if you cared you would at least do this much. 
I donâ€™t think he believes in my diagnosis...
I donâ€™t want to die but no matter how much I think I see no other options. The end of spring is the time I think :) so letâ€™s enjoy my last months.
