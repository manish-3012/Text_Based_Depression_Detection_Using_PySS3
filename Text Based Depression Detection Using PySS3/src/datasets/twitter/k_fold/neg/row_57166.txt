Hi there. I'm suicidal, but I'm awaiting an appointment which may mark the beginning of things getting better for me. So I'm trying to screw my life as little as possible. But I DONE FUCKED UP. I lapse into deciding to commit very often for small periods of time, at which point I start acting really erratic because I feel like nothing matters.

Just recently I fucked up and weirded everybody out. I wanted help with pushing me into suicide, so I asked everyone I know to punch me/kick me/rip out my hair or to viciously verbally abuse me. I offered money for this to happen but nobody accepted. After I came out of my death mindset I freaked the fuck out because IT IS NOT A NORMAL THING TO ASK PEOPLE TO DO. Oh my God people are going to think I'm a weirdo and I'm going to be mocked forever and I can't live after like this. I've already got enough horror and dread in my life to be dealing with this. I know that what I did was wrong and creepy and unusual but I had no other way to do it and the feeling is kind of cathartic? I can't justify myself but I have to try. How do I move past this?
