I tried to kill myself yesterdayI'm not sure if this kind of post (post-attempt) is allowed here, If not don't be afraid to remove, I understand 



I am 16 years old and yesterday I thought it was my last.

I have been struggling with dealing with everything that goes on in my head, for around 2 years i have been at my worst, I have been seeing professionals for just under a year and nothing changed, I felt like they didn't listen to what I was saying and that they dismissed my issues.

Yesterday I finally grew the balls to try to kill myself, I got drunk with some friends as i usually do at the weekend and I acted fine as i usually do and i told my friends i was going home, around 5-10 minutes away from where i live there is a bridge that crosses over water, I walk over this bridge nearly every day on the way to school. I think while crossing the bridge that one day i would jump off of it. So when i eventually got there I climbed on to the railing and sat for maybe around a minute and worked up the courage to jump, and i did i remember how it felt. It felt as though i was falling for a long time, i dont know if i fell unconscious or why the fall felt so long, I hit the water and found that the water was not as deep as i imagined, I shot up from the water and felt instant pain down my left side of my body (probably landed that way) For some reason I tried to get out of the water, the water about up to my stomach, so i could walk in it, I eventually manage to climb out and i walked around not knowing where i was or where to go for probably around 10-15 minutes. I really don't know how to explain how i got home but in short i had to climb over a fence into a factory and walked out of the exit back on to the road and walked very painfully home the way i normally would. I got home and told my mum what I had done and I told her I think that my leg was broken. My mum and my sister were both crying, The only reason i was crying is the fact that i couldn't even kill myself, I even failed at that. I still don't regret that i tried, I'm just disappointed in myself that i couldn't succeed.

My mum took me to the hospital where they told me i was really lucky that i didn't break my leg(s). Due to the way i landed i only have swelling and bruising up my left leg, I spoke to someone from the mental health team at the hospital and had to speak about everything that bothered me, I am going to be put on anti-depressants and have more regular appointments to speak to someone.
I was kept over night and was allowed to go home in the morning, They were going to put me away for a week, but decided that it may not be the best for me since only being 16 being put in a place like that may do more harm than good. 


I am sorry if you read all of that I don't have anyone to speak to, I feel lost and don't know what to do with myself anymore, I'm don't know how to feel about this.

also i feel like people may get the wrong idea when i say bridge, It wasn't like a huge bridge.
Here is an image on google maps of how the bridge looks, I cant really give a better angle without disclosing more information about my location as i would like to. [Bridge](http://i.imgur.com/Z79eFq4.jpg)
