Instead of not being able to get out of bed, I canâ€™t get to bedItâ€™s 12:30am in Scotland right now and like a lot of times I struggle to get into bed, not because Iâ€™m lazy or whatever but itâ€™s almost like Iâ€™m â€œphysically weakâ€ (and mentally) even though my bodies fine. Not only that but I also canâ€™t get out of bed for hours at some points, this shit sucks.
