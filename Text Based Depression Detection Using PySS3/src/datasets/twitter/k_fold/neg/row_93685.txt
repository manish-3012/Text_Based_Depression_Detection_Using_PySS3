I constantly think about dyingI have to keep my mind occupied non-stop because the second I have time to think, the thought of dying takes over. I want to open up to someone, my partner says I have nothing to be sad about and invalidates my feelings all the time. Heâ€™s right, I have no real reason for wanting to die. I tried to tell him how I feel, he told me I was attention seeking. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep living inside my head.
