I'm Still HereCops got called when I attempted on Sunday, so I didn't end up taking anything. Talked to another crisis worker and they didn't want to send me to the hospital. They think it's "Unhealthy " that I go so often (3 times in the past year and a half) which I find super ironic. They just said to call my psychiatrist asap and then left. Had some Henny then I went to bed. Talked to him today and got a new med. It's called Wellbutrin. I start taking it tomorrow. Hope it helps. I have been feeling better though. Thanks to the people that commented on my last post, I read them all.
