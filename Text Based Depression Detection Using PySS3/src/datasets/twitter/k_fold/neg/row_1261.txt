Uneducated, unskilled, friendless and suicidal.I feel the only way out of this meaningless existence is suicide. I went to public school until third grade when my mom met my stepdad, he was a conspiracy theorist who thought school just brainwashes kids to be followers of the elite corporations, he was unemployed with no money when he moved in and stayed that way.
He convinced my mom to homeschool me,which she only did once a week until sixth grade. After that nothing. I never had any interactions with anyone else other than them my whole childhood.

When I turned twenty I miraculously passed the GED test and got a drivers license and was kicked out of the house by my stepdad. I was homeless and got a minimum wage jobs and roommates that never worked out, because I had no social skills and still don't. I always had anxiety and depression over my working, education and social skills.
So I broke down and tried suicide, got community mental health and approved for disability and section 8.
I have been living off this for a few years, but still have no friends and can't enjoy anything. Not even movies or music because I see people living full meaningful lives in movies and singing about love in songs.
I feel like I can't go on living as an uneducated, unskilled thirty year old on disability with no prospects of a career or social life in sight. I just don't see a solution to this problem do you?
