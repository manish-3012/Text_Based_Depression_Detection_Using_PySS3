Irl horror stories hit differentWoke up, was home alone, decided to cut my wrist but i couldnt cut deep enough so i tried to overdose on paracetamol but they were expired. I called 111 and got taken to the hospital. When i was there i got put on suicide watch. They took all my possesions (phone included), gave me a hospital gown and watched me to prevent me from commiting suicide. At 9am some people came to see me, the ran some tests and took an ecg scan to see if the overdose was lethal or not. After that i had a chat with a psych for around a hour. Then once he left me i had to wait from 11-12:15, thats when they took my blood test to see if the overdose was dangerous. They had left the needle in my vein in case i needed an antidote which was very painful. The needle stayed in there for an hour before i got my results back. I turned out to be fine and they gave me a butterfly stich on my wrist. I then had go wait for a few hours before i had to see another psych. It was very boring, 1/10 would not recommend
