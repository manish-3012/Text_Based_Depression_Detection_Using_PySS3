donâ€™t know much longer i will lastevery day is harder of a struggle to live through than the one before. i can feel myself getting closer to the day i end it. i cannot get it together. i canâ€™t leave my bed, and when i do i immediately want to go back. i hate looking at myself in the mirror. i hate living this life .
