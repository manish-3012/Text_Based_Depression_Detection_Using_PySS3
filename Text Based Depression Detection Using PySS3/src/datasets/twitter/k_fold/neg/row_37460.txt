My gf and I lost our unborn child. I need help finding therapist fast.Last week we suffered the loss of our unborn child to fetal abnormality. Everything has felt surreal and awful because even though it was unplanned, we decided to keep the child. After our child was found to be non-viable, we had to go through the process of a medical abortion. The clinic was so wonderful to us but we still had to deal with protesters and strange/cruel state restrictions made to shame us even though there was nothing we could do.

I'm stuck in a hole because I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about this besides my gf because of judgements that my friends and family might make. She's works very hard though and has a more robust support system. The pain is unbearable and the emotional seclusion is drawing me to a dark part of my mind that I've never experienced before.

I need help finding a therapist or something. I want to grieve and talk but these awful thoughts of self-harm make me feel like I need help fast.  I just can't keep doing this by myself. I feel so alone. I need help.
