hm?oh... how did I end up here.. when did my problems spiral this far? I remember a few years back when I was a happy child who didn't have a single care in the world and had no idea of the dark secrets that hid deep below my family. well, whatever. the only way I feel anything is when I am hurt. self harm is always my go-to way to feel something other than emptiness\~
