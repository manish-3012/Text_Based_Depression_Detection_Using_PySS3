Winter of 2016-2017.I'm amazingly cool with it. 

I've built four fortunes, and all have been destroyed by a killing machine with ASPD.

There's nothing I can do to stop the implosion this time. My body is capable of recovery, but my mind is following a genetic predisposition that can be delayed, but not conquered.

So. 

I'm leaving a digital tracer here for whomever to follow. 

Also, I'd welcome any well wishers, positive thoughts, bawdy illustrations, words of encouragement (genuine or otherwise), and anything else you'd care to leave.

I'll make it through the next winter. The one after that - it's absolutely too much to ask of me to keep going.

I'm not angry. 

Don't be sad. 

Every minute you're angry is a minute you're not happy.
