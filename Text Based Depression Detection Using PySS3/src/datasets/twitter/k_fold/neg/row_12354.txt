its timeive been reading this forum for the past few days. ive been having these feelings for years but more intensely the last 7 months. i have no job, no money, no family, no friends no potential and no reason to live. i have totally given up. i dont care if my actions hurt anyone else. i actually love knowing that my actions will hurt people. ive tried to do this with pills and alcohol for a while now but  now i am going to just hang myself. i am not legally able to purchase a gun or else id already be gone. as soon as i am in this house alone i will be taking this noose, putting it around my neck and leaving this world for good. please mark my grave unknown
