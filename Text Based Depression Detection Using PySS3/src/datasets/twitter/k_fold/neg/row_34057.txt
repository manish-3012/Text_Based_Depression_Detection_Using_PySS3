How do you guys last so long?Im only 20 now, but its been about a decade of feeling like this. Because of personal beliefs, i cant kms. How do you older folks (40+) last so long? Ive read stories on here about ppl wanting to die their entire lives, and i dont know how i'll manage this for 40+ more years. Im at my worst rn, and i think its only getting worse. Just this morning, it took me 3 hours to pick up my phone 2 feet away from me. I had no energy to even move. Wtf is this.
