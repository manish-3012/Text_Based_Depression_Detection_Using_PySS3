I want outIâ€™ve dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts for years, but in all seriousness the only reason I havenâ€™t killed myself yet is because of my mom. She is the only reason I have left to stay here. However, my dumb ass did something (really) bad a while back, and she found out about it. She said it best herself, the parent-child relationship requires trust, and I lost hers. She has put up with my shit for years, but I think this is the last straw. I donâ€™t see a point in going forward anymore, especially if my own mother despises me like she does now.
