i never told anyonei tried to kill myself a few months ago. i got really close. i guess it's best not to state the method. i didn't get hospitalized but if i hadn't stopped when i did, i wouldn't be here. i don't regret doing it, just that i didn't go through with it. i couldn't even do that right. that night ended with me just uncontrollably shaking. it was probably due to shock. my body was so shocked that i almost died but my mind was calm. i didn't cry. i didn't feel sad or scared. i just got up the next day and painted a smile on my face.

i've had a few attempts but that was the closest i've ever been. no one knows that i could've died right there and then. everyone else was just living their lives. no one cared, not really. it's not like they owe me that anyway. it's not like tge universe owes me good days because i've had so many bad ones. 

the world did not stop, nor will it when i finally go through with it.
