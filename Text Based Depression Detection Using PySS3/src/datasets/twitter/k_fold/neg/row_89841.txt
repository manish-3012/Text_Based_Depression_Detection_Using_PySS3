I've decided I'm going to end it.I'm to tired to keep going on with this pathetic excuse that I call my life. I've tried to reach out (sort of), it didn't work. I don't see it getting any better so I'm going to kill myself I don't know exactly how yet but it will be soon. I don't know why I'm even posting this,I think i just wanted to tell someone, make it seem real
