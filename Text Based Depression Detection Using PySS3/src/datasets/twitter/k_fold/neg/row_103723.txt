I thought I had my shit together but I donâ€™tWhen I was 11 years old I tried to kill myself and drank a bottle of extra strength ibuprofen, i had been sad for a long time. My mom used to abuse me in the worst ways and when she found out I was self mutilating she smacked me across the face in front of my best friend. I cried, and then drank the pills a few days after. I obviously didnâ€™t die. She got me help when she found out I tried to kill my self. I was on antidepressants for about 5 years and found a great therapist who turned out to be one of my greatest friends. Sadly, he died from cancer. I miss him so fucking much. I stopped medication a few months after his death. I was doing okay. Occasionally I felt sad but nothing too bad. I am 20 years old now and Iâ€™m going to school for neuroscience. Except I am not good at school. I am not good at anything really.  My grades never go beyond a C. Even when I study for weeks at a time. I donâ€™t feel good inside anymore. I donâ€™t see a point in anything... I sleep and wake up and I feel so stuck and I donâ€™t want to be here. I donâ€™t want to be anywhere. I think of killing myself most days. I know I wonâ€™t be here for much longer. I always knew I would die at a young age. I canâ€™t do this anymore, I just want it to stop.
