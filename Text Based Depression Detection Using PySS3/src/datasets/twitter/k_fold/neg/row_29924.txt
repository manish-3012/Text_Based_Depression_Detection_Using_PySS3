I'm not good enough for anybodyI don't eat
I don't sleep
I don't drink
I don't dream
I live my life in such disarray
That maybe MAYBE I'll be gone one day
Such beautiful flowers
The bright big sun
All laugh at me crowding
The things I've done
I won't be good enough
I know I won't
I'm not a 10
So stop saying the word "hope"
I know I deserve it
I know I do
I'm not good enough
For me or for you
