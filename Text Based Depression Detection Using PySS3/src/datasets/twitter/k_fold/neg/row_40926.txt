Posted this on r/mental health, but it seems to be dead. I want to reach out discreetly but Iâ€™m terrified of talking about it because it seems so trivial. So many people have worse problems than me and I should be happy.Iâ€™m suffering from suicidal thoughts and actions and it hurts so fucking much and Iâ€™m sick of the pain. Completely unmotivated and beat down, my grades are showing it, my energy at work is showing it, and I overall am just so tired of acting okay when all I want to do is sleep forever. So Iâ€™m making this last ditch effort to get some help but Iâ€™m fucking terrified of talking to people about it in real life and I really donâ€™t think itâ€™s going to help. 

If it helps I live on the east coast in the USA and Iâ€™m 18, and Iâ€™m not sure if I have insurance. Some of my family knows but most do not, and Iâ€™d like to keep it quiet.

I just canâ€™t take the pain anymore. Not a day has passed in 2 years that I havenâ€™t thought about suicide and self harm and Iâ€™m literally burnt out.
