Closer than I've ever been before.I am a monumental fuck up. From age 16 until 26 I was a drug addict. I pushed any friend that tried to help me or wanted to keep me grounded in reality away and embraced the ones who facilitated me getting high. Also during this period of time, from about 19-25 I found myself taking care of my ailing mother and complete ignoring myself (other than to get my fix, of course). COPD and lung cancer ravaged her for a long time, and I would sit high as a kite and do whatever I could for her because there was no one else to help. In my mind I thought "when her suffering ends, maybe mine will too." And I really believed this to some degree.

When she finally passed I remained addicted, depressed (even more so as one of my best friends died during this time) and isolated for about one more year, maybe a year and a half. Then I got extremely sick and was so miserable that I just decided to give everything up while I was sick. And it somehow it worked for me. I've been clean and sober from opiates, opiate substitutes, cocaine, crack, cigarettes, marijuana, and anything else that I found myself abusing for five years now (in December).

Which is good and all, but now I do not know what to do with myself and a hopeless feeling like one I've never felt before is slowly crushing me. I haven't been officially employed for more than a decade. I did not go to college. I want to go, but I have no idea where to start and have no one to talk about this with and feel like even if I did I would just breakdown.

I look at my peers and everyone is happy with a family and a career and then here I am, with nothing to show but the damage I've done to my body with my horrible decisions. I truly feel like maybe it would be best if I just "disappeared". Just went out one night to some remote area and blew my brains out. I've had this thought before, but as I keep wasting time I just feel like it's a reasonable solution.
