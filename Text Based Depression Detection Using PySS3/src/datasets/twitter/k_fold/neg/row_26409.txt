Decided a TimeI'm gonna live until I turn 23 then I'm gonna end it. Life just isn't getting any better for me at this point. I'm so lonely, I don't have any friends, my family hates me and I'll never have a relationship. I've tried everything and am now stuck and there's nothing I can do. Not even sure why I'm hanging on another few months. Seriously I've given existence more time than anybody for life to start and I know since it hasn't by now it never will.
