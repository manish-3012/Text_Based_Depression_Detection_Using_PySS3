Spent the entire day completely aloneI love Christmas. Itâ€™s my favorite holiday. Today has been awful. Iâ€™ve been alone the whole day. Spoke to nobody, saw nobody, had no one to celebrate with, or exchange gifts with. I just donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m still here. Nobody cares. I reach out, I try. It just doesnâ€™t matter. I just donâ€™t matter to anyone.
