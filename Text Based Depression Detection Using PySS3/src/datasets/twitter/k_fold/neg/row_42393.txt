idk what to do anymorei try so hard for years and years and i can't deal with depression or my confusing mental state anymore. i have paranoid schizophrenia that isnt my issue mentally. I've been so depressed for years and struggled with suicidal thoughts as long as i can remember. I dropped out of high school in my final year because i became a complete failure. my brain seems to be deteriorating into mush now. I can barely understand basic sentences and I can barely hold a conversation. I've gone to the hospital and that barely helped. I've tried 6 antidepressants and mixes of them together or without and nothing has helped. My psychiatrist just doubled my wellbutrin and switched it to XL now but nothing helps. i cry every night now and suicide really seems like it will help. I've seen all the doctors, I go to a therapist, but nothing helps me anymore i'm so desperate i dont think anyone understand how desperate i am. I just want to be happy. i'm not going to kill myself any time soon but i don't know what else to do. i'm just trying to find any assistance in my life i'm sorry about all the bad grammar and stuff i can't type and cry
