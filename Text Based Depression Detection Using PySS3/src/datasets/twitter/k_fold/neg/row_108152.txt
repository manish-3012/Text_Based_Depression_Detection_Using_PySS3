I am (very likely) mentally ill but if anyone found out I would probably kill myself immediately.I've never been diagnosed with anything and will not attempt to diagnose myself, but I often feel very depressed, though sometimes I am content or even excessively happy. I'm sixteen, so this could just be teenage mood swings. 

Anyway. I have cut myself (in areas hidden by clothing), but ultimately the need to not get caught overpowered the urge to cut (I am very close with my friends and we are all quite comfortable with our bodies, so it's extremely hard to hide scars from them). I have also tried starving myself, but this is also really hard to hide. I think about suicide a lot, but no method seems failproof to me, and I *really* don't want to end up brain-damaged. 

I think I need help, but there is no way I can tell anyone. One time, my teacher told me I looked "not my usual self" and asked if I was okay. I smiled, said I was tired, and immediately began planning my suicide. I made two different plans, both of which were flawed and (obviously) never ended up being executed. However, if someone were to ask, "Are you having thoughts of suicide?" or "Have you been self-harming?" it would put me into such a panicked state that I actually would execute one of my plans. Similarly, if I tried to ask for help, I would quickly regret it and do the same thing.

So you see, I'm kinda stuck. Also, I can't think of why this would be relevant but I am very happy at the moment; that is the only reason I can type a coherent thought about my mental state.
