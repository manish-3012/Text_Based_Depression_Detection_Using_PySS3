will probably suicide eventually...just idk a way to say this "aloud" I guess, but yeah I'm pretty sure I'll do it one day. I'm trans, 22y/old, dmab // nonbinary, but too scared to transition in any way. Mostly because I'm nonbinary. It seems so impossible to transition to a state of nonbinary, when my body type is so obvious, and hormones are basically going to give me a "girl" body, and if I don't start hrt, my body is just going to keep becoming more and more "masculine." I feel like I'd either have to live as a "male" or as a "female," and I hate that so much agency is is taken from me.  
Further, I'm Christian, so basically if I do anything like that I'll probably go to hell. As if I'm not already on the way. Not bashing Christianity, just saying. 
Basically, I feel like, from what I've read, suicide can be forgiven, but being trans, and not straight, can't. So, I might as well off myself now, than live a life of accumulating sins.
I'm seeing a great therapist too, and for free even, and he's helped me get all the information about how to start hrt, and I think my insurance is good even too, but I just don't have the confidence to start it. 
So yeah, I can't talk to persons in my life about this so here I am, just wanted to say, pseudo-aloud, that I want too, and plan to kill myself some day..
