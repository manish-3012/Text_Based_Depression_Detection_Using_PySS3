I'm so numb...I'm getting tired of this apathetic existential depression. I feel like its not even actual depression sometimes. I don't have the energy to get out of bed and everything is meaningless, yet I'm not suffering enough to want to end it immediately, but I feel like I will eventually. Everything is just so gray.
