DrowningI'm trying hard not to cry, because if I start I know it will be hours before I stop. Biting the inside of my cheeks as hard as I can, hoping that the pain will shock me from these thoughts and stall the tears. Feeling like an utter failure when, despite my every effort, the tears do come. They always do. And it's messy and painful and stings my cheeks as they roll down. I feel myself spiralling out of control. Drowning beneath the waves as they keep crashing down on me. There's no relief, no up or down, No logic, no sense, just the searing raw pain in my chest as I gasp for air and the feeling that I failed. Again.

I have lost the last shred of hope and I don't know how to be okay anymore. I don't think I even want to be okay. I'm tired of fighting just to survive. I just want to sleep, no dreams, no waking.
