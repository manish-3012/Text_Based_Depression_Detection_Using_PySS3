I want 2020 to end already2019 was just one of the most shitty years of my life. I cried almost every single night, I felt more lonely than ever, I dropped out of University for the second time, I wasn't able to get professional help, I can't be with the person I love and I feel like such person has neglected me for most of the year, and the cherry on top was that I started to get more recurrent suicidal thoughts. 

A few hours ago while walking home from work, I started crying, my mom was by my side, she asked me if I wasn't feeling well, so I nodded, then she asked me if I was crying because of my partner, and I shaked my head, then the last thing she told me was that she didn't want me to cry all night. 

I'm done with crying, I'm so done with having this feeling of unworthiness, I don't want to keep dreaming just so I can destroy my own dreams, I don't want to be a burden for my parents and the person whom I love.

I wanted to do so many things in life, but now I just want to quit to everything. 

My birthday is in 10 days, all I have done during my time alive is being a nobody and a parasite to everyone around me.

I don't have friends, my family is disappointed on me, I can't do anything right, so what's the point to keep being alive? 

Although I must say that the only ones have prevented me from commiting suicide are my cats, cause it makes me uneasy the thought of me not being there to take care of them.

I don't know if I'll make a decision anytime soon, but all I want is for this year to be over.
