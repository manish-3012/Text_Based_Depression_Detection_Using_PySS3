I think the biggest tragedy of this place is that there are more than 100K of us hereI bet for a majority of us, this is the only help we'll ever get.  The system is absolutely fucked up man.  There is so much suffering going on in the world and the people in power just shrug their shoulders and jerk themselves off some more.   I hope civilization continues, and I hope that the historians of the future are just as cold and ruthless when remembering this era of history as the people currently ruling it.   I hope there's studies about us, and that the practices of today are admonished like the barbaric practices of the past.   We haven't evolved at all, all we have now is technology to howl into the void.  As a collective, we fail on every single level.  We've never left the late 1800s.  The only difference between now and then are cars and goods delivery.   We're still barbaric, we're still rugged individuals instead of a society.   We have completely squandered everything we learned coming out of WWII.   What sucks is that we could all realize this, but it's too late to change course. 

America is a pug stie.  The biggest one on this whole damn planet.   It didn't used to be that way, but it is now.   Id call out for help, but no one answers.  You're completely alone in this universe.  Even if you find someone truly special, they'll just be ripped away from you, or vice versa.   How can one be happy here
