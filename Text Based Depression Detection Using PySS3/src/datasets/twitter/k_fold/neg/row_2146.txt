My friend needs helpA couple of friends of mine both have exact dates on when to kill themselves. One has her date set a few years down the line, so I'm not as worried as she will change. The other, though, has a few days planned spread about this month. The first one is this Friday, only three days away. She has only told two people about this, me being one of them and she really wants to let other people know about this, but she's afraid that they would probably be too scared to know what to do. She just told me today that if I see her on Monday, then she would have made it through the first day. 
I am scared. I do want to help her. I tried to tell her things such as "You made it through for this long, you can make it through this month" and "You can make it, I know you can" but I don't even know if that helped. She knows I'm trying to help, but I still don't think I'm doing enough to help.
If anyone has any ideas, that would be amazing.
