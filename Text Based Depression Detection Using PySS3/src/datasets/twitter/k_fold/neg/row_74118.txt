Thinking about giving myself one more yearLike the title says just really down and was waiting till my birthday to post this but may give myself a year or sooner to live . 28 feel like my life's going no where , friends or what little I have barely hang out anymore , family doesn't really talk much , don't get to see my nephew much (still young pretty sure he wouldn't notice I'm gone)since my brother sucks , been about a year since my girlfriend left me and was right after my birthday as well ( isn't that some sh), not having luck finding new work and the job I have currently is not all that great maybe work twice a week. Typing this up as I get ready to work holding back tears or emotions I guess. Just tired of it all
