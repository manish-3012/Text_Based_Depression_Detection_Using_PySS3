The stupidest reason for suicideI can't afford to buy music, so I have to steal it, and it makes me feel guilty. My own guitar tunes are inspired by stolen music as well. I'm designing an amplifier (can't afford one so have to do the DIY thing) and listening to stolen FLACs while tweaking the circuit. The amp will always remind me of stealing.

I don't play video games or watch movies, so at least I don't have to pirate that. I stream Adult Swim and some other channels (super crappy quality, but still illegal). 

It's not the only reason. I never leave the house (maybe once a year) or talk to people so loneliness takes its toll, but it's manageable. Stealing is not.
