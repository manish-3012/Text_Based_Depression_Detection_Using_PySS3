There's nothing. Hearing the wind blowing reminds me of this.Just sitting in my car
Less than a mile away from "home"
Am I really alone?
Listening to the wind blow
Headphone on music on LOW
So I can hear the earth speak to me
leaves blowing against the pavement triggering the house porch lights.. Catching my eye.. Awakening me from this trance of Suicidal ideation
I'm a character though in a play in my mind
Where I'm the victim.. But only because I hate myself so 
So lets begin at the top
Am I waking you up?
Change your mind because I wasn't thinking right
