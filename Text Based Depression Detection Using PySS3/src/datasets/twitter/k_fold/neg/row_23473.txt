I need help...My depression started around 3 months ago and has been on and off recently. The reasons i want to kill myself change almost every week, and recently they have been getting dumber. At first it was over my apearnce, next is about how im failure, and now its just that i want a girlfriend. I feel like no cool boys, or even nerdy girls even like me. I used to really want to loose my virginity, but now i just want someone to cuddle with. My depression gets worse every month and i really need help. If any of my IRL friends some how see this, please dont talk about it.
