I hate myselfI'm not sure what to do anymore. I've gotten so sick of living that I've actually started zoning out and forgetting what goes on. All I know is that I'm miserable - I just don't know the details.

I hate my family. Mostly just immediate: Mom, Dad &amp; Brother. You can tell my parents just put up with me, and my brother hates me. I guess it just sucks that the people you'd think are kind of forced to like you just don't, and you don't understand why.

Then there's my husbands family. I feel constantly judge by them, even though they're no better. I hate them. They hate me too, but I guess they've learned to put up with me for my husbands sake.

Then there's me, the person I hate most of all. I'm a bitch and very aware, yet I seem to be unable to control it. I hurt my husband daily. Sometimes I notice, other days he suffers in silence. We've been intimate a handful of times since our daughter was born - 3 months ago. And it's not like we're an older couple - 20 &amp; 22.

I can't be touched, held. So there's no cuddling. I hate kissing some days, and the thought of sex is very draining. 

I hate myself. I don't want to be me anymore. I hate my life. The same routine, and even days that get new surroundings I can't remember the details.

I miss my husband when he's gone, but want him gone when he's here.

I'm a horrible human being. I know I should be killed off.

I cry daily. I think about dying daily. Some hope to win the lottery, I hope to be murdered walking down the street.

I'm so depressed. I hate myself.
