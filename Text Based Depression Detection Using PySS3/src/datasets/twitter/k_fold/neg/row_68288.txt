I'm down, way down...Now I'm starting to pull those that care about me down. I'm trying to get help but I don't believe it will make any significant changes. I'm not 3ven sure why I'm doing it. I don't know why I do anything I do anymore. Nothing in my life is going to get any better. It hurts more knowing I'm bringing others down. I'm just fucking lost and I don't see things getting better.
