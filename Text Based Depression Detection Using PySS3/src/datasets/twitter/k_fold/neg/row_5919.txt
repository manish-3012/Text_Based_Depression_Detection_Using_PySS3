My life is great, I'm just not interested in itI am an eighteen year old attractive boy who graduated early from high school and is now going to community college. My home life is great. My parents got together at a young age and started an adventure company together so from a young age I was living the life; playing outside everyday either rock climbing, boating, or back packing. My mother is from Sweden, so just about every other year I travel abroad and visit my family in Europe. I am Intelligent; I get a's in all of my classes with little or no effort, and I learn things five times faster than everyone around me, and I am currently fluent in three languages and four instruments. My future is bright; I have three different jobs currently lined up that I'm interested in (one of which is in Sweden). the only bad things that have happened to me are that my sister killed herself four years ago (at the age that I am now), but I didn't really care, and I was chronically ill for five years in my youth, but that didn't bother me that much either. 

My point is that I shouldn't want to die, I should love life, but I don't. I hate the fact that all we really have is the moment and our memories of the past. That all that we're going to have before we die is a ton of memories and then we're gone. the only thing that I really want is absolute peace, to loose all consciousness and not have to think about anything or do anything ever again. I just don't want life.

This isn't something that I want to happen right now, but I'm sure its going to happen in the next three years

P.S. My psychologist says that I'm basically a psychopath with reduced empathy, but otherwise I'm completely normal. I think that I'm a very kind person; I volunteer every other weekend at the church, I give to my friends whenever they need something, and I try to be as selfless as possible 

Can you tell me why I should live?
