Anyone feel like they would be less likely to kill themselves if they had more money and lived somewhere better?Much of my suicidal ideation is linked to trauma, loneliness, and poverty. I imagine if I lived somewhere that was safe, if I was able to get a job that paid enough to move out mom's house, and if I was in an environment where I had community, I wouldn't have to shoot myself.
