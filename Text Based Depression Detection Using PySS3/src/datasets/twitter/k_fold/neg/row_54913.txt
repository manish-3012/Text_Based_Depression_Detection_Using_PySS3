Want to goAt best friends place. Wanting to wait til they go to sleep and leave. Was raped March 5th tried therapy haven't managed to be home with my husband since even though it's not his fault. Not anyones fault. But cant seem to recover. Have enough combos of meds to end all the shit I've put everyone through. Only regret is that I didn't do it sooner so i wouldnt be affecting anyone.
