Just not sureHey guys, I have been trying to type this out for some time, here is my story

Last year my father passed away due to suicide and I discovered him, I didnâ€™t really realise the impact and bond my dad had with me till he was gone, Life hasnâ€™t really been the same for me besides iâ€™ve started to get really active and stay busy, i feel like the only reason i stay busy is to keep me from doing dumb stuff, I have my future and everything planned out and iâ€™m involved in some really great communities/groups irl but my depression kinda swings, sometimes itâ€™s here sometimes itâ€™s gone sometime it just appears out of nowhere and hits me like a truck and i really want to end it, 

honestly i must say though that the only thing stopping me is my family, I love them so much and I worry what they would do if i took my life as well, I have so many great ambitions in life but yet sometimes i just feel like fuck it life sucks and itâ€™s not much better anyways regardless of if depression is here or not, im really scared to go talk to a doctor about depression because i have to big of a pride for myself and donâ€™t want to be known as the kid with depression and what not because i would hate for people to think differently of me, nobody really listens anyways when i talk about it, I kinda feel like im robin Williams, always making everyone else happy and im constantly taking care of my friends and making sure they are fine but i donâ€™t get that same treatment back, all my friends are fake, never inviting me to anything but when i talk about not having friends everyone wants to hop on the bandwagon that their my friend

(I think i have add and adhd because i constantly loose track of my thoughts but iâ€™ve never been able to get these things tested so sorry if this seems kinda like rambling iâ€™ve literally never had anyone to talk to about this and i donâ€™t know how much longer i can take it)

like i said before the only thing stopping me is my family, I kinda put myself in a position where i have dangerous jobs planned out that way if i die itâ€™ll seem like i died doing something brave when in reality i was hoping for it in the beginning, I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore because like i said i feel like iâ€™m robin Williams, always making others happy and making sure they are fine but the pain hides behind my smile, just wish people could understand what actually goes through my head without judgment from others or my family, why the fuck is all this so hard, if you have any questions if this didnâ€™t make sense just ask, i would like to talk to some of yâ€™all because reddit seems like a good place to relieve real world problems when real people wonâ€™t listen in front of you.
