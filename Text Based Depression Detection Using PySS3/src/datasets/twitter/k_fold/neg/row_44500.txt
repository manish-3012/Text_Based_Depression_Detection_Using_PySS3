God gave them everything.My aunt doesnâ€™t believe in my depression diagnosis. She thinks that because I didnâ€™t have as bad of a life as her (and sheâ€™s not depressed) that I just need to â€œtoughen up.â€ Strangely enough my dad is her brother and we have virtually the same symptoms and actions. It couldnâ€™t be more obvious that itâ€™s a genetic thing and that she was blessed without a predisposition to depression/suicidal thoughts.

My best friend also was diagnosed with depression (or possible Bipolar disorder, Iâ€™m not entirely sure) and she has a fuckton of family support, hell, even more *from* my aunt! Iâ€™m happy that sheâ€™s doing fine from what I can tell and Iâ€™m always happy to help, but when you live your whole life jealous that your younger best friend is more gifted than you in the looks and social department, adding â€œfamily supportâ€ to the long list of things sheâ€™s better at than me... stings bad.

My boyfriend is amazing. Iâ€™ve never been with someone so awesome. However, I see how loving and accepting his family is; they accepted his asbergers diagnosis, talk to him with respect, and are overall great people to be around, and I just wish I had the same. I donâ€™t believe that heâ€™s depressed but he does have generalized anxiety. Regardless, heâ€™s so confident in himself and what he does that itâ€™s almost intimidating. I honestly feel bad because Iâ€™m such a trainwreck and he doesnâ€™t deserve that. 

I canâ€™t help but feel, like, irreversibly crazy and alone. Iâ€™ve trapped myself in my room for the last four hours not knowing what else to do and Iâ€™m anxious and depressed with nowhere to turn. My uncle is home and I donâ€™t even know if he knowâ€™s Iâ€™m home. At least I did the dishes, though.
