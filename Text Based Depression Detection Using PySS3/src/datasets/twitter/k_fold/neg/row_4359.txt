I'm addicted to the zen from accepting deathI'm 22 this year. 

At the start of the year, I went to a therapist secretly to figure out why I have suicidal thoughts despite not having crippling problems. 

In short, I've never learnt to sit with discomfort. It stresses me out, makes me want to run away, want to kill myself. Doesn't matter how big or trivial it is, I want the unpleasantness to end. 

At 20 and 21 years old, there was one day in each year I was dedicated to kill myself. The former I had planned for half a year, to die on my 20th birthday, the latter, maybe a week of resolve. 

Each time, I felt zen. I felt no sadness nor happiness, but somehow I felt content. The emptiness actually made me think I could continue living a little while, because without the discomfort I'm actually in an alright position. 

But now I'm suffering again. Without going into details, it's always regarding my family. I made a deal with myself that if my parents ever hint at regretting my birth again (the first was when I was 11, the second when I was 19), I'll just end their misery by ending my life.

The time has come. A little rushed cause she just said it hours ago, but slowly the zen is flowing through me. It had to be quick because I've just moved back home from studying overseas, so while I regret not being able to pay them back, I hope to stop wasting their expenses any further.

I haven't updated my suicide note from last year but I'll do it when I finally stop tearing and feel peace. 

I can't wait.
