one day soonknift and rope.
in blood it soak.
take away.
there is no hope.
stair at wall.
blindly alone.
there no hope.
when i realized that this inst me.
but still this my reality.
i expect no one to care at all.
cause no body ever calls.

afriad to see.
and one day soon
i shall be free.
i will be free.

so i sit here on my own.
cause no body eveing care no more.
try to find work but their no hope.
everyone better then me.

so one day soon.
I will face you
no longer be 
afriad to see.
and one day soon
i shall be free.
i will be free.

no one gonna stop me.
no one gonna help me.
no one gonna find me.
no one gonna save me.
no one gonna know me.
no one gonna find me.

so one day soon.
I will face you

afriad to see.
and one day soon
i shall be free.
i will be free.
