Seriously. Why even bother?Nothing excites me anymore. Nothing. I used to be excited about games. About traveling. Girls. Enough to get me up and active somewhat. But it seems as though the last few years I've just been going downhill and I've hit rock bottom. Nothing I used to like is appealing. Nothing new seems worth doing at all. My friends don't really care to talk to me, and honestly I can't blame them. I've been in such a rut for so long. I don't really bring anything to the table anymore. And I've been a pretty bad friend to some of them in other ways. I just don't know how to deal with people.

I'm really bad at expressing my emotions. I'm not ashamed or anything like that, I just find it next to impossible to put into words what I'm feeling. Empty. Meaningless. Those words come to mind. I feel like I lack substance. I just have nothing to offer anyone including myself.

I'm at a random hotel in Atlanta. I'm about to start drinking until I pass out because being out of my mind is the only thing I still enjoy.

I don't have the will to kill myself, but I won't deny that I want to die.
