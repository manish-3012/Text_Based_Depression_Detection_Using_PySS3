so, apparently I'm a c*nt according to some do-gooders around hereI have just been through what was one of the worst Christmas in years, because regardless of the company I spent it with it wasn't enough to brush the feelings of loneliness at the thought of my dead older brother and my grandmother and a parent I don't speak to anymore. Add a fair dash of self-loathsome and an unexisting self-esteem that have been feeding a depression that have been around for longer than some of the people posting here have been alive, and you have me.  


I was planning on killing myself - still am. Apparently there's a lot you can do with a belt and a door - and I find it amazing the sheer amount of times I've been called a cunt by completely anonymous strangers who are presumably good samaritans, on these forums, due to my less than friendly demeanor towards imbecility.  


I'm not looking for pity or sympathy, as I really can't do shit with either, specially from people who don't know me and will likely won't have anything original to add to this discussion. However I feel that some people mingling around here would do well to stoop out of their high horses and reconsider whether they should be here espousing nonsense to people who are depressed and considering ending their lives. And the mods could do with some sanitation of said people.  


Thank you :)
