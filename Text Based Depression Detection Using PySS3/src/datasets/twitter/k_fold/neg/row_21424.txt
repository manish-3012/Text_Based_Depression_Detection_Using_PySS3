3rd time attempting suicide, hopefully I follow through this timeIf you want to see my whole life story then scroll down my profile page. I hope my parents find that page after I die so they can understand that there is nothing they could have done to stop me from swallowing 30 lexapro pills. Trust me if you heard my whole life story you would probably just tell me to quit life already anyways. Never had a friend, Never had a person to talk to, Never had someone to relate to who was going through what I've been going through, Never will be even the slightest of happy ever again, Never will appreciate life like the rest of you, Never will understand why I have to keep living when I feel disgusting and deprived of everything within. I'm thinking about calling a suicide hotline to come and look at my dead body so my parents won't have to be the first ones to see my inevitable and deserving corpse. I don't want anyone to stop me, I've already been through that when I tried to jump out in front of a vehicle and got placed in a mental ward for 2 weeks. My parents don't even ask me if I'm suicidal, they don't even think I'm suicidal at all, they think I'm doing this all just for attention, a part of me just wants to end it all to show them that I wasn't kidding around when I say I'm going to kill myself I'll surely and gladly do it and you'll have to live the rest of your life knowing that. I just hope 30 lexapro pills will be enough to end me. I hope someday my parents find these notes on reddit so they can have some closure. Nothing will stop me this time, not even the police, I'll make sure I have a knife by my side so they assume me as a threat and shoot me if thats how it has to end.
