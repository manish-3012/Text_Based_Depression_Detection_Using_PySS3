Tried to commit suicide in 2014, thinking about it againI have bipolar and anxiety disorders. I am in university for math and can't handle exam stress. After 5 years of studying, I'm only done 23 out of 40 courses. I haven't failed a course, but I probably will fail cs this term - exam is today and after studying I don't "get it" (it's a useless course too). If I can't get a degree, I have no future and I will never ever get a degree at this rate. My grades are shit too (68 average).
