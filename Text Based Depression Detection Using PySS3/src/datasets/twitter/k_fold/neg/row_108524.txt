I feel disappointed whenever I wake up in the morning like "Oh, I wasn't taken in my sleep yet?"It's the same brutal cycle every single day. I'd cry myself to sleep wishing that the gods would end my suffering and take me in my sleep because I want a painless and quick death. But every morning I wake up, I immediately feel disappointed because it's going to be another day of trying to get through this shit thinking that I have my life together when I clearly don't. I want to end everything now because it's all just pointless. There's no sense in waking up anymore. Fuck this shit.
