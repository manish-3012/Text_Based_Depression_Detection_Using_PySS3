I don't want to live to be 20My birthday is in just over a week, and I always thought I would be feeling better by then. I've really been trying in the past few years, especially the past 6 months, but I know at this point I'm not going to achieve what I want to. I'm not unhappy about it, I'm proud of the things I accomplished in my life, just a bit disappointed about the time I lost while trying to get better. I've already been admitted to the hospital, I don't want to go back. I know I'm only 19, I know some people think it's a waste of a life, but I don't believe I'll do any good with it. I've lost a lot of friends, I've been hurting my best friend, I feel like I've been emotionally manipulative, and it needs to stop. I'm content knowing I did what I could, and I don't want to hurt anymore. I've been trying to delay all of this by smoking weed heavily, but it's getting a bit unbearable. It's a relief knowing it will end soon.
