Messing up has made me suicidalI joined this story contest on tumblr and it distracted me for some time. Then, i found this blog i followed kept getting anon hate for being gay. At first i was fine, then he said something that made me annoyed and I sent hate spam to his inbox under ask, something about get raped by a horses dick and you retarded homo. He laughed it off and that was the end of it. Next thing i know, the following morning, i am banned from the blogs. Turns out they found out. I was so angry and send angry spam messages to their blogs. I talked to the guy and he was upset about it, and now i realized that I messed up. I didn't think it would be a big deal. Now i feel so depressed and suicidal. I cried so much I coldn't sleep. I just feel so alone, stupid and demented. I make the wrong choices all the time and I fuck up.They are saying i as responsible for the anon hate for three days. but it wasn't me. I  just only three to him and one to two of his friends. I think he made up the whole fight for sympathy. I wasn't the only anon. Now my mother notices that I am sad, and she asks what is wrong, I can't tell her.she knows I have been struggling with depression and all she says get over it, you will be strong and u have to fight. I am so fucking sick of her, I am stuck in Kuwait,i have no friends, in a job i hate and with no goals. and what i do have, I keep screwing, and I am so sick of her bullshit. I keep making the same mistake again and again, doing something impulsive for attention and then getting hit for it. I lost deviantart, subreddit, facebook,utube and now tumblr accounts. I so fed up of exsisting, I tried cutting yesterday, couldn't make it deep enough. I want to end my life to be free of my mistakes.
