It's been really, really... really difficult for me to keep on goingDISCLAIMER: This might be a lengthy post and a bit childish... Please bear with me.

I had been suffering from depression for the past 5-6 years and year by year it's just getting worse and worse and worse.

I started my sophomore year of engineering couple of months back and knowing that my 2nd semester was really hell and had pushed me through the limit and even further than that and I had even tried committing suicide which I failed, I wasn't expecting anything good out of 2nd year at all.

1st week went okay and then suddenly next week I got transferred from my batch to a better batch, even though the difference between them is minimal. I left all my friends, people who gave me hope to continue on, and join that batch and it's been really really tough not feeling lonely...

I just kept pushing away people who I cared about and who cared about me and even those friends completely and the burden of college is super hard to cope with too... I love engineering but it's really really hard for me to move forward like this. I just want to end this pain. I just don't wanna keep on going on like this. I just don't wanna be alive anymore. I just want to give up. I just want to run away from life.

Fuck this shit, being buried 6 feet deep is the best solution I can only see.
