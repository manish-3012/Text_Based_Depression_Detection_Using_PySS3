Idk why im still hereEveryday I ask myself "why am I still alive? I'm just a burden to everyone". On one hand,  I don't want to kill myself, but on the other, I do. Im tired of everything and everyone. I really don't know what to do other than ending it all. I want to go through with it so badly but there's something keeping me from doing it. I wish there wasn't something keeping me from ending it. Idk how much longer I can go on. Eventually im gonna ignore what's keeping me from ending it
