I canâ€™t get therapy.Iâ€™ve been depressed and suicidal for about five years now (I just turned 17), and I have a lot of issues caused by past traumatic events. Iâ€™m in a really tough place right now, and I really want to get out of it. My parents donâ€™t give a fuck about me. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t give a fuck about me. My only friends donâ€™t give a fuck about me. Nobody here cares about me. Iâ€™m homeschooled, by the way, so I canâ€™t just â€œgo to school and meet new people.â€ I am NOT going back to public school. Theyâ€™re the reason Iâ€™m the way I am now. I need help. I need to fix my problems, but I canâ€™t do it on my own. I need professional help, like everyoneâ€™s been telling me I need for the last five years. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t have insurance. If my parents see me crying or if I tell them or show any signs of me being upset they get really mad and yell at me cause â€œI have no reason to be upset.â€ They only think that because they donâ€™t know a single thing about my life. They donâ€™t know the reason why I wanted to be homeschooled so bad (I basically got raped by my ex, and he got away with it. The whole school bullied me and called me a liar.) My parents donâ€™t even know my favorite color. My dad is always at work or asleep, and my mom is a fucking bitch. She is always out cheating on my dad with younger, married white men. I include white because sheâ€™s racist and will not even LOOK at anyone of another race. Not even her own. Even if sheâ€™s home, if I ever try to talk to her she gets extremely mad at me because â€œsheâ€™s on Facebook.â€ No matter what it is I have to say to her.
Not only do my parents not want to help me, even if they did, we have no money. Weâ€™re really close to losing our house right now, so I have to GIVE UP MY ROOM AND SLEEP WITH MY MOTHER so that we can rent out my room and still keep the house. That is the LAST thing I want to do. I wish I could be older and have money so I could move the fuck out.
I am trying to get a job, but I know that until I get help, this will never work out. Iâ€™ve already been rejected three times.

I could go on and on and on and on about my problems, but that will get me nowhere. What I came here to do is ask for help. I can not afford therapy, and Iâ€™ve looked online for some sort of online therapy, and theyâ€™ve said I need face-to-face therapy and that online counseling will not work for my issues. I canâ€™t afford therapy, and my parents will not do anything to try and take me.  I need help. Please. Iâ€™m suffering so much. My heart canâ€™t take the pain much longer. I know itâ€™s going to just stop one day.
