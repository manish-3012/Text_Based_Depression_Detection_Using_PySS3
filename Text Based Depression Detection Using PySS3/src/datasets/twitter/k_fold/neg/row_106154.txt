20 year old male just weird to think of myself having suicidal thoughtsI'm 20 and I started having thoughts of killing myself when I was like 18. It really like freaked me out when I noticed what I was doing. I was mad for some reason I can't remember and I just thought about taking a handgun and shooting myself in my truck. I had the same thought for the next two years pretty frequently. After getting a good job and a nice truck I get mad and quit my job. The thought of killing my self came back. I got a job in another factory and hated my job, hated the people I worked with, hated everything in my life including myself, and I hated that I quit a really good job. I was depressed and still am tbh but at that job I had the same thought everyday, I thought about taking a gun in front of everyone in that plant and blowing my brains out. I guess as a last fuck you to those people to scar them for life. Now the thought of just dieing randomly is very pleasing to me and sometimes I wish for this. I guess I'm lonely and depressed. Idk sorry for rambling y'all just feels better to get it off my chest I guess.
