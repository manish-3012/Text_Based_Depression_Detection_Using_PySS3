HelpApologies Iâ€™m on a mobile.


Iâ€™m 32 year old female, with numerous overdoses, an inpatient admissions to psychiatric hospitals. Been for awhile With the help of, sertraline, tonight I just have this overwhelming urge to take everything I have... and end it. Usually Iâ€™d feel bad about the thought but I donâ€™t now.... It almost feels like itâ€™s my time??
