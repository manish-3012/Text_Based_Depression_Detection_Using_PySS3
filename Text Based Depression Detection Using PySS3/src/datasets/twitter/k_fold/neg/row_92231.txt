I feel like dying....Recently I've been doing too much things I regret and I want to stop and Im trying my best, but as soon as I feel like i did something good I fail at it and it goes worse than expected...even up to the point I heard my parents talking about divorce and just straight up abandoning me. I really wanna leave this world and i also wanna stay here....i dunno what i should do and im stressed as fuck
