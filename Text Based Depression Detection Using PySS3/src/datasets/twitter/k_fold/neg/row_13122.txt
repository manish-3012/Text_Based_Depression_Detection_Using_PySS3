I just need to open upI'm a lurker on reddit. I don't even know why I'm posting this. I'm so lonely and depressed. I'm very close to my brother and I have a few pretty close friends but I feel like I can't completely open up to them. They're always there for me and they know my situation, but I feel like if I told them how often I feel suicidal and what I really think, they'd just call 911 out of concern. I just feel so alone and so horrible about myself, my life, my future. I feel like a joke because my only out is drawing with crayons lol. I feel like a joke because I'm relying on the internet. But reading some replies, you guys seem to be such caring people. I'm just sitting here, on a Friday night, lonely, listening to music. And a part of me doesn't want to get better. A part of me likes being depressed, likes having no motivation to do things. Because that way, if shit hits the fan in life, there's an out: suicide. A part of me doesn't want to get better and deal with all the shit in my life like a normal person would. But telling that to a close one would make them think "oh shit, they're in danger. better call 911, make them go through a week of inpatient, and come out feeling the same way." I know I don't want to be depressed either. I don't want to be alive. But even more so, I don't want to be dead. It is just a shitty place man. This is on mobile and I didn't even proof read. But anyways that's me. Thanks guys.
