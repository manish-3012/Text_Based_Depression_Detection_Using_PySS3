Nobody believes meI've tried to speak to my family, my psychiatrist, people I spoke to briefly under the crisis team, and I have said to them that I am suicidal and I feel like I'm waiting for the right time or something, I don't know. But I basically said I know it'll happen. And I've told them because there is still a part of me that wants things to be better, but I don't see how they can anymore. But I asked for their help and I've tried to help myself. Today alone I've had two people tell me I'm doing great when I haven't left my house in weeks or showered or barely left my bed. I just sit and plan and wait. People say to reach out for help, but I've lost count of how many times I have done so. It feels like there's no other option. I can't help myself anymore because I don't want to be here.
