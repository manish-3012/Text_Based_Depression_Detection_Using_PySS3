Im thinking of treatmentSo I'm now left with two choices, get help or get killed. I just want to know what kind of help should I seek? I live in Queens, NYC (USA). Ive been to a mental hospital before and it wasn't very good, poor facilities, and stuff don't really give a fk, and basically only drugged me to believe I'll  be alright.  I don't have health insurance and I'm almost homeless, any way I can get help? 

Some personal info: I'm 20/male, I have no family or friends to really help me, extremely isolated. Very poor physical health as well (underweight), and a list of problems... I wish I can find a place to help me both physically and mentally, not just drug me to imagine my life is good.
