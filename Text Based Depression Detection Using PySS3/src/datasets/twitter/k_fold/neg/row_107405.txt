Break up (again)I'm lost and I am feeling really depressed right now. There's no point for me to keep going.

The love of my life broke up with me 3 months ago and it hurts....

I don't know... I don't want to be with anyone else but I also don't want to get back together because I feel like she gave up on us without fighting. She broke up with me without trying to fix it first... However I know that she deserves better... That she now has the opportunity to find someone better. I guess I am not worth the wait 

I'ma piece of human trash anyway. She deserves better.
