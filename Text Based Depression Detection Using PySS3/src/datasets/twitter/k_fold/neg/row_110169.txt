It's almost been a month...Since I nearly tried to kill myself. I went out and bought everything I needed. I prepared mentally and physically. I even ordered take out because who cares about the cost when you're dead, right. 
I'd written suicide notes plenty of times before, never with the intention of following through, just to express my anguish. That time, I didn't even bother.

The reason, the thing that pushed me over the edge after battling depression for nearly 8 years, was pathetic. It was the fact that I had gotten my first and only taste of love. It felt like absolute bliss and then I had it cruelly ripped away from me. I fantasized that he would find out, that he would be miserable for how cruel and unkind he was to me. How he treated me like I was less than human but how I went crawling back to him because all I wanted was that feeling. And how he broke my heart not once, not twice, but three times.

I knew that I would always end up alone but he made me believe in a beautiful future I never thought I could have. He gave me hope. And hope is such a dangerous thing.

It's still painful knowing I'm going to die alone, and that no matter what I do, I cannot stop loving the person who strung me along and used me. My brain feels like an echo chamber of memories and I don't know how to get out, how to move on. I just need a moment of silence. Of some fucking peace.
