If I take 13 mg of klonopin and a ton of booze will I end up in the hospital, the morgue, or just late for work? Currently taking .5 a day.Everything is sort of falling apart. I donâ€™t like the idea of leaving but the reality of my situation is that things probably wonâ€™t get better because I just donâ€™t have the energy. My current, as far as I know, boyfriend, is upset at my lack of sex drive and my inability to change myself. I work 6am to afternoon to avoid crowds of people. I take lexapro because of anxiety. I have klonopin because a thyroid disorder often sends me into obsessive panic attacks. Iâ€™m on probation so I canâ€™t smoke weed to cure the sex drive issue (and many others) thatâ€™s mostly driven by other meds. I got a dui and my car is in the shop. So in addition to repairs and court fees I will have to deal with high risk insurance. I also cut my hours down at my retail job in June and lost my employer health insurance (by three shifts) for the next six months. Iâ€™ve applied other places but they are out of bus range. He just says to change. I normally donâ€™t respond well to men telling me to change. I know there are issues I need to fix but the reality is that there are things out of my control. 
Iâ€™m just getting tired of myself. Apparently I use others as a punching bag. I genuinely want things to be better but I have no money to help anyone except myself and thatâ€™s barely. 
I hate doctors. I hate feeling trapped. Being in a hospital would be hell. 
This solution seems like the easiest. But I have a limited supply of things that wouldnâ€™t send me into a very uncomfortable eyes and ears bleeding slumber. 
I know I only have a limited time of probation, I guess the issue is that I really thought this person was going to be by my side regardless of issue and now Iâ€™ve apparently turned into a pile of human garbage that drinks and watches cartoons all day. 
I canâ€™t apply to other jobs until I have my car. 
I wonâ€™t be able to pay for insurance for my car until I get another job. 
And I have a very low tolerance for people (without sex drive diminishing pills which is apparently a huge problem) and no college education and no way to pay for one. 
Iâ€™m upset I was asked to change myself repeatedly. 
Fuck it.
