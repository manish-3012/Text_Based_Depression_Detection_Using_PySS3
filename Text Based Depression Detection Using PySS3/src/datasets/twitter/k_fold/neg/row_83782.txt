Iâ€™m so disgusting and ugly and I donâ€™t deserve love, happiness or life.I will never be thin and attractive like everyone else. I will never be seen as lovable to anyone. No one will ever care about me and maybe I deserve that. I have no irl friends. I have no internet friends. Maybe itâ€™s all for a reason. Iâ€™m so disgusting and awful. I deserve to suffer and feel pain. I deserve to die and go to the deepest hottest pit of hell. I just want to look and feel normal like everyone else, but I canâ€™t. So I deserve to be reminded that I am garbage every second of everyday. I just want this to be over. I just want to leave. I want to die and go far far away from here. Far away from my body. I wonâ€™t ever be normal. I wonâ€™t ever be loved I wonâ€™t ever be normal. I just canâ€™t. Iâ€™m too pathetic and worthless. I deserve suffering and I deserve torture. I could never be normal. I will never be normal. 

Iâ€™m so sorry. I didnâ€™t mean to. But here I am.
