I have this sudden fantasy to blow all of my savings on going to on a trip and then dying afterwardsItâ€™s so hard to find joy in anything. Of course maybe it would backfire and make me want to live but then I wouldnâ€™t have money to survive. I donâ€™t know. I just want to find some kind of scrap of happiness but I canâ€™t think of anything and then my mind wanders to extremes. I do t know how to cope with this anymore
