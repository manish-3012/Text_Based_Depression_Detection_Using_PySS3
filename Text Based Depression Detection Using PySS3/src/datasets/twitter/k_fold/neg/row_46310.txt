Same tired old storyAlmost every day for the last few months I have sat and thought about suicide. The thoughts have not been good. My wife hates me. (My third wife, yup I'm a pretty solid failure at marriage). My kids hate me (I know all kids hate their parents at some point). I am broke as fuck supporting everyone and working two jobs. I'm just tired of it all. There is no point to this shit. 

The even more fucked up part is I know these are not normal thoughts. I work in an emergency room and have spent 20+ years as a paramedic. I see suicidal people all the time and have talked plenty of people out of it.  My best friend from high school shot himself. He was easily one of the ballsiest guys I've ever met. I've seen him do some amazingly heroic shit in fires. He couldn't handle his family life ending. 

I know all of the signs. I know I should seek help from a professional. Some people think I'm burning out,  I disagree. I still crave the action and excitement of being in the ER and I can't imagine doing anything else. I've spent my entire adult life helping people, sacrificing for everyone else, putting my family and sanity on the back burner to help other. Now, I know I need help and I have no idea where to go?  I sure as fuck can't go to my work and tell them. I'll end up out of the ER and somewhere shitty. I can't go to other hospitals, because my insurance won't cover it, and as stated before I'm broke as fuck. I can't tell my friends, I've always been the solid one that doesn't break down. 

So what do I do?  You know besides the obvious?
