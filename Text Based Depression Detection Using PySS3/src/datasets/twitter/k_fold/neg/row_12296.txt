how is this a life worth living?i have serious disfiguring acne that doesn't respond to any treatment. i've had it for 10 years now. for all that time i've been afraid to look at myself in the mirror. i was fired from my job about a year ago because of it and haven't left the house since. it really hit me hard, knowing i'm not even wanted at a workplace. i dont see my friends anymore and they have moved on. i am alone in this world and there's nothing i can do about it. why should i keep going?
