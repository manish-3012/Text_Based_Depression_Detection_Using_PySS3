How to be less introspective?I often find that my thoughts tend to dwell on myself, and that I'm almost constantly lost in my thoughts. This really hurts me in the social scene as I tend to keep to myself and keep quiet. It also affects other activities. I could be reading, playing a video game or watching a movie and my thoughts drift towards myself.

This changes, however, when I've been drinking. I do absolutely zero self-examination when drinking and I'd like to be in this state sober.

Any ideas?
