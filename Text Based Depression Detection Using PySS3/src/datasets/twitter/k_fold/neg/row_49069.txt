What to do when the only doctor in 50 miles tells you not to return?I live in a very rural area. One doctor and his crew here are the ones that runs the two hospitals in the area. There are 3 other psychiatrists but are not involved with the hospital at all. If I were to go get help it would be the one doctor who I mentioned that would treat me. 

A few years ago I was hospitalized when I was homeless and told they could not release me into the wild so find a place to go when I'm released but was given 0 way to find one as there's no newspapers or net access. This led to getting reamed by him and the hospital staff saying I was trying to live at the hospital because I ended up being there 7 days. I finally I had to lie and make up a place to go in order to be released and was caught in the lie. I was told never to return to the hospital. 

I'm seriously in need of help as I am frantic and seriously suicidal. If I was told not to return how could I ever get help? Even if I did just go to the hospital it would be that doctor and he wouldn't help me.
