I have everything but I still want to die.I have friends, a good family, no money problems. So why do I still want to leave this world and die. Knowing my death would hurt people close to me just isn't enough for me to keep on living.

I'm tired and I want to go. I don't want to live as myself anymore. Every day is just a reminder how disgusting and worthless I am. I hate the fact that I've tried twice already but failed every time. 
I think about death a lot and the idea calms me. I wish I would have nothing so it would be easier.
