Life afterHow do you carry on living past your suicide date? I had plans to end my life this coming Saturday 23rd March.
It feels weird because I still feel suicidal but I have decided I don't want to end my life this weekend. What I'm finding hard is life after Saturday. 

QHow do I wake up and carry on like normal knowing that I would have been dead? How do I talk to my family and friends like nothing has happened? How do I live if I wasn't planning on living that far, how do I live when I was going to be dead?
