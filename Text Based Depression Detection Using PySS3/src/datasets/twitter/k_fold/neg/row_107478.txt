Failure at 25.My whole life it feels as if I've been a failure...
In highschool I could never keep up,the teachers didn't care to help as they viewed me as the student who didn't care about my grades,its hard to do homework when you don't completely understand,and the tutoring system was garbage,just other students who'd rather use the tutoring system as an excuse to blow off class
After highschool,I barely graduated by the way,I decided forget working in a factory the rest of my life,I want to be a Marine!Well to cut down on writing,I tried to kill myself,I decided to swallow razor blades,which obviously didn't work.
Then afterwards it feels like my life is me just droning(my term for just working,eating,sleeping,maybe watch TV or play video games,but mostly the first three). After the Marines i found a good paying warehouse job,but I couldn't keep up,I struggled till I had a mental breakdown,they put me on a month suspension(no pay) I had to visit a psychiatrist once a week till the end of my suspension,the first one I liked she was kind and interested in helping me,and even asked the company for more time with me to help me out,the company decided to cut her loose,and sent me to a bellowing cow,that would scream at me till I gave her the answer she wanted. At that point I decided "fuck it, im garbage, I'm 19,I don't drive,I'm a lonely virgin and I'll probably die that way,and I always fuck things up,always!" So after the psychiatrist session,I went home,I put on my best suit,im talking clean shirt,vest,tie,jacket,and dress pants,and I loaded my 12 gauge shotgun,I loaded a slug shell,and I put that barrel in my mouth,and I pointed it at where I thought my brain stem was,I sighed as I pulled that trigger,I was hoping to see pitch blackness,I was hoping to be at peace,I only heard a click,it was a dud shell. Well a few years later all that has changed is I drive now and I live in my mom's basement.I constantly tear into myself mentally and emotionally for each mistake I have made in my life,past and present. Well here we are present day,my mom got me a job where she works,it's good pay,but hey once again I fuck things up for myself,so I tear into myself harder and harder,so today I decided its the day I die,I mean why not,I think about it at home,I think about it at work,I think about it when I'm driving between the two. So when I got home this morning,I took my shower,I ate a little,and I wrote my suicide note a second time,I pondered my way of ending it,and I decided I was going to hang myself,I took two belts,one to wrap around the beam,and the other for the job,I tied that knot real good,I leaned forward,and I bent my legs,I smiled as I did this,no more fuck ups,upset,no more dark thoughts,finally a quiet mind. Well let me say this the human body is fighter,I'm 6'4" 250lbs and I managed to jerk my way out of that leathery noose,next thing I know,I'm on the floor,my jaw,tongue,and teeth hurt,my elbows and knees hurt,and I have tears running down my cheeks,and my cat is licking my face. So I lay there gasping,trying to catch my breath,maybe an hour has passed,my neck burns and itches,and it hurts to swallow. 
So maybe next time,there's always next time.
