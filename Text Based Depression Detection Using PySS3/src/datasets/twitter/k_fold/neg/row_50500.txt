Got my first job recently. I thought it would make me happier, but I feel much worse.I feel like I'm always going to mess things up and that I'll always be a failure. I thought that'd change when I got my job, but it made it worse. Knowing that even getting this job is the most I'll ever achieve in life and that everything from here on out will just disappoint everyone just wrecks me. I can't even function in the world, so what is the point of existing? I don't have the courage to end it though, I wish I did. Wish that I could just do the right thing, just once. Really starting to think I'm always going to be stuck in this hole. It keep getting worse and I'm so tired of it.
