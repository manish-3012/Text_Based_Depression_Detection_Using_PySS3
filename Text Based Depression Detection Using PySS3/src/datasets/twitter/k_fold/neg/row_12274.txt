Im so ugly guys are going to treat me horribly the rest of my life?(21F)
[what I looked like in high school ](https://imgur.com/a/vZXqTpw)


I feel like I'm so disgustingly ugly I should be dead. I was treated like the ugliest girl in school and still feel that way as an adult. In high school, guys would say they would sleep with but not want to be seen with me? They would say I'm good enough to fuck but not date. That they wanted me for sex and nothing more. They called me a pig and said I looked 40

They would call me a gross whore and say I smell every day. They said I had a big nose and wrinkles. I just so ugly I'm scared to date again that guys would treat me this way. 

I worry now guys only treat me better because I look different. Was I that unattractive? What is so ugly about me that I was treated this way? Will, I ever look normal I feel I'm so ugly I looked deformed in high school I'm scared to leave my house. What made me look so ugly
