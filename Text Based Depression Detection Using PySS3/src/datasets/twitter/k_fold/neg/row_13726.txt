Girlfriend has tried to commit suicide twice in a monthHi everyone,

My girlfriend is an absolutely wonderful person with an absolutely horrific past. She has gone through things I would not wish on my worst enemy. She suffers from severe depression and bipolar. Lately she has been feeling very worthless because of her job and not having a degree. She was on the right track though, she enrolled to go back to school to become a Vet Tech. Things seemed like they were getting better. But late last month she made her first suicide attempt. I rushed her to the ER and she was sent to Inpatient for a few days. It seemed to really do her a lot of good. They changed her medication and set her up with a counselor. 

Things were going fine for several weeks but yesterday we got back from a really nice vacation and as I was trying to go to bed, she was in the other room writing her suicide note and taking about 80 pills. I had a bad feeling so I went to check on her and she was really out of it. I rushed her to the ER and she will be there for a few days until they can transfer her back to inpatient. 

I just dont know what to do. She lives with me because her family is horrible. I am her main source of support. But, I also struggle with anxiety and depression. I can barely take care of myself. I am also fairly young (24) I have a decent job so I can support us both but it is so tough. I want her to get help but I feel that having her at my apartment is not the best for her since I work so much. I feel like im tearing myself apart worrying about her all the time. And after this last attempt I am going to feel so uneasy leaving her alone anymore. I constantly worry I am going to come home one day to find her lifeless.
