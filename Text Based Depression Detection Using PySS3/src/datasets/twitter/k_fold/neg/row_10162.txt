I need a purpose in life, something to care about.I've been thinking about this lately, and there's nothing that I truly want to do. I don't enjoy any of my daily activities, I don't have any hobbies or anyone that I love. Every single day is the same. I'm also beginning to think that I simply don't like people in general, or anything that involves social interaction, my career is based on that. What's the point of living when you don't enjoy it? Maybe life just isn't for me.
