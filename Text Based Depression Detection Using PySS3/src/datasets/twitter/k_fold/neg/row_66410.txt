Two weeks ago the police came to my house and I am tired of living.Two weeks ago I was feeling really suicidal, more than the "usual". It's absurd how I've grown used to this since the age of 12... it sucks. My family ended up knowing about my issues and they "supported me" but them... my friends... everyone is just putting up with me. They take pity in me, that's why they talk with me. I'm so tired of entering people's lives, I ruin everything. So many good people die and yet, here I am... why? Why? Why me? I am useless, ugly, dumb as shit, got no will to live, so why me? Why do I get to live when I don't want to? Why don't I have the courage to just FUCKING END IT WHY.
