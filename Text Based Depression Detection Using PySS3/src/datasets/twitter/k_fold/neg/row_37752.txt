my last threadit's over. im too mentally unstable. i been in isolation for far too long now. they should do a case study on me cus i haven't dated anyone in years. haven't had friends since i early 2010s. i have no family i talk to, no friends, no career, with mental and physical illness. i had enough of this shit, there's no point of crying on the internet anymore. life is fucking boring and nobody gives A FUCK about you. i'll just do whatever the fuck till money runs out and i'll kill myself. have a FUCkING shitty life. enjoy ur fake ass relationship, enjoy ur divorce in ur 40s or 50s. enjoy ur shitty job, enjoy ur kissing ass ur boss, enjoy watching the news, netflix and doing the same shit over and over till ur too old to wipe ur own ass. FUCk all of you. i LEGIT dislike 99.9999999999% of people, i wouldn't give a fuck if most ppl just disappeared
