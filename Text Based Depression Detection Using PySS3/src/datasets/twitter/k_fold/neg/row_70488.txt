Suicide and family patterns.So, I'll just get to the point. 
When I was 16 my mom killed herself, she was 38. She had attempted numerous times before. When she was 7, her father killed himself, he was 37. I'm 25 now and as I grow older I become more suicidal. My life is nothing like I thought it would be. I am bipolar, just like mom was, and her father was. I feel like it's just bound to happen to me. Better me than my brother honestly. I just needed to vent. Sidenote: anyone else here have a parent that completed?
