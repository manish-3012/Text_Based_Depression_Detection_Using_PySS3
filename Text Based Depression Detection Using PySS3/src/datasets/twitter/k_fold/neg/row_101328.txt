What to doI think I have anxiety and depression and the last time I tried to get help it made everything worse. Now I don't know what to do because I feel like i can't tell any of my friends because I can't bear any of them. I won't talk to my family either because the last time I tried it ended really badly and made me feel worse. I feel hopeless all the time and I don't want to live. I don't want to die either. I want to cry all the time and whenever I start to enjoy something I get upset again because I know that I'll feel even worse after.
