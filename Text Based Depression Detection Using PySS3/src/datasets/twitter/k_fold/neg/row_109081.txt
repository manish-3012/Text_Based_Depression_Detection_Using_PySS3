Life comes to a point where you become DesensitizedLife eventually comes to a point where you become desensitized to the madness.

It's impossible to feel depressed anymore, considering also how it's all you've ever known.

I know I'm going to be single for the rest of my life, 
I know I'm always going to be broke, 
I know I'm never going to have friends.. 

..but that's precisely why I haven't been feeling that depressed lately - I've lowered the bar. Hope is toxic.. if anything, hope is THE biggest cause of depression.

Believe it or not, if I ever were given the opportunity to get into a relationship, or make new friends - I would turn it down immediately. Out of sheer wisdom. I already know how that is going to turn out. Good things never happen to me, and they sure as hell won't come to me Easily.
