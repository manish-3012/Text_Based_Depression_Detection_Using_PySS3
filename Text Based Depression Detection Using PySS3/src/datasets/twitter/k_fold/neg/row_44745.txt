this is a waste of time, buti know i'm only doing this because if i didn't it'd be swirling around in my head which is like setting off a grenade in an office. aka a disastrous mess. anyways.

i can be as hopeful as i want that someone will approach me and be the voice i need, but it's so, so fucking futile. everyone i've ever spoken to about this shit eventually 1. goes quiet, 2. admits they don't know what to say to me, or 3. wishes me the best but can no longer try to help.

and it's frustrating. and it's humiliating. and it's numbing. and unfair. and it kills me. and every time i come back it's like picking at a scab. the more you touch it, the longer it will take to heal. but i've been picking my brain so much that i can't help but desperately clamor for help from strangers. all the signs say that talking to people is the fastest way to recover. and i just. want. to fucking recover. or die. whichever is first. i don't care anymore! 

but i've never gotten any help by talking! just dead ends. sometimes they actually seem like they lead somewhere. everyone promises that yes, yes, it will improve, just keep going. so i kept going, and here i am! years and years and years of this. the people here who feel the way i do, ten, twenty, many many years older than me asking the same questions? i don't want to end up that way. and there are people younger than me who don't want to end up the way i did. 

so i'm here again. asking the same old things. wanting the same old help. it's vicious. it never gets better. there's no point in trying anymore. there was never a point in the first place. we just run in circles until we get tired and fall dead. 

just. hoping. one day i meet that person who doesn't quit trying to help me, like the rest. maybe then i could believe in this.
