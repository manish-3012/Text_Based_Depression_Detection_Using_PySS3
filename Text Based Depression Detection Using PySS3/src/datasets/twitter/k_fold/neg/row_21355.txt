I just wish this would all go away and end.I've struggled with depression for years. It's gotten so much worse within the last couple years. I feel like I'm a burden upon my family and friends. I wake up in the morning wondering why I was even given another day when other lives are taken that do not deserve it...I feel like nothing I do matters. I'm aware I sound like a teenager just going "Wah, Wah, Wah", but I assure you that isn't the case. Oh, and to add onto that note -- I'm gonna be 25 soon.

Today is the first day I've sat by myself, listened to music and those thoughts had crept back in. "Why am I here? Would it matter if I just disappeared? Would it take that pain away? Why am I feeling the pain now?" So on and so forth...my brain wants to just never wake back up or deal with this life anymore...
