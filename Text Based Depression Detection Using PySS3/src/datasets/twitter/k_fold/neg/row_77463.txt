I don't know why I feel this waySorry in advance for the grammarâ€¦

Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for almost 2 years now, Iâ€™ve always had problems with anxiety and over the last few years I think this has developed into depression.
I do take medication but no matter how many times my doctor changes the dose or even the medication itself, it never seems to work.

Itâ€™s hard to explain exactly how I feel.
When he was 12 my younger brother was hit by a car, he died a few days later after my parents both decided to switch off his life support.
The grief of losing my brother was crushing, but I also felt weirdly. It was if I was, for serious lack of a better wordâ€¦ jealous.
I wanted to die, not him. It wasnâ€™t fair.
I now find myself where I would do anything to go back and die in place of my brother. I would literally do anything to make that happen. Itâ€™s not fair that he had to miss out on so much of his life and Iâ€™m still here and want to throw mine away.
I just want to give my parents my brother back.
I just want to die. 

I just donâ€™t understand why I feel this way, about my life, Towards my dead brother. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s normal.
