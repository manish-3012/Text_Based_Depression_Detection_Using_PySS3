All aloneThis might be me just rambling at this point but whatever, but I wish I wasn't so lonely all the god damn time, I'd go out and do thing but no one will take me because I'm depressed and I'm nothing.  Or had the balls to kill myself which is easy to do right now. But fuck i want to die or get someone who loves me and won't leave after a month or two, someone who I can spend my life with, someone who I'll never find. If only I wasn't so god damn tired, like fml, I dont have any motivation or energy for anything, I barely eat, exercise, or just get out of bed in general. I want to die. Fucking if only I'd be that lucky, but no I'm stuck living and thinking about how no one will ever love me and that I'll never amount to anything, nothing out of the usual though. I'm always paranoid, so I feel like I'm being watched and/or judged by everyone, and I might be a schizophrenic but I dont know and I probably won't know, so my life is whatever. I'll trade my life for death. If you need me just do whatever, I'm dead to everyone so I dont expect to be a response.
