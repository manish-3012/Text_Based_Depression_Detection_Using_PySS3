no reason for me to be alive im 26 life is going nowhere, no job, no qualifications, no friends, no human interaction , no interest in being alive, still the same person i was when i was 16 , relying on parents, everyone growing old and dying around me, i feel guilty for my parents because they raised me to be better than i am i just dont know what to do anymore, we dont own a house, 99.99% most likely never will, time is running out , my parents will be dying soon and i have done nothing to make them feel like they were right to have me, obviously they dont say this stuff to me but i can feel it. i know it. i want to have children, but no girl would ever look in my direction let alone talk to me. i wouldnt be able to provide for them anyway. then i think how shit i would feel if they were to even go through 1% of what ive been through , i just wish there was a way i could go back and not be born in the first place. i wanna end it, but cant if my mum is alive, ive been therapy its no help, ive tried dating apps its no use, ive tried anti depressants they just numbed me, been off them 2 weeks and in those 2 weeks my granda died, i really couldnt make this shit up, i have to go to her funeral tomorow, she didnt really care about me or my side of the family, i cant even remember her saying my name, yet i feel guilty and sad as hell that i wasnt there for her at the end. i cant stop this feeling anymore, i try to vent online to see if it helps how it used to but it doesnt, i try to play games to take my mind of stuff but people are even more toxic on there , i think about ending my life every day, but deep down i dont wanna die, its just the easiest way to ease the pain. i always dismissed when people said stuff like this, thought it was attention seeking but damn being on the other end i dont wish this on anybody, i hope i dont wake up tomorow morning
