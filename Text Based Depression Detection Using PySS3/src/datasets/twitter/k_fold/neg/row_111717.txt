The only thing keeping me going is fear.I want to die.  The only thing keeping me going is fear of living in the streets.  Thats why I show up to a job I hate,Target retail.  Im almost 30, dying is a more realistic option than making changes, thats why i dont make them because i know this is short term.

I shut down.  Im not taking care of my responsibities.  My health insurance plan from last year is gone, and i havent pursued a new one at my job even though i know i should. And i need it to make the refills on my 4 medications affordable.  I procrastinate and avoid it because i want to escape.  I dont want to live.  I want to fucking die.

I font get how anyone has the will or motivation to live.  It is a mystery to me.
