give me a reason not to kill myselfWhy should I not kill myself when my existence is insignificant? I'm going to die someday so why not speed this annoyingly slow process up? I don't see why I should live when the planet is dying anyway, and I really don't see why someone would want to keep living like this. Existence is miserable and activities seem like a temporary distraction to the permanent solution that is death. I hope death is a permanent void, if something comes after it, I'm going to kill myself a second time, I just want to rest. Living as a shell on autopilot everyday isn't really my thing so why should I keep living. Hobbies are so useless, I've tried getting into new things but it all seems pointless in the end, since everything will end the same way. I don't see why I should keep trying. I don't understand why I shouldn't kill myself. What's the big loss?
