I am 23 and I don't wanna live anymoreI am a dedicated person. Have a good success on my lectures and all. But even though it is a good thing, I am not happy. My social struggles makes me very depressed. I am in ASD(Autism Spectrum Disorder). More of an Asperger's. People already ignored me. Didn't pay attention to what I say. I never had friends in real life. I was more of an aloof kind of guy. Guys in my class only talks with me just because of my lecture notes. I can't say "no" to people that is why they use me easily. I wish I didn't even exist from the very beginning. Nothing makes sense in my life anymore. I can't even concentrate on my lessons since this quarantine. It was going good when I was going to the school. But now this virus thing happened, whenever I sit in front of the computer, I do other things than studying my lessons. I want to be an academician. I am really living with this goal/dream. But at some point, it starts to seem like an impossible goal to me. I don't want to disappoint my family. I wish I could go to somewhere that is isolated from human presence. One of my biggest goal is being an academician in Denmark(it was Australia before), living in my van peacefully. Will I ever make those things true? I don't really know. I feel very weak recently. Suicide is always an option for me. At least, the idea of death comforts me that I won't be in pain anymore. I don't want to exist anymore. I feel like a burden to other people.
