Why delay the inevitable?I rely on my grandma, but she is getting old, she threatened to kick me out when I came out as transgender, but let me stay in the end, but she actually does? I might live with my mother, but that would be difficult.

I am not capable of working due to my mental issues. There is always a breakdown which would result in getting fired and even getting locked up.

It would be better to end this misery while I still can.
