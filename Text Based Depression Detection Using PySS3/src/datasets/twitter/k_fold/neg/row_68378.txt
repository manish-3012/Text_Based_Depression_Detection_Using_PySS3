Real FriendsRecently had someone (who knows me extremely well) tell me they couldnâ€™t talk to me if I was depressed because they donâ€™t want a â€œdark cloudâ€ over them all the time. Mind you, this is someone who I consider to be one of my best friends. 

What kind of friend sees someone in need and says they donâ€™t want you in their life because youâ€™re too depressing? What the fuck?
