I can't live like thisThe others somehow can... but I can't. There was so much back and forth today... I was there for two lectures and somehow managed not to cry. And the others are fine somehow. They went running and bought some books... They have plans. But I can't. I feel so abandonned. 
I hate myself for what happened eventhough I did not technically exist then. But the old main person did and she said the wrong things and made us loose the one save relationship we had. And I am everything that is wrong with her. I am a person just consisting of faults, despair and the wish to die. While the others are ok. 
But they don't like if I am around I make them sad too. And I understand. I don't want to be around. I want to be dead. I'd give up my existance in an instant if I knew how to. 
The only I do is crying anyway. How can the others be happy?

We will be alone for the rest of this pathetic life. No one ever wants us. 

And the other will be angry that I stayed up and made them tired. The boyfriend is angry too, because of something Kashi did, not me.... but I understand... no one likes me..
