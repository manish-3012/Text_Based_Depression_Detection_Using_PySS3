Too sensitiveI feel like I am too sensitive and emotional unequipped for this world. I cry constantly. If I see a person I believe to be in any sort of pain or distress, it destroys me. The movie "The United States of Leland" captured exactly how I feel. 

I'm so tired of being sad all the time. The only person I could really relate to and be totally honest with died last month. I'm just so tired of existing.
