/u/drunkenposting, mod of /r/electromagnetics and /r/targetedenergyweapons choose suicide but no publicity over checking out the radio free zone next door.Three weeks ago, my mod /u/drunkenposting asked whether there were safe havens:

Apparently, none of the old subscribers remember what they read and the new subscribers do not use Reddit's search engine to find answers. While a mod of /r/gangstalking in 2014 - 2015, I had posted on eluding and on radio free zones:

/u/drunkenposting disclosed he resides in Virginia:

&gt;I moved to Virginia, so unfortunately I'm still in the DMV area. Much further out, though.

Though I rarely have time to read posts in /r/gangstalking any more, I read his post. This saved me from having the regret had I only read his post and replied, I could possibly have saved him. I tried.

I could not comment because /u/pogomaster12, the mod who replaced me, had banned me for requesting performance of Tok-A-Mak's promise to refer. Therefore, I PM /u/drunkenposting. Our PMs are at:

The radio free zone in West Virginia is a mere several hour trip by car from Virginia. West Virginia was annexed from Virginia during the Civil War. /u/drunkenposting refusing to drive several hours is exemplary of TIs being self centered and selfish. Yes, the majority of TIs are. 

For over two years, I have been writing radio free zones may be possible safe havens. I have been downsizing to prepare to relocate. For over two years, we have waited for subscribers to follow through. They haven't. Even /u/drunkenposting. 

Last year, I invited /u/drunkenposting to mod /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics. He accepted the invitation but didn't perform any mod duties. I encouraged him to post. He choose to post in his own sub. Own subs act like one's own Facebook. Reddit is not Facebook. 

Four days ago, /u/drunkenposting announced being suicide in his own sub but not the other two subs he mods:

https://np.reddit.com/r/MyTortureJournal/comments/8bmm4n/im_trying_to_commit_suicide_tonight/?st=jg1bnuso&amp;sh=59217209

Had drunkenposting wanted targeted individuals (TIs) to encourage him to live, wouldn't he have posted in other TI subs? Had he wanted to generate publicity of the plight of TIs, wouldn't he have posted in large subs? Or committed suicide in downtown Washington, DC talking into a bull horn and wearing a poster? 

I do not subscribe to /r/MyTortureJournal. Two days ago, /u/triscuitzop PM me regretting that he did not see his post in time. Thank you /u/triscuitzop for notifying me. Two nights ago, I logged into Reddit. I was knocked out unconscious for 4 1/2 hours. Last night immediately after I went on a computer, the torturers made me semi conscious. They rendered me incapable of Redditing.

I read /u/triscuitzop's notice today, Sunday, April 15, 2018.

/u/triscuitzop's notifying me is not enough. /u/drunkenposting was a subscriber and poster in /r/gangstalking. I request /u/triscuitzop to crosspost my post in /r/gangstalking.

Will someone honor /u/drunkenposting's suicide by checking out the radio free zone next door to his corpse? Plant a tree with a huge memorial sign stating a TI may have possibly survived had they lived here. Submit a meter report. Archive the meter report into wikis. Cite the wikis to answer future TIs questions on safe havens when they haven't bothered to read our wikis.

Failure to read the shielding wikis and to shield contributed to drunkenposting's suicide:

To be honestly I haven't experimented with anything beyond rudimentary shielding yet. I don't really have the money right now to do so, but maybe in the future I'll try it.

I had replied sea salt is a mere $.69 per pound at the health food store. Granular bentonite clay is affordable too. Our PMs on shielding are at:

I hold /u/Tok-A-Mak partially responsible for /u/drunkenposting's suicide. A nonTI should not be the head mod of a TI sub. /u/Tok-A-Mak took over /r/gangstalking in /r/redditrequest. In 2015, he censored directed energy weapons, ultrasound, meter reports, shielding, implants, stasi, etc. and simultaneously without warning demoded five mods including me. /u/Tok-A-Mak recommended we create a sub on the topics he censored. He breached his promise to refer /r/targetedenergyweapons. The mods of /r/gangstalking continue to breach promise:

https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/79cdf5/closing_rtargetedindividuals_part_2_is_head_mod/?st=jg1diinf&amp;sh=59e91eb8

I had foreseen the consequences of a TI sub censoring directed energy weapons and shielding:


All three mods of /r/gangstalking are complicit in perpetuating physical torture and slow kill.

https://np.reddit.com/r/TargetedIndividuals/comments/78snvc/closing_rtargetedindividuals_please_subscribe_to/dp0rcfc/?st=jg1eixay&amp;sh=2d09b9fb

Though /u/drunkenposting is a mod of /r/targetedenergyweapons and /r/electromagnetics, he neither had read the wikis nor asked for help. He asked for help in /r/gangstalking. A sub that had banned the very topics he needed help in. The subscribers of /r/gangstalking do not read old posts. They are ignorant on what was posted prior to Tok-A-Mak's censorship. Sometimes ignorance is bliss. In this case, ignorance lead to suicide. None of the subscribers have knowledge of this as none of the mods announced the suicide in their own sub.

Practically being the only TI who researches and recommends eluding, radio free zones and shielding on Reddit may have lowered my credibility. Hive mind takes over. The majority don't discuss these topics because they lack knowledge of them. Hive mind wins. Do nothing but bitch. By demodding five mods, /r/ganstalking turned into a chat room.

We need more mods and subscribers to answer shielding questions by referring the shielding wikis. We need wiki contributors to update the wikis. I cannot keep do it all.
