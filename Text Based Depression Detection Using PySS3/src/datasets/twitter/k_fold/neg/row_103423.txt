I dont thank I can continue at this pointI have been struggling my whole life my family doesn't talk to me except to put me down.

I have been alone almost my entire life every girl I have dated left me because "I can't support you in the way you need it".

All my friends left me and I have no one, I have tryed to get into the dating seen so I have someone to make me happy and to I can make my life feel worth living by making them happy every day but every time I get on those damn dating apps it makes me feel worse.

I'm tired of living my sad miserable life and I dont want to keep going because it just keeps getting worse I dont know what to do
