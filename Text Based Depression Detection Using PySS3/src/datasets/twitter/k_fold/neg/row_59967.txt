any1 else ever feel like this?feel incredibly sheepish asking this but I have been struggling with this for as long as I can remember and need to know I'm not the only person to feel this way. 

I honestly wish I had never been born, if there was anyway to guiltlessly erase my existence to the point where it would not affect anyone's life i would. 

According to the world's standards I have alot going for me: young, relatively attractive male who has strong work ethic(actually recently received huge promotion at work), intelligent, outgoing (though I seem unable to form romantic relationships), drive a nice car, etc... yet weekly if not daily I lay in bed at night wishing i could hit the "end it all" button. I have seriously considered ending it all in the past but could never purely cause of the impact it would have on the people I love. 

Ugh, even as a child I daydreamed of hitting that sweet relief "end it all" button...not gonna get into specifics since its all irrelevant and many people have had worse childhoods than mine. 

my life is full of unfullfilled desires/goals/expectations and im sick of it
