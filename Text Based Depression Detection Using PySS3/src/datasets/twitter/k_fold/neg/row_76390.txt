Hiding my suicidal ideations.For the last few years, I've been experiencing suicidal ideations.  I have never actually been suicidal or planned anything, but more than ever I think about killing myself.  I am 44, alcoholic, lost everything as a result.  I am bankrupt and unemployable because of the red flags in my past.  

I have never told anyone I have these thoughts.  I am single, no kids so I won't be leaving family behind to deal with my suicide.  I am starting to realize that I have a hopelessness future especially with this pandemic bringing economic devastation.

I will wait until my elderly father dies first.  I plan to commit suicide within 5 years because I hit age 50.  I will not tell anyone.  I won't leave a note either
