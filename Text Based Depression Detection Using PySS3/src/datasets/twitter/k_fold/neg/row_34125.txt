Just can't cope with zero hope.I turned 20 last month. Whoopee. Got a job. Yet to be scheduled. I'm trans and made that clear in my application, so I am probably a diversity hire anyways. Only reason I got the job. Not even me would hire me.

Feeling angry, depressed and like I'm at the end of my rope. Everytime I turn on the news I lose a little bit more hope for my future. There is no hope.

The only person stopping me from ending my life is my girlfriend. She deserves a lot better than me. She doesn't deserve someone like me. I can't hurt her like that.

Even before this shit year, I had little hope for my future. Having an intense fear of it. Now my hope dwindles everyday. One day I might actually go through with it. I dont know when, but there's nothing to look forward to anymore. 

There is nothing left to say, or do but to end my life. Someday I'll get the strength to leave this life behind and go back to void. I've been trying to escape this pain for what feels like my entire life and I've made no progress. I'll never make progress. I'd rather die than attempt positive change again.
