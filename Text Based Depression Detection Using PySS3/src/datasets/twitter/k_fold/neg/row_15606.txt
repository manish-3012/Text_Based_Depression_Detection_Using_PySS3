What really happens after we die?So i get relax remembering about my "inevitable death" to escape this shit hole, but i sometimes think.... what if there is an afterlife!?
Which makes it scary to die sometimes. But my life sucks so much that i don't even care sometimes what's next, just gotta escape this shit hole.

I'll go insane if there's an afterlife. I really hope that i just wouldn't exist, or be trapped in my imagination or something and live in a dream forever.
