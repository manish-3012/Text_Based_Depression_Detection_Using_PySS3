Anyone Else Feel Like Theyâ€™d rather Kill Themselves Than Work or Go to School?Like honestly. My life is going okay, but it would be going better if I would do the right thing.
My credit cards need to be paid off, my phone bill is way overdue, I have a loan to pay off, Iâ€™m truant for school, and Iâ€™m at risk of losing my job. This can all be fixed if i would just do what I need to do, but i donâ€™t want to.
My paychecks are short due to hardly working, so when I only have a small amount on payday, I deal with stress and shame by spending that money on fast food and binge eating. I spend my time just laying in bed hoping if i go to sleep i wouldnâ€™t wake up, and my room is a pile of hoarding shit. I step on valuable shit that fell on the floor one day that i never picked up. I stepped on and broke a family photo with my dad who passed, and I just blamed myself and tried to hurt myself when I did. But the broken frame is still there.
I can hardly afford to feed my cat, sheâ€™s here licking plastic and biting cardboard and shit.
Iâ€™m so unmotivated and fed up iâ€™m sick of this shit.
If i have to do this for another 40-50 years, Iâ€™m not gonna last another year.
Thankfully Iâ€™m still in high school, so i can take control of my life in the near future, but right now it seems as though Iâ€™m fucking up my life and it sucks.
Like I donâ€™t want to do anything, no school work, nothing.
As if iâ€™m purposefully setting myself up to fail.
I really wish I had the courage to kill myself because honestly.
I feel like itâ€™s easier to commit suicide than to fix this hole I dug for myself.
