27 and I feel like I'm done.I feel completely worn out. I've been depressed since I was 15. When I was younger and I would think about suicide it would make me really upset and I would cry but now I find myself thinking about it all the time. It's almost a relief now when I think about ending my life. Like I can put an end to this.

I'm 27 years old with an associates degree in computer science. I have held a programming job for three years which is a miracle considering I  am a terrible programmer. The job is toxic. I go in everyday with the fear that I will finally be found out as the phony that I am. My boss also likes to make matters worse by constantly putting me down.

I have recently come to to terms with the fact that I am a transgendered person. I was hoping that finally admitting it to myself would make some of this pain go away but it only intensified it. I feel like an inferior person.

I don't want to type out all my problems. I'm scared because I've never felt this calm and collected when thinking about ending my life. I imagine that after I die there will just be nothing, and I yearn for that nothingness, where there are no more decisions to make.
