I give up, I'm tired of fightingI posted online to another forum I am a member of. After that post, and people jumping down my throat, I want to end it. I can't take this life anymore, its too much for me. My physical pain is overwhelming, my depression is more than I can stand. I want to run in front of a bus (but I'm too much of a chicken). End it, the pain would stop, i would no longer be stuck on this hateful planet where everyone hates me. I want to die. I have no reasons to live. Maybe my parents could live without me. Everyone would go on. No one would miss me. My boyfriend would finally have a chance to find the help he needs and the love he needs. Why was I born, why am I here. I am a failure of a human being. I wish I would just die already
The post? because I was upset and jealous over someone else. I can't be loved. I cause everyone pain. and I'm too mentally Ill to live.

edited to add: I'm heading out to an interview, I really would rather stay home but a good friend of mine is coming to bring me there. she doesn't know about my ideations, and I don't plan on telling her. What drives me crazy, i'm a social work student. i've worked with others suicidal... I hate when I relapse. I contracted (with myself actually) not to hurt myself until I can see someone to talk about this. Thank you for being there. I will post later.
