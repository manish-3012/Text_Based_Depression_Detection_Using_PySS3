ThingsReddit keeps deleting my posts because of misclicks
I had a lot of things that make me suicidal but my mental frame is so broken that if I got a wrong reply on a post where I say those things I would have probably hurt myself. The one thing i would have talked about no one replied or liked so whatever i yell into the void now

It is so late and I can't sleep because I want to kill myself yet again. I wish I can go back in time and tell myself "misery is better than loneliness so you better keep this friendship because you will not be able to have another friend again." 
I wish i can stay home and watch TV all day and never worry about people 

No replying with just "same"
