I feel the end approaching. I wrote a note. I canâ€™t take this anymore.I spent the day writing a â€œnote.â€ I wrote it so that it was done in the case I needed one so I didnâ€™t have to take the time to do it. I explained my suffering to the extent I could. I wrote an individual message to each of those who may want to hear something from me. Iâ€™m so alone. I feel very numb. My brain is scrambling with passive thoughts and all I can think about is disappearing and ceasing to exist. Iâ€™ve been coming across methods people have done or tried throughout the day and all I keep getting are intense intrusive thoughts of needing to do it and images of me doing it. But then, if I fail, Iâ€™ll be hospitalized yet again, which has always made me worse in the end, and I will be a huge failure, in massive medical debt, and a big fucking embarrassment. I have an extensive trauma history, including some recent trauma in past months, and I just see no way out of this pain that involves me living. I feel trapped, helpless, and hopeless. I am in so much pain, and I canâ€™t keep fighting. I have no one and no reason to keep going.
