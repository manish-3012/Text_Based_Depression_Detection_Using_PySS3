Im crying,afraid that i will try to kill myself in next monthIm so emotional,today my mom said that that im selfish and education is the most important.
Now crying and thinking about suicide."education"-dropped out of university 1,5 months ago,still parents dont know,but im planning to tell them next month,after appoitment with psychiatrist(16 january),going to someone who can help me for the first time.

Yesterday broke up with girlfriend because i was being useless in that relationship and she was 10 years older.

Few days ago i opened to my "friend" and told about depression which i met only one time outside of high school earlier so its hard time to talk about being close with her,we were just talking sometimes in hs,nothing more,but despite that im meeting with her on saturday,she told me that i dont have to feel bad about "using her" to help myself,she said "she will feel needed and i will feel better".

But the worst thing is telling my parents about dropping of university,they've always been hating me cause of grades in school and telling me how bad i am,mainly because of school.And i feel lonely,i dont want to use my friend everytime im feeling bad,but i dont want to die and i need someone to talk with :(
