Why do I do this to myself?I always feel divided between myself, fragmented.
One day I'll care, the other I won't.

I feel suicide is not the answer, I know of what will happen but my mind is broken, my will is shattered, bonds are battered.

I want help, but I feel it won't be help
Logically asking for help, emotionally think it wont help.
