i want to die - high schoolhey so i just started high school and im part of this really competitive program. i've been competitive since a very young age and i feel really defeated. i didn't get accepted into my school's deca. apparently i was supposed to get in and it was supposed to be final, but the exec decided to reject me last minute.

i really really really wanted to do deca this year in grade 9 and i dont want to wait until grade 10 to try again and get into deca. i literally want to kill myself and take some pill that can help me die quickly and painlessly. i feel like a useless piece of shit honestly (mind my language) and hope i die in a fucking hole. i'm sorry for putting my troubles out here but i feel so dumb that I DIDN'T GET INTO DECA.

my application was really good but not good enough. my friends even thought it was good. but still not good enough. i'm still not good enough. now i feel my changes into getting into an ivy league are less since i dont have that much commitment to deca if i start in grade 10. also, all my friends are gonna be winning prizes in deca this year, and ill just be on the side. lol doing nothing with my life. i dont know what i want to do now i didn't get into deca and i really wish i could kill myself.

i'm sorry i'm just rambling at this point but does anyone has some sucide prevention hotlines that are avalible 24/7 where you don't have to enter some survey beforehand? also, why am i so dumb? what are some easy ways to kill myself?
