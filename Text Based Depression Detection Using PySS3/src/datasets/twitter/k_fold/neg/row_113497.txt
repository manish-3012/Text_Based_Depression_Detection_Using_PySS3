My friend's stuck between a rock and a hard place in his life right now and is dealing with depression and thoughts of suicide. Can you guys help him out?(im posting this for a friend of mine because he said it would be more comfortable for me to do it for him)

also for privacy i'll be calling him "Kyle", but that isnt his name etc, but you can call him that to make things easier.

kyle's stuck in a tough situation right now and doesn't know how to get out. his family is scared of him, he doesnt have anyone except for online friends to rely and talk to about his thoughts. i think hes going through depression and hes been talking about suicide a bit recently. when i asked him to make a summary about his thoughts, he gave me this for you:

"I have constant thoughts of hurting people. I hate people and I hate this society. Everything is motivated by money, and no one bothers to help anyone out any more. If someone was getting beat up by someone else, most people wouldn't bother to help. Humans and other animals are everything wrong with this world. The thoughts of me hurting people won't go away and they get worse when I think about these things. I've already beat my animals and hit my family members. It's only going to get worse. I'm destined to end up in prison. I have no motovation to do anything anymore, not even school. They've already threatened to call the police for being traunt. I just feel like I'm a waste and a burden to others. I Just wanna kill myself and be done with everything."

kyle says that he doesnt want to go to a therapist because of the fear that they'll turn him into the cops, and thinks that the biggest issue right now is him killing himself.

im desperate for any help as to how kyle can get out of this situation and correct himself, can you guys help?

ive also given this account to him after this has been posted, so if you need any more information just ask and he'll reply.

edit: the account that he will be using to reply is /u/userVRC6, not this one because i was stupid with passwords.
