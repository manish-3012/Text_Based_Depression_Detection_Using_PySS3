I figured it out and I'm kind of relievedI've been racking my brain for months trying to figure out a solution to my problems. I've been pretty active in this sub but suicide never felt "right" until I figured it out last night. The common problem in everyone's life is me so if I take care of that everyone will be happy. I don't want to go into too much detail because it'll be a novel, but yeah. I'm leaving and it'll fix everyone's problems and I'm so so so so happy I figured out the solution. I'm at peace with it and I'm happy about it. I just wanted to let you guys know because so many of you reached out to me the last couple months and helped me when I was upset .
