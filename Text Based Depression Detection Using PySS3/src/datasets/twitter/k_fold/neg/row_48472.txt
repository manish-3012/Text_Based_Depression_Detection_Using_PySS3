Too tired to live, too young to die.. I need help.. Please..I'm sick of living but I'm only 25. People always say i have my whole life ahead of me. I've just taken 10 Klonopin (again) and currently drinking vodka + cranberry. My husband thinks I'm nuts, I'm an American living in the UK with no friends/overly known to the mental health system.. I want to just say fuck it and move home where I know I can be single &amp; happy. But I can't afford it.. IDK what to do. I'm just tired of feeling alone.
