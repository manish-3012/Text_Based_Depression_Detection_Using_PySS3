Told my psychiatrist I need to go back on antidepressantsI called him in the middle of the night and left him a message. Of course, I've got two weeks to go until my appointment, and then probably another week after that before I can actually start taking them, but I've gotta start somewhere, ya know?

I can't go to therapy and I'm stuck thousands of miles from home with no support system in place and I'm actively burning all my bridges so I dunno if I'll make it but fingers crossed I guess
