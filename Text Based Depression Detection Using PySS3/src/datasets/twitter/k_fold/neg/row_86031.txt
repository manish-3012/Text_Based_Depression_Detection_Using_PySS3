Sometimes I want to give upIve been going thru pain since March of this year. Not trying to put my bizzness out there but its been my right testicle. Its been aching like everyday where I had got a hernia surgery and a Vericocele surgery to clear the pain. My body is still trying to heal from both surgery so im not worried about that. All i care about is this right testicle ache to go away. I pray and have others thats praying for me for strengh and healing and to be honest I dont know how many more days I can take. This have been a rough summer for me where i lose weight from depressed and anxiety. I feel like its all my fault. Ive been to E.R over times, 5doctors and 3 urologist and one pain specialist. Its like im living in a nitemare and my dreams even be scary. Cant tell u when the last time I had a smile on my face. When i look in the mirror I look sick and i know i do and try my best to regroup but soon as i feel that ache it bring me back down. My life sucks right now and none of the doctors cant find a solution. I go to church and bible study for months and I ask God to plz take this pain away and to forgive for all my sins.. I reach my boiling point in pain and i dont like taking medicine bcz of the side effects. Its crazy when u come up of ideas on how to end yourself..
