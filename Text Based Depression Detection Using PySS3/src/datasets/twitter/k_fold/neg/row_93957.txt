Itâ€™s so scary to think of becoming a statistic.Iâ€™m 21. Iâ€™m an alcoholic and Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Had a pretty horrible childhood. Last year my ex and I broke up and it destroyed me. I called him last night when I was drunk, and texted him. I think he blocked me. 

Last fall I got back into therapy. This February I went a month without drinking. Iâ€™ve told my therapist Iâ€™m going to manage my drinking. Everything is going downhill so fast. I donâ€™t want to spend the rest of my life on meds and in AA meetings. I want to live a normal life but thatâ€™s not on the table now. Suicide would be so fitting to my story. I donâ€™t want to hurt the people who love me but Iâ€™ve been suicidal since I was probably eight or nine. I remember telling my older sister that I thought I was depressed and got laughed at. I made my first suicide attempt when I was in fourth grade. 

Battling with mental health and addiction, I canâ€™t remember a time where Iâ€™ve been truly happy in my life, except for when I was dating my ex. Because he was perfect for me. Better than everyone who came before and everyone whoâ€™s come after. I stopped doing Xanax and coke the day I met him. Still havenâ€™t touched either since. 

I donâ€™t want to love him for the rest of my life. Im trying to get over it in therapy but itâ€™s been months with no progress. I donâ€™t want to love him for the rest of my life. I donâ€™t. I donâ€™t want to be old and still miss him. I donâ€™t want to settle down with someone else and still be thinking about the one that got away.
