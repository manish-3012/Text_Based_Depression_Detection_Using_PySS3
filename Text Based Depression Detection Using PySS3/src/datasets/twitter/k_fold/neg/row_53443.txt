I tried to kill myself Monday nightIts finals week but I really couldn't care less about my grades. My sister and her 7yo daughter were at my house and when I went to go say goodbye to my niece she said "bye! See you soon!" Jesus fuck that woke me up a little and made me question wtf I was doing. None the less  I took some pills laid down in my formal black dress and heels and didn't die. Kind of upset I woke up the next morning. went to class and took my Spanish midterm. I'm still here and alive. Might try again.
