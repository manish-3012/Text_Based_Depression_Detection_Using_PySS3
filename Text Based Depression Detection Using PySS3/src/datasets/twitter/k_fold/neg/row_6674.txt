I Can't Properly Deal.Lately, life seems pointless. Like there's nothing to come of it, so why bother? The one person I can talk to won't talk to me. I'm losing friends, family and the love of my life all because I don't know how to deal. I get so angry and lash out and don't know how to give others the space that they need to deal with things. I'm trying, I really am. It's just so hard. I'm trying to see my therapist. But they no longer take my insurance and I can't afford it. But I know that I need it. I just need to be heard. To hear others. To not feel alone in a room full of people. I've tried to get help. I don't want to die, but I just don't know how to live anymore.
