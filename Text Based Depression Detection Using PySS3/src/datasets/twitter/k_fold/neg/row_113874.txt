30 is the limit.I turn 25 in three days. I don't even know if I'll make it until 30 but that's the limit I've set for myself. I'm trying. If things don't feel better by then I'm just going to kill myself because at that point I know my life, my health, my looks is just downhill at that point. 

I tried to see if I could find a decent psychiatrist but naturally my health insurance has limited coverage from mental health and I'm too embarrassed to seek out other resources and I feel like it's a waste to pay out of pocket. I'm trying to change things in my life to help, but I am just going through the motions.
