I'm just so miserable that it's honestly funny ðŸ˜‚I totally feel so much like shit right now, ngl. It all makes sense now....I've been feeling this dormant pain inside of me every day I  came to accept it, only to experience the pain becoming more severe and acute. But it's alright I can withstand it, I can take it all but do you honestly know what is it that I can't take anymore? Being a disappointment to people who I do my best for, being a good for nothing even though I put in all my effort and might into everything I do, making people grow tired of me, making people wait even when I do all the work to be on time, making sacrifices for the people I love only to be taken for granted in return, trying my best to make them happy even if I'm not happy, putting so much effort and still be unnoticed.... what I don't comprehend is why do I get to feel this way even though all I do is trying to never do wrong for anyone or anything.... let's speak reality though, all of the above was caused by me. I have brought it all upon myself. I never blamed anyone nor I do blame anyone because this is one hundred percent me, my life and what's become of it. Or it might just be my mental health speaking at this point I've got a side of me which has sever depression, anxiety, a self destructive trait, trauma and I don't even know what else do I have but yeah a damaged shitty mental health. 
Whatever it is. All I know is that I need to die. I really wish that I was able to donate my life to someone who actually deserves living rather than being wasted on something like me, but that's just wishful thinking. So yeah after all we are all dying it's the natural process of life. It's just a matter of time being sooner or later. So me taking my leave earlier isn't a bad thing afterall :)
