I'm a failure not sure what other options I have leftSo, like I said, I'm not really sure what options I have left but I'm at the lowest point in my life.

In the past few months, I've broken up with my girlfriend, gotten in a car accident and can't afford to get a new one, moved back in with my mom, have eroded my savings down to a bank account with $10 dollars left, have been getting harassed by credit cards, and have no faith left in myself.

The worst part?  I thought I was doing everything right!  I went to law school (accumulating $180K+ in debt in the process), and have been unemployed for almost a year now.  I've given up looking for work in law and have started applying to retail - but they won't even call me back.  Honestly, I've given up looking and have totally detached.  This isn't how things were supposed to shake out!  I was supposed to be successful!  Instead - I came out as a total failure.  Everyone has to see it in me - even though they don't care - I still feel like a figure of ridicule.  

Essentially, I don't know what to do and don't see any options.  I haven't killed myself only because I'm afraid I'd screw it up and end up burdening people more so by having to take care of me as a vegetable.  I really wish I had died in that accident - It would have just made things simpler.  I talked to my mom earlier today and told her that I wanted to end my life because I don't think I can deal with things anymore.  She told me to get out if I was serious and basically dared me to do it.  I really don't know what else to do.
