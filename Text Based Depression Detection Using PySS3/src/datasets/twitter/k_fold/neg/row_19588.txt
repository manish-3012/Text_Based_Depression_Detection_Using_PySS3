Tips on keeping suicide out of your mind?Hi. I have cripplingly low self esteem and have cut myself and still do it fairly often. Lately I've been leaning towards suicide too often. I'm scared I might try something. I know my case isn't nearly as serious as others here, but I just wanted to know if you guys had any tips on simply keeping suicide at bay.
