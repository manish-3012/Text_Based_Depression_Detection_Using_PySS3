HopelessIâ€™ve always been the type to overcompensate to try keep people around me, id be anyone but me because my opinion on myself is that low that no one would like me for me. Iâ€™m currently 21 and feel all Iâ€™ve had to offer, Iâ€™ve given and Iâ€™m reaching my limit, Iâ€™m not saying that my reason for wanting to end things revolves around the lack of company in my life, but itâ€™s definitely contributing. I grew up with a turbulent family life, my dad died 8 years ago and thatâ€™s probably where things really went downhill for me, because it left me with loads of regrets. I donâ€™t talk to family about my problems because they have their own lives, own families, own problems to deal with, so thereâ€™s just no time for me really. I feel super useless in life and maybe Iâ€™m just a waste of oxygen, a waste of resources, I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m just not what the world wants or needs
