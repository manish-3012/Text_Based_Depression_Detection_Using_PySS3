19m, tired of being alone foreverIâ€™m tired of the days and nights full of crying and fantasies in my head of only hoping that maybe I will have someone but I know deep down that I will never have anyone. I will die alone and I donâ€™t see a reason to live because of that. Everyone else my age has had some sort of experience and Iâ€™ve had literally none. It wonâ€™t be long before Iâ€™m the 40 year old virgin and I certainly will be killing myself before then.
