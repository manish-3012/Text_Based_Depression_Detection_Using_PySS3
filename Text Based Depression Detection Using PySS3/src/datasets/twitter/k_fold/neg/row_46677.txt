It got worse (16 year old trans girl)Since my last post, my temper got the best of me, and i confronted all of my friends, asking why they were ignoring me. they all said how they were uncomfortable around me, and how they were tired of waiting on me to change. i lost them all, and i cant get them back. the only reason im not in the middle of killing myself right now is because i have one friend left, who has no idea of what ive done, but i feel im just going to drive them away too eventually. i dont know what to do, i dont think i can change, ive hurt everyone ive ever interacted with. im toxic, manipulative, and abusive, and it doesnt matter how much i acknowledge it because no matter how hard i try i always end up having the abusive side of me take over, the bull headed side that thinks that im right just because i got my feelings hurt. im so lost, i dont know what to do. i dont know where to start. im not even sure if i truly want to be a good person, and that tears me up inside. im not sure about anything of myself anymore. and "i dont know what to do" is echoing in my mind endlessly.
