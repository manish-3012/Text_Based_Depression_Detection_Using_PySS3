All of the posts with zero repliesAre actually a good thing, I think. 

When my post doesn't even get replies here (which is often) it reinforces my belief that my life is not livable.

When I do get replies, my life just gets worse. I forget for a minute how bad it is. But no one can save you, not even by validating you pain.
