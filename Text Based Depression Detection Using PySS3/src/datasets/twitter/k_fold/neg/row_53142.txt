Not making plans for the future to keep the option openI've been mildly depressed for years and I've been in a bad place for a few months now.  
I've paused my studies at university, started therapy and I'm just trying to get through one day at a time.

Usually I make some kind of commitment (concert tickets, helping out at an event of my students' union, making holiday plans with booked flights, etc.) a few months ahead and keep myself going that way.  
But I don't want that anymore. It just makes me feel like I only force myself to live without even wanting it.

After my sister's wedding next week (which is the one thing that kept me going for the last 8-9 months) I don't have anything I firmly committed to go to. And I'm avoiding making plans with others any further ahead.  
I haven't made plans to commit suicide either, but the idea is there. And I don't think I'm ready to give up on the opportunity and commit to keeping on living.
