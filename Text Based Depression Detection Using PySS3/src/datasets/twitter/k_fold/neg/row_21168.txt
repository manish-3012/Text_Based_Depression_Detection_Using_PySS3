Donâ€™t want to fucking sleepWhy? Why should I sleep? Why is it that weâ€™ve decided that we have to stop what weâ€™re doing around a certain time and lay down for several hours. Itâ€™s fucking impossible sometimes. And Itâ€™s not like iâ€™ve got anything important to get up for tommorow (later today more like) because Iâ€™ll just be sat here in the house again doing nothing, achieving nothing.  Being a horrible excuse for a son/brother/person. Sleeping now wont change any of that. Sleeping canâ€™t motivate me to try. Sleeping canâ€™t make me happy. Sleeping is so fucking horrible because itâ€™s just more time iâ€™ve wasted in day. I donâ€™t want to sleep. I donâ€™t want to do anything. I donâ€™t want to be alive. So sick of it.
