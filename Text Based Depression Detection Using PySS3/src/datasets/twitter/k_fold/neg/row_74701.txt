I feel irreparably brokenI feel like I'm broken person. And that like broken people do, I cover up the cracks and pretend I'm whole. It doesn't seem like I'll manage to fix myself. It doesn't seem like it'll get better. 

I don't know what "broken" exactly means behind the metaphor, but it feels right to describe it like that.

I just wanted to get that out. 

By the way I'm not going to commit suicide and I'm too afraid of death and its consquences to be suicidal, so don't rush to try to save my life, it's okay.
