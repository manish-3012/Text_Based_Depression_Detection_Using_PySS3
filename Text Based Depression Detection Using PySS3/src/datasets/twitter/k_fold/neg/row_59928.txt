Not in crisis, but just finishedI'm just tired of living I guess. Like literally tired. I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and I would really rather sleep than get up and do anything. I have no desire to go out with friends or to go to work or see family. I just graduated high school and the thought of college is just tiring, too. Trying to make new friends and doing coursework more difficult than what I'm used to while working as a cashier on the side just seems like so much. I don't want to do it. I don't want to do anything, really. I want to have an ambition so bad but I can't force it. I'm on three different medications for depression and I just got them all refilled and I really want to overdose, but I'm scared I'll wake up in pain and go out in agony. My brother overdosed a few months ago, but survived it. When I found him, his face was blue and he wasn't breathing. I can't get the image out of my head. And now he's back from rehab and already getting fucking smashed again and I'm scared for him. My parents are getting divorced and they're both trashing each other to me and I hate it. I miss having a happy family. A few years ago, my father just went batshit. He has MS and his brain is getting messed up from it. He started hitting my brother and I and now he's trying to play it off like nothing happene. All of it is just so tiring. I'm not necessarily extremely sad or angry. Just finished. I'm sorry this is so disorganized. There was just so much to say and I couldn't think straight enough to put it all in any kind of order. I know that if I die, people will be hurt. But they're all going to die, too. That pain is temporary, and I honestly don't think people would miss me that much. I just needed to get it off my chest that I really do want to die. This is kind of a last ditch effort to find a motivation to live. Thank you so much if you've read to the end.
