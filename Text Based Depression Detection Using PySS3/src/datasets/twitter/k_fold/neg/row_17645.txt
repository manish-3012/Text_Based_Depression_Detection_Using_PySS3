I'm so tired.For the last few weeks, I've been so tired. Like, walking through miles and miles and miles. I can barely keep my eyes open. No matter how much I sleep, I'm still exhausted. 

My life isn't bad. My friends are wonderful. My family is shit, but they're not a problem. I just don't want to keep going. I'm tired of feeling second best. I'm tired of being exhausted and numb. I'm just tired.
