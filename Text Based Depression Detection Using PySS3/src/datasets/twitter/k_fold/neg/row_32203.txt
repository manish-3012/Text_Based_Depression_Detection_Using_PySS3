Treading in neck deep waterI need a Survival plan.. its not that i sit back and think how shit my life is i actually do shit and at night i want to die.. i may be beyond help bc i cant be around people and i dont want to listen and i hate just having to work as a volunteer bc nobody loves someone that isnt succesful. Everyone has it better than me
