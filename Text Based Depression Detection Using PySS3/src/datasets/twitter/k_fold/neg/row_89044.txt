Stranger in a an even stranger landHello, I am not thinking about killing myself...but I believe that I'm "mentally dead" and that my body is just physically here. I acknowledge that I have a family that loves me and there are far worse situations out there with that said..

I'm currently in the western world, as a male, I feel like the "world" (by "world" I'm referring to my surroundings, country, etc. and yes I know that my country isn't the "world") is isolated, cold, and distant.

It's a sin to look at anyone in the streets and it's an even bigger sin to go up to a woman and tell her that you find her attractive (I've even tried the "jerk/PUA" thing for a bit which also didn't work out as planned). I am by no means a "Mr. Nice Guy" nor do I act like a mysognists (some people could describe me as a chaunvinist but I'm more of a traditionalist).

Yes, one can say "Just suck it up and get modern boy!" But I see more problems than just that... the matriarchy system is heading in a downward spiral (rather than a patriarchy system which progresses forward). 

Anyway, the reason why I'm shouting in SW is because suicide has often creeped up in my mind. As of right now it isn't, I'm a bit happy, but I simply do not value the things society does.

I'm young, in college, and it seems like if I'm not in a fraternity I'm not worth shit in the eyes of a female (even if she's not in a sorority). 

When I do find a woman who shows interest back, it's often like talking to a wall..there's just no..personality or even soul behind that face and then I just instantly turn away.

Is this normal in western society? If one has no "social status" (I am wealthy but no one knows it, nor do I want to flaunt it) then you might as well be a "creep" and "stay at home" (no one has actually said these things to me). 

I guess, I'm just wondering if it's worth sticking out for and if there are better "worlds" out there? :(
