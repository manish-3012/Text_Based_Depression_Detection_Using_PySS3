I am going to kill myself.I canâ€™t afford the help that I need, and my family wonâ€™t help me.

I had one friend left, but he was my ex-boyfriend. He wonâ€™t talk to me now. 

I do not have any friends in this city. 

I hate everything about my life. 

My roommate is not home. I am either going to take pills and slit my wrists, or I will drive to one of the bridges here in Austin and jump. 

I want to be well. I want to be alive. I do. But I donâ€™t want to be institutionalized. Iâ€™d rather be dead than institutionalized. 

I just wish I were good enough for someone. Anyone. 

But I am not. This is my goodbye.
