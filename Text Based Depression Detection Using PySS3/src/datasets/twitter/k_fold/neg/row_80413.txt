I (29M) have a friend (30M) who is very open and adamant about his desire to not live anymoreI was having trouble wording the title because thatâ€™s basically it. I (29M) have a friend (30M)who is very open about his desire to not live anymore. Heâ€™s had a hard life, from childhood till now. He goes through a lot of pain daily, he was seeing a therapist routinely for a while and even then he was very open with her that he believed it should be legal to be able to take your own life if that is what you wanted. Heâ€™s been institutionalized for telling someone he wanted to commit suicide as recently as a month ago, but was let out very quickly. When the pandemic started he just quit paying his car payment because â€œhe didnâ€™t feel like paying it anymoreâ€ and he was recently let go at work because he refused to sign a counseling agreement. I was eating with him last night and he was very adamant he doesnâ€™t want to live anymore and even said he was going to buy a gun with his first unemployment check. He doesnâ€™t have any family anymore as his parents have passed and heâ€™s never had a good relationship with his sister. I truly donâ€™t know what to do at this point, I attempt to see him as much as I can to just hangout and be there for him and give him someone to talk to, but no matter what I say or do heâ€™s still very much at peace with the fact that heâ€™s ready to not be alive anymore. I have struggled with depression before but not on the level that he is currently and am having trouble on what to do.
