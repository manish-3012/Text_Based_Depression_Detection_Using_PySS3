I think it's time for suicide.My thoughts are not really lined up well at the moment, but I wanted to get this out anyway. I know no one will care, I just hope this will help me make up my mind. 

Life has not been going so well. I don't even have a lot of happy childhood memories, it was mostly just me getting bullied. And it's safe to say I failed as an adult. I suck at making friends, socially inept, unattractive, get insulted by random strangers, and have nothing going for myself. 

Â I really feel like I've reached my limit. I feel like ive failed at everything ive tried, and I just dont know what to do anymore. I'm starting to lose hope that I'll ever be loved or competent. It has become downright painful to get through each day. I think it's time to end it.
