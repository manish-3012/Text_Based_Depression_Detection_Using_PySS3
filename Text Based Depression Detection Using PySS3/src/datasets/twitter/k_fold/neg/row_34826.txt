I feel trapped into living.Long term depressed, recently acquired real reasons to be so too. Even thought there is nothing I want more than to die my loved ones always convince me not to. I have problems that I can't fix, I live in a world in which I don't belong yet they beg me to stay and I feel obligated to endure years of suffering for them I want to resent them for it too but I can't bring myself to.
