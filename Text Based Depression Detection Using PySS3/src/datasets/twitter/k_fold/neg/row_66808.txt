"Just go to therapy", "Go get help"..Im not going to lie im tired of that fucking advice. Ive already been to 3 different therapists...I just need a fucking friend or someone to talk about my issues with. Is that so hard for people to do? I know it is good advice especially if someone is going though mental health but damn im tired of hearing it. Ive been suicidal for the longest and ive found that having a friend to talk to is more helpful (for me) then any therapist. It feels like such a heartless world. Everytime I open up about my suicidal thoughts I eventually get ghosted while they talk about how much they care about mental health on social media.
