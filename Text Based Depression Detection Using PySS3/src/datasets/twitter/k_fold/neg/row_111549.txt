Happy 30th Birthday.It'll be 30 years in about a month. 30 years of being selfless. 30 years of being in the audience to everybody else's life. 30 years of physical abuse. 30 years of mental abuse. 30 years of being isolated. 30 years of depression. 30 years of loving others. 30 years of being a support system. 30 years of no support. 30 years of of being silence. 30 years of being trapped in a body that I didn't ask for 30 years 30 years of being Black in an anti Black world. 30 years of having dysphoria in a body not even others want 30 years of trying to fix what others broke with no help. 30 years of poverty. 30 years of people feeling bad for me but doing absolutely nothing to change what is. 30 years of multiple disabilities. 30 years without being touched enough. 30 years of being ghosted. 30 years of being everyone best friend. 30 years for being punished for being disabled. 30 years being denied care, empathy, and sympathy from a government that's built on me not mattering. 30 years of eating disorders. 30 years of my life taken from. 30 years of surviving, 30 years of people not listening to me and telling me "it'll get better". When it hasn't. When I told them it would. And it didnt. And they want me to be here for them..and they say "well I would be sad". Fuck yall. How selfish. Here I am telling you how I feel. How I feel like the only reason why I'm here is for others as a stepping stone. And you're response is for me to continue your mountain of support? When do it get that in return? When will I have people see me as I am? You want me here for you. Another 30 years of this for what? How does no one see the issue with this but me?

Im tired Beyond that I'm angry, sad, and hopeless. I'll never get that youth, I'll never have those school days that most cishet folks get. i'll never be able to walk outside and be called she or her. I'll never be able to have people here for me physically like! need. I'll never find real friends to visit and spend time with me frequently, I'll never have a man walk up to me in the store and hit on me and tell me i'm beautiful and our beautiful love story start. I'm obligated to use apps that play more like a popularity contest then finding people to have real connections. I'm obligated to use these out of safety.. And because I am a Black trans women.... I'll still probably be killed. So even if I find love... He'll probably just kill me anyways. 

I wish I wasn't so scared of literally everything. The safest place is my room and I may just get shot by the police anyways. Cuz that's what they do to us.. Thats what we've telling people for hundreds of years.. That no one cares about us.. But still here we are. With people not listening Ive already had a shot gun ready to be pointed at me when someone called the cops on my address (while I was sleeping mind you). I made a promise to someone I love I wouldn't kill myself on my birthday... But I'm gonna be honest.idk if I can keep that promise. I don't know how long I can. I've been in mourning for a long time over my own life. And no one seems to get that my life was already taken from me. I never had a chance. Not in this world. Maybe i'll finally be able to be free and happy in the next life. And if one day I decide to self transition myself there, I'll finally be happy. I'l finally live happily. For me.
