I'm 19 years old and I feel like I won't live past the age of 25I've always been depressed. It is sort of hard to explain but basically I feel like I'm suicidal but not dangerously so yet. It is as if there is a bucket labeled "my failures and fuck-ups" and I can feel the water inside approaching the limit every time a drop is added and right now it is about 3/4 full. I was extremely lonely before and now I have friends. I went to Animazement and hung out with friends and friends of friends and so on and it was around 50 people total and I wasn't lonely one bit. I was always very intelligent but my class rank was one of the lowest in high school because of my ADHD but now I'm in college and I have an Rx for adderall and I'm making straight A's. I had a very traumatic childhood because my dad went out with whores but I cut him out of my life and I'm over it. I don't understand why I'm feeling so depressed when most of my past hindrances have been resolved! I'm worried that life will shovel some more shit in my face and eventually it will be enough to make me end my life. I think suicidal thoughts like how badly I want to jump off the train trestle in my neighborhood just to end it all but I'm still capable of walking away from those types of thoughts. Does anyone have any possible tips on how to make things better?
