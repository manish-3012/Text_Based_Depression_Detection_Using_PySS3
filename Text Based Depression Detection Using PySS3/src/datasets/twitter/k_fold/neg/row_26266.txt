I want to erase myself from existenceSo I'm severely depressed, I have bad anxiety and I'm very suicidal. I hate life. I have completely lost my will to live. I'm 17 and I have some important exams coming up but the thing is I have no idea what I wanna do with my life. I can't get help because my mom doesn't believe me. She thinks that depression is satanic and that I should just be happy. She is controlling, ignorant and never supportive. She's not the only member of my family that is like that. At school almost everybody hates me because I'm an antisocial piece of fuck. Maybe I'm too pessimistic but I really don't think it's gonna get any better. I have no energy or motivation and I'm always tired. What I do have is constant chest and back pains. I'll have random mental breakdowns where I'll bang my head at surfaces and slit my wrists and thighs. Almost every night I cry myself to sleep hoping that I won't wake up the next day. I'm not okay. I just want to die
