HeloCan someone please give me some advice?

I'm a 20 year old girl from the UK.

From 2015-2018 I struggled with severe depression, to the point were i wanted to kill myself but never had the courage to go through with it. 

From about mid 2018-about 2 weeks ago. I was as happy as could be, but recently I have been suicidal again.

I have no reason to be sad. I have a great family who love me, a boyfriend who I've known 8 years who supports me, I'm an apprentice. But I am still so sad on a daily basis.

Sometimes I wake up and think I can do this, then half an hour later I'll be in tears. I'm not eating properly, not sleeping properly. I think I just dont know who I am. I dont know what I want, who i want to be, why am I even here? What is the point anymore? I am just so confused.

I cant escape my thoughts. The harder I try not to think and have a clear mind, the more I think. 

Is it worth living anymore? I dont want to hurt my family but I'm in so much pain.
