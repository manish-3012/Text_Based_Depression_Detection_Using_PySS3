IdkI'm unhappy and I feel alone.
I used to tell myelf that I didnt want to die, I just wanted to be happy but not anymore. Im so tired of waiting for things to get better, I've tried so hard be happy but I'm done believing I can be. I just want to go, but im scared, how can someone want to die so badly and not bring themself to do it. How can someone thig about it everyday and not do it. I cut myself once, my bf said he'd leave me if I did it again. But I think about it everyday, I think about hurting/killing myself everyday.
