Just not really sure anymore...I'm not as heavily focused on suicide as I have been anymore but while my professional life excels(21 and almost in the Academy for corrections officer training) my personal life is killing me in ways I cannot express. I'm with my high school sweetheart I met my senior year of high school and we're engaged, just shy of 4 years in a relationship. I'm thinking that I'm at the very least bi. That's if I felt I needed to put a label on it, what turns me on turns me on. Now I feel as though I need to tell her and I possibly feel the need to explore this. I love her, in ways I thought unimaginable and yet now when we text or talk or spend time together all I feel is anxiety and shame. I don't want to hurt her and yet if this is indeed an avenue I feel compelled to explore I don't feel it's fair to keep her tied to me. Just need some outside sources to talk to. This whole situation is making me stressed, depressed, and hard to enjoy anything in my life from romance and sex, to just playing a goddamn video game. If you've stuck around thanks for the read at the very least
