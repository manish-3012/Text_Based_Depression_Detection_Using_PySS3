"Looking off the the edge and I'm picturing the fallCause I don't want to break my legs and have to carry on,
If I carry on I'm gon need some marijuana,
put it in my bong then I make another song."

-Lil Peep




Just a verse in a song that stuck out to me and wanted to share. Whatever you are going through in life please know that someone loves you.
