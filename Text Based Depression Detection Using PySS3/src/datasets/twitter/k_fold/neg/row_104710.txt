EuthanasiaI cannot remember a time in my life when I was ever really happy. Still, I witness happiness often in others, and kept going as long as I have (I'm in my 20s) on the misguided belief that happiness is a state I would  eventually achieve at some undefined point in the future when I 'figure life out' or 'get the hang of living'. I no longer believe this. I do believe my time is up. I haven't the will to keep going. If the next 20 years are anything like the previous 20 - and I have good reason to believe they will be - deciding to stay would be wilfully punishing myself. I suspect I do not matter enough to those closest to me for any of them to attempt talk me out of topping myself for reasons other than to divest themselves of any potential guilt. I am the only person who gives a shit about me, so topping myself would actually be an act of mercy.
