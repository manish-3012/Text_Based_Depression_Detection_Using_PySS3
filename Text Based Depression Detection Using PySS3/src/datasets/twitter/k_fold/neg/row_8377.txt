How do I make sure my contacts are notified of my death   I don't have a lot of friends. As a matter of fact, I can count the ones I do have on one hand. But, I'd like my parents to be able to notify these friends upon my death. Is there a way I can take the lock off my phone (galaxy s7) so that my parents can access it and notify who they want to notify? I've never been so calm. I am ready to go. I tried to OD once and I failed. This time I won't fail and if I don't succeed, I won't have to deal with the fallout if I fail because I will be brain dead.


I am calm. I am ready to die. When I tried the first time, I was nervous. Now, my hands are steady. Palms are dry. 


Just tell me how to unlock my phone so my parents can have that peace.
