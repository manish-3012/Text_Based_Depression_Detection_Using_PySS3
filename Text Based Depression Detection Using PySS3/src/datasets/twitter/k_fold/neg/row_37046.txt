I don't care about anything.I don't care about my family, my friends, my girlfriend, i dont think ive ever really cared about another human being.  I dont care about money, education, what kind of job i have, i dont care about anything material.  The only thing ive ever loved is art, and i just dont care anymore.   Even if i dont kill myself what kind of a fucking life is that.
