I am sadI dont really know if im suicidal. I dont want to waste anyones time. I really dont like living. At least right now. I feel like i dont want to die cause i have loved ones i dont want to hurt. I find existing uncomfortable. Everything I think is stupid, everything i say is asinine, everything i do is wrong.  
  
I checked the Samaritans website to see if I was really suicidal and all the things they listed as risk worthy is how ive felt for weeks. Years. Ive always found suicide a relaxing thought.  
  
Every night in bed I tend to fantasize about a thin magical metal 3ft spike, floating above me and impaling me in the head, or eye or chest and somehow causing no pain. And just ending it.  
  
Sometimes I don't even know if it's that, I want to die, but instead I deserve to die. That I deserve to be in pain. And I deserve to be miserable. Maybe that's my lot.  
  
I'm cowardly. And my moods can swing. I will probably delete this. I don't know. Sorry.
