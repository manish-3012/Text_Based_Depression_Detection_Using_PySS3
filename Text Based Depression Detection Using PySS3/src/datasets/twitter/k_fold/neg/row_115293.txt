Unpopular opinion: Suicidal people are not necessarily mentally ill and the way we treat them is horrible.We need to stop stigmatizing suicidal people by identifying them all as mentally ill or depressed. Many suicidal people are not mentally ill and have perfectly rational reasons and irretractible life curcumstances leading to their attitude. Some are chronically ill with a debilitating painful permanent or terminal illness, or a ruined livelihood with a serious criminal record. We need to stop locking them up in oppressive environments in psych wards with the rest of the violent criminally insane and drug addicts. We need to stop forcing them to take toxic chemicals  that are likely to make their physical illness even worse. We need to stop sending the police after them - If they are already on the cusp of deciding whether to live, then a criminal record and a beatdown on the way to being drugged isnt going to help at all. The whole way  we treat the suicidal (and the mentally ill) seems like unconstitutional human rights violations and war crimes.
