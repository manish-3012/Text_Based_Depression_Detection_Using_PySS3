PlanI have a plan to commit suicide. I have struggled with bipolar disorder and I am too scared to tell anyone about it. nobody knows that I am struggling with alcohol and drug addiction. Iâ€™m not happy if Iâ€™m not drunk or high, and even then I donâ€™t enjoy life. I am 18 years old, but I am already tired of life. I never feel safe in this world and I could never trust anyone. my dad has never understood mental illness and always told me to just get over it but i feel the only way to "get over" it would be to just die
