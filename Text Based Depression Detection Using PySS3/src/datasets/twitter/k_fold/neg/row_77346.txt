Donâ€™t really know how to title this but I think I am suicidal.I remember how I used to be, and I am none of that. I know some people would say change is good, but not the way I changed. I liked who I was. I was happy every day and rarely sad, not sad everyday and rarely happy. I wish I had no one now so I could end it all without thinking about how much Iâ€™m hurting those who love me. I donâ€™t care about anything and I am living for my parents everyday and I just do whatever it is thatâ€™ll make them happy. Rn, itâ€™s going to community college and studying all day and even though Iâ€™m doing well and they get happy when they see my grades it doesnâ€™t do anything to me. I just want to die. I have friends and I have hobbies that I like, but it doesnâ€™t change how badly I want to die. If this continues Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll get so mentally exhausted that I wonâ€™t be willing OR able to do college work after this semester, and I will have to dropout. Nothing I have ever done has made my parents as proud as a few good test grades and Iâ€™m really scared I wonâ€™t be able to do that anymore. I love my mom dad and sister so much and I donâ€™t understand why they are stuck with me. I am beyond lost. I have times where I feel really good for 2 or 3 weeks, but it devastates me knowing that even on my best day if I was offered a clean way to die without hurting anyone I would take it in a heartbeat. I canâ€™t even think of my own face a few years ago in my head without tearing up. I genuinely feel like there is someone/something fucking with me like why am I given life if all I think about and want is death. Help
