I Don't Like To ExistSo I am 14 years old and don't like being alive. I have a family that loves me very much (I am angered at my parents, however, for being so selfish and creating a sentient being), and although my family has suspected I may be depressed, I have put their fears to rest by watching what I say and stating I was fine when asked. Yesterday, my weight system failed and I was unable to drown myself in my bathtub, and although I have revised my plan to make it more likely to work I started having second thoughts. However, these two statements from my suicide note sum up my emotions: "I have chosen to not be self-deceptive. Why do people play video games? To be in control. But this control is imaginary. The only way to have control over life is through death. I will procrastinate no longer." and "Life is a cruel game. Why torture yourself and make you have the illusion of self worth when there is really nothing there? You are nothing, just an irrelevant mass of organic matter. Your personality is made up of solely chemical reactions in your body, past experiences, and the environment. And yet there is such a clear and accessible option to cheat at the Game of Life: Trick the system and forfeit." I have come to discover that to do what I wish, I need a justification that I am not just an idiot driven to depression. Also, I would like a logical counter-argument on why not to die, if anybody has one?
