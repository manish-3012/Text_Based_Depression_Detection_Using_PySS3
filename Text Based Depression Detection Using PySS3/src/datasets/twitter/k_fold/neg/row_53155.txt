I'm Stuck, Please Help [advice/motivation]**IMPORTANT**

My situation may not seem that bad to a lot of people but I feel like my world is about to end. If you don't have anything good to say, please don't say anything because it will only make me feel more garbage. A lot of people are going to compliment my grades or whatever but I feel like what I have achieved is not good enough for me because I didn't try my best.

**Background** 

***Short Version: I got bullied and everyone hated me.***

***Long Version b/c its thereputic, please read if you can:*** It all started in 7th grade, when I moved. I moved into what people would consider a low-income community. I come from a middle/upper-middle class community. most people think that I am spoiled but my parents never raised me that way. My dad was always harsh on me and always criticized me for being disorganized or lazy (even though the things I did was considered normal for most kids at my age). I would almost never sleep in on the weekends. Rather, I would study mathematics that was above my grade level. I was never an exceptional student during elementary school but my dad forced me to work hard to get where I am (which I thank him for). I was extremely motivated and wanted to make something out of my life. I had ambiotons which would get me far in life. I immigrated to the U.S. because my dad got a promotion and I was the "weird kid" but I didn't think much of it. I was an extremely extroverted and opionated person and I didn't care what people thought of me. When I moved in 7th grade, I was automatically cast out. I moved in 2 weeks after school started and the school that I went to was very small and everyone there already knew each other. I couldn't find anyone like me. Everyone there critcized being bold and I was considered "immature." Girls in middle school already had sexual intercourse at the age of 12 and some of them smoked week or were affiliated with gangs. Everyone thought I was a spoiled brat because to most of the people there I was a "rich kid" and had everything handed to me. To be honest though, I probably worked 10 times harder than most of the kids there. I worked hard to earn good grades and I didn't spend my parents money by buying the newest Air Jordans every week. The worst part about all of this was that I kept my extroverted personality, but no one cared about what I had to say because I was different from them. Eight grade rolled around and I made a friend who was actually suicidal. She cut herself but I couldn't understand why. She would always talk about how her parents abused her and how the neighborhood she grew up in had a lot of gang shootings. It was very overwhelming for me and sort of uncomfortable. Nonetheless, I tried to help her to the best of my abilities. My only other friend was another girl who was an "edgy person." I was highly influenced by their style and wanted to become the quiet, shy kid who no one paid attention to.

**Backgroud Part 2**

***Short version: I had it all but I wasn't challenged enough.***

***Long Version:*** I went in to high school with a very unhealthy mindset. It was simple I wanted to change myself so that no one would pay attention to me and I didn't want any friends. I wanted to stay by myself and only focus on my work. When I walked into my honors pre-calculus class as a freshman, a junior asked me if I was in the wrong class, as I was the only freshman taking that class. I later decided to switch out the study hall that I was given with biology. So to sum up, I was a freshman taking: Honors Pre-Calculus, Biology, and Chemistry.....and the upper-classmen HATED IT. For the first 2 months I was described as an overly confident, annoying person. The funniest part was none of them had talked to me for more thatn 10 minutes. I was the "try-hard" that everyone hated. This time though, I made a big group of friends, who appreciated my extrovertedness and bold personality. They still weren't my type of people 100%, but they were better than nothing. At this point my mindset was "I guess my plan was bound to fail." My social situation was as described: The sophomores, juniors, and seniors hated me and my freshman class respected me enough, so much that they were scared to talk to me. I tried hard in all of my classes semester 1 but they still weren't pushing me enough. I am the tyope of person that works smarter, not harder. Things were still too easy and so I slacked off but still managed to get straight A's. I could get away with sleeping in class but still mange to get a 95% on the test the next day. I got in a relationship with someone from my math tutoring class (that didn't help me because I knew everything in the class, but my parents still forced me to go). This was the first time someone had asked me out, or even thought I was pretty (later I found out a lot of guys would rate me an 8/10, btw I'm not trying to brag this is just what people have told me). So I startewd dating him. he was a great guy, until he brought up his "ex" (he never actually dated her, he just lied to my face). I was asking him to transalate a song in his native language and he said it remined him of his ex and unsent the message. Normally, I would be furious and end it right there and then but for some unknown reason, I said it was okay. I thought "he could still think his ex is pretty but be faithful to me (WRONG) and it was also kind of my fault for asking who was prettied after he mentioned her." To be frank with you though, I was a pretty good girlfriend *(ex. I looked at memes with him, I encouraged him gaming, often times he would even cancel out scheduled FaceTimes to go game and I completely suported it because I knew how important it was to him, I even helped him with his Biology assignment, like what more do you want?! I'm short (5'3") (but he was pretty short for a guy (\~5'6")) and I have long legs (50% of my body, the ideal ratio), I have "big titties" (D), a 0.7 (ideal, hourglass) waist to hip ratio (24-34) and a 0.68 waist to butt ratio (not the biggest but a bit above average, no acne, long culry silky hair, long lashes, "nice eyebrows", almond shaped eyes, basically I don't need makeup to look pretty, most guys would say I am above average, I'm taking advanced classes and have a 4.0 GPA, I am considered popular, and your friends and parents like me)* Anyways, after 10 months, I decided I had enough of his lack of commitment I was always putting in more than I got back and he was never down to do anything but go to the mall and talk (not even buy food or watch a movie). I broke up with him, but because of this relationship  I distracted myself from my priorities. I felt so empty because eveything ahead of me was so uncertain, was I going to make it to my dream university? And after that, was I going to make it big in my profession of choice? I don't want to be rich, I want to be comfortable. I don't want a mansion, I want a clean apartment/house and I want to be financially stable enough to pay my medical bils, groceries etc. I don't want to buy designer clothing, I want to buy something at a reasonable price that I would look good on me. I don't want to buy a luxury car. I am okay with using public transport, walking, or biking.

**PRESENT**

***Short Version: Long Vesion: I feel like garbage because I fucked up my grades last semester and got a notice for plagarism.***

***Long version:***  I feel like garbage because I fucked up my grades last semester (I got 2 B+'s and 1 A-'s its kinda ok because I'm taking 4 AP classes as a sophomore??) and got a plagarism thing recorded permenantly for copying like 5 sentences of HOMEWORK. And rn I feel like a useless piece of garbage because my dad disowned me and won't even spare a glance at me. I have absolutely no motivation and want to end it because I hate the feeling of uncertainity in my future. I feel there is no way to fix the damage I have done. I also like someone who is completely off limits and I want to stop liking him because it is killing me on the inside and I don't want us to get in trouble because of my stupidity.
