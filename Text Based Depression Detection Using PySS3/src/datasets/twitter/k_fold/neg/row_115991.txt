Hopeless.Nothing Iâ€™ve done helps me feel better. Things seem eerie and dark and endless, and Iâ€™m thinking about killing myself probably 100 times a day. Itâ€™s all I can seem to think clearly about, itâ€™s the only thing that seems real or possible. Itâ€™s all I want. I think of all the other things I used to want and it all seems so pointless. Thereâ€™s no joy or relief to be found in anything but sleep, and I canâ€™t even do that for more than an hour at a time. Gaming, sometimes, when I can throw myself into a different life. 

I used to vent through art, or writing, but I have no desire for either anymore. I used to read all the time, but I canâ€™t focus on anything anymore for more than a minute. Life these days feels like itâ€™s saturated in darkness. 

I mentioned something the other day to my mom. I said that most of the people in our family are depressive, and she said itâ€™s just the blues. I felt offended, but? Maybe itâ€™s true. Because I donâ€™t even cry. Itâ€™s easy to step out of my room and be the person that everyone thinks I am. I smile and joke and laugh and clean and cook and play with the dogs and then when I have space I just sit and wait to find the courage to just end it. 

Do people who arenâ€™t depressed struggle like this? Do you think about suicide this much? I hear that sometimes itâ€™s okay, because thinking about it is just a coping mechanism. I donâ€™t know.
