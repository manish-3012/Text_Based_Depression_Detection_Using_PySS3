Some days I just feel â€˜doneâ€™Iâ€™m done with trying to make friends 
Iâ€™m done with trying to hold down a job 
Done with trying to go to class 
Done with acting like nothings wrong 
Done with pretending to be normal around everyone 
Done with trying not to cry all the time 
Done with seeming like I understand when people canâ€™t be there with me 
Done letting things go when I really shouldnâ€™t 


I took a few sleeping pills. Time to sleep off the day. Sleeping is like time travel. 
Who gives a shit?
