I'm tired of trying and just feeling more lonely. I'm a piece of shit who doesn't deserve anyone and I just want to die already.Nobody would care if I just died I'm a jobless, college dropout, no friends, closeted overweight trans girl. I'm such a piece of shit I just want the misery to end but I don't know when does it all just fucking go away I'm so fucking tired. I hate myself so much fuck me I just can't do this anymore
