Can't stop thinking about killing myselfDeleted all my stuff today, gave away my belongings, holding onto one last connection but I feel it fading and I don't know if it's my depression pushing them away or if it's something I'm overthinking and I've pushed myself away again. I tell myself everyday how things would be better, make plans, then I get sad and sleep.  


I need cake.
