InsanityGirlfriend broke up with me.  I put alot of my feelings onto her that I suppressed.  She has her own problems she didn't tell me about, then said we needed time.

And here she is, now dating someone else.  

I dont know why I expected anything different.

I continue to be fucked around with, then cast aside.  I walk forward, and I stumble.

Im tired of getting back up.  People at work telling me to kill myself because I ask for their help doing basic tasks.  Supposed friends abandoning me in my time of need.  

My wrists are blank slates, and there are carvings among them.  

I know what I am.

Alone.  Hollow.  Pariah.  

Amongst the living, I feel dead.  Why not join the dead?  All my pain will go away.

Life is a gift, but I can't give it to someone else.  I know people around me would be devastated, but if I've seen anything over the years, its that I can be replaced.  Temporary mourning, then continuation.

If life is strength, and strength is death, what is death, if not hope?
