Help! Found someone who appears to be suicidal and begging for help. I don't know what to say.[It's from this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/FamiliesYouChoose/comments/6kmrn9/going_to_commit_suicide_soon_and_i_just_wnt/). From what I can see, this guy has been posting heavily asking about suicide methods, and discussing trauma in his life. He doesn't seem to get many responses, if any.

Please guys, someone help me talk to him.
