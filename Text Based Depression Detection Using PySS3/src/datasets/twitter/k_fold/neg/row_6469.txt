I'm getting tired of all of thisI am sick of the nonexistent mental health services that my country pretends exist. I am tired of all the aimless and shallow nonsense that fills up everyday life, all the propaganda and backwards self serving shit. I cannot even live properly without headaches and generally ailing health. There is simply nothing to live for
