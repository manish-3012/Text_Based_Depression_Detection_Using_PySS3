Going to kill myself right nowI'm done being depressed, I'm genuinely sick to my stomach when I see other people happy and I'm constantly miserable, and if I show any sign of grimace I'm expected to "man-up". I always have to be fake to people and I'm tired of trying with every fucking single god damned fiber in my being to be nice, to be orderly, to do the right thing in the right moment, and getting fucked every god damned turn by every fucking piece of shit. This world will eat you alive, the only way to escape it, is to be born rich, or to be born lucky. I'm going to shoot myself in the head with a shotgun and fall backwards off this building to ensure I die. Goodbye.
