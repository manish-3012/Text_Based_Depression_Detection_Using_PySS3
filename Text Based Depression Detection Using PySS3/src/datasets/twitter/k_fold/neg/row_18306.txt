Can you be identified if you travel to another country?Just theoretically if you travel from one EU country to another and die there for some reason without any documents, what are the chances you will be identified? Are they going to do an EU wide DNA match because I don't see another way? I mean... everyone has donated blood and done blood tests. Maybe there is a huge database where they store this info although it should be private.
