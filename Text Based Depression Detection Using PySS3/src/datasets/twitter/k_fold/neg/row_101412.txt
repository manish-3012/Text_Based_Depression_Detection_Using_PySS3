I should just die, all I do is waste time and opportunities for the false hope that people think I will follow through with them. Iâ€™m going to end up nowhere.Havenâ€™t been doing my homework, havenâ€™t been studying or practicing driving so I can get a license, I havenâ€™t been helping my mom around the house, all Iâ€™ve been doing is sitting on my ass when I get home from school playing games. I can barely take care of myself and donâ€™t know how to cook and load dishes into a dish washer. Iâ€™m typing this out at 1 am when I have school the next day. All I do is nothing and disappoint people. I get given opportunities for myself and donâ€™t follow through with them and in turn waste peoples time. My closest friends ditched me because I wouldnâ€™t listen to them pointing out what I was doing wrong and kept repeating the same rude and controlling behavior. 

I should just fucking end my life. â€œStop giving me stressâ€ says my mom, then Iâ€™ll just die, you wonâ€™t have to worry about me wasting your money on stupid game related things, impacting your sleep, and not following with chores around the house. I deserve to just fucking die. All I do is leech off of people. Iâ€™m only happy when Iâ€™m around other people. I only am able to function when Iâ€™m with other people. Iâ€™m only able to do my school work that I get at school and fail to do any outside of school work. 

Iâ€™m sick of being told Iâ€™m being stressful and not doing my responsibilities. I hate myself for making my closest friends hurt by me being a toxic friend and having to cut contact with me for their own emotional sake. I really have no worth. I quite literally have no reason to be alive. No one does in the first place. Sure, my few other friends and family might be impacted if I am dead but as time goes on they will be able to cope with it and they will be dead eventually too, and Iâ€™ll just be forgotten like the other billions of people who have existed. Lifeâ€™s meaningless. Iâ€™m meaningless and a hinderance to other peopleâ€™s lives. I want to die. Every day I inch closer to feeling less afraid of it and thinking more about it. Every day I get temporary happiness and then fail at the important things. I have no close relationships. I really just want to end it all.
