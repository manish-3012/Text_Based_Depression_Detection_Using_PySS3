So lonely not being able to tell anyoneI've been having intrusive depressive thoughts lately, "I'm going to fucking off myself". Like I wouldn't /actually/ do it. But they're constantly there lately. And I can't tell anyone, because I don't want to be hospitalized or anything like that. Because I'm not actually going to.

But fuck, dude. I'm not doing well.
