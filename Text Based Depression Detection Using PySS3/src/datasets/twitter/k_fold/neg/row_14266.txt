I'm honestly soo lost and not even sure what to do anymore.I'm 21 years old and i have strabismus (its similar to lazy eye) and i honestly feel as if it has ruined my life and i don't really want to continue living if the surgery i will have soon doesn't work but i also do not want to cause my family any trauma and i really need help.  

I have had this problem with my appearance since i was 1 year old and i suffered so much bullying in my school years because of it. I have also never been in a reltionship or know what it's like to have mutual feelings with someone. I have friends but i don't spend much time with them because of social anxiety. I feel as if my youth has been robbed from me because of this stupid eye problem. I feel like my life will not be getting any better if i continue to live with this problem.  

 I have been working and have saved money for 2 years to try to get it fixed with surgery , if my eye problem is fixed, then i can begin to try and fix my emotional damage and my underdeveloped social skills but if it does not work, i am not even sure how i can continue to live like this. (the doctor has told me that it is likely not going to work)  please help me. I don't want to die but i feel like its my only option
