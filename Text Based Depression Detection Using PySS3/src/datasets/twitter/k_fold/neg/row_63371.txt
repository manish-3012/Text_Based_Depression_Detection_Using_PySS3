Such a painI am a high school freshman in a third world country, I not only have to put up with mental scars, depression and stress but also piling amounts of shameless homework and studying I have to do, that I have absolutely no motivation or willpower to... people who will remain nothing but sadists and/or who are terrible at their job and don't want to be good at it dictate what you will do and what you will have outside of school, increasing the already giant difference between the odds of a 15 year old from a third world country becoming a youtuber compared to a 20 year old from the US doing that, and if I don't do the unreasonable amounts of school work I have to, I feel so depressed, worthless and like a failure
