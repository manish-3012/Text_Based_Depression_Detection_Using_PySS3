May 1stI've been thinking about doing this for two years at least. Now it has come down to this, this year I have gotten around to the date without anything getting in the way. Even though I'm only fifteen I don't believe there is a future or hope for me. 

For maybe two weeks now though I've felt happier but I know it won't last. If I don't decide to do it that day I will change it to May 8th. It's like my brain is trying to play a trick on me by making me feel happier last minute and question what I am about to do. 

Most of my own problems I got myself into and created. I cannot go back in time to try and solve them, I cannot be the person I have wanted to be all of my life.
