Ahaha I want to dieeeeFr tho,, my scars are fading too early,, as if I didnâ€™t cut deep enough like they said to. I donâ€™t know if I have insurance so I canâ€™t ask to get help,, I just want to go to the roof. Falling looks so peaceful.. itâ€™s also all of the transphobia,, the constant dead-naming. The constant misgendering.. itâ€™s all bullsh*t.
