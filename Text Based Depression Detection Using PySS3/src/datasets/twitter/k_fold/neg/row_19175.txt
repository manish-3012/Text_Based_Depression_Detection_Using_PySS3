I Live Beyond the MelancholyWhat I mean is I live in a place beyond sadness, beyond will, beyond the depths of everything that kept me human. Itâ€™s beyond not just not feeling but also not being present. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t exist or maybe I do and nothing else does. Nothing really affects me anymore. 

Itâ€™s to the point where Iâ€™ve tried doing drugs and drinking to do anything but it just makes me feel either flat or like Iâ€™m sinking. During the past school year my school has been threatened to be shot up and bombed (separate occasions) but it didnâ€™t bother me. No risk even occurred to me even when I tried. Nobody ever talks to me and the last time I really felt anything was when a good friend was moving and their last word about me was â€œyou know, youâ€™re too sad all the time.â€ Now I sneak out when I canâ€™t sleep which isnâ€™t often cause I usually sleep close to 14 hours a day. I spend most of my money on drugs just cause it might bring me something to experience. 

I have rope in my closet if I ever want to leave and honestly Iâ€™m not sure why I havenâ€™t already. Thereâ€™s nowhere to go. Not down or up. I donâ€™t cry no matter how much I try and I canâ€™t get anyoneâ€™s attention to possibly just give me a hug or maybe Iâ€™m just that unbearable. Iâ€™m not scared that Iâ€™m not liked and even hated by some people and in fact Iâ€™m extremely passive about it. I wish I could just be worth a dime to someone. Even that statement is part of the problem. I become physically sick and disgusted with myself whenever I get physically or emotionally invested with people one on one. It frustrates me but not even emotionally, just mentally. Fucking Christ I just want to drag a razor across my face. I want to rip myself open and tear the meat right off my hands with my teeth. Someone has to die here and I think itâ€™s gonna be me.
