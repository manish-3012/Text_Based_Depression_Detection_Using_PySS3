I feel so lonelyI've been feeling really lonely the past couple weeks. Usually it doesn't hit me this hard because I have my dog and she goes with my everywhere.
It's just I feel I'm too much for people or not at all. I'm really distant unless I'm comfortable then I get too much for people and we stop hanging out. This has happened countless times. 
If I don't message the conversation dies and we won't talk for weeks or months. I understand people are busy, but an effort is never made on other people's part. 
I'm just sort of "there" in peoples lives, but not really. My boss constantly calls me by another co-workers name and a different one doesn't even know it. I've been there for awhile now. Everyone at my job is pretty close and they joke around. I just don't understand what I'm doing wrong even outside of work. I'm trying so hard. 

I've been mentally checked out for a couple weeks and it's all hitting me hard right now. I'm really tired, and want this feeling to go away.
