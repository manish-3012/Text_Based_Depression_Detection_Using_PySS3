I hate my life, I'm gonna end itEven if I don't kill myself I'll be dead by 18 from starvation, dehydration or whatever else someone could be vulnerable to while homeless.

I can't land a fucking job, &amp; I'm almost 18. I was fine with my parents planning to kick me out &amp; leaving me for death, but I'm not OK with having no savings at all. I've never had any money in my entire life, &amp; every time I apply for a job, I never get any responses. It's been years, I've done everything that was recommended I do before applying. I've volunteered, I have references (one of which includes the fucking MAYOR of my town), but I've still never even gotten an interview.

I thought about turning to illegal ways to make money, but I feel like suicide will be better on my conscience. Fuck the world!
