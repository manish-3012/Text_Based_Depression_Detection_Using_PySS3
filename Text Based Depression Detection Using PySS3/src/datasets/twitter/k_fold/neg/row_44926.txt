I don't want to live anymoreI'm an awful person. I get into arguements with my parents a lot. I force myself to sleep to avoid any confrontation. I hate how I am. I get angry at myself for trying to reach out to a friend or anyone because I feel like I'm exaggerating everything and I'm attention seeking. I just want to end it all. I really want to die. I'm just too much of a coward to do it.
