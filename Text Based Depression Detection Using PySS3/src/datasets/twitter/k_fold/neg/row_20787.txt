I guess you canâ€™t post pictures here. Wrote a note and wanted to share it. Iâ€™m not going to do it tonight, but this is the closest Iâ€™ve ever been.Iâ€™m in so much pain. I did something Iâ€™ve never done before and wrote a note, just 1 broad one to my family. Short. Mostly, donâ€™t forgive me, just move on with your life. If you are angry, try to let it go. Find comfort in knowing I am no longer suffering, and can no longer cause any hurt or worry to anyone else. Itâ€™s better this way. And then some details on my illness.

Iâ€™m not going to do it tonight. But holy fuck I do feel a lot closer, and that kind of sick relief that comes with knowing an end is in sight. 

I realize too, there are some people out there who do know how much I am suffering. They do nothing. I need so much help, get none. Soldier on by myself, with no answers, no treatment. If this was a world worth living in, wouldnâ€™t those people at least call, express support, try to encourage me to live? They donâ€™t. People only care about themselves. I typically think, I canâ€™t do this to my parents. But youâ€™re parents just want you to be â€œokâ€ enough that they feel theyâ€™ve done their job. Mine are so used to chaos and problems, maybe theyâ€™d find peace, in my absence. Iâ€™m 36, Iâ€™ve lasted a while. If I had a spouse or children, itâ€™d be different. I do feel bad for the pain Iâ€™ll cause other people, but not as bad as I feel for myself for feeling and thinking and living and being the way I am. 

Iâ€™m crying those kind of painful, silent, build up in your chest and head tears that make your face and sinuses feel like they want to explode. I canâ€™t see any light. Maybe itâ€™s meant to be?
