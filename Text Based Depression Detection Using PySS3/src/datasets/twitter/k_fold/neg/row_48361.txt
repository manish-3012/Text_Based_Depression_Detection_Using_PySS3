Just need to writeIve been planning to kill myself everyday since monday. I wrote the suicide note and i know where i will do it. I procastinate at bed and tell 'ill do it tomorrow' tho. 

i have been depressed with anorexia for more than 10 years. My mother has some mental health issues too and those affected my teen years. I have never been motivated to keep living. 

Since last year i have been going to a public theraphy almost everyday but now they kick me out because im worse and not improving. If even theraphist tell me that idk, im really wothless lmao. 

I tried to kill myself sometimes this year but failed. Also the man i love killed himself this summer and that affected me a lot. 

Hope tomorrow i can do it. As seen in another post, i fear to hurt my family and my only friend tho.

Just a rant. Thank you.
