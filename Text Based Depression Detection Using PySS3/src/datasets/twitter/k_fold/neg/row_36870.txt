It's just one thing after another.First I got an std, almost killed myself, but found an online dating community that Gave me hope

Started somewhat seeing a guy that didn't have it we didn't have sex but I Gave him a hand job and Oral sex. He went to get checked out after warts appeared on his penis but the doctor said he doesn't have it. However I'm convinced he does. That place cleared me once when they shouldn't have. He's about to start dating another girl now and I'm freaking out. He doesn't belive he has it and just wants to sleep with her. I feel I'm going to be responsible for ruining 2 lives right now.

The guy above had bed bugs at his place. I have bites all over my body. I moved into a nice place and spread it there after I let him stay there. I couldn't live there anymore so I moved back into my parents big house and now they're here as well... My parents are going in vacation  and 3 siblings are gonna be moving and they could very likely spread it to those places. Plus my brother is babysitting a friends cat and the cat could be affected.

I can't get a job and my parents are paying for everything.

The worst part is it feels like this isn't even close to being rock bottom yet.

Idk if I'm suicidal but I just want This all to end. I'm already at my limit and things are just starting to get bad.
