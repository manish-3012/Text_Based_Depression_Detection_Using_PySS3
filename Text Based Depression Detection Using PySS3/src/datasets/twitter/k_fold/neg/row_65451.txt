Suicide DestinyDoes anyone else feel like they were destined to kill themselves or maybe just die in general? I see a lot of people who were successful in life talk about they knew they were destined to do big things and I feel like that also except that my life wasnâ€™t setup for greatness but has been setup to basically kill myself? I donâ€™t know how to describe it I guess itâ€™s I just donâ€™t see a direction my life is headed in except suicide or death. I do have one thing keeping me alive but that could end any day due to a freak accident.
