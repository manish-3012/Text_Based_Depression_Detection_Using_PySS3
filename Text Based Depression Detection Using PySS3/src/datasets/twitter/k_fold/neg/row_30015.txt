My friend just wants to die, I've got no ideas left how to help them.To preface this, I've called various suicide hotlines and discussed with family/friends, but still have no idea what to do. Even if someone could tell me where to go to find help for them that would be a massive help.

I have a friend, Kevin, who has severe depression and has attempted suicide in the past (about 3 months ago). This resulted in him being held in a mental institution involuntary for a week, which he hated. He said he didn't want to talk to any therapists, got discharged from his one since, and hasn't found antidepressants to have a significant effect on him. Also, he and a mutual friend (Josh) share very nihilistic world views, believing in antinatalism and similar philosophies. These basically view the world as suffering, then say that suffering could be stopped if we never were born in the first place, so ideally we should all die out and that assisted suicide should be legal for philosophical reasons. Kevin also has never been openly emotional about his depression with any of us, although he does sometimes talk deeply with Josh.

We all recently graduated high school and Kevin seemed to be doing alright, confirmed by him when I asked about his depression, but that doesn't seem to be the case. He sent a text to all of us about 2 weeks ago, detailing his depression and emotions. He talked about have to put up a mask to leave the mental hospital, that he carried this mask on to school, but it slips easily leading to panic attacks and weeping to the point of vomiting. He also plans (maybe fantasies, but Josh said he had seriously been talking to him about it) to jump off a bridge when he starts uni. At the end of the text he said it's a very selfish act, but he will not talk to us anymore as excitement in his life always leads to disappointment.

When I received the text, I had no idea what to do. I wouldn't want to send him back to the mental institution, as it seemed to make him worse if anything, which he also detailed in his text. He wasn't in immediate danger of suicide either, with this plan, and I know he is still alive currently. I talked to Josh, but he was complacent with letting him die, as they have discussed life together in such a negative way their whole life. I think he would also like to commit suicide but doesn't want to go through with it, especially as it can't be assisted. I was almost convinced by this argument of him being in suffering and letting him out of it, but I can't sit easy with that. I called various suicide hotlines, who didn't give much help other than suggesting group therapy, different pills, and trying to get his name off me. They also urged me to call the police if I thought he was in danger, which I almost did, but he isn't in direct danger/I don't think I could live with myself if I got him involuntary held going crazy in a mental institution. Eventually, the second and final mutual friend decided to tell  his siblings/mother. We sent them the text, along with an explanation of the situation, with the logic that they were/would be close to him in the future, so they'd be the best people to know. This is how I knew he was safe, they told me he was just in his room, but he hasn't replied to any of us since. I assume he's still alive now, they haven't messaged me, but they're on a family holiday for a month so I don't want to disturb them and ask about Kevin (they're also going to see his dad, who has been out of their lives for \~5 years).

We've all been texting him since, just as normal, sending memes and that kind of thing. His family urged us to keep talking to him even if he didn't reply. I initially sent a very heartfelt message to him but that kind of thing has never worked in the past due to his lack of emotional openness with us. But I have absolutely no idea what to do now. They get back from holiday in a few weeks, but I imagine he still won't be talking to us. We were planning to go on a tramp with a fourth friend, something Kevin has never done, but he was seemingly keen to try it. I was thinking about going to his house and asking him to come on the tramp, saying that we miss him (which we do) and that kind of thing. This is because I think there might be a chance for him to see the world as a place for adventure and beauty once he leaves home, so it would maybe kickstart that or something, and break his isolation from us. If anyone has any thoughts, please share, I don't know what I can do except let him die, which I don't want to do. After reading the talking tips in the sub, I realize my messages may have been trying to give advice too much, I don't know what to say though. He's not the kind of person to accept generic advice about trying to see things in a good way, he doesn't care. Is there a counsellor or someone I could talk to who would actually understand this and work through it instead of trying to put him in hospital/looking at the world through rose glasses? By that I mean institutional methods are not a fix all, they haven't seemed to have helped him at all, I just need to find something to do. Thank you, any advice would be greatly appreciated.
