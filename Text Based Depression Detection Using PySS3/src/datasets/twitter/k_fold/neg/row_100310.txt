My update on my planI made a post not too terribly long ago about how I intend to kill myself on my birthday. Itâ€™s coming up fast and, as I expected, nothing is getting better. I hate my damn life. The one person I even talked to is ignoring me, now. I mustâ€™ve said something or did something. Either way, Iâ€™m sorry. Fuck my family, theyâ€™re all pieces of shit who I hate greatly. The only one Iâ€™ll miss is my sister. My dog wonâ€™t understand why Iâ€™ll never come home, one day. Iâ€™ll miss him so much, heâ€™s a good boy. But I canâ€™t take it. I canâ€™t do it. This giant hole of emptiness and loneliness can never be cured or filled and it consumes me, everyday. I wanna either OD or hang myself. Both are options. Iâ€™ll likely OD. Just a little more than a month away until itâ€™s time. I havenâ€™t been on this planet for very long and itâ€™s already been proven to me that life is terrible and unfair and that nothing will ever get better. I guess Iâ€™m sorry, strangers of Reddit, if Iâ€™m just being a whiny bitch. I needed some place to let it out.
