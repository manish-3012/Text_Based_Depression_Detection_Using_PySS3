I wanna die but Iâ€™m terrified of failingâ€¦Can anyone else relate? I wanted to give myself until the end of the year, and if I still couldnâ€™t take living anymore Iâ€™d finally let myself OD, but Iâ€™m so scared I wonâ€™t die and then my life will become ten times worse. Yk hospitalization, my friends finding out what I did, etc. Iâ€™ve been browsing this sub reading so many horror stories of people still living even with pretty high doses and now Iâ€™m scared :(
