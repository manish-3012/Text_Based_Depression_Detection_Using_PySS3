What do you live for?I guess it's not the best place to ask this question, but I also can't think of other people who would take it seriously. 

So a little about me. I've been struggling with this emptiness for around two years. I feel that if I died now or in 50 years, that would change nothing. My life is basically 30% of mild contentment and 70% of feeling empty. The only times I feel happy is during my workouts or just after them. 

I study some useless shit that I do not care about. I have some friends, but none that are close to me. My family is great, but I wouldn't say we're close either. There's an issue with me I guess, I'm afraid to open up to people. But how can I be different? 

You had that experience, too. You finally open up to somebody, as you can no longer keep it inside. And they give you *that look.* A few times you get burnt like that and you stop trying.

I don't blame them, though. How could they understand?

I lost touch with my emotions. I feel like an island. The only things I seem to feel is mild contentment, stillness and sometimes deep emptiness mixed with sadness. I think the reason for all of this is that I have no purpose to life.

You know, some people have children. Some believe in God. Others have hope that one day they will find a SO. I have nothing. 

And the worst thing is, I feel ashamed of feeling this way. On surface I have everything. Good grades, a loving family, some friends, good looks... Nothing *bad* happened in my life. I have it in the 1% of luck. And still there's something missing. 

I don't want to kill myself, at least not now. But if I could go to sleep and not wake up... I guess I'd take it. 

Anyways, something keeps me here. I don't know yet what it is, but I have this feeling that one day I'll get to know. And maybe then life will have a little bit more sense.

But back to you: What do you live for? Maybe you could share how you got to know what it is? I'll be very grateful. Thank you for reading, kind stranger. I hope somebody will smile at you today.
