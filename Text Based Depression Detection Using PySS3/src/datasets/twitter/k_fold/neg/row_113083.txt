Sex Addict Needing Support, SoonI'm a sex addict needing support.

I can't keep living like this. If anyone knows of a hotline I can call that will either help me find meetings in my area (or via Zoom), but most importantly will let me talk through my issues, I'd greatly appreciate it.

I'm not sure if this is okay in this sub, but I'd even be willing to give my contact info to speak to a recovering male who has experience.

Please lend support. Thank you for reading.
