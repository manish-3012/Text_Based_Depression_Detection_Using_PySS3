We can get through it.To those who are feeling empty right now, to those who are cornered by their difficult emotions, to those who have no hope left, to those who can't properly express themselves, to those who find it very difficult to be optimistic anymore and to those who are trying to push through - I just want to say that you're not alone. I myself am going through a difficult phase in my life right now but I try to gather whatever little strength that I have to place one foot over the other. It's okay to cry. It's okay to not fully have a grasp on yourself. There are just some things that we find really hard in dealing with. But do know that you are capable, maybe not at this very moment but you are. We can do it.
