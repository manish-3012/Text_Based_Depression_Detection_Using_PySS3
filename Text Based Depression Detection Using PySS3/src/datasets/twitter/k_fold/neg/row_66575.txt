I stopped being afraid of suicide a long time ago. Is this a bad thing?Hey there,

I've struggled on and off with suicidal thoughts in the past, but the past few months have been pretty rough and they've gotten to the point where last Friday I was basically going to overdose on painkillers before I realised I didn't have enough. That near-attempt and my thoughts the past few days have led me to realise that I'm not really scared of committing suicide anymore. There's no fear, or any strong emotions at all actually, when I think about not being alive anymore. 

And because I realised I didn't feel anything much about it, I've been provoking myself in small ways, hoping to get a reaction: pressing a knife against my chest, standing too close to the edge of a train platform and thinking about how easy it would be to step off, etc., but it never makes me feel anything. 

I've made a plan to kill myself but I don't know if I would actually follow through with it - my emotions and my feelings about suicide are now so numb that most days it's a case of "okay, I *could* kill myself today, or I could watch TV." Or, "I *could* jump in front of this train, or I could go see a movie later." 

I feel like this is a bad thing, but it'd be interesting to have other people's opinions on it.
