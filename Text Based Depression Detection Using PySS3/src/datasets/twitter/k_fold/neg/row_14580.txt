What keeps you alive?the only things keeping me alive is my favourite band, the arctic monkeys. music seriously changes you. it's not like their music is so beautifully written or they're spiritually entwined with me or what the fuck ever. i just listen to them and feel... happy. like i can't feel that when i'm out and about life. call me a basic teenager, but there have been so many instances where i just want to end it all but then realise that if i'm dead i can't watch them live. but after watching them live i'll probably hang myself

and my family too. more towards my siblings, because all 3 of them had problems with some sort of mental disorder. and being the youngest, i think my turn is coming soon. my parents, i'm not sure how they'll handle it. i don't want to think about it. 

future? university? fuck that. if i don't watch arctic monkeys live by the time i'm 25, i'll just assume they're never touring anymore and i'll kill myself. that gives me 9 years. 

i'll update you guys in 9 years i guess, when i'm either dead or living my best life. one or the other.
