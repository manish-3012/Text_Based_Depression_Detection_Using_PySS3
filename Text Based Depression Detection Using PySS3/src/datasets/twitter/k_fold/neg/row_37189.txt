I am starting to not feel fazed by the thoughts of ending it allI will preface this with the fact that I had tried to do so over 10 years ago, but I stopped because of family members. Since then, while I have had dark thoughts here and there, I am mostly able to keep them at bay.

Lately, thatâ€™s not the case. I think I am starting to feel more numb to the thoughts. While I am still scared of death itself, I fear I will not fear it in the future and act upon my thoughts. 

Two people are the only factors besides the fear of death that is holding me back. Despite everything going well on the surface of my life.. I feeling more shitty and worthless as if I am just some trash on this planet that needs to be taken out.
