Apprehensive to receive professional treatment.Iâ€™ve been in a dark place since about 2017 with frequent thoughts of my own death, inadequacy, indifference, numbness, addiction, etc. An amalgamation really (most are). I embarrassingly only realized that I might be suffering from depression about a year and a half ago and havenâ€™t been sure what to with that since. I find it difficult to talk about in person especially those closest to me. Iâ€™ve been considering professional treatment for a bit now and am very ignorant. Iâ€™m very apprehensive to take prescription antidepressants, I have never tried them but I have no interest in adding any more drugs prescribed or not into my life. I would like to feel better and not be trampled by the medical system at the same time. I assume most therapists are now on zoom due to covid but any insights would be appreciated.
