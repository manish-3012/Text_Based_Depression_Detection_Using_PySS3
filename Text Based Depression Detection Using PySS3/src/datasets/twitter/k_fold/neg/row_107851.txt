I canâ€™t take chronic pain anymore.I have chronic debilitating migraines at least 2-3 days a week with slightly less severe headaches 24/7. I have a few good days here and there, but when itâ€™s at its worst Iâ€™m afraid it will put me over the edge. School has become nearly impossible and even if I do finish I donâ€™t know how I can get a job when I canâ€™t even move half of my days. It just hurts so bad. Itâ€™s not just depressing to lose hope, what Iâ€™m really worried about is impulsively shooting myself in the head when the pain becomes too much for too long. The last time I had one for three days straight I stabbed my head over and over (lightly, like overly aggressive acupuncture with a knife) because it seemed to help somehow. Would I really be so selfish to end it because of this? This is not a life at all. I mean if you had to choose to live for 70 years with someone continuously drilling holes into your head as you threw up, or just die now, why would you want to live? For your friends and family that you never see so they can watch you suffer? And why canâ€™t I be open about the fact that itâ€™s bad enough to come to this. I wish I could casually say oh hey ya things are going okay but I do wish I were dead because this pain is so bad. Iâ€™ve been to every doctor and tried all the solutions and nothing works. Itâ€™s like my worst hangover times ten except itâ€™s been going on for five years now. I donâ€™t even know what to do with myself when it gets to its worst point. I go half blind and canâ€™t even remember words and I hate losing my brain with it. I keep looking for answers thinking itâ€™s gonna change but itâ€™s not. How the fuck do other people with chronic pain get by?
