One of those daysIâ€™m not sure whether it is Christmas or just that I realise that I am totally alone except for my abuser and before you say oh leave get help their are agencies I am telling you their is not. My dad chose to leave this live 10years ago and my brother 2 years ago at 39 young. Both alcoholics both mental health issues. Want being a grabs dad and uncle a sister enough for them to stay obviously not. I am beyond the anger now I think it took me ten years to get over the anger and understanding that their mind was tired. Here in New Zealand we have the highest rate of suicide I mean Theo are kids as young as 11 doing it choosing to leave. My mother disowned me many years ago Iâ€™m not sure if it was because she was embarrassed of my existence. So on Christmas day it will be much like my birthday just me hoping that my daughters might visit but they didnâ€™t even say a whisper for my birthday so be grateful you are not terminally alone
