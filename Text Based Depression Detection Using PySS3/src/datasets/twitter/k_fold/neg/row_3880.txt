I feel trapped and want to end it allI'm drowning in debt, but I absolutely hate my job. The idea of getting up tomorrow and having to go into work seems like.. I don't even know. I'd rather die than do it. I've tried for months to get away from this hell hole and have even gotten a couple call backs and interviews, but no job offers. It feels like taking my life is the only option left to get away from the soul sucking misery, but I don't want to leave all my financial and other problems to my family after I go. I'm stuck and feel trapped like in a prison.
