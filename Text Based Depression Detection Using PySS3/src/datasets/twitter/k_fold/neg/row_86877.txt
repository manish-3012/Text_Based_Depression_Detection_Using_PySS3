No motivation anymore.Its been 2 years since I broke up with my ex-fiancee, who was my one and only relationship. Since then, I have been absolutely unable to find anyone to go out on a date with, let alone be in a relationship. I am just ready to give up, and I really hope that there is some sort of motivation that I can find, even though I am basically done.
