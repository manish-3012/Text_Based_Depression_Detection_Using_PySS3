These pills keep me from killing myselfI miss a single dose in the morning and by noon suddenly it all comes rushing back. Like I never sought help in the first place. The feeling that makes your insides seem to rot. The feeling like you've just been humiliated but it never seems to fade. You want to burst into tears but are completely unable to. Can't get up to clean, to shower, to make food even though your place is a disaster, you reek, and you're starving. All of that rushes in like floodwaters and all I can think about is the cardboard box on the top shelf of my closet that could make it all go away. Instead I take three magic little pills every morning and they keep that box closed.

What happens when the pills stop?
