Slowly finding purposeI've thought of quitting many times lately and have really wanted to but I am slowly starting to see a possible purpose to make of my life. I am going to try to dedicate my life to you guys. To helping make the world a place where many are actually proud to live and raise children in. A world where love and forgiveness are wide spread and a person's value has little to do with their wage or net worth.
