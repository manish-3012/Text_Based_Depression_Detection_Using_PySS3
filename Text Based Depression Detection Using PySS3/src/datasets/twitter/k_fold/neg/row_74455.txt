constantly flooded with memories and thoughts of every mistake in my life.i just want to sleep but i canâ€™t. every time i close my eyes itâ€™s something shitty thatâ€™s happened to me or something shitty or stupid that iâ€™ve done / said.

so i sit awake and cry and panic and i canâ€™t function.

my mental health has always been a disaster but it really feels like non-stop deterioration at this point.

i hate that i never have anything new to say. i canâ€™t articulate anything so itâ€™s just the same old â€œi donâ€™t want to be here anymore why canâ€™t i get the guts to end it alreadyâ€ over and over.

iâ€™m so miserable and so tired of being ALONE.

i know that i have love and good in my heart to give to people but iâ€™m so fucking stupid i just canâ€™t talk to anyone.

i know itâ€™s never going to end until i do it. i know i will never meet someone who will stay. i know thereâ€™s no point. i just want to die.
