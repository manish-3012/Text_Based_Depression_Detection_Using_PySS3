I got knocked down, I'm not entirely sure if I want to get back up again...We're drowning in debt. I've been out of work more than I've been in it the last 15 months. Apart from a brief 2.5 week period of wedding day and honeymoon I don't remember the last time I was happy.

I put out applications for all kinds of jobs, stuff in my field, stuff out of it. I've even applied for burger flipper roles in a McDonald's ffs. I have a useless degree, and I have no hope.

I got calls for interview and then they say they don't want to take me on for first line support roles, would rather put me forward for a second line role, but have no idea when that role will open up...

I am the fattest most useless lump and waste of space I have ever been.

I think, honestly, I'm done.
