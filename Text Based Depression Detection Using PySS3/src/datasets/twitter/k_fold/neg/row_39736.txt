It does not end and been diagnosed with an eye condition that usually ends up losing my sight if not treated.Since everyone here has been helpful
I just would like to have your own personal opiniom regarding some disturbing matters 

The doctor diagnosed me with really bad case of the eye floaters and be given special eyedrops for it and its getting worst as days have passed

I currently have a job with att uverse pre install tech support. 

If incase my condition gets worst can such be grounds for resignation due to medical reasons ? 

My parents are not thinking straight about the medical matter at hand and just wants me to continue just because there is medicine at hand. And there is good money there.

 once the doctor found out that i have a job with att pre install tech support.
I was told that i should leave and find another lighter job than that or risk being blind in the long run. 

from experience with my parents ideas. 
I usually end up in ths hospital or worst.  

What do you think ?. 

I will be going to work in a matter of hours. 
And i need opinions badly. 
Since you guys have been helpful.
