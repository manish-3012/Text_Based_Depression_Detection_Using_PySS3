I am scaredI am scared that I will soon give up. My bpd is getting the better of me. My urges are high and this boy Iâ€™m seeing is currently the only thing keeping me going. Heâ€™s become my favourite person and weâ€™re not together. Iâ€™ve only known him for a short period and iâ€™m scared heâ€™s going to leave and hurt me. I am scared that when he does I will have no stability left inside me. 

But I am also scared to die. I donâ€™t know what thereâ€™s going to be after this world and as a Muslim Iâ€™m panicking. Sometimes I donâ€™t feel real. 

I wish I had someone to take care of me.
