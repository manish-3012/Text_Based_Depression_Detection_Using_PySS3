Justifying my actions to the voidI am 29, I have been successful in many aspects of life, but I have been suicidal consistently for 16 years. I have had no recent emotional shock, no bad breakup or fight, I am not being abused and I have not been, I have not been fired or failed an exam. I have come to the conclusion however that it is time for me to pass.

I have no philosophical belief in the sanctity of life, but I am not a nihilist. I have seen enough of life to know that there is no path I wish to travel or destination which interests me. I am suffering in the moment due to poor physical health and a deep and unyielding loneliness which does not break when I am with my family, my friends or with a lover. Since I can perceive no end to my emptiness, and no worthwhile goal to achieve, I do not see a possibility of meaningful change and no purpose in continuing to exist.

To live on would be nothing more than a favour to those who would be sad to see me go, and with all due respect to them, my altruism is exhausted after so long.

I have sought treatment through every avenue available to me. I spent years on medication and in therapy but neither my quality of life nor my long term outlook were ever improved. I have long searched for tacit permission to end my life but I understand now that it is something no one will ever give so in my final act I will be forced to rebel against society as I see it, to throw away a gift that no one will admit I never asked for and never wanted.

Tomorrow I will purchase the equipment for my chosen method, and tomorrow I will finally know the stillness and silence of oblivion.
