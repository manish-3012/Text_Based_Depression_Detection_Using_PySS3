I drive everyone away.I cannot maintain long term, meaningful friendships with people I care about because I always end up doing something to drive them away.

I've tried time and time again to change so that I'd be worthy of people staying but I'm not sure what it is that I do that drives them away.

Of course, I would never tell the people in question that I feel this way because that would come off as guilt tripping.

It's just getting so painful, I don't know how to handle that. Any time I get attached I do something to screw it up.

I honestly don't think things can or ever will get better for me.
