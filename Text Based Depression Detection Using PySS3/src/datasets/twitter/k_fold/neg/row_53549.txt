Endless Cycle of MiseryI wish committing suicide wasn't wrong in my religion. Everyday I am more convinced it's the answer. I want to it so badly. I am tired of the world and my surroundings and my family who cares yet make things worse all the time. I don't want anything but to rest. It's so burdensome to be here and do the smallest of things. Constantly fantasizing about how it will happen, how there's no coming back.
