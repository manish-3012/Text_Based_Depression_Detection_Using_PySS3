I've made my decisionAfter doing a lot of thinking, I've decided that late January will be my time to die. I want to wait until after my niece's bday in mid January, but I also will be losing the funding for my cleaner at the end of that month. (I'm disabled &amp; rely on that service for some of the things I can't do)

I've started selling some of my things to make it less for my family to do after. I've started getting the things I need to make an exit bag, &amp; I'll be getting 2 helium tanks in early January. I've also ordered samples of some adult diapers to limit the mess. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this. I guess I just wanted to tell someone before it happens.

Thanks for reading
