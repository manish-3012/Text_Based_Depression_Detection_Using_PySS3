I'm exhausted.I don't really know how to start this.. so here it goes. I have been contemplating suicide for a very long time now and it's becoming the elephant in the room in my life.. the thing is only I can see it. I feel so alone constantly and I over the course of the past two years have lost more friends than I can remember.. the only people I have left don't make me happy when I'm around them.. they only make me feel more alone. Everyone I know is getting ready to take on life.. they're talking about carrier paths, buying houses and mortgages and I'm just waiting on the next season of game of thrones. I feel like a failure that's waiting to happen. I can't see myself living past my twenties.. I don't know why.. I just can't picture it.. the only thing that keeps me from jumping off a cliff or swallowing a bucket of pills is the thought of some great future that I probably will never have. Maybe a family.. a son and a husband or some shit.. living in a house in the middle of nowhere.. people I can call my own.. but no one cares about me.. let alone loves me.. my obnoxious personality seems to drive people faster than I can even get to know them. There are very few people I actually give a shit about..  the only people I can think of are people I barely know, like teachers who I haven't spoken to in a fucking long time, who probably don't even remember that I exist.. Now I'm just counting down the days until it's all over... luckily I don't believe in a God or anything.. so the prospect of have to be conscious forever doesn't scare me too much.. cause unfortunately.. you can't kill yourself once you're already dead.. all i want to know is if there is anybody out there who understands? Is there anybody who gives a shit? Or is everybody just as phony as the last bastard.. Idk.. 

Ps.. im sorry about this rambling tangent.. and I'm sorry about all of the ellipsis.
