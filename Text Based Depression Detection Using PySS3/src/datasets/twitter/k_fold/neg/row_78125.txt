What are my options? Housebound, anxiety, depressed and suicidal. I'm thinking of attempting within the next few hours.I'm 17 and haven't left my house in a year. I have generalized anxiety disorder w/ panic attacks and depression. Schizophrenia is in my family and i'm beginning to feel paranoid/strange a lot more often, so i'm worried that i'm in the beginning stages of psychosis as well. 

I feel that it isn't possible for me to leave home. I know I could if I tried, but i'm way too scared. I've thought about cutting my arms then calling for an ambulance so i'd have no choice except to go to a hospital.  

In 2014 my symptoms were less problematic and I went to the local hospital numerous times looking for an admission for my depression and suicidal thoughts. I was always sent home. Professionals don't care. If I had been admitted during that time, I probably wouldn't be so bad off right now.

I don't  know what the hell to do.
