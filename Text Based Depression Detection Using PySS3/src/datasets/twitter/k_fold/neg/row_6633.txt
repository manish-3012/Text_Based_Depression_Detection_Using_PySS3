Ex-hacker going through Quarter life crisis So today I turned 22. let me tell you about myself and what I'm going through.

I'm currently pending federal charges for computer fraud for spamming. over my years of spam and ill gotten game I've made over $100,000. All of that which has gone to family friends, and bad investments. I'm officially broke now. After my charges where filed and I was let out on bond I picked up a 9-5 job which I still made decent money from, just last week I was fired from it cause corporate found out about my conviction. 

Anyways, this time last year I was in time square living it up, now im broke and miserable.

I once was rich from illgotten gain, now I'm broke. I want to be legitimatly successful but idk if my conviction will ever allow me. I feel like my life is over and there is nothing I can do to ever become successful. I have nothing now and I might not have anything ever. idk if I even have friends or not. I just want to kill myself or have someone realistically telling me that I can still become successful without all the rainbows and unicorns .
