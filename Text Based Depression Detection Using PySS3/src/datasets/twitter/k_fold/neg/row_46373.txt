I want to dieI am truthfully very close today to it. My ex chose another guy he knew for 2 weeks over me and it feels hopeless.

He tells me if he only had me at my best that he would have chosen me but that my worst makes him not choose me.

I honestly don't know how to last the night. I've been feeling this way for a while before he chose that guy but now the pain is just all adding up and I don't know what to do.

I have no other friends, no one else to talk to. Especially those who would understand. So I'm alone just able to think of ways I can end it tonight. 

At this moment right now, I hope I go through with it.
