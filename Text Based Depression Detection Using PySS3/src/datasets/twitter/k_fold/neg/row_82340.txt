Best friend hates me give me a reason to be alive without feeling guilty for living every dayI already have a cat I love and a boyfriend I love and a mom and sister I love. But I've let every single one of them down besides my cat. I fucking hate myself and I know I'm selfish and I know I'm xyz. I truly am aware of almost all of my faults and I've wanted to change them for years and haven't. What's the fucking point if I haven't and continue to let everyone I love down. I want to kill myself so bad I know my mom would take care of my cat and she would end up being relieved that I'm not still financially dependent on her. Give me a reason to live that isn't guilt. Give me a reason that's positive
