Things just donâ€™t go my wayI donâ€™t know what to do. It seems like at every turn Iâ€™m dealing with so much. Iâ€™m overwhelmed and just want things to settle but they wonâ€™t. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped here. Like that I put myself out so much to make everyone else happy and feel good, and those around me take advantage of that. I want to feel valid and happy, but I donâ€™t know how.
