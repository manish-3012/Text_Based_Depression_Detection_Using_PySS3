I wish I take away all the pain in this worldthis world is indeed beautiful, but with alot of pain, I don't want to really see the world more(not that I've even been out of my own country), or even hear about it, it's painful for me everyday. I don't plan on being here for too long but I wish I take away all the pain in this world, there are people who deserve so much happiness and love and life, I wish I could give any of mine to them, I'm tired of people saying " better days are coming", " it's just a sad day" " you'll be fine" " theres so much left for you to see in this world" I wish I could tell them I don't want to see the world, I don't want to see the better days, I just want to remove myself from here, I don't belong here. I wish I'd have just died of covid, but I don't want to affect others through covid in my family. is it too much to ask for a painless ending? 




please note I do not plan of self harm, it's just too much on my mind, needed to get it off somewhere.
