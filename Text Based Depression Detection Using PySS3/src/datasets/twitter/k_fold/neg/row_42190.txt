I'm tired.As my title states, I'm tired. I'm tired of being the only source of sympathy in my life. I tell people (doctors, therapists, my wife) that I'm suicidal, depressed, anxious. I also say that the only reason I don't finally do it is because I deserve all of this pain and more. I tell my story to help lines and other professionals and I either receive a "wow, that is sad" or I have to spend my time unsaddening (not even a word) the person I just depressed with my life. 

I recently lost my job so I don't have benefits or can see my barely there therapist or continue on my medication. I can't afford professional help and I don't have a support system. I'm tired and I don't want to be alive anymore.
