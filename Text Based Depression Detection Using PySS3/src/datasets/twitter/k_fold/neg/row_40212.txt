I wish I had never been bornI wish my idiot parents wouldn't have gotten together out of obligation to "find someone and get married because I'm getting old" which is what they both admit to doing. They both have mental health problems and yet they chose to procreate. I was doomed from the start. Can I please fucking die now.
