Why was life createdOk seriously why was life created? I don't like it. I wish I wasn't born but it's not my choice. I didn't ask for any of this. Life is a joke, a mistake, and a failure. It was disappointing to say the least... I could at least try to get sleep for a long time, probably in a coma. Anything to help me forget about this stupid creation. Death is my solution. Everyone won't worry about me, I'll fix what I'm feeling, and I'll never have to go through this ever again. I'm a dumb idiot, so I would rather die. I want to shoot myself already. I am the problem, so ridding myself will help. Time to begin early. Good bye.
