I'm a burden on everyone around me. I'm gonna end it this week some time...The fact of the matter is that I'm a burden, I'm useless, I'm a leech. I've never had a job and never will because I can't deal with job interviews, women all hate me, 80% of my friends have all ditched me, I've got nothing going for me, no future, my dreams are all gonna crumble to ash soon enough. May as well end it before I watch things become worse.
