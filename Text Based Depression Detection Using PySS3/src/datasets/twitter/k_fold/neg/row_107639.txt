Iâ€™m a fucking loser.For the past 6 months Iâ€™ve been sitting on my ass eating pizza, smoking weed and drinking, and playing video games (mostly single player RPGs because I have no friends. And any attempt to meet people reminds me how little social skills I actually have). Iâ€™ve been leaching off my wonderful mother for this whole time, she works her ass off to pay for her loser son to do nothing with his life. She deserves infinitely better and sheâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m still here today. 

I used to work at a fast food joint but I ended up quitting without even telling anyone simply because I was having a terrible mental health day and was too ashamed to face anyone after that. I havenâ€™t had a job since and have not been looking for one at all. I am a lazy piece of shit. 

At this point in my life, I honestly donâ€™t care to do day to day activities much anymore. I used to go to the gym 6 days a week but since I stopped working Iâ€™ve just been eating pizzas and awful junk food and regularly consumed 5000+ calories a day, ballooning me in weight; all I do is eat. Every day I tell myself to kill myself, out loud at least 50 times, Often thinking about shit Iâ€™ve done over the past couple of days that makes me cringe. I think about stilling my wrists, laying my head in a train track, every single scenario involving the aftermath what my family and one friend who is my drug dealer might think. So many scenarios because I have so much time to think because I have no job. Every day I wake up only thinking of going to sleep again. 

The only think I really enjoy in life is the NBA and my fucked ass sleep schedule has prevented me from even watching them anymore. Iâ€™m starting to care less. I want to love something but I donâ€™t have the energy. I try to talk to my mom but she canâ€™t hear it anymore it drives her crazy. She had me at a an older age so sheâ€™s already aged and Iâ€™m afraid the stress of having me as a son literally killing her. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m even typing this TBH, just to vent most likely. I probably wonâ€™t kill myself because my mom is alive. It would destroy her, we donâ€™t have much to be happy for in out household unfortunately. I love her so much hopefully one day I can do good for her but I just want to give up on my life. I have no energy. I feel like some people are just destined to kill themselves and I feel as if I am one of them. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts since I was a child I canâ€™t see them ever stopping
