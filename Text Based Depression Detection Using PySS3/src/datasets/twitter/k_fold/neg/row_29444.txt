I just need someoneIt's been 4 years that I havent had a friend, nobody to call me and ask how im doing, not a person to listen to or take an opinion from. It's gotten to the point that I'm scared of socializing because I dont know how to act, but I still try to put myself out there. But no matter what, I always mess it up. My own family ignores me to the point that if I try to say something theyll start talking during my sentence and everyone just looks right over me. Im tired of it. The constant dread of being alone, the feeling of my heart being in my stomach.. I cant take it. Nobody even notices me. It's not like I'm a horrible person, I try my best to help people and I do my part as best I can but still.. the universe just wants to kick my ass I guess.

And if I am with people like at my brothers house or something and he invites his friends, they all look down on me and treat me like shit. My brothers fiance fell when she was drunk just the other night and I went to go help but low and behold, I got pushed out of the way and told to move. Why do people do this to me? I cant wait to end it. Just a few more hours.
