Iâ€™m so scared I wonâ€™t be able to do itIâ€™m sorry if my writing isnâ€™t very good right now, but Iâ€™m scared and the posts on this sub always help me through these kinds of things.

So Iâ€™ve had a plan for a long time now, and Iâ€™ve had this date in my mind for later in the year (so that Iâ€™ve got enough time to fully prepare or so that Iâ€™ve had adequate time to change my mind if some sort of miracle had happened and life was worth living for some reason). I chose the date when thinking of my little sister. Iâ€™m listlessly trying to minimize the impact of my death on her and it would be the shittiest thing in the world to celebrate your 16th birthday the same year your older sister had died, so it must be after her birthday this year.

But itâ€™s now less than 50 days to the date and itâ€™s time to book the motel and buy the equipment, and Iâ€™m so so scared. I canâ€™t be alive anymore. I canâ€™t bear to even think about continuing to pull myself out of bed each morning to another day as fucking horrible as the last. I donâ€™t even want to try think about continuing to live past this date and having to be alive and living through this fucking horrible life with all this fucking pain inside me always.

I know that suicide is a selfish act but nowadays it really fucking makes me sick to listen to people say things like â€œwhat about your family?â€, â€œwhat about the people who love you?â€ - because, honestly, what about me? 
Why donâ€™t I deserve peace? Why should I have to continue pushing myself through this pain and crying and screaming and being by myself for the happiness of other? I know that didnâ€™t make sense, but I know that some of you must all understand this.

Iâ€™ve tried medications and therapy but things will never change. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve had to learn. Things will never change. There is nothing left except for myself and the pain. Nobody in my real life understands what I mean. So, please, someone - please talk to me and tell me Iâ€™m strong enough.
