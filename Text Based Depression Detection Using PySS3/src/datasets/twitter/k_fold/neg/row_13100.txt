So closeI'm so close, mentally I want to, I need to end my own life. I cant stand these thoughts any longer. But I made a promise. I made a promise to the one person who I love most in this world that I wouldnt. I'm so conflicted. I'm in so much pain, I want to do it. I've written the note I've made the plans, but I cant break my promise. I cant disappoint him anymore.
