Getting into a good college pressureI'm from India, to get a good college you have to be in the top 10k out of 1 million students.
I am facing a lot of pressure from my parents who constantly remind me numerous occasions everyday and won't accept  anything relatively less. They don't even care for me and many times told me that they wished I wasn't born or died by now. They mainly want to prove to their family who never liked them. My parents only care about me when they need help from me. They lash out on me even when I do nothing wrong. I've been trying my best but I'm no where near the competition and nothing makes me happy anymore and I just wanna die.
