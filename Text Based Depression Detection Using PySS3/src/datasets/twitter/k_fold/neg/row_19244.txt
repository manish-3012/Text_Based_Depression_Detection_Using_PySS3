I don't want an instant, clean deathI want it to drag on. I want to really feel it when I go. But I also want to make sure I'm actually successful at the task at hand. Probably one of the biggest contributing factors to me not being dead. To pass away relatively quickly by shooting or hanging seems to be a waste of the death I've been dreaming about for so long. So, for now, it's just a fantasy I guess.
