ScaredI'm not sure where to start but, this is my first reach out for help. I'm terrible at asking for help or even talking about my problems, but I've started to scare myself. I've thought of suicide before but never in as much depth or for such a great length of time as I have now. I just spent the last hour weighing out the pros and cons to my self. 

The only major change in my life was a recent "demotion" at work to save my job through the winter. I know it's temporary but for some reason it seems to be adding fuel to the fire. I seem to be stuck in a rut and not accomplishing anything with my life, and I believe that is what's eating away at me on the inside. I have been on one date since I was dumped 3 years ago and  my ex girlfriend recently started dating someone else. I know this shouldn't be an issue but it hit me pretty hard. 

I find it hard to complain about all of these meaningless issues, which have no real physical impact on my quality of life, while there are so many people so much worse off than me. I know there are resources available and I know how what I need to do.. but I just can't seem to bring my self to do them.

I am able to think myself out of suicide but I don't know for how long. I can't seem to shake this thoughts and feelings. I know I shouldn't want to do this but once it's done it all stops. No more feelings, good or bad.
