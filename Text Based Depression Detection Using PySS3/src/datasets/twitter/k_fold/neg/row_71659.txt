18M No drive, no will, just nothing.I think I will explain and talk about me here, i don't have anyone to talk about this and tbh no one cares. These things I have written only in letters to myself to let something out.

I'm 18 and 3 years ago I started lifting and until a year ago I was the fittest guy in the school, I had crushes countless of time and even though I didn't have any particular goal I was just living and didn't feel bad or anything, I've always been kinda normal with my feelings I was "depressed" sometimes but not really in a bad way. Recently I started cutting myself, it was an accident but its addicting and the mental pain goes away for a moment. I have crazy anxiety all the time. It kind of started with the fact that I realized that I'm a very lonely person and am in general just a really boring and not a very nice person, I'm ugly and I don't think that anybody ever truly liked me. Nothing makes me happy, there are moments where I laugh and sometimes don't feel like complete shit, but in the end every morning and every evening I just lay in bed and cry like a crybaby. Everything seems pointless and I don't really want to live anymore. There are some who say that they care, but if I'm gone or not does it really matter, people say that it's selfish to kill yourself but in the end, this endless pain would go away and event thou some who knew me might be sad I wouldn't even know it. Nothing matters in the end.

Even this text is stupid and useless, I can't even say how I really feel.
