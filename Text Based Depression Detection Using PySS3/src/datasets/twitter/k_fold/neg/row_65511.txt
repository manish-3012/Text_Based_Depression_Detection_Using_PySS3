HeyHonestly just wanted to talk to someone. Iâ€™m not necessarily on suicide watch mentally. But Iâ€™ve thought about it. I had a mental breakdown at work on Thursday and checked myself into the psych ward of my hospital. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was 13, now 20 and this was my second hospitalization. I never had a plan set in stone. But Iâ€™ve fantasized about just downing a bottle of Tylenol, taking a dab big enough to knock me out and just letting my liver and kidneys fail in my sleep. I have a support system but I donâ€™t want to bother them anymore. I just need a new anonymous face who understands what Iâ€™m dealing with.
