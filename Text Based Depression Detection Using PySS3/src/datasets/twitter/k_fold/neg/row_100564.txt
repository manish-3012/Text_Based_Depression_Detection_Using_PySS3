Is it even worth itSorry bout the poor formatting, so is the curse of mobile

Yâ€™all have probably heard the same sob story over and over again so mine probably isnâ€™t very different. I was born into privilege, Iâ€™m white, my parents are upper middle class, Iâ€™m smart with a high IQ, and never wanted for anything. Yet things decided to come along and ruin it all. First it was the anxiety, then the depression that runs in my family, then the binge eating, then the suicidal thoughts, the hospitalization and finally, what to me was the nail in the coffin, the autism diagnosis. I spent so many years forcing myself to â€œact normalâ€ to please others that I now have no idea who I am or what to do. Iâ€™m only 17, and Iâ€™m graduating high school this year but it doesnâ€™t seem worth it at all. I havenâ€™t made any new friends in years, and my current friends barely even know or care about me. Iâ€™m overly shy to a fault, and mess up nearly everything. Im slowly loosing interest in everything, and practically nothing makes me happy. Iâ€™m always tired, 50 pounds overweight, and just getting dumber by the day. My memory has degraded and I now forget nearly everything. I forget to do basic easy household tasks until Iâ€™m yelled at for not doing them. Iâ€™ve never had any sort of romantic relationship and probably never will. Iâ€™m nowhere near conventionally attractive and quite ugly, despite what family says. I smell despite showering every day, sometimes twice a day and I sweat buckets for no reason. I know the statistics, 85% of people with autism are unemployed, and past graduation just seems like a black hole. I canâ€™t drive, hold a job, and college seems like an impossible task, Iâ€™ve barely made it through high school after all. I canâ€™t manage money because I have no impulse control or self restraint, which explains me being obese. I hate myself so much that itâ€™s become completely ingrained into me, and I see absolutely nothing good or redeeming about myself. I blow up at people for no reason, canâ€™t handle any amount of pressure, and have absolutely no drive, work ethic, or self control. I know I wonâ€™t kill myself, Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to do that, and Iâ€™d feel bad for doing that to my parents. But I donâ€™t see an end to this, the autism will never go away, and itâ€™s always going to make my life a living hell. Is it even worth it at this point, is the question I ask myself on the daily. Why should I keep going through this when itâ€™s never gonna go away, itâ€™s always gonna be there just to ruin everything time and time again.
