When I hear all of you going through this shit...it kind of hurts inside for me.I want any of you to tell me your story. Tell me why your life is so messed up, how you hate it, how it sucks. Tell me how you don't know who you are anymore. Get angry. Be sad.

I won't say anything to you, I'll listen to what you have to say. Then we can make a joke, crack up. But, in our hearts we all know that we might never be happy. 

I'll tell you a word of advice and we laugh and cry together. We are all messed up, we are all dying inside.
