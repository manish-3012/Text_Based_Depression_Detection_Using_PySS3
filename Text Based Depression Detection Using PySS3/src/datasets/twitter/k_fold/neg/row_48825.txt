Don't want to make it through the yearPosting on mobile, sorry about the formatting. I'm 16. I've posted here two times before, I believe. I can't bring myself to do anything though. Every time I've gotten close to being ready to die I get dragged back to the brink by something. I don't want this crap anymore. My family is fucked and I'm just gonna live fixing my issues forever, school is miserable, and nobody really gives a fuck. I'm just another angsty teenager bitching about his problems, right? It doesn't matter what I think or feel, everyone just says "hang in there!" Or "There there, it gets better" or "Here's Buzzfeed's 5 tips to kicking depression's ass! You won't believe #4!" and nothing is helping. I can't go to therapy because of my parents, I can't talk about things in person for the same reason. I live with manipulative assholes and god I fucking hate myself so much. But I just numb it all with porn and food and videogames. I just distract myself because I don't want to face the mental instability I have because nobody cares about me as a kid, I don't want to feel the anxiety, or the depression slowly taking my few passions away from me. I already have notes written. I want to die, I just need an extra push.
