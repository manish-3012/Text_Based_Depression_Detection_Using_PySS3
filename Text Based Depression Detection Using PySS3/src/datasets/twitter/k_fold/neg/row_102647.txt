No more motivation to live anymoreFor the past 4 or so weeks I've kept to myself usually sleeping all day and all night ignoring phone calls and other responsibilities.  I feel like I have no purpose or use for life anymore.  Socially I feel I'm really awkward and feel like no one can ever love me as a soulmate after constant rejections by most girls.  This constant depression has lead me to give up on college and my degree in engineering.

I've tried alcohol and throwing myself into a hobby of building computers but both are a financial drain and only a stopgap.

I know I should go to a doctor and discuss this with them but I feel like it wouldn't help anymore really.  I'm better than I was before with my suicidal ideations and no longer looking into methods but just the idea of not being alive seems to be the better option.

My main feeling is I'm at a point where I feel I'm ignored by everyone and make life miserable for those around me.  I'm a disappointment and a failure and do not matchup to my peers.  i want to improve my mindset and myself but I feel it will all be frivolous.
