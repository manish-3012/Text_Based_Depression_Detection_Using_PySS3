My genes are a mistakeThis is it. This is natural selection, and this is fate.

I was doomed from birth. I will be forgotten. My body will rot.

Genetics are real. Natural selection is real.

#I am a victim of incompetence.

I can't even offer musclepower to this world because I am low energy.

I have nothing to offer.

What is even worse is when I try to visualize myself as a supersoldier, I don't feel any better.

I need to just die.
