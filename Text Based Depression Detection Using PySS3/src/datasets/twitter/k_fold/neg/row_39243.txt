I'm done. How do I finally do it? Is there help?I've been really depressed. I've lived probably 100 years in my 27 years of being here. Had everything - money and love and I lost them both two years ago. A few months ago I was able to work on making money again with my business and I did. But it makes me even more so lonely. Girls don't want to date me. I will meet girls I connect with. And they just consider me a best friend. But of course they let me pay for everything when we go out. But they tell me it can't be anything more. What the fuck is wrong with me? I texted some friends tonight and it is still early but of course no one texts me back. I need help and someone to talk to I'm going insane. 

I'm 27. Fuck am I going to join the 27 club? I texted the girl I fell in love with as previously mentioned and she basically didn't give a shit. Fuck people and fuck girls. I'm on 27 but I know I'm gonna die alone. I cause too much stress to the people around me and I would be better off dead. No one here who knows me really gives a shit even though they know my intentions I am sure.
