His name was Max George.Max was my best friend. We would spend every single day online playing games. He meant everything to me, someone dependable and loyal. Even when I moved overseas, we stayed in contact. He was supposed to be the officiant at my wedding. We got matching tattoos after he bought me a Batman leather jacket...he called me Bruce, I called him Clark. We were supposed to be in it together, forever.
On May 29th, he took his own life. To say it was agonizing is an understatement. It took me nearly a month to go a day without sobbing. To think of him still pains me, to remember him still hurts. All I want is the world is to have him back.
People out there care about you. People out there are going to be ruined if you disappear, just like I was when Max left. Whatever you're in, there is a way out, and leaving everything behind isn't at all worth it. If you need someone to help, I'm here. I might not get back quickly, but I'll get back as soon as I can.

You are not alone.
