Don't know what to doI almost got sectioned this morning but i'd calmed down so they didn't.

Turns out they threw my kitchen knife away cus i harmed myself with it. It was from my sisters kitchen knife set and it turns out it's not easy finding a blue knife so at some point I'm going to have to explain to my parents a missing knife.

Also my medication won't be ready until tomorrow and I'm spiralling and I don't know what to do.

Do I email the police officers like hey I lied I don't actually have my meds and I don't feel okay.
