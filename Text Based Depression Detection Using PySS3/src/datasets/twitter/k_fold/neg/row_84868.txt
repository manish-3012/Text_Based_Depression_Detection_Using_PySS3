I don't know what to doMy girlfriend whom I loved deeply for 3 years left me about 6 months ago and I cannot get over it. I tried to distract myself with hobbies such as working out and I picked up circuit work but I feel deeply depressed. Randomly throughout the day I just think of her because I still love her even though she ended our relationship with 3 lies after I confronted her about each one and she still hasn't told me the truth. Near the end she was going behind my back and telling people mean things that hurt my feelings so bad. Each night I go to bed early, distract myself with youtube and will just think of her because I loved her so much and I will just cry for 30 minutes straight. On 2 occasions since the time we broke up I wanted to kill myself badly, but was an inch away from actually doing it. I really do not see a purpose in my life right now. Please help me. I've literally become so desperate I drown myself in calculus. I just need some help. Thank you 

You can ask me anything. Im really sad but I promise it won't tip me off the edge right now
