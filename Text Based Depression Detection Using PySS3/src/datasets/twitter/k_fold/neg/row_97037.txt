Will someone talk to me?About anything? I feel depressed and want to kill myself right now. I was okay earlier, then the feeling just kind of suddenly came on a few hours ago. I've been depressed since I was about 12. Clinical depression, anxiety, OCD diagnosed. I feel alone and scared. I wish I could runaway and start over, but I'd miss my family a lot. I don't know what to do.
