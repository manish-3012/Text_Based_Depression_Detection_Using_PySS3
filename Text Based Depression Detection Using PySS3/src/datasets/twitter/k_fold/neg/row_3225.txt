Is it inevitable for me? I don't understand.33/m - Have struggled with thoughts since a teenager. While I don't get to the planning stages, I still think about it. A lot. Mostly about what would happen if I did and how confusing it is to not being able to stop thinking about it. My mom died by suicide when I was 23. My dad's father died by suicide when my dad was 4. I often think it is inevitable for me.
