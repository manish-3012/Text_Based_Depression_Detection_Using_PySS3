Do it now. Before it's worse.Here I am. Mid 20's. A wife and two daughters I can barely provide for and I feel lost for it.

I thought about making an alt for this, but no, this deserves to be here. My daughters are 2 years and 1 month old respectively and I think that if I end it... maybe it won't hurt them since they are so young. They won't know the disappointment that is thier bastard of a father AND my wife could find someone better. Someone to support them. I always stop myself. What if it catches up though? What if they are 8 and 10 and then I do it? That would be so much worse. I don't want them to know me. I keep holding on. I keep thinking that I'll get better, but I never do. 

I could ramble forever.... but this isnt to sob. I just think they could do better. Without me.

Just watch.
