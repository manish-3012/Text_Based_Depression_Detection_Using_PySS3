Does therapy help ?i'm 16 and have been extremely suicidal for about 4 years now. I had a plan set up for a while when i was about 14 and would've went through with it but some family came home early and i felt like a real piece of shit for almost doing it. Since then i've come to the realization that my abusive parents probably wouldn't care, and i don't mean to be negative, but they really don't. i've been dating this girl for already a year now and i can honestly say that i'm in love, and i promised her if i ever became a threat to myself that i would finally tell my parents about my deep seeded issues and pursue therapy. i texted my dad a little bit ago , a short text basically seeing i need help but don't wanna go into it. i already regret but i did it for her. i just wanted to know, has it helped anyone else? i'm really hoping it does for me cause i would love to be happy with myself .
