i don't wanna do this anymorei don't wanna do this anymore. i have one friend, she lives far away. i'm slowly but surely destroying our relationship with my instability. i've lost all my interests, hobbies and passions. i feel like im waiting for something that will never come. i've given up on feeling better. i really need help but i'm not sure if it exists. i'v been through lots of therapy, drugs, treatment programs, etc. but nothing has changed. and the worst part is i'm too much of a pussy to kill myself. at this point im the boy who cried wolf. lots of failed attempts, lots of bark but no bite. i'm just not sure what i can do anymore. i dont have money to do anything that i could want to do, i live with my parents who are starting to hate my presence. i've left my house about 5 times in 2017 and dont have the will to even get high anymore.

i'm dismissed every time i ask for help because "i'll never accept it and never make any effort"

i don't wanna exist anymore.
