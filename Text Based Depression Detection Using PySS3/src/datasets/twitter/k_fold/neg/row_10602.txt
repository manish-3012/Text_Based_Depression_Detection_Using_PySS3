Know what sucks?I was drawing on my arm just now and I realized that, no matter how good of a day I'm having, how happy I wake up, how nice it is outside, I'm still going to have to look at my fucked up wrists from the last time I tried to kill myself and the time before that. I have to put on a long-sleeve shirt, make sure I don't roll it up too high, and remember that place I was in the last time I wanted to die enough that I cut into my own skin with a razor.    

That's a fucking bummer...
