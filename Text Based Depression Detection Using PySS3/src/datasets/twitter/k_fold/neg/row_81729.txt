I just can't deal with life any more.My whole life feels like an uphill battle. My anxiety and its effects have got too much for me to handle, I've collapsed twice in the past week due to high stress/anxiety. I finally thought I'd found some happiness. And I had to go and fuck it up, being the self-destructive cunt I am.

I made a genuine mistake with a best friend and it hurt her. I didn't mean to. I know she doesn't believe it was a genuine misunderstanding. I don't know how she is and I can't cope, I really cared about her. I just wanted to make her happy. I've spent the past 7 years with anxiety and worrying that people would believe lies/accusations written about me online and I just can't fucking take it any more. Why should I be punished for stuff I haven't even done, stuff that was made up to intentionally ruin my life. I just can't take it any more. The first time I experienced anything close to love and I had to go and fucking ruin it.

I can't live knowing I hurt someone I truly cared about. I'm burned out and can't do this any more. My anxiety won't stop. I've got no fucking life left to give.
