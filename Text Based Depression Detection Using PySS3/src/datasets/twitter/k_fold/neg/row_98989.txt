Goodbye everything hopefullyI have a noose tied in the cabin and access to a shotgun with birdshot Iâ€™m just trying to convince myself to just do it! I guess the reason for all my problems are from not doing anything I have manic depression bipolar and I really donâ€™t feel anything anymore but I canâ€™t get past the fear of not being able to go back if I want once hanging itâ€™s one of the only ways I feel alive Iâ€™ve tried to get myself to do it multiple times today itâ€™s so frustrating it would only hurt for a couple minutes compared to what Iâ€™m facing in my actual life now if I donâ€™t. Fuck.
