Just Need Some AdviceSorry if this is in the wrong forum. I spend a lot of time reading here I and feel like I identify more with this forum than the â€˜Self Helpâ€™ or â€˜Depressionâ€™ forums. Also, Iâ€™m not actively suicidal right now. I just want to put my situation out there and get some advice.

Basically, I graduated college \~4.5 yrs. ago (27M) and took a job a new city, away from family and friends. I had anticipated it would be difficult at first but frankly life never â€˜took offâ€™ I have no friends outside of work and, except for my job, I feel like I donâ€™t belong here. This is not helped by the fact that I am a shy introvert with few hobbies and no passions. I spend most nights/weekends at home.

I had ups and downs over these years and tried different things, but it culminated in a period of heavy drinking and intense suicidal ideation. After which I went to see a therapist for several sessions. In the end though, I donâ€™t feel like I benefited from the therapy and I have no idea what to do now. I am deeply embarrassed by this whole experience, and I donâ€™t really have anyone to talk to.

I could try to start over where I am which is essentially what I am doing now. It is difficult though, because I feel like I have failed here. I sometimes muse about moving to a new city, where at least I could enjoy the advantage of saying â€œIâ€™m new hereâ€ but I donâ€™t know if that is just wistful thinking, and if Iâ€™ll end up repeating the same mistakes. If nothing changes, I am certain I will end up where I was before and I am not confident I could make it through again.

I will try to answer any questions that are posted but please be patient as I am not online all the time. Thanks for reading.
