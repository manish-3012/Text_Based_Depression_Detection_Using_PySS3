Help. Just so depressed.I don't want to take my life. Over all I enjoy myself.
I cannot handle everything right now. From being laid off, trying to plan a wedding that might have to cancel(it's a month away and we can't afford it) to finding a new job that's 10 hours away and I have to move asap. Then on top of that having an abusive father who comes off very alpha and won't leave me alone by being a control freak. I don't know what to say or do anymore. It's all crumbling and I'm alone. I feel like life is worthless. Is anyone out there who can talk to me?
