Everything that defines me is a lieI just recently moved from an overseas school in which I was considered to be one of the 'smarter' kids, even though it was a pretty shit school I started to build my ego and everything of this intelligence that the school made me feel until it was essentially the centerpiece of my existence. Well I just moved to America and started a SAT class, and now I'm so depressed that I seriously feel like killing myself. We did a practise test and marked it as a group on the same day and I did fucking terrible, especially on math which I thought was one of my strong suits. Kids who were a whole year younger had scores that put mine to shame. Even if I was more anxious and stressed out than I've ever been in my life while taking that test, the score I got was one of the worst in the entire class and there just is no excuse for doing that poorly other than that I'm a fucking idiot. I feel completely empty now, like I've been robbed of what defined me most. I'm sure you're thinking something like "What a spoiled brat, its just a test",  but I have put my education above everything else in my life, I have no friends to hang out with outside of school and I'm really socially awkward so my intelect is all I have in this life, the intelect that I never had in the first place, so what does that leave? I can't even fucking write anything else I'm just so full of rage, fear and dread for my shitty future. Fuck everything!
