Hello, guys!I'm 13, and I have been through a lot of tough shit. First, it started when my dad abused me and my mom. I got adopted shortly after when my dad and mom started picking up an addiction to crack/cocaine. When my mom died in 2016, I attempted suicide 9 months later twice. Since then, I've attempted suicide 7 times, and when I was in boy scout camp when I was ten, I was raped in a bathroom.

My point is that I've been through a lot of shit, and if ANYONE wants to talk, just talk to me. I know how it works. People tell you to talk to them if you feel sad, but you don't. I've been through so much. To everyone battling depression who's reading this, bookmark this page, and if you feel sad, or depressed, i'm here. I can understand whatever you may throw to me, and i'll try my hardest to cope with you.
