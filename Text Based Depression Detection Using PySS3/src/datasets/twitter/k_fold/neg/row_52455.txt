Nothing matters...When you know that people only give a marginal shit about you. When you know that you only have a specific value to contribute to peoples lives. When you know that the world is a cruel and terrible place and that as much as people claim that theres more to life out there, that's the easy answer that they give so you feel like you have something to live for. I'm not stupid, nor am I under the impression that life is fair and rewards those that wait. I am just so fucking tired of endlessly waiting for things to get better. There is nothing for me to look forward to after I graduate. How do people continually live with the idea that things are going to get better when in reality they are simply just going through the unpredictable, unknown motions of life? How does one expect to just get up and at 'em every day with no promise of a better tomorrow? How can people simply survive on the mantra that "it gets better" when that is in no way guaranteed in this life? I am so tired of the fake amalgamations that I call a life. I'm sorry for this rant but I truly am beginning to just now see that everyone is truly in it with themselves in this world.
