I can't do this anymoreI've just had enough. I don't feel that I'm in control of my life anymore. I've had suicidal thoughts for a long time now, maybe 6 or 7 years now. I've never acted on it seriously but I just can't do this anymore. I don't even really know why I'm posting this. I don't have the guts to do this sober, so I picked up a bunch of beer. I always told myself that this would be a decision I made sober, and you know what? It was. I just can't follow through with it in that state. I've always worried about how my mom will take it more than anything. Deep down she is a strong woman and I know she will get through it. I have a fiancÃ©e now, but she will get through this too. I was held back by the thought that if I did it, she would too but she will be able to get through this. She confirmed that when I kind of brought it up a while ago. I've spent a lot of my life worrying about others feeling and emotions. And finally I think this time I just have to be thinking of myself. I'm not trying to make this a selfish decision but at some point, I have to look out for myself too. I've always been a kind person, and you know where it got me? Well. Here I guess. Just fuck it all.
