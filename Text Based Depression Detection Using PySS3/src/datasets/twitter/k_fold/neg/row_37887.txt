rant | i don't feel like i own my body.this might sound very shallow and stupid coming from a sixteen year old but i've been feeling detached from my own body, i feel like it doesn't belong to me and whenever i look in the mirror i feel numb. i've been using cutting as a coping mechanism to make myself feel something but due to my loved ones finding out, they've been more attentive when i act distant because they think i have new scars on my skin. i've been clean for months but just a few hours ago, i've been itching to feel something on my skin so i resorted to scratching myself. 

i remember vividly, this started out when i was around nine or ten when i got extremely sick and my classmates and teachers congratulated me saying how good i looked when i lost weight. i resorted to starving myself, i made it a task to only eat a piece of bread for months until i can see my ribcages. at that time, i was happy and yet in a very toxic mindset.
i'm still trying that method to lose weight up to this day but it doesn't satisfy me anymore. i felt disconnected with my own body thus i resorted to cutting to make myself feel something. despite it being painful, i tell myself, that at least there's something to remind me that i'm human.

as i grew into my late teenage years, i feel more and more like a subconcious living in a physical body rather than an actual human; i hated my physique, i hated having a very feminine figure. i wanted to be petite, i don't like my chest and how every time i see an outfit i like, it ruins everything for me.

i have suspections that i'm experiencing gender dysphoria but there's also the thought of me just simply being very dysmorphic about my body. i don't think i can last a few more years living like this, it's chipping away at my thoughts.
