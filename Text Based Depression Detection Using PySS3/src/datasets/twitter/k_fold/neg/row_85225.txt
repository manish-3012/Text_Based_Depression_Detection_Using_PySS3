one more time that Iâ€™m going back.Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for years (foolishly tried twice thinking I was doing it right)  and many times I kind of set a date limit. Well, tomorrow Iâ€™m going back to regular life, one more time that Iâ€™m still going to be around and didnâ€™t go through with it. Donâ€™t know about the end of the year, hopefully Iâ€™ll have the courage and will have everything (or most of it) done and free to go. 
This is all so very pointless, meaningless.. and not in a good way, in an anguished way.
