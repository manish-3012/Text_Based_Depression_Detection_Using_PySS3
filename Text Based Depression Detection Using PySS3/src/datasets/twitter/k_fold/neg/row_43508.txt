the cavalry's not coming and it's time for me to clock outevery time i think about going through with it i've always had something to stop me. i was ready to kill myself at 18 and convinced myself to at least make it through college to see what the world had to offer. i'm 21 now and almost graduated and through every serious suicidal moment, something has happened or i have reached some sort of realization that gave me enough strength to go on a little longer. i've had my mind made up for weeks now and the cavalry is not coming.

i don't see any future for myself that ends well. it's not unlikely that i can find happiness eventually, but the time and pain it would take to get there is too much for me to bear.

tomorrow night i am going to see some of my friends at a group gathering. not to be dramatic, but it has been a very long time since other people have helped me feel peace. i no longer feel the warmth in my heart that i used to feel being around the people i love. i seriously doubt this will be any different. so tomorrow night i am saying my goodbyes. it will be hard but these people used to bring me so much comfort that i owe them something positive on my way out.

there is a gun store within walking distance and i live in a state with few gun laws. it will take no more than an hour to walk in, sign the forms, and walk out. there is a park nearby, where i will call 911 before doing it so that the police can find me instead of my roommate. 

i am going to leave a lot of pain behind. a lot of people are going to be hurt and my sister may never recover. i wish i knew what to say to these people. my friends may hurt for some time but after a while of my absence they will move on because life goes on. i cannot suffer for their peace anymore
