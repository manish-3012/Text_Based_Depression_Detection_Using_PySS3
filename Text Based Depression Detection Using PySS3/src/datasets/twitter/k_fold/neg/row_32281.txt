Cutting doesn't help anymoreI think I'm finally done with everything. Nothing makes sense anymore. I'm a failure at everything and a stranger to everyone I once knew. Tonight I lost the last thing I was holding on to and honestly don't know if I can go on. I created this account mainly to say my goodbyes to the reddit community that helped me so much. Thanks guys.
