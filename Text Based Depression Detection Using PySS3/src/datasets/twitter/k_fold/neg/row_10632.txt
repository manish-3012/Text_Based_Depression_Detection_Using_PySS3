Would knowing the whys help me?I want them too. I'd think they would I couldn't speculate. But I know that any of the questions I want won't have any answers I can live with. But not knowing why and how I got to this place and if I could of done something to prevent it wouldn't be knocking at me shaking. I can't takl like I type all crazy its too much too scary. 
Why is it so easy to not have me?
Why did you say that we'd get married? Don't answer if you are reading I didn't make this for you I just need to talk to reddit because I don't have anyone else on hand.
Could I have done something, I would be anyone if I could?
Why are you in make up? Could I have any effect on your life? when you wanted me to let you know you were the most beautiful in the world, and I thought I let you know without make up in the mornings I loved you most. 

Why couldn't I get another chance?
If I could be saved why won't you?
Why didn't I was the god damn right towels?
WHy did I try to sell me to you when I should of told you how muhc you meant?
I don't know my motive for anything.
Did something happen to you? Please let me know, I could die happy if I gave my life to fix it, and you could not feel guilt, It would be so much easier than this, and I asked for my use.  WHy can't I confident, would it help.
