Etika.I just watched his last video, i really feel him. I already decided i will be going a week ago but his video really set it in stone for me. Sometimes people are just destined to not live as long as others, i feel sorry for him and i hope he gets a spot in heaven if there is an afterlife. Knowing that suicide leads to hell in many religions, i'm fearing the worst for both of us but then again, if there is a hell. There's already a spot reserved for us anyway. RIP Etika, i wish you didn't serve as an example. Life can take a turn for the worst, doesn't matter how happy you are, doesn't matter how small the inconvience is. It can end just as quickly as it started.
