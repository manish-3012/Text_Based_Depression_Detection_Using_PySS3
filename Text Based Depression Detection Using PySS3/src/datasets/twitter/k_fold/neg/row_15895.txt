LonelyI don't even know what to say but here goes...

i am 19m, unattractive uni student with very few friends. ive had depression and anxiety since highschool and on antidepressants which dont seem to be working that well. ive had 0 luck with girls (or guys for that matter). i am disconnected from my father, havent gotten over stuff from past with him and just barely tolerate being in the same room as him.

i just feel super lonely. i rarely get messages from anyone wanting to just chat with me, only when i ask something.

i did ok in my gcses (2a*, 4a, 3b, 2c, d, f, u), got to college and did kinda meh in my a levels (a*, 2b, c) and then failed my first year at uni. switched course and now half way through and im falling behind and losing all motivation to continue.

 ive considered suicide before but never had the balls to follow through with anything. now, lying in bed the night before going back to uni (i live 4 hrs away) and im feeling the worst and most loneliest ive been yet.
