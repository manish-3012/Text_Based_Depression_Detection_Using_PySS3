Losing the War within (veteran)I dont know if it is the right spot for this but I feel it belongs here

I am a veteran of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and have been in the civilian world for 5 years now. After I got out I felt that the world was mine. I never thought of the time I spent overseas and really got along well with everything. Held down jobs with increasing responsibility and even finished college. I live in the SF Bay Area which is notorious for being a stressful place. 

However in the last year I have been having terrible night terrors. It is almost like my sub concious takes over when I "sleep" and destroys my mind. After sleeping for 8 hours I wake up feeling terrible. The dreams are not there but I can feel that it was a painful experience. I lost my job after not being able to show up after a terrible night after terrible night. My girlfriend left because of this, she even filmed it for me after much denial on my part. After I witnessed this I was shocked. In my sleep I turn into a fearful and extemely stressed person. Like I am in combat every night. 

To ward off this I have been drinking pretty heavily. The other night I was very drunk and put an un loaded handgun in my mouth to see if I had the guts to do that. It has become a horrible cycle. My emotions are so out of whack that I am hardly able feel any real joy anymore. I just go through the motions and wonder if it is my time. I feel that my purpse is through, maybe my contribution in this life was my deployments. Maybe that was what I was meant to do and no more. I look to god to find this truth. Why am I still alive if that was my purpose?

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
