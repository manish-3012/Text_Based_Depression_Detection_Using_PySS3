I donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s happeningLast week was the first time in over 5 years I obviously survived and I was ok for a few days but today everything is back with a vengeance. I am literally working out the different way I could do it in my head.  I have been fighting anxiety and depression for as long as I can remember but itâ€™s getting worse. I donâ€™t know how much I trust myself anymore.    I know I donâ€™t have a horrible story and it makes me feel weak. People deal with so much more than I do. Why canâ€™t I handle this?
