I see a bridge, my mind says yes but I never doIt's so wierd, I mean OK today I understand, I've just got back from a great night out, no paranoia, which is a massive burden on my life, but suppose that's because there was only 5 of us, for my mates 18th. Anyway, on my drive back I had to drive under these two bridges and the bridges always seem to beckon me, but there's something that says no. I was gonna jump last week but, again, something said no and then I ended up... Y'know, sorry, just trying not to trigger anyone. I feel so pathetic, my life's going fucking nowhere and my mind screams 'then just end it' and I totally want to agree, but as I've stated too many times, something says no, something I equally love and detest... Fucks sake
