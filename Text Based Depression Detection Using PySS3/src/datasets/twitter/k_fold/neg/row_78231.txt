ComfortSuicidal thoughts at some points has been so strong that I fully planned out everything. Gathered supplies, but lately I feel I need to restock as I got rid of everything. I have done so much research and feel I have a no fail plan. I need it so at anytime I can be ready to go. Suicide is a comfort to me, a way out, and I feel I may need one soon. I have been disassociating for weeks, feel horrible and can barely stay awake, my eating disorder is worse than ever, and I obsess over everything. I hate this place, I donâ€™t know myself anymore, I feel so overwhelmed and upset all the time, I just want comfort, I want to sleep, I want to go away. Iâ€™m there again...I just want to be gone.
