I think I have literally 0 best friends including the internet now. We haven't talked in weeks and we keep saying we're going to talk and we never doI haven't had an IRL best friend for about a year and a half now. Ruined that one by saying she was my "favorite person" more than once while she had a boyfriend. I realize now that's probably even heavier than telling someone you love them. Even though I would've been fine with having them as a friend I really felt I wanted to let her know just how much I appreciated her. Like this chick was the first person to prove to me again and again that she legitimately liked being around me and liked having me as a friend. Even though she had plenty of other friends she legit liked hanging out with me and no one has even done that before. There are people I THOUGHT had done this but then later turns out that wasn't true but of course I still tried to be their friend and follow them around all the time and probably be annoying. Of course there are people at work that I don't dislike but right now that's about it. Just people I kind of don't dislike and tolerate.

Anyone who says internet friends aren't real friends are so fucking wrong. But we never follow through on voicechatting anymore. Like someone will say like for instance today it was "hey lets voicechat tomorrow at 7:30" and every time I would build my whole schedule and everything I'm doing after work to fit that time and they just dont respond when I ping them or say they're busy now. Jesus god fuck I am so goddamn lonely and desperate to have a conversation with someone I actually want to talk to. Having someone like the person I knew a year ago would be a fucking miracle right now. Like if I actually met and knew them in real life but I really don't think that could ever happen again and I fucked it up.
