Just another suicidal person..I want no one to cry after me. So I broke up with my bf over a long ass accusatory text and had a fight with my mom and sister.

I'm all alone in my apartment whichs rent I won't be able to afford next month. I'm unemployed as I go to full time school which I'm only failing in. This means I'm also uninsured, in a country where everyone has free health care. Can't go to a therapist or hospital.. 

 the only thing stopping me is the uncertainty of taking those pills. What if I give in to the pain and go to the ER? I would be in even more dept. I wish I would just drop dead. I wish I would have killed myself 12 years ago when I was 10. I wish to close my eyes and never wake up again
