What's the point of life ?Now I don't know if this is the right place, but I was just looking to vent a little, but I'm not suicidal

I do wish I was dead every day though, but wouldn't take my own life.

I just don't get it, we plod through life and then we get to the end and who knows what, it doesn't really matter, it would be preferable.

If I get to to Heaven, that's obviously better, if there's nothing, well saves me doing this, and if it's hell, well it's for eternity, so what does it matter, if I start a few years early ?
