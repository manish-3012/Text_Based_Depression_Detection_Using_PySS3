I'm worthless.I have nothing to offer. I'm a burden on my family, all I do is cost my parents money; I can't find a job, can't decide on a career, I can hardly leave the house. I'm so ugly, I'm getting fat, I don't even feel like getting dressed in the morning. I have no real skills or talents, and my self-esteem is nonexistent. I don't feel that I have a purpose in life... I'm just worthless and unimportant.

I have no friends and my family hates me. We barely talk. My siblings are all really close, but I'm always excluded from everything they do. I just want someone to talk to but I have no one, and I can't fix years and years of having no real relationship with my family. My parents don't believe in depression so I can't talk to them about it even if I wanted to; they laughed at me when I tried to bring up getting therapy once.

I hate everything about myself. I have no goals and no direction, I can't get motivated to do anything, and I dropped out of college and disappointed my parents even more. I'm tired of being dependent on them and I'm so done with this crappy life. I know they'd be upset if I killed myself but at least they wouldn't have to deal with me anymore.
