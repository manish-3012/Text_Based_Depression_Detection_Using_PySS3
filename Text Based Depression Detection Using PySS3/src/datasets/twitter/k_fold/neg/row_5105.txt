Am i the only one?My mom is really the only thing keeping me here. I woke up in a really bad place and found a card with my name on it. My mom had got me roses for absolutely no reason other than her love for me. Instead of making me happy, it made me really sad. I love her more than anything in this world. I don't deserve this. She doesnâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on in my head, I told her about my depression and how i have been growing more tired of life every single day but she wouldnâ€™t listen, she didnâ€™t take me seriously, eventually she just walked away and started doing the dishes. It hurt at first, but i donâ€™t blame her, sheâ€™s just scared. Even if she doesnâ€™t understand me or my life her pressence still calms me like nothing else, just the sounds of her cooking in the evening, or how she asks about my day every time i come home, she loves me and never judges me for my mistakes. I just know my death would destroy her, i know she would see it as her fault and she will never be the same again. I love her, and i will fight on for her, i  have no doubts as much as it hurts, she is more important than me.
