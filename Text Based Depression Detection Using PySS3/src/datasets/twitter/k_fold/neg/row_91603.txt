What is wrong with me?(Sorry for my bad English) I am 16 y/o and for now i have a full happy life i have an a supportive family i have a couple of friends and i have an a beautiful girlfriend. I should be very happy but i am still feeling empty. I am fighting w/depression since i was 13 never told anybody except some of my friends and my girl. I had a lot of suicidal urges in the past and even tried once. I hate myself and i am a very VERY aggressive guy and i think that this hurts the people around me(especially my girl)which makes me hate myself even more. Sometimes i look at the mirror and  say to my self that i am a worthless piece of shit. I have no appetite for life what should i do???
