Coming off of Effexor sucks....So I've been slowly reducing my dosage, gradually increasing Wellbutrin. A few days ago, I finally reached the point where I could cut the Effexor out entirely and I felt pretty good. My outlook was better, and I really felt like I was going to be okay.

 That was like four days ago, and now, I'm right back to the point where I sleep all day long, and every waking moment feels like torture. Every time I think I might be able to get up and function, I get the horrible dizziness that accompanies Effexor with drawls. Suddenly, I can't think of a scenario where I don't end my own life. In March I tried to kill myself, and today, I'm right back to that point again. The thing is, it's so much worse. I'm just so angry, and I have zero patience for other people. 

I know these feelings are all basically chemical, and that if I just hang in there, it's going to get better, but I'm just so tired of this crippling depression, and I'm almost ready to do anything to escape my own life. Has anyone here gone through Effexor withdrawls before? How much longer can I expect to feel this way?
