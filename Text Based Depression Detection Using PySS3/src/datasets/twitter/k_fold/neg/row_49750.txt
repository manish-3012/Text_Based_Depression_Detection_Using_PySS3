I don't want to be hospitalized again but I can't stop thinking about ending it allI'm bipolar type 1. Was hospitalized Jan of this year for the 7th time from extreme depression and psychosis from meds not working. I was put on lexapro and zyprexa. They helped for a bit but for the last month I've been getting worse and worse. I fucking hate myself so damn bad, I'm so tired of my psych not listening to me, tired of exhausting my family who are as of bow just fucking sick of my depression. I started hurting myself again. Just a little. I'm so tired. I'm tired of shit not working. I'm tired of pain. I'm just so tired. I don't know what to do, I feel like a complete failure and am tired of being told to keep my head up it'll pass. I'm fucking sick of trying this endless game of rotating pills that don't work. I'm stuck and I just want to go drive somewhere secluded to not be found and maybe jump off a cliff or some shit. Or just overdose on pills. I can't get it out of my head but I don't want to be hospitalized again they take away my anxiety meds and I have a real bad anxiety disorder thanks to past sexual abuse. I'm just done with life and tired of trying so hard for nothing. What can I do? I'm so confused and just crying at damn everything. I'm so sick of this.
