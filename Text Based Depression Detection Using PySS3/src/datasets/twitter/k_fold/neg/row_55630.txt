unsurprisingly hate the holidaysAll of the failures I see in myself are magnified on xmas. Trash job, so I'm working the holidays, but I'm worthless so I didn't have anything to do anyway. No friends hit me up to do anything. I watch random people having fun while I try to conceal a breakdown at work. Muster will to call my mother, but she doesn't answer. Now I'm sitting here begging the cannabis to take effect, so I don't have to feel this shame and worry. I've put off killing myself so many times that I doubt I ever will, which makes me feel more afraid and hopeless that this will just worsen as I age. I'm 30, depressed since 16, got shittier after 24. happykrismas.
