I'm 16 years old, and THIS YEAR is my "win or die" year.If this year does not live to be successful, if I don't not end up look any better than I do right now, if I do *not* have my dreams accomplished, and if everything goes to total shit (as it is right now), I will go to the mall with my mom one day and I will run &amp; jump from the highest floor. This has been thoroughly planned

If this year *does* happen to be somewhat successful, and I end up looking better, and I somehow end up taking someone to the junior ball with me, and if I end up making actual friends that respect me, I *won't* die.

I'm not saying I'm suicidal, I really don't want I kill myself. In fact, I've never hurt myself or cut myself not even once. I'm terrified of death. But as I said, this is my *win or die* year. If I fail this year, then it is ultimately guaranteed that the rest of my life shall continue that way. I am better off dead. And when I say that, I am truly serious.
