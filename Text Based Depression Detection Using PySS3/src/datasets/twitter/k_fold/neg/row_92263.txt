The other day I seriously considered overdosing and was in the ER. But whoever I mention it to, they never ask why I was in the ER.I mean Iâ€™m feeling better now than I was but Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m out of a job and Iâ€™m not mad bc I feel like my depression and anxiety have gotten so much worse since being there. I mentioned that to a few people like â€œyeah it wasnâ€™t great and it had me in the er lolâ€ and not a single person asked why I was there. 

I mean these are people I consider friends, you know? I havenâ€™t been in the hospital for anything serious before so itâ€™s like it would be something normal for me. I donâ€™t know. Maybe Iâ€™m just being an attention whore.
