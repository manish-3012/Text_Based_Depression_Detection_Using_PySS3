No ReasonSo, here I go again. Sitting in front of the restaurant, typing this on my phone, while I'm drunk as hell. How did I get to the point, where I willingly broke my promise to completely give up on alcohol? 

First off, about two months ago, I relapsed and went back to rampant alcoholism just before my high school finals. My girlfriend was worried about me, and asked me to stop it. So I stopped. Before I got together with her, I went through five years long period of depression, which ended with me giving up on alcohol for the first time (I was addicted to alcohol for two months to the point, where I was sneaking alcohol to school). She helped me out of it all, helped me up. But now, we've grown appart, I have a suspicion that she is cheating on me, and it's only a matter of time before we break up. On top of that, my dog is growing old, and has the first half of his life behind her. 

These are the two last things keeping me from ending it all; my girlfriend and my dog. But now, with my long distance relationship on verge of breakup, and with my dog's last 7 years left, I have nothing to look forward to. I feel that I have 7 years left before I end my life. (and now my mom is casually talking to me while I write this, but she doesn't speak english) I don't feel like I want to go on, like I need help. My time is running out.
