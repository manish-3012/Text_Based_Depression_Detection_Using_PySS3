Worrying that Iâ€™m not worth enough to friends for them to put up with me.In my house recently, the two more assertive people have suggested (read: basically forced) the idea of having a bucket for every personâ€™s washing up and thus everyone just does their own stuff, while trusting everyone to wash anything communal as well as the kitchen itself after they use it. It worries me because Iâ€™ve tried so hard to improve my diet and if people leave stuff and claim they didnâ€™t do it, I wonâ€™t be able to clean someone elseâ€™s mess, cook, then clean again. I donâ€™t have the energy most of the time. 

They wonâ€™t listen to me though. They insist itâ€™ll be fine, but theyâ€™re the worst people for not cleaning up after themselves. I had to stand up for myself, and now Iâ€™m crying and stupid as it sounds, I feel like hurting myself more than I have for a long time. Iâ€™ve never self harmed before, but if I had a knife nearby I feel like I wouldâ€™ve done it. I just feel like Iâ€™m not worth enough to them to make simple changes so that I can eat properly. They kept acting like they didnâ€™t even know me, didnâ€™t even know how much depression drains me. This all comes at a really stressful time too. Dwp meetings comin* up, another load of people who constantly try to act like my disabilities and illnesses donâ€™t exist, bunch of terrifying paperwork to do for resigning my rent contract. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s the middle of the night here. Nobody but those two are awake. I canâ€™t go anywhere and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m gonna hurt myself and I know no one cares.
