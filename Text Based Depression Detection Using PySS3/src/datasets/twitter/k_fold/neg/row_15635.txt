Youâ€™re the reason I want to dieYour words weight in my mind. Your presence alone makes me want to vomit and caused raging thought of suicide to consume my mind until I either do vomit or relapse. Youâ€™re happy and well. And you say itâ€™s thanks to me. But how would you feel if you knew you were the final straw in my demise?

You said you wanted me to get better, progress, etc. I call it lies. I canâ€™t wait to buy a gun and leave you in the dark. I canâ€™t wait to have my body donated to science or whatever is useful of me gets used by a more deserving human. I donâ€™t want to be locked up. I donâ€™t want help. I donâ€™t want therapy. I want off of this fucked up world. This is the universe where terrible things resulted in my inevitable suicide and I canâ€™t wait to cease existing. 

Fuck you.
