I am not suicidal, but I feel like being dead is better than my life.**I forgot to mention this in the title, I am 18 years old.**

I am not exaggerating when I say my life is shit. A lot of my problems are fixable but I cannot find the motivation to actually fix any of it, and I think that stems from depression. Some of the things on my list below may not seem like that big of a problem to some, but they are a problem to me and I want to learn to change my ways.

Here is everything wrong that I can think of off of the top of my head.
___

* **I am a high school dropout** - Not only does this hurt my chances of getting a good/decent job when I am older, it also causes me a lot of stress and depression knowing the social stigma of high school dropouts. I dropped out of high school because I was stupid and very lazy, plain and simple. I would of rather skipped school and played my Xbox than get an education, and now at 18 I realize what a terrible mistake that was.

* **I am obese** - I am 6'0 and 250 pounds. I have always been a chubby kid but within the last 2-3 years, I started to put on serious weight. I know this is from years of eating nothing but frozen food, fast food, drinking a 2-liter of soda daily, and just sitting on my ass and never doing anything. Also, when I say obese, I don't mean like a giant fat man who you see at wal-mart on an electric wheelchair. I actually hold the weight decently for being 250 pounds but that is when I am clothed. Unclothed I look like a giant fat blob and it depresses the hell out of me. [Think this (this is not me)](http://i.imgur.com/mdHG3.jpg) and [not this.](http://i.imgur.com/ZpklB.jpg)

* **I have never had a girlfriend** - My relationships with the opposite sex (even as friends) are so non existent that even my mother has asked me if I was gay. This is due to a little bit of social anxiety along with a little bit of me never feeling confident about myself. I also can't act how I act around my guy friends, around girls, and that bothers me. If you could see some of the facebook chats I've had with girls, they are so fucking pathetic and overly nice guyish. I end up sounding like a weird, creep, with no balls. I act fine around other guys, but around girls, I clam up and can't think of anything to talk about.

* **My mother does not like me** - She has never directly said this to me, but I can just tell. We used to have such a good relationship when I was younger, but now any time we talk, it usually ends up in a fight and her calling me a loser, and I can't blame her. My 14 year old sister is the complete opposite of me. She is kind of overweight herself, but other than that, her life is great. She has a ton of friends, she hangs out with them a lot, she does great in school, and my her and my mom get along great.
___

The examples I listed above are the things that bother me the most about my life. The things I am about to list below are things that bother me but don't need as much explaining.

___

* **I don't have a job**

* **I don't have a drivers license** - (part of the reason I don't work.)

* **I have no sense of fashion** - My usual outfit consist of worn out jeans, a stupid t-shirt, and old Jordans. 

* **I have no self-esteem** - This is self explanatory.

These are the main problems in my life that I can think of off the top of my head. Any and all advice would be very much appreciated. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.
