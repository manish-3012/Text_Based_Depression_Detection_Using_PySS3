Useless personThe only reason why I have not killed myself is because I donâ€™t have the courage too. My life is a fucking mess. I am almost thirty. I still Iâ€™ve at home. I cannot hold down a job. I canâ€™t finish my masters degree because i have had so many problems with paying attention in school. I am drowning in student loan debt. I think that it is time for me to kill my self this Coming year.  I am tired of being such a burden to others. I used to think that the way that I lived my life was okay but it is not.
