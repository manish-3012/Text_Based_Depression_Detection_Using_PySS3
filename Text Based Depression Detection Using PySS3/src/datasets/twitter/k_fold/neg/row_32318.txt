I feel like nothing helps anymoreDiagnosed OCD, anxiety (social+gen), panic disorder, depression. On Sertraline 200mg. Almost 2 years clean from self harm. 3 suicide attempts in the past.

All the stress from school is just getting to me and nothing that used to help is working anymore. I study music and I love it, but the pressure has basically sucked all the joy out of it for me. If I had a bad day in the past I could just play or listen to music and I would feel so much better but everything just seems so pointless now. I'm never going to go anywhere with it and I'm not even good at it. 

I have to stop myself from looking for my blades/sharp items every 10 minutes or so and I scare myself when I walk near roads because all I do is think of how easy it would be to walk into traffic and make everything stop.

I know I'm avoiding talking to my friends/family about it because I know it will probably help. I just feel stuck in this dark, pointless, emotionless hole. I don't think I want to kill myself - I just want everything to stop. I want to not be here.
