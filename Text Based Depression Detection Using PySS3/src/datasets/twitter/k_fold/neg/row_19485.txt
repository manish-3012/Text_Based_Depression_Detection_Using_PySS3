I just want to stop.I don't want to "die" I just want to not exist, suicide is really the only means to that end. I'm not sad or depressed, nor am I happy. I'm just nothing. I have no unfulfilled desires or expectations because I have no desires or expectations. I have already done everything I want to do and life just has nothing left to offer me. I want nothingness. I'm in constant pain (physically) and am completely hollow (emotionally). There is just really nothing to me. I fall somewhere between unsatisfactory and mediocre in everything I do because I just can't care. It is all meaningless to me. Life is a wonderful thing for those that want it, I just don't. I never asked to be here, I've never wanted to be here. I'm empty and alone and I have nothing to offer the world. All I'm doing is wasting resources that could be better used by someone who wants to be here. Continuation seems selfish and greedy. I can't see myself continuing what I have already been fighting with for 15 years for what would be a normal life span. It really is not that I want to kill myself, I just don't know of another way to cease myself. I am a wisp in the background and serve no purpose. I just want to be allowed to stop being here. I tried killing myself about 15 years ago (age 10) and the thought of another decade and a half of everything just seems horrid. I'm a prisoner of existence and I want out. I have fought the urge every day for years, but I am tired. The constant weight of life is becoming too much for my willpower to handle and I want my deserved rest.
