Struggle in college leads to suicidal thouhts.I'm in my first semester and i struggle almost everyday.I'm an introvert and it's really difficult to deal with people for me, or even to start a small conversation.Major that i chose is a huge problem for me because i struggle with homework i was given,and i feel as if i chose wrong profession and it also requires leadership skills.How can i lead people or order them if i can't deal with myself? All this leads to stopping working out and starting bad habits like smoking cigarettes eating shitty food and overall feeling terrible. I don't really want to kill myself but these thoughts come and go and i'm scared that one day i might snap.
