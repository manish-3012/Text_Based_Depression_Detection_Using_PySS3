I'm done.I'm failing school. Taking out my depression on my boyfriend. Therapy/meds are no help. Making everyone else's lives miserable. Fucking up every good thing I've ever gotten. In a college that is too hard, a major that is too hard. Home now and have no friends. I've wanted to for a long time now but I never had the guts. I cut every night instead of killing myself. Now I'm going to cut deep enough to end it all, make the world a better place.

edit: hey guys if any of you were wondering I'm okay now. I decided to drink my problems away instead. Not good I know, but I'm still alive at least. I'm a mechanical engineer major, and I have no clue what I could change into because I'm not good at anything. But that's ok. I'll deal.
