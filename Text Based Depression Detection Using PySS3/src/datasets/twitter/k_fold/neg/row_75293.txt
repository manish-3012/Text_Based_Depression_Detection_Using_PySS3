Is writing stories about killing or harming a cartoon character who looks and acts like me harmful or beneficial?There's an (adult) cartoon character who looks and acts like me. In fact I found out about the show when someone pointed this out to me.

Whenever I'm feeling stressed (like today) I like writing fanfics where this character either ends up wounded or killed. My most recent one was him overdosing on drugs because his terrible childhood kept haunting him (something canon to the show). It included details like him vomiting and him dying of an OD from his point of view. 

He gets hurt several times in the show and sometimes I like watching that as a means of stress-relief.
