I feel like I don't belong hereLong story short (not really). I never felt like I ever belonged here. I wouldn't be good at talking, don't have friends to hang with, could never expose my feelings without consequence, grew up with anger issues, felt like a disappointment a lot. The one thing I always believed in though was I know where I belong, the Army. 
Going through Army training was the best time of my life so far, I belonged there and was happy training and doing. Then I came back home, had a plan while I was gonna stay here, unfortunately the plan flopped, I started getting too comfortable here, also started getting dependent on happiness through my S/O without realizing it until we broke up for the third time (3rd being the last for realzies) and I looked back on it. 
I've always felt like I lived in a fancy bird cage, with no purpose other than to wait until I'm 21 to get my mom her papers so she can be happy and live her dreams. Then I can finally leave this place and live my dreams, but I'm afraid if not for my dream then I'm a nobody, that I don't belong, I shouldn't be a burden to anyone else, and should off myself if I can't serve a purpose. I always thought suicide as something I would never do, but deep down I know I have an open mind about the act for some reason. Everyday here's just a cycle of me being disappointed in myself for so many reasons, then acting like I'm alright as not to burden my sadness on anyone else that doesn't deserve it. Then cry about it, not be able to change it, and repeat.
I'm fit, I'm healthy, have a good life, but afraid if something ever happens to where I can't serve my purpose, that the disease of suicide would effect me and I don't know if I could do anything to help it.
