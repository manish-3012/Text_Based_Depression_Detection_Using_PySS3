I am so lonely. I want to kill myself.Iâ€™m 30. I have no friends. Iâ€™m not sure why I canâ€™t find a relationship. I have tried super hard. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ugly and every other part of my life has been figured out. But this loneliness has haunted me since high school. 

I donâ€™t know what to do.
