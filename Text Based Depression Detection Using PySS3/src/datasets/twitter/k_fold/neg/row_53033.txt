My knees just decided to give out today and now I can barely walkThings were looking all right in my life. I really wasn't depressed or anything. Just reasonably content making it through life.

But since a few days ago my knees felt very weak and... off. For no reason. Then today it suddenly rapidly worsens and I can barely walk. In the evening I then get a fever, I have to throw up and all sorts of other symptoms. So I call the doctor and they basically tell me to just hang in there until tomorrow and then I can call my personal physician(or whatever it's called in English) who will decide what to do.

The fever and all the other symptoms have died down but I am so astonishingly frightened for the future now. Maybe this is nothing, just some weird knee infection and I'll be fine in a couple of days, or maybe some surgery, I wouldn't care as long as it got fixed.

But what if this is some incurable bullshit like arthritis and for the rest of my life I get to live like a cripple? I don't know what it is. But I have to just lay in bed and go to sleep and somehow not worry how my entire future will play out now.

It's crushing me. I'm struggling to hold back tears. At some random point this thing you never take for granted like the ability to walk is suddenly hung in the balance. It's like it's all meaningless because I can't control anything. I might as well just end it because who knows what life will take from me next.

Or again maybe it's nothing. This what I'm dealing with right now
