I want to kill myself but I cant(m14)(alt account) i have been suicidal for a year and a half maybe idk but I always want to kms. but I dont wanna kill myself I just kinda wish I was never born or something. I have a good amount of friends and they all care about me and love me but I always do something to piss them off. and idk how to talk to them about my depression (they know im sad) because of have selective mutism which is pretty much not being able to talk at certain times and I get nervous whenever I talk to them because I feel like im annoying them and wasting there time(they are girls btw). 

is anyone else like this?

also I need advice on how to talk to people about my problems without annoying:wasting there time.

(im on mobile and I have water in my phone ttbata why my typing is shitty):

Thank you
