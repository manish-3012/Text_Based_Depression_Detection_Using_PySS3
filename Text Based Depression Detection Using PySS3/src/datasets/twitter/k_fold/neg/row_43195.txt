Had a Apiphany! May save me/you!!So I've been suicidal, been really struggling finding meaning in my life! Awoke from a cult and now all feels hopeless and pointless. I just realized I have been looking at life all wrong.  The reason imho why everyone is miserable is because the world in which we live is based on greed ultimately. We may not start out that way but the way we are forced to work to make ends meet pretty much makes us this way. My thought is that we are trying to find happiness through personal gain when we should be trying to find it through helping others. Not trying to step on anybody's toes here but the bible does say they're is more happiness in giving than recieving. Now this isn't meant as a reason to go give people stuff but rather to help them (also imho). We each have a perspective on life that is different especially on this subreddit, if we can endure the pain we are going through we will be uniquely equipped to help others to climb the mountain, and then through our actions we can find true meaning. The kind of meaning where you'll be able to look back on your life and say that you really did make a difference! If you can get by with a Toyota Camry why buy a Lamborghini? Such things are pointless in the end and are expressions of selfishness. I've recently had the thought often that life is too long, but in truth it's too short its only our perspective we have from ours that effects our opinion. If we've only ever lived for ourselves we will only look for happiness from what we can gain for ourselves from both ourselves and those around us. You see if we live for ourselves we are never helping others, which is the true path to happiness. 

Anyway this got long, if your still with me thanks for listening.  I hope it makes sense, peace!!
