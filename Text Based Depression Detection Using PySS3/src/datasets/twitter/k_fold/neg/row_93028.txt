I feel so brokenThe only thing that makes me feel better is fantasizing about my death. Every day is something different. Pills, but what pills? Wandering around in the desert until dying of exposure, but what terrain would I prefer? Guns are easy, but where would cause the minimal amount of clean up? It's the only thing that makes me feel better.
