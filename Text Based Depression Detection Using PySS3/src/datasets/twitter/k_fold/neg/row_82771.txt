Hi strangerI'm not going to kill myself today. No I don't have cool backstories like most of the people here. No I am not abused physically nor verbally much. But please read this short thing I have for you. 


I have been bullied for 8 years now, never been in a relationship, never kissed, last hug was a year ago and it's summer break so I don't socialize at all.


I hate socializing because of my anxiety and fear of strangers. I usually just keep a low profile and deal with it.


I haven't been happy for a while now and also I have been thinking about ending it all. I have been going to my school therapist for a while but it just makes matters worse because it puts me thinking about my lifes details even more and makes me even sadder.


I am the middle child from a 5 person family. Our family is in a good financial and social place. I am not really poor nor rich, my parents aren't alcoholics or anything like that. My parents spoil my younger sister and allways yell at my older sister. I'm just there and no one really notices me that much unless they need something. My mom just keeps yelling at me, my older sister and my dad.



This is not important in any way.
I just want to write this because I don't belive I will make it past 25. Don't worry now, it's still a long way to go. Bye stranger for now. Have a great day/night.

TL:DR sad, have depression and anxiety, don't want to commit suicide but want to die
