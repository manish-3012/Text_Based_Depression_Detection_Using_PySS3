she will abandon me toomy dad abandoned me and kicked me out of his house when i was 19, i'm 21 now and i live with my mom, she told me she will never abandon me like he did, but her boyfriend keeps pushing her to go live with him (and i'd go too), but FOR FUCKS SAKE I DON'T EVER WANNA LIVE WITH ANY MAN, EVER AGAIN IN MY LIFE, BECAUSE I'M SO FUCKING TRAUMATIZED BECAUSE OF HOW MY DAD ALWAYS EMOTIONALLY ABUSED ME, i live with my mom and my great aunt and we're FINE in here, i know i'm currently an unemployed loser (and probably will always be) but i swear i'll f\*cking kill myself if she ever decides to live with him, I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THIS HOME, I'M SO FUCKING SCARED OF BEING ABANDONED AGAIN, GOD PLEASE DON'T DO THIS TO ME PLEASE PROTECT ME, every fucking friday it's the same talk again and again i'm tired of this bullshit why can't i ever have a good life, why can't i ever feel safe and sound, i'm home right now but i dont feel safe at all and i feel like my whole world is close to ending
