Failing out of college in my last semesterI was supposed to graduate last semester. I failed a bunch of classes because I didn't do any work. I am now on academic probation and 1 month away from "graduation". I probably won't be graduating though because I am very behind in my classes, haven't attended any labs and haven't even been put in a group for a project that was started 2 months ago. 

I'm going to kill myself in 1 month, to the day. The day before I should've graduated. There's really nothing anyone can say or do to stop me. The only way I'm not killing myself is if I manage to pass my classes with a C average: highly highly unlikely. I've disappointed and let down my parents 1 too many times. I have given my parents ~$100k in debt up to this point. I hate myself
