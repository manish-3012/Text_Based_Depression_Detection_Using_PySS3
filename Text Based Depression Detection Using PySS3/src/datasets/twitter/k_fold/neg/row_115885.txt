very, very, very low batteries......I don't think I'm in any danger tonight simply because i just am soooooooooo *spent*.   I'm not exhausted.  I don't feel angry or furious.  I feel not sad but melancholy.  Like I'm trying to walk while wearing a 6-inch lead blanket over my head and body.  

I've pushed away my last friend, and I've been broken up with a longtime partner for a few months now.  He's the only one I wish I could connect with, but that's impossible.  

I have a bit of a plan to accumulate painkiller-type-pills, over time, so that the next time I get as low as now or lower, the choice will be rather automatic.   Normally I'm quite aware of the CHOICE aspect of taking that road, and I choose to not hurt myself...I just feel dead anyway, dead already, I have such a hard time in general and have dealt with depression for most of my life now.   

so lonely.  too tired to think or act...but I do know that I don't want to be alone / lonely anymore but there's no real way out for me.  I'm lonely constantly even when around people...especially then.   

ok  pissing my life away, anhedonia always it seems
