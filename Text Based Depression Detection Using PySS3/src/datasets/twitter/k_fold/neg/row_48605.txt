My fiancÃ© and I made a pact...I almost killed myself a couple weeks ago. Sent out the texts to everyone saying good by and drove somewhere so no one knew where I was. I sat in my car for 2 or 3 hours trying to work up to taking the 5 grams of my medication that should give me a heart attack when you take that much. Needless to say, I ended up not doing it. My partner told me the clichÃ© â€œif you go, I goâ€. And I believe them. But we talked about it more and decided that if one person has decided to go, that we tell the other and we will do it together so we can die in each otherâ€™s arms,,, Only problem is I am feeling suicidal again, but I donâ€™t want them to join me because of course I donâ€™t want them to die. I am just scared and confused and fucking fed up with living.
