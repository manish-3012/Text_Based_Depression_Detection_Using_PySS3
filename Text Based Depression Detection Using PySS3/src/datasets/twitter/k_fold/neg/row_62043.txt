Ready for the long sleep, but I'll wake up again tomorrowHad some long text written out which I don't want to post anymore because who gives a fuck? 

Long story short, I'm in my early 30s now and the older I get, the more I understand how much of a fucking tragedy life really is. I knew it several years ago, but goddamn, it isn't getting easier.   


I looked up "I want to get cancer and die" and ended up here. I lack the reservation to end my own life.   


A part of me thinks that people with these thoughts aren't meant to survive. There are so many people on the planet and I've met plenty who enjoy life and can't understand why others don't do the same. I think it's those people that are meant to have kids and live a long life.  


The tragedy is that I might live until I'm 80. That I will have to go through the same motions for 50 more years.
