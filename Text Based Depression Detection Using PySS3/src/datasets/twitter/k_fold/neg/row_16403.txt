Not suicidal, but lost best friend to suicide. Need help coping.I lost my best friend of six years to suicide about 3 days ago. It was very sudden and unexpected, as he had made plans as far as two weeks from now. He bought concert tickets, arranged a sushi date, scheduled a doctor's appointment. I'm very confused and devastated.  

He had been there for me through all the rough times I've had. I also lost my dad to suicide and he stayed up with me on the nights when I couldn't sleep coz I was so grief stricken. We played World of Warcraft together and had conversations for hours. He was there when I lost my grandparents, my childhood dog. He helped me through the times when I myself had bouts of depression. All he asked in return was my friendship. 

He also had severe depression on top of multiple medical conditions, which caused him constant pain. I tried my best to be there for him, I always dropped what I was doing to be at his side when he was hurting, emotionally or physically. Now that he's gone, I feel like I didn't do enough. I loved him so much, and my love couldn't save him. 

I feel like part of me is gone. There is a huge void in my heart. I feel numb and empty. I keep expecting a call or a text. I keep checking my friends lists to see if he's online. I had a day of anger after he died. I blamed everyone I possibly could but that didn't help either. I'm also a bit mad at him for choosing this. 

I don't have a lot of friends, and he was the only friend who really knew me. Who I truly opened up to. I know I'll be okay some day, but what am I gonna do? Who will I talk to? What I am gonna do when I need my best friend? That's what scares me most of all.
