Staying alive for othersâ€™ sakeIâ€™ve been on and off suicidal for the past 8 or so years. Not because of anything in particular, just a mix of depression and anxiety. At this point, just being alive and awake hurts so much and I canâ€™t comprehend going on like this.

Sometimes I just feel as though Iâ€™m not cut out for living, no matter what meds or therapy or mindsets I try, I think that maybe Iâ€™m just not meant for this.
