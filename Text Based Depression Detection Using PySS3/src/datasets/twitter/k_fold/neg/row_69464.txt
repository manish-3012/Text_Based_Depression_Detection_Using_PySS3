I kind of feel like i don't have another choice anymoreMy Story of Problems got to big for me to even comprehend them myself.
I have gotten myself in so  much trouble i can't think of a way to get out of it anymore.
I have constructed a net of lies to convince others i am fine that is about to break in 2 days.
My financial problems are out the roof and i can't hope that i get out of this without bankruptcy. I have an illness that makes 90% of my skin to some kind of crusty burning, itching shit and everywhere i go there are lots of dander.


i am getting appart from my famaly, friends and everyone that tried to help me, 
because i soked the help up like a sponge but never did something  with it.


I Always whant to do something and have plans when in the end i do nothing.
It feels like i am not capable to do anything anymore. I don't have the strenght to deal with it anymore and i just whant to end it. I am already in the mindset to just waste everything i have on pleasure until the point where it all falls appart. Wich will be in about 2 days.


I don't realy whant to but my mindset is final. I will  visit my mom tomorrow one last time but  
to think about it just breaks my Head. I think i cant go without completly breaking down. But i can't... not again... i will break down again and everyone tries  to help again and in the end i will just be where i was before. 

I don't even have interest in living a live. I just cant stand anything anymore and i almost brke down writing this text. I already feel so unstable that everything mild could trigger me to do something stupid. And the shit i try to avoid is comeing soon. I know i won't be able to handle this
