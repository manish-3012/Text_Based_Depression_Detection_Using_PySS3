tiredI don't see a life in the future for me, I've tried so hard with therapy and to try and pull myself up but everyday it just gets harder than before. I'm so tired of waking up in the morning, I don't want to feel this pain everyday anymore. I feel like everything is wrong in my life and nothing I do makes anything any better. Every time I work towards something something happens and I'm set further back than where I begun.

I'm so lonely and I doubt anyone would care once I'm gone.
