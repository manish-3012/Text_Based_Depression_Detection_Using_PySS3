Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™m sorry
Iâ€™m sorry for what I want to do. My narcissistic mentality has caused enough pain, not just to myself But to the people in my life that I wanted to be around most. Iâ€™m sorry I was never any good at the things that mattered like being there for you when you needed me to listen. I didnt even try to understand what was wrong. Maybe I was just too in love with myself to understand certain things. Iâ€™m sorry I got upset when I should have listened. Iâ€™m sorry I was quiet when I should have spoken up. Iâ€™m sorry for not being able to snap out of it until you were ready to move on. I always wanted the best for us but I didnâ€™t have the motivation to make something happen. Now I have the motivation. I have the motivation because I lost you.
