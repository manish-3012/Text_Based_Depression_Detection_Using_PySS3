I'm starting to get tired of waking up, for the first time ever.I have been sad for a long time, but it's gotten so bad. I don't know how much I can take it. Lately, when I wake up from dreams, the only thing I can feel is genuine pain. I wake up and I just think "fuck man" as the reality sets in that today will be just like every other day for the last however long it's been since high school. I start to slowly remember that whatever was happening in my dreams wasn't real, and that it will just be another boring day of following the same routine. God damn it. There has to be some sort of escape from this life. I wish I wasn't so scared of pain.
