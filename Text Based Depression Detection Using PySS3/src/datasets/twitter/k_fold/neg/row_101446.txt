Hypocrites and the fucking human condition. Fuck it.
I love my Mother very much, yet she's so uptight about when I drink that I'm sick of her and lose respect for her every time she gets on my case about it.

I started smoking a couple of years ago but recently gave it up. Moved onto electronic cigarettes instead. She fucking smokes and kills herself every day, but she feels the need to get onto me about drinking.

Because you love me and brought me up in the best way you could, Mother, I wont get mad about you for it - just because there has been a history of bad drinking in the family doesn't mean I'm going to go the same way. I just want to fucking drink.

I've been thinking about topping myself recently. I'm going through numerous issues and feeling a combination of guilt and shame for a lot of shit I've done in the past that most people wouldn't even think about. Obsessive thoughts. Depression. Worthlessness.

This is why I drink a lot of the time. I would fucking *LOVE* to go back and fix it all, but I can't. I feel like a sack of shit.

The message is passed through the family and I always feel paranoid about drinking in the week, even if it isn't every fucking day. 

I'd love to fucking kill myself and be able to view the reactions of people at my funeral. Leave a fucking suicide note saying "well, look at yourselves, you fucking cunts. YOU DID THIS."

I probably don't mean most of what I say, but I'm tired of it. I really am. Wish I lived in America so I could get my hands on a gun. I'd be dead long before now. Fuck life at the moment. Fuck it.
