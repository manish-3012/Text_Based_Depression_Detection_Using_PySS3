I'm planning to say goodbye to this world once and for all on the night before the first day of school.It's that time of year again! I wasted my entire month of July on checking boring social media sites, and August is coming up, which is basically a Welcome Back to School month despite the first day being in September. The work is too demanding for my laziness, everyone secretly hates me for being different, and my legal guardians are not helping because my mom only "comforts" me by having the usual "my little angel is on the honor roll" attitude, and my dad sternly lectures me and takes away privileges for bad report cards. My death will be my greatest achievement, that's for sure.
