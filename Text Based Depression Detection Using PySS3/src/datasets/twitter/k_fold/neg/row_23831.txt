No more Romaniaaa~Wanted to go see my girlfriend as soon as borders opened up~
But she dumped my suicidal/autistic ass lol
Can't expect anyone to want to deal with that with you.. I'm just sick of always being alone tho, yknow? Like holy fuck my whole life! Then i decide to let my guard down.. let someone become my entire world/support structure and now I'm even more fucked up mentally because i now have to go back to how it was before and forget i spent all this time thinking she was the one..

Like, i should be happy with myself and i'm not,
Before her i was downing bottles of whiskey and sleeping pills.. getting catanonic and fading out of life bit by bit cuz i wanna die ðŸ˜‚ Now I'm back at that door and idk if i should knock.. because I'm always welcome ðŸ˜‚
But thats probably how im gonna die

Gg life
