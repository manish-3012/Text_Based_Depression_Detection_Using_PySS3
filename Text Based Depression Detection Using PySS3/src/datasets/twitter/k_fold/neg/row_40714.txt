I lost everything I had going for me, it keeps getting worse at 22 years oldI am ready to throw in the towel and stop plying this gambling game called life. 

I have not have had a break. I suffered my whole life as ADHD making impulsive decisions. One decision that landed me in big trouble that almost cost me my military career. I have moved on since then to make better decisions and after graduating moved to a different stare to turn over a new leaf.

But that was stripped away from me due to a clerical error from my unit. They didnâ€™t submit one paper that was needed to maintain my security clearance , and now my livelihood is turned upside down. I was taken away from work , like a criminal. Now it has to go through a long process of getting reinstated.

I just donâ€™t understand why I keep getting this curveballs thrown at me. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I just canâ€™t. I had a new apartment, a new car, and that is all going to get taken from me because of my units mistake.

I had an offer too, but my morality made it hard to accept. I have a contingent offer pending approval for funding and apparently that isnâ€™t happening anytime soon, just got news right after I declined an offer. If I accepted this offer, I wouldâ€™ve been working by Monday...but forget that now. I just thought it was the right thing to do since I wasnâ€™t going to stay at the place I declined long, and theyâ€™re a startup.

I donâ€™t understand life. I just want to be free. I feel entrapped in my body, in my life. Nothing so far has been a consistent positive, not even for a  couple months. 

I know I deserve better. I know Iâ€™m a good person. Itâ€™s so exhausting going on when everything I do is taken for granted or stripped away before I can get used to it.

Iâ€™m over this.
