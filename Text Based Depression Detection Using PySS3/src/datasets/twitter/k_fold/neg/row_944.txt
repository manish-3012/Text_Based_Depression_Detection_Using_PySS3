Low mood from issues at work(Also posted on r/advice)

23, M, UK

Evening all. Iâ€™m relatively new to reddit but have been lurking a while and noticed that this sub gives decent advice, and Iâ€™m feeling quite low this evening and feel I need to share my thoughts if you donâ€™t mind.

Iâ€™ve been at my place of work three years, I love it. Itâ€™s the industry Iâ€™ve always wanted to work in, the pay and benefits are great and I love the day to day stuff. Iâ€™ve attached myself to a group of friends which is great too, but over the past year thereâ€™s been a few times where people inside this friendship group have made some comments â€œin jestâ€ which have really hurt me. Iâ€™ve tried writing it off as banter plenty of times, and I know I am oversensitive so have to write some of it off as that too, but especially recently Iâ€™ve been struggling to cope more and more. 

Like this afternoon for example; I was in a perfectly happy mood having worked on my own all day, then walk into the office to complete some paperwork before I go home and three of the guys are in there. The dominant influencer of the three makes some comments dressed as â€œbanterâ€, and instantly I feel a sense of dread. Like someone has pressed a light switch, I feel a warm queasy feeling all over my body and I feel my chest go all fluttery. I struggle not to cry in front of them and leave quickly. I wonâ€™t go into the comments made, not because they are particularly nasty or anything but it requires inside knowledge of the job I do and that would take even longer to explain. 

Anyway so Iâ€™m feeling pretty terrible about all this, and begin to have violent visualisations where Iâ€™m hurting myself, like deeply cutting into my arms or falling from a tall building and my bones smashing. I canâ€™t stop these visions from appearing in my head and Iâ€™m almost craving the physical sensation that they depict. I do have a history of depression and low mood which stems from childhood (Iâ€™m 23 now).  In recent times these visions of me hurting myself seem to become my default response to feeling low. The violent thoughts soon progress into suicidal thoughts and I then spiral and get more &amp; more upset.

I canâ€™t tell work how I feel because if I admit the thoughts in my head I will be taken away from the work that I love and probably end up being made to go sick which will make me feel 100x worse.

My bf knows I get sad from time to time but I donâ€™t want to burden him with my problems because Iâ€™m scared that itâ€™ll put him off (which is pretty illogical because we live together and have been together a good while). I donâ€™t like burdening my parents either because theyâ€™ve got their own worries. 

I donâ€™t want to confront the boy because when Iâ€™ve told him before that heâ€™s upset me Iâ€™m made to feel like the one in the wrong because I canâ€™t handle the banter. Likewise I canâ€™t report it to work because I donâ€™t want to be labelled a grass, and Iâ€™ve always believed I should have the courage to confront the person and if I canâ€™t or wonâ€™t do that then I shouldnâ€™t get anyone else involved.

I know Iâ€™m giving excuses for literally every possible solution, (and Iâ€™m sorry about that because I canâ€™t stand it when others do that) but I guess just writing this post is helping to a degree 

Thanks for listening to me, anon internet user. Wish I had the balls to tell someone in real life.

TLDR: Friends at work are saying hurtful things, Iâ€™m unsure if Iâ€™m being oversensitive but regardless itâ€™s causing me to have violent visualisations of hurting myself/suicide which I canâ€™t turn off &amp; I feel I canâ€™t turn to anyone else in real life.
