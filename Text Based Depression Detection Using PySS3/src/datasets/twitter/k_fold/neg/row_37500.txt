Follow on to "I'm at total peace today"I've had a really great day. Got my truck detailed, went and got a shave and haircut, had what I've always wanted as my last meal (burnt ends, collard greens, fried okra, and banana pudding) then the only bad part was that i wanted to talk to my daughter, but my wife was making things difficult. Now i have all these different people reaching out to me to "not do anything stupid" lol. Why is it that all these people come outta the woodwork when you've finally come to peace with your decision? I'll got a couple hours still, so I'll give it another shot. 

Anyway, I've had a couple drinks, tooks a few muscle relaxers and been watching a show I'm into. I'll continue this for a couple more hours and then I'll polish off my bottle of crown royal and take my 30 temazepams. At which point I'll go to sleep. 

I've attempted suicide on a couple different occasions and it always felt like a cry for help. This feels different. This feels serene. I've said most of my goodbyes. Tied up some loose ends and i really don't care how my "friends" feel. It's all very liberating. There's an end and I'm the one who has control over it. I am finally a free man for the first time in my life.
