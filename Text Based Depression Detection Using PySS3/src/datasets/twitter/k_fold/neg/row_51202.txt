WHY?!?!Maybe I don't want to keep looking, hopelessly searching for that one special someone. Maybe, for once, just for fucking once, I want someone to look at me and have butterflies in their stomach. Maybe I want someone to approach me for once. Maybe I want someone to tell me I'm handsome and that they'd want to get to know me without me having to do anything beforehand. Maybe, after ten fucking years, I'm too fucking tired and emotionally exhausted to try anymore. Maybe I'm tired of feigning confidence and being called a creep because of it. Maybe I'm tired of being made fun of for my efforts from middle school all the way to my SECOND YEAR OF COLLEGE. Maybe I'm tired of people literally walking up to my face and expressing how ugly I am. Why is it so easy for some of my friends to have meaningless one night stands and not realize how lucky they are to actually be intimate with another human being on a DAY TO DAY BASIS? I  know the world owes me nothing. I was dealt a shitty hand. So why is it so easy for other people? What the hell did THEY do that was so deserving of praise and gratitude? Why is it, for those people, relationships are handed to them on a silver platter, yet they turn it down for meaningless SEX? Yet, someone like me, with the best of intentions, is still tasked with having to find what he's been looking for for the last ten fucking years? AND WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK DO I HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?  Fuck...I can't stop crying now...
