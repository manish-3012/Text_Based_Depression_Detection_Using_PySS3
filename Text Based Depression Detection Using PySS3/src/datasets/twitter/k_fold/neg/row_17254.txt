I feel like Iâ€™ve made all the wrong choicesRecently my depression and anxiety have come back, I stopped taking my adhd medication on a whim because I just felt a lot of anger/sadness and didnâ€™t care anymore.  I ended a long and beautiful relationship, the only person who Iâ€™ve ever been fully happy with and when I tried to mend the relationship they said they couldnâ€™t be with me right now.  Not that I blame them, I broke their heart and I could end up doing it again.  
I recently left a regular job for a remote position due to covid which I was excited about because I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about it, by the job is so much more stress than itâ€™s worth and I feel so isolated from the world.  Everything just feels wrong right now.  I keep thinking I should reach out to a counselor and be honest about the fact that I want to end my life, everything just feels like too much.  But Iâ€™m worried a counselor will reach out to my job (we get free counseling through my job) or worse, my family.  Iâ€™ve already had an episode in the past and I really donâ€™t want to put my mom through that right now when itâ€™s so close to the holidays.  I have 2 full months prescriptions of vyvanse and Iâ€™ve been trying to research if you can overdose on it.  I know I shouldnâ€™t but I so badly just donâ€™t want to not wake up anymore and deal with lifeâ€™s problems, they donâ€™t seem worth it anymore.  I feel like a burden to ppl ever since my depression/anxiety came back and I feel like everyoneâ€™s lives would be better off without me in it.  I know this could have taken a major turn due to the relationship ending and not being able to get it back.  But right now everything else on top of it just feels like a lot.  I also have to decide in a few days if Iâ€™m going to move to the other side of the country.  Part of me says eff it letâ€™s go and get away from all my problems, but that feels like running away and I know thatâ€™s not going to fix anything.  

I guess Iâ€™m just here to rant and maybe get some advice?
