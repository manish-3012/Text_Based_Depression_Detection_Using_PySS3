My family wants me goneLately I feel like my family wants me to die. They want me gone. Iâ€™m 99.9% sure that they view me as a burden and that they want me gone so they can live their lives without me. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m saying this because my family are the people that I have turned to in recent years for help and Iâ€™ve spent a lot of quality time with them. It has helped me a lot and is probably the reason that I am still alive today, but I guess I was wrong. I guess they just want me gone. I just need to stop being a wimp and do it already. Itâ€™s basically been made clear that itâ€™s my time since my family (the last people I have left) are giving up on me.
