How to progress?It took me almost 4 hours to figure out how to post here (simplify this website, thanks.)

I've not left the house for 6-7 years, I've visited my GP multiple times over the past 4-5 years with no avail, I don't know what to do anymore, I've seeked help from every public channel and being ignored, the only reason I'm still alive is because of my niece and nephew, but that won't support me forever, the last weeks have been horrible, what am I suppose to do? I suffer with agroprobia and social anxiety disorder, I don't know what to do anymore, I've already lost so many years of my life.
