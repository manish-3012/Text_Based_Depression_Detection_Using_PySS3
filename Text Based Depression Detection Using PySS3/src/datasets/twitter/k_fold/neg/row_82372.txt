Totally Worthless.As the title states, am feeling worthless to everyone around me. I'm 18 and my family seems to somewhat care about me but ignore me quite a bit. Besides them I have about 4 friends, one of them being a recent ex girlfriend who I still have feelings for (I know, bad idea). I feel like all of my friends could easily just find a new and better friend if I did just kill myself.

I also found out my ex slept with one of my 4 friends in the cabin we are all staying in for a week, I learned this info about an hour ago. This totally destroyed me and I'm trying to get my space from them right now but when I'm alone my thoughts go to a kind of dark place so thats probably why I'm writing this right now, I need someone to tell me anything about my situation and what I should do, I don't want to lose half of my friends, but I kind of feel betrayed. Suicide seems like a good idea if it weren't for my family, they are the only ones keeping me from doing it.
