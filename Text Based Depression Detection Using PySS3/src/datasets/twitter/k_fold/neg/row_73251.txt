I want to die but Iâ€™m scared of pain and death.Iâ€™ve been 16 for exactly 1 month today but these thoughts go back to when I was 13. Iâ€™m at a family gathering to send my cousin off back home to New York tomorrow, and I should be playing with my baby cousins or talking and having fun and instead Iâ€™m in the car crying. One of the babies just called me the â€œleast popular but still a good cousinâ€ which I think just sums up my entire life. Iâ€™m so tired. All the time. Itâ€™s so hard to function. 

I think a coma would be nice. The everlasting quiet sleep I so desperately need with 100% less fear of the other side and what people will feel. If I donâ€™t like it Iâ€™ll either wake up some day or I wonâ€™t. Doesnâ€™t matter at that point really.
