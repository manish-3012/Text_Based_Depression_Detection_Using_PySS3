In a lot of pain and a lot of people depend on me.I've lived with suicidal thoughts for the better part of a decade. They seem to be getting worse.

I have a family that I love very much, and I know they love me. But the pain I feel every day is getting so severe I don't know how to function.

I have a high profile executive job that pays well, but I'm so depressed I barely get by.  I know that if I get fired there's no way I can get work anywhere else because I'm so overwhelmed by suicidal thoughts and depression.

I know that suicide would harm my family.  I get emotional thinking about the impact it would have on them.  Historically it's thoughts of my family needing me that have prevented an attempt.  But now the urges are getting more overwhelming.

I'm not looking for guidance, just felt like typing this.  Feeling pretty scared and alone right now, so any comments are welcome.
