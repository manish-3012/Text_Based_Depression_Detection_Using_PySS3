Hello, still here. Does anyone know of a good OCD or anxiety or mental health workbook?Things are very bad today, which is not fun as my life is more or less better than when I last checked in. However, I'm still here, so I guess that counts for something. 

Boy, is it scary to ask for help. I hope I have the strength to do it this time. I'm kind of in a weird tango with my mental health where things get really bad and I comtemplate leaving, and then things are okay again. I feel happy sometimes, but not "deeply happy," if that makes sense. I can't afford therapy (and I wasn't good at communicating with my therapist when I had the insurance to see one), so what can I do? Any suggestions for workbooks? Is that a good place to start?

I love my SO, but talking with them isn't helpful. They're not a therapist. They can help me through bettering myself, but they can't hold my hand through it. That's my own responsibility. Right? But it's so hard to do that when I can't even see through the cloud of depression.
