Just survived a suicide attempt. Dad snapped at me for being a mess.Too embarassing. Hence the throwaway.

I'm feeling so confused. After a long depressive episode, I finally attempted suicide. It was quite unlike me though; too spontaneous and unplanned. I overdosed on a large number of antidepressants and painkillers. The following hours were awful, to be honest. I ended up throwing (I'm hoping all) them up. I came back to my room and all I remember is locking my door, after which I apparently passed out on the floor. I woke up to the sound of my father kicking my room's door. Took me a while to understand what was going on, I managed to drag myself to open the door. He started yelling at me asking why the door was closed. I was obviously in no condition to answer, but he didn't seem to care much. The longer I couldn't answer and kept weeping the louder he got. At some point he hit me and I crawled back to bed. He continued his speech about how I, much like my room, was a mess, and a weakling, and a failure.

Now that he's bored and gone, I'm left even more fucked than before. Ashamed. Tired. Not sure if that's because I failed - yet again - or because he is right.
