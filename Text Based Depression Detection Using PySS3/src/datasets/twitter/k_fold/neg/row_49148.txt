I am being forced to have sex, I don't want to do it, why does this happen to me?I'm a smart, good looking, guy and I'm in need of making ends meet. I'm straight and this guy knows I need money and food and he's gay. Now I've been engaged, lived with many women and I'm just not getting hard for this dude. Even though I need the help, I can't get hard for a guy, only for women that I love. This whole thing makes me feel trapped. I lost my mom, dad, fiancee, friends all during covid.  I never thought in my life I would have to whore myself out to feed myself, but, I'll have to or I will kill myself. What should I do? I don't have a problem with my dick, and I won't let him convince me that, I am not gay, but feel like I have to fuck him to survive. I wish I was gay, I'd be ok. What the fuck I feel so trapped plus I have bipolar and IDK, I just need a handgun and kill myself.
