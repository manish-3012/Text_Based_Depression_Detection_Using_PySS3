Does anyone bring themselves down every chance they get?What i mean is  for ex:
An attractive man is looking at me i will feel kinda nice at the moment then quickly "fuck that hes prob never seen such am atrocious creature before"

Or when im giving advice, i feel happy bc im helpingsome one but then.. "Who the hell would listen to a loser like me.."

Then i find myself edging closer to "ending it". :/ anyone else??
