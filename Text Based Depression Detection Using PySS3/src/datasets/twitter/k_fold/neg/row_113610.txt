i donâ€™t know what to do anymoreive had a shitty relationship with my family from the jump but I never expected it to get as bad as it is now. i barely speak to my family even though we live in the same house, and my drug/alcohol usage drives them away from me even more so. ive always felt as if I was an outsider or a black sheep within the family and my various untreated mental illnesses exacerbate the thoughts of suicide and my depressive episodes. 

i wanna seek therapy, I really do wanna give it an honest try this time around as opposed to the multiple times Iâ€™ve went since I was a kid and never spoke what was on my mind out of fear/not taking it serious. i just still feel so afraid for some reason. 

its become obvious to me that the trauma inflicted on me by my mother and the abs ends of my father has affected the way i deal with the world and I feel as if I wonâ€™t make it through my incoming 20s, my teen years were already so difficult. i donâ€™t know where to go
