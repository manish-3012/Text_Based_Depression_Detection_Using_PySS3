How common is it to have constant suicidal ideation for years?I'm not sure when the switch flipped but I can't remember the last time i woke up or fell asleep (and everything in between) without ideation. Suicide has been on my mind since i was a child but i know thats not super uncommon. As always I'm just kind of looking to relate to someone.
