Wounds in my heart are too deep and it's not getting betterIt was said that time heal things. But it looks like it doesn't for me. My dad has been mentally ill for 2 years and year ago he almost stabbed to death my mother, sister and me. He has hit multiple veins in the neck but luckily no arteries. Due to that I suffer PTSD.

My mother health has been terribly crippled and altough my sister is physically ok, she still wakes up in cold sveats every night. 

I myself besides PTSD suffer with bad genetics and due to that I battle multiple health problems everyday. Recently I also started to have back my transgender thoughts and if I would decide to transition in a future it would mean I would certainly lose my fiance ( we talked about this) .

I also have a mortgage and my business is tanking so even though I'm going extra to regular job I won't have money to pay. Basically now within a year me, sister and mother we all will be homeless. Only thing that has been stopping me so far from doing anything drastic has been the fact that I couldn't stand if my loved ones would be so terribly broken, but I'm not sure if I can hold any longer. This has been brewing inside me for some time and I'm ready to go. 

Only thing I care about is that it would be painless so I had to find the method that suits me the most. I actually like exit bag method. You just get some some bag with tight closing, helium bomb and then you slowly drift to sleep. The good thing about this is that I have insurance therefore my death may pay for our debts and mother and sister will have a place to live. 

I'm very sorry if I ruined day to some of you, because giving joy and being kind to other people was a thing that was making me happy the most. Sorry.
