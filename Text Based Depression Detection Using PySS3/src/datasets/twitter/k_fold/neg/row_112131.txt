Hurting myselfI hate myself and I think about suicide many times but I don't have the courage to do it, instead I just cut myself because it makes me feel much better, like I'm giving back to me what I deserve, and I deserve pain.
I have a gf and many may think it's something awesome and at first it was, I love her, I really do, but at first it was love, now it's obsession, I NEED her at all times. And as it is a long distance relationship (yhep, I made the mistake of getting into one of these) I feel like shit most of the time.
She has problems of her own and I think she doesn't love me anymore, she says she does but she never shows it, she always prefers to do something else rather than talking to me. I think she is only with me because being alone feels lonely. I get mad at her. Sometimes I tell her what I feel but when I open up, when I show my feelings I can hear a little voice in my head that says "she actually believed that bulshit" "she actually thinks you have emotions". If it wasn't for because I cry myself to sleep most nights I would think I have no emotions.
