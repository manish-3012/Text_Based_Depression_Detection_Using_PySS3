The Boiling Point.For the longest time I would never consider suicide.  Oh, for sure I wanted to die (or more directly, to not exist).  But I would shake it off every time the ugly thought popped in my head.  Well, I'm worried I've just about reached my boiling point.  Yesterday was the first time I started thinking of ways I might do it, telling myself it was just hypothetical of course.  But, I can see where this path is leading and it scares me.  

I'm trying to think of my alternate plan.  I'm considering packing a bag with some select clothes and cash.  So that when I do get to the point where I'm gonna attempt suicide, I'll just get in my car and run away to a different city.  It's not a great plan but it will work temporarily and be better than killing myself.

**EDIT: One thing that does help me in the mean time is my [anonymous blog](http://nobletruth5.wordpress.com/) where i get to vent all my frustrations.**
