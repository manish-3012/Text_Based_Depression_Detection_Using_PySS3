OF, stabbing, etcI just started taking my lithium. I stopped taking so I was saving it. I finally got Medicaid approved so I am slightly CONSIDERING meeting with a new doc soon. 

That's beside the point. Since I started taking it agaon, I've felt like utter shit. I was pretty okay before I started taking it again.

I just want this fucking sucky shit to stop. It will fucking stop, some say, people love you, they say... Well fuck that.

Yeah. I thought that maybe I can wait to kill myself, but I haven't cut it over a year but I remember how awesome it feels. Maybe cutting is a great option for now.

I don't even know why I'm typing this or why I'm submitting this. Nobody cares. Even strangers on the internet. 

Fuck the world.
