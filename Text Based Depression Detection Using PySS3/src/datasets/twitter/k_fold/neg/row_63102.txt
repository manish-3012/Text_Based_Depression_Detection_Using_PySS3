Just a matter of timeI started planning my suicide in a roundabout way at first a few weeks ago, just writing my suicide note like I did with my last attempt two years ago. Over the past few weeks it's escalated and now I can't go a full minute without imagining some increasingly awful way to kill myself (think: cutting my throat, electrocuting myself, jumping off a bridge and drowning in the river). My mind is full of all these awful images and I can't make them stop. I've been huffing cleaning chemicals to try to imagine what they might taste like going down my throat, testing my blades against my skin and fantasizing about applying the perfect amount of pressure to make that last fatal cut....

Everything is too loud, too fast, too much, and too often. I can't deal with it anymore; I just want to make it all stop. I'm a failure at everything I've ever tried to do and just when I think things are going good my life starts falling apart all over again; I'll always just be a lazy, selfish, manipulative, self-destructive cutter with a drinking problem and a dead-end job and a broken family. I do have a few people that might miss me if I were gone but I'm tired of living with this pain just for their benefit. I'm sure they could go on without me, in fact they'd probably be better off.

Thanks to anyone who read this. I guess my point is if I don't do it tonight I'll probably do it one of these nights. Just tired of being alone with this. Again, thanks.
