My entire life has turned to shitAfter ten years of hard work, sacrifice, blood, sweat, and tears, I've realized the last major goal that I wanted to achieve in my life and it's work related. I had plans, followed my course of action, and here I am.. but along the way, everything turned upside down. My partner of over 9 years left me, my best friend (happens to be a family member) took advantage of me and skipped town, I'm alone and the nature of my job is brutal.. as in, I wake up at 2:30 in the morning for work and often don't get home until 9 or 10 at night only to do it all over again every day, 7 days a week, for 3 months at a time. I love the job itself, but the people I'm working with are horrible and have tried to sabatoge me in various ways (haze the new kid). I have nothing left and noone to help me fix things. I'm alone and I want the pain to stop.
