ConfusedI've been concerned with how I've been feeling for years but I've never discussed my feelings with anyone because I'm scared. Just writing this post is making me anxious and uncomfortable but I think it's a good first step to help deal with what's going on.

This past week I've been feeling really suicidal. I'm actually surprised that I haven't done anything yet. My thoughts are beginning to scare me and I'm scared that I'm just going to give up trying. I've felt this way before but I've managed to work through it but this time feels different somehow. I don't really know how to seek help for what's going on and I feel like things are not going to improve any time soon. There's only so many times one can say things will improve and actually believe that it's going to happen.

I've been tempted to go to the emergency room but I'm scared. Just thinking about it I feel my anxiety levels rise and I can feel my heart pounding in my chest. I also have so many things coming up and so many things to do that I can't imagine what would happen if I would have to stay in the hospital for any length of time. I  also don't know if I can actually muster the courage to tell someone that I'm not fine and I need help. 

I don't want to kill myself but I do and it's beginning to feel like more and more of a good idea every day. I'm feeling awful and so confused that I'm not sure what to do anymore. I'm a 21 year old female and I live in Canada. I don't have anyone to talk to about this in real life so any advice would be extremely appreciated. I'm sure many people have gone through similar things and I would love if you could post your experiences so i have an idea of what I should do and what to expect if I go get help.

Thank you!
