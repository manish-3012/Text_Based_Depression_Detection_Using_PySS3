I'm an alcoholic in love with two different women, and I just dropped the last of my food on the floorI've been doing shitty lately and the shittiest straw just broke the shitty camel's back. I was cooking the last food in my house (some eggs, some beef fajita strips, some cheese, a tortilla) and after making my culinary masterpiece of poverty, it all fell on the floor. Literally all I have left in my fridge is some tortillas, some Tapatio, a bunch of Coors Lite, and some honey. All I have in my cabinets is a single pack of Ramen and some maple syrup. I also have $30 to last me until the 17th of the month. I haven't eaten a real meal in 2 days and I'm waiting till I go back to work tomorrow at a daycare to eat some of the food that the kids don't eat.

On top of that, I am in some amazing emotionally lows right now. I am in love with two separate women, both of which are mad at me. I can't fathom life without either woman. One lives here in Midwest America, one lives in Toronto, Canada. I love both women equally. But both are mad at me because I am a raging alcoholic with no end in sight and neither wants me to drink.

I kinda just want to end it all tonight. I've done really good about abstaining from self harm. Been clean for 9 months. But I sorta just want to end it all tonight. It's the stupidest thing. I have siblings that love me and two different women are in love with me. I should have no reason to end my life. But on the other hand, all my friends have left me, I'll never graduate college, I have to give up my dream career cause I'm too stupid, and I'm basically guaranteed to lose my mind before I achieve anything so whats the fucking point. I might as well just slice myself open now and everybody would be a whole lot easier off.

This was an x-post but I just wanted to add some more thoughts.  I have always wanted to die.  I don't feel like I'm worth living at all.  I can't seem to make money at all and support my brothers.  I have $20k of school debt from a degree I didn't even complete.  I want to but I've burnt too many bridges and I'm too stupid to complete college.  I have had 3 jobs in a row that haven't paid me for some reason or another.  I'm a transman in the Midwest of the USA so people really don't like my kind around here.  I don't have auto or health insurance.  I have $2k worth of health bills from getting the stomach flu in February (which doesn't sound like much but I didn't even break $9k last year in income).  I don't even know how to financially make it.  I haven't eaten a real meal in ages.  My brothers are making it so I'm glad.  Thats all I want.
