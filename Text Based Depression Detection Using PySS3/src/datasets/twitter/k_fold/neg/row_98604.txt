I think it's time.I lost my job mid-March.  I can't find work, and spent my last dime on rent today. My benefits are gone, as is my stimulus.  I am manic right now in my bipolar, and can not sleep for days at a time. On top of all that, my brother is dying, and I think my son behaves better without me. 

If I can't rest soon, I am taking the pills and going away. 

I don't know what else to say.
