Fed up nowSo these past couple of weeks sucide keeps creeping up and now Iâ€™ve gotten to the stage of writing the suicide notes off in my head (most of it saying sorry to my family) but I just want an instant death with no pain. Iâ€™m in college now but getting bored of what I have chosen to do as it doesnâ€™t interest me anymore. Just got back from a holiday and liked a girl there but pretty sure she just thinks Iâ€™m a creep Iâ€™m 18 years old with no social life and never had a girlfriend feeling pretty hopeless and getting thoughts on how to kill myself thought I would tell my problems instead of keeping them to myself
