Idk if this is the right placeSo please remove this if this is not ok mods.  Me and a friend started a subreddit called r/nocut.  The purpose being similar to r/nofap, where people can share updates and support others except instead of fapping its cutting.  I assume that alot of you people here struggle with cutting, or used to cut.  I am currently dealing with suidcidal friends, including one who has carved up his chest.  I feel like it would be a good place for support and for you to get your feelings out.
