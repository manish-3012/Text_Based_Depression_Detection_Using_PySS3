LeavingI was just told that I want to feel this ways that Iâ€™ve been this way for years. To just get a job and stop acting like Iâ€™m the only depressed person. Stop bringing up dead people from so long ago stop talking about how everything is terrible. To stop and finish school and just get a job. Iâ€™ve applied for 200 jobs. I do everything I can. 

I canâ€™t take this anymore. I am leaving but I donâ€™t know to where because thereâ€™s a fucking pandemic. 

I donâ€™t want to live. This sucks.
