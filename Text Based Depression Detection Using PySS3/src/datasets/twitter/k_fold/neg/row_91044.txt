I'm drunk. my ex girlfriend, the only person i've ever loved other than myself, just got engaged and my brother is dying........the only other person i'm close to and I ran away to another country to escape everything.  I'm fucked up and i'm alone in a foreign country.  Give me some wisdom reddit.  Every night I hope i'm gone. I really do.  I won't respond to you, i'm sorry.
