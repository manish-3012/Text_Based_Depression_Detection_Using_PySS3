How this this sub workI'm not like sad or anything today things actually went pretty well, I woke up well took care of myself properly, ate well, went to class and I even did something I had never done before and surprisingly enough got a good response to it that made me feel good so I'm definitely not in the the usual mood that these posts seem to all have going but like 3 or 4h ago I definitely came to a realization that I'm literally just a 3rd or 4th option to everyone in my life like really there's no one who genuinely is interested in me, if there's someone else available I might as well not exist. The only time someone will ever actually reach out or actually give a shit about me even if it's only in texting is if I'm the last option available or if I got something they need. People will talk so much and say so much and write and whatever else but really it's the small stuff and the details and their actions and indifference to you that gives it it away at the end, that's how you really realize that you don't matter to anyone at all, not really. Doesn't matter how much they say otherwise, it's really just people being polite and because they want something from you so they keep you around and pretend just well enough, until the moment I get these little realizations and it's all so obvious and the choice really is so clear again like it's not an whole depressive episode or something it's just a clear realization of things, I'm about to actually do it properly this time and I'm like really fucking excited for it not like happy excited or anything but I'm not like sad I'm like really pumped for it this time it feels like a rational decision there's no point in writing letters or putting affairs in order or some shit it won't matter and it's only gonna drag this on and loose the edge I feel so ready for it now it's so clear I just needed to like write it out you know make sure I wasn't completly crazy but I'm not this make sense all of it does
