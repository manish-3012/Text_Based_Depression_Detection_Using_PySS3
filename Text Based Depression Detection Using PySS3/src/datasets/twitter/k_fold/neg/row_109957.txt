Began cutting myself a few days ago and feel really accomplished whenever I do itSorry if this is the wrong sub since Iâ€™m currently not having any suicidal thoughts, but here it goes. Iâ€™ve had suicidal attempts in the past (2, both from hanging), and Iâ€™ve been going to a therapist for about a month now. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s helping, but I just know that the anti-depressants are making me feel emotionless at times. Iâ€™m still experiencing depression constantly and the thought of suicide is always on my mind. For the past few weeks, Iâ€™ve just been imagining my suicide attempt finally working, but Iâ€™m not actually planning on doing anything. Meaning, if I can kill myself right here, right now, without thinking of consequences afterwards, I would do it. 

The past few days, I started cutting myself on my wrist. I use a small box cutter and slit my wrist just enough to see a red scar. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m crazy, but I feel a sense of accomplishment and rush whenever I do it. I have made 2 distinct cuts so far, but have concealed them with my watch band. I feel tempted to cut myself all the time now, I just feel like I need it. I wish I can keep cutting and not care if other people will see. 

Just wanted to get this off my chest. At least the cutting is postponing the suicidal thoughts for now.

TL;DR Started cutting myself and feel good about it. Suicidal thoughts are gone whenever I do it.
