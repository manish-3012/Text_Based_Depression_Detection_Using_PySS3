I don't want any of thisI didn't ask to be alive, to have major depression and be forced to pay to exist on this shit planet. I have everything except family, which I don't care abut - good job, friends, strong relationship, etc. but every time I think about my future it's too scary, it's too rough, it's too much and I don't want ANY of it. I have this stupid idea that I HAVE to be a music teacher in order to respect myself, aka the hardest thing a human could ever do with the lowest pay proportional to the effort put in. Nothing I do is enough, I fuck up everything, I hate myself. I'm terrible at everything and I will never succeed. Music teachers have to be... amazing people. And I will never be amazing. I hate myself, I hate being alive.
