These chronic migraines are killing me. Itâ€™s been since 2012, and Iâ€™ve only had a break for 3 straight weeks after a $2500 week-long ketamine IV. Itâ€™s too much. The 20th is the anniversary of my best friendâ€™s suicide. And my Dadâ€™s attempted suicide. I feel itâ€™s meant to be.Seriously, each night there comes a time that I ponder death.  Itâ€™s only my loved ones holding me back - and yet I canâ€™t help but wonder if they are wrong, and Iâ€™d be freeing them and this could be he most selfless thing to do.  That Iâ€™m selfish for sticking around for lifeâ€™s few pleasures when my family would do so much better without me, lying in bed.  Doing nothing because of the pain.

I truly doubt whether theyâ€™d miss me.  My doctor just now wouldnâ€™t give me enough painkillers and I made a fool of myself, blubbering in my office.  He asked if Iâ€™ve tried anti-depressants.  Of course I have!! I was diagnosed with borderline, and drugs rarely work on us.  Iâ€™m a trauma child, and though I kicked borderline (minor miracle), itâ€™s been hell.  My best friend died from Borderline.  She hung her self when she got her shoelaces back.

Itâ€™s been enough.  Life is pain, emotionally and physically.  Now I just need a fool-proof plan.  Anyone know?  Itâ€™s really the best thing.  I have this gratitude app and Iâ€™m grateful... just not grateful enough, I guess.  Or grateful enough to help my family from this burden.
