Weird questionWould a .177 and 1000fps (333 m/s air rifle kill me if I shoot it at my temple? I've seen some articles but they were talking about a .22. Also would I need to use the heaviest bullet (Rounded tip) or the lightest (hollow tip/would go faster?) not an expert on weapons. I want to know if this is gonna be succesful or not. I do NOT want to become a vegetable and make my  life worse than it already is
