My death will mean nothingAs much as Iâ€™d hope that my death will mean anything or lead to change, Iâ€™m not that optimistic. Iâ€™ll just be another statistic, useful only to every armchair activist that will only care until they get bored and find another pet cause. 

Iâ€™ll be just another story to be shared on Facebook a handful of times and then forgotten about. I know that by the next day, everyone will have forgotten. My life doesnâ€™t matter, and neither will my death.
