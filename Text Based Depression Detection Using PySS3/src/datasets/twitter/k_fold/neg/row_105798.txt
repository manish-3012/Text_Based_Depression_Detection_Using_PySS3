There is no help available for me. What do I do?I tried to kill myself for the second time last night: I took a random assortment of about 50 pills and then went to sleep. All it did was make the left side of my head throb in a way that was actually quite pleasurable. This is my second suicide attempt - the first was in 2003 and I was involuntarily committed to a mental health "hospital" for it. (It was actually more of a prison.)

I've asked for help SOOOOOOOO many times, and all I've ever got was "seek help" or "seek therapy." 

I've tried that. Hundreds of times. I have no job, so I can't afford medications. I can't afford $100 a session therapists who are not going to do anything but tell me to "just change your thinking."

I'm done with this. I'm 32 years old and I've done NOTHING with my "life." An average day for me involves harming myself and masturbating out of boredom. One of my favorite things to do is take a ruler and just beat the back of my legs until they look like ground beef.

I no longer have any interests. Nothing makes me happy. I don't have a drive any more. It's just too late. I'm 32 freakin' years old - it's waaaaaay too late for me to learn. I've always thought I was autistic since I totally don't get social cues but I was unlucky enough to go through school at a time when autism was totally ignored. If I were a kid in school today, I'd very likely be placed in special education. I wasn't afforded that luxury though, and I'm paying for it now. I'm totally socially clueless and no one is willing to help.

I'm invisible. Nothing I do matters, and nothing I ever will do will ever matter. All I want is to be a productive human being and MATTER to other people. I could die right now and nothing would change. Certain members of my family might be sad for a short time, but they'd go back to their normal lives.

I'm at the point where I need constant reassurance, but I'm not getting any. I'm tired of being ignored. "They" always ask "why won't men seek help with their depression?" I know why: because no one cares! If doctors and the "mental health community" are going to ignore me, then why should I bother? I don't WANT to live any more, just let me die already!
