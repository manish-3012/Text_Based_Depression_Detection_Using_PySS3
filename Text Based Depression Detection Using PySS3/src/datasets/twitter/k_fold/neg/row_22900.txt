I think my mum knows I'm suicidal againI'm a 17y.o male and my first suicide attempt was when I was 9, latest was a little over 7 months ago. My mum came over today to check on me and basically she asked why I haven't been going to school (we don't live together but she still gets emails from them whenever I'm absent) and asked if I was suicidal again, I don't know why I said no but as soon as I did she started crying. Maybe she could tell I was lying, but she didn't ask again, just cried. I told her I was doing okay but I'm not, I just wish I was gone
