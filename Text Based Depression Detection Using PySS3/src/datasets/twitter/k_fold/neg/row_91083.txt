My boyfriend asked me not to tell his friends because they would try to stop him. I feel so badSo earlier today my(16m) boyfriend(17m) told me to break up with him because his mental health was getting worse fast and there was nothing he could do about it he said he loved me but the emotions were deteriorating. He pretty much said he was going to kill himself. We don't live close enough for me to call the police or anything and I don't know where he lives outside of his county so I couldn't do anything. There was no convincing him or anything and I know he has been suffering and even though it hurts so much I couldn't stand to be holding him back from being happy. His last request from me was to keep going and to be happy for both of us and to not tell him friends because he didn't want them to try to stop him. I feel so bad not telling them but I don't want to betray him.
