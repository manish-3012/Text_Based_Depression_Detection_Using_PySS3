Not sure if this is the place to ask this.I have tried suicide in the past a few times, obviously they didn't work, but I was close. I now only try to entertain myself until the day I die and I find it to be unfair that I'm not allowed to decide when I get to die. I'm on anti-depressants which have brought me out of a 5 year depression, but the only thing that keeps me going seems to be weed, but I want to know if there is a reason for life or a reason for me to care anymore.
