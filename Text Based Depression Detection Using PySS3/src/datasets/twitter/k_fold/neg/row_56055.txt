I'm scared I'm going to get schizophreniaMy mother has schizophrenia, she thought that someone was stalking her and we had to constantly move to "get away from him", she also thought that he was trying to preform witchcraft on us.    She ended up going to a mental hospital and got better after quite a long period of medication

My OCD then began to flair, and it began to feel like I was going insane.   I have heard there is a link of OCD and schizophrenia which scares me.    Ive gotten mostly better but I'm afraid it will pop up again

Anyways, the main thing I'm worried about is the fact that there is a 10% transfer rate from the parent to the child with schizophrenia.      I always wanted to start a family (I'm just 16) but that's going to be impossible now, because I cannot in good conscious subject a family to that 10% chance (it's a wonder my Dad didn't run).   I can never get into any sort of relationship because of this.      

 I see no option other than killing myself in the future once my parents are gone.    My eyes have deteriorated so I can't look at screens much either, or else they hurt, so I can't drown myself in video games or anything like that.



**TL:DR**

* Mom has schizophrenia, I may get it to

* I want to start a family in the future, but the 10% transfer rate of schizophrenia means I can never, in good conscience, get into any sort of relationship.     

* I have OCD and am paranoid it will also pop up again full force

* My eyes hurt when looking at any sort of screen for long

Give me a reason not to end it
