I want to end my life, but I love my mom too much and don't want to hurt herI don't know what to add.

I love my mom, she sacrificed so much to provide me with a good life. She loves me and wants the best for me.

I  hate being stuck in this life. I tried everything but nothing seems to work and things keep getting worse.

One day, I'll just kill myself. Maybe one day, I'll have the courage to be selfish.
