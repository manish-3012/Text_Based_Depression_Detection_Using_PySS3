Don't care...I tried going for the new job out of town that would take me away from it all. But this trip introduces itself a whole new set of obstacles in addition to the ones already in my life. I'm tired. I'm exhausted. I don't have anymore energy. I feel like a zombie. Bored of it all. I wanted to end my life peacefully with CO in the room I grew up in. But, at this point, being away from home and not having a safe place to do CO, I would be down to jumping... Anything to get rid of it all. I'm so tired and I don't have anyone who loves me unconditionally to tell me it's all going too be okay and that they will always be there for me no matter what. No one...
