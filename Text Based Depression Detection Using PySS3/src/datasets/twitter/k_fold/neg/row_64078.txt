I'm never going to be good enough. I realised just how depressed I am today when I was looking up how to tie a noose.

How did I get this depressed? My girlfriend of two and a half years is going to university soon and before she goes I'm fairly certain that she will end our relationship.

I'm 18 and doing nothing with my life, I didn't get good enough GCSES to get into sixth form, this is mainly due to my mother trying to commit suicide two days before the exams started, I got between E-C.
This meant that I couldn't do A levels and I ended up going to college and doing music (yeah, I know it's a drop out subject) I finished in June this year and since then I've had to deal with my father attempting to commit suicide. lost all my friends and failed to get any job/apprenticeship 

I've been sat around this week seeing all my old friends make statuses on facebook about how they've gotten offers from various universities. It hit me when I realised I'll never be able to go to university, I won't be able to get the grades and even if I did I wouldn't be able to afford to pay for it.

I've tried turning my life around but I can't even do that, which is why I was researching how to tie a noose. 

I'm going to become an organ donor before I do it because my organs may as well go to a good use and keep somebody alive who will use them and do something with their life. 

Does anybody have some advice on how to turn their life around? I may as well try once more.
