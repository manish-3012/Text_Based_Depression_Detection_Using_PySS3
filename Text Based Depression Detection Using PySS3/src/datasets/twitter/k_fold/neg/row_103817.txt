No one gives a shit!I'm so fucking tired of trying. No one even cares! No one gives a shit about me and no one wants me around. Everyone would be so much better off if I was gone. Then I wouldn't be a burden on anyone. Then I wouldn't cause anymore pain. They'll move on and be able to live without me getting in the way. I'm just a problem. I'm not good enough! I'm a fucking piece of shit and I only cause pain!

I tried reaching out here before, but the one community that's supposed to support suicidal people doesn't even give a shit if I'm dead. No one cares! I'm really and truly alone.

I don't think I'll be waking up tomorrow.
