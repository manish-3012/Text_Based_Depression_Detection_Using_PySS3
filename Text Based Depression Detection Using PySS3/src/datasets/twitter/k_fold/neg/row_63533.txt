I'm feel lost.I feel lost. I don't have a future. Im working somewhere I don't like. I don't want to do anything at all. I have no motivation to strive for greater things. The main reason I haven't killed myself is because of my family, they would be devistated. I don't care about myself. I know that's wrong but it doesn't feel wrong. I don't know what to do.
