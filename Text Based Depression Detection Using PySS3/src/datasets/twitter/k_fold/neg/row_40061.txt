I hate myselfI hate almost everything about me. I am tall, fat and stupid. People make a fool of me because of that. And I know I deserve it. Even if I wish -internally- I was treated like a human being.
 I know I'm big. But I still do have feelings.
I have a low IQ, Im not good at languages, nor speaking, nor maths. nothing. 
I act like shit, I'm self-centered and people usually get mad at me.
It's possible that I also have something like borderline personality disorder, it just seemed a lot like me, but I can't self-diagnose,nor seek help. 
After all, this planet would be better off without me. I just come here to apologize for my existence.
