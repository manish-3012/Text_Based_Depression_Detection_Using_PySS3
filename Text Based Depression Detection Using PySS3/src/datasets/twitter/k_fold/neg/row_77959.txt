I hate this...I'm loosing it. I can't even pick up the guitar, my outlet. I have so many that care for me, so I'd feel so selfish. I'm curling into a ball, I'm loosing it. I'm gonna loose my job on this path, then I'll lose my home, then I'll be homeless and she will never come back, I'll loose all the memory's, I'm loosing it.
