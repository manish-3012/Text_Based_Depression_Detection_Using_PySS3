HelpI'm 18, relatively intelligent, with a good number of acquaintances yet only a couple of close friends. I fashioned a makeshift noose, if you could even call it that, using a belt and a tie, and I feel utterly helpless and want to die. I tried phoning certain services but I freeze up and can't say the words and it's horrible. In my life I've gone through a lot of trauma which I don't wish to discuss, but over the last 4-5 years, especially in the last 1-2 years I've been battling depression and anxiety. It's ok when I'm out and about, but when I'm alone it really kicks in, (is this a normal way to feel?) and more recently I've been very alone, just sitting around in the house and feel like I'm no use to anyone, and I know I could just ask someone but if I do and they say no it just gets worse, and then my confidence goes and I just slide deeper and deeper and it's gotten to a point where I can't see any way out anymore. I've spoken to a couple of my more trusted and closest friends about it but nothing changed, and I just feel like there's nothing more I can do, so please help me

(Sorry if that's angsty teen 101)
