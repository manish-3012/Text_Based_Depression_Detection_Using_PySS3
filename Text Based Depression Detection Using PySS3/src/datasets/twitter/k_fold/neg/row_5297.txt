I don't want to die, I just don't want to work 40 hoursI plan to end my life soon, just because I can't seem to find a job that I'm willing to do for the majority of my life. I wouldn't mind working at most places 4 or even 6 hours a day, but 8 hours just seems like more than I can handle. I think that if i could find a job that payed enough for just 6 hours a day, I might be able to keep going, but these don't seem to exist.
