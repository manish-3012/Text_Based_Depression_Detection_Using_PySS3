Not an interesting titleI can't think of anyone I like

There is no one interested in making music with me.  

I am alone.  I have 0 social media. 

My wife does not express any, any emotion for me. 

Empathy has been sucked from the world today. 11/6. 

I am alone.  I have no way to express myself outside of myself. 





This is me yelling into the void. Wondering if 4-6 minutes is tantamount to liver disease from alcoholism or maybe just living another 40 years inside my head. I despise being alive. I hate me.
