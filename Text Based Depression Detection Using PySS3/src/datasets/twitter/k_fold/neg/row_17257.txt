I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.The things youâ€™re about to read are things that have been said countless times before. Iâ€™m not special, but I am in pain.

Iâ€™ve been through a lot of violent shit in my family life. I have an alcoholic, mentally ill father and a strained relationship with my mother. This isnâ€™t about that.

Iâ€™ve been having a lot of issues, partially because of what Iâ€™ve been through, and Iâ€™ve just been so sad. Helplessly sad. I have the best friends a person could ask for, but I feel as though they donâ€™t really care and no one does. I know itâ€™s me convincing myself thatâ€™s the case, but it doesnâ€™t make it feel any less real. I struggled with self harm in the past and still do, though I am pulling myself out of it. Iâ€™ve been dealing with so much I feel like Iâ€™m being crushed, and I still keep my head up, make good grades, and care for everyone around me. I know Iâ€™m strong. Stronger than a lot of people. But Iâ€™m not invincible. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore. I want a break. Iâ€™m in an almost unbearable amount of emotional pain constantly.

I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to live anymore either.
