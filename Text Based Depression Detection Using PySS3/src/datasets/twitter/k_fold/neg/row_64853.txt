I feel like offing myself most of the timeFirst off I don't know why I'm making this post I don't what I'm looking for it's probably validation or comfort or something like that

I don't have a lot of friends most of my friends are online and I feel kindly most of the time I only look forward to going to bed everyday that's the thing I look forward to everyday because I don't have to stay awake and think about my future and my life right now I wanted to be a doctor but I gave up this year because I don't ever think I will i try to but I can't i study for about 12 hours a day ( 6 school and 8 outside of it) and 8 hours of sleep which leaves me with 2 hours a day to do whatever I want I feel stressed most of the time I don't want to kill myself because I belive in afterlife and I'm afraid that if I do I won't get in heaven but I do wish I never existed it would've been so much easier

In addition to always feeling alone I spent the last 9 moths with my family at home I don't have the best family so it's been pretty sucky school also sucks even more because it's online and I don't really understand what's going on so yeah I'll really kiss my dreams of being a doctor goodbye I just hope that I die soon or something happens on my life to make it less sucky I definitely won't do it myself though

Besdies school and my family everything is okay I guess even though I don't have many friends at real life I do have a lot online so not everything is bad

This is basically it
