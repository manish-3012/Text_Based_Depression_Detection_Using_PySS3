I'm losing everyoneHi. I'm not sure what to be saying, Ive been pushing people away and generally just trying to get people out of my life. I don't want to, but it's this thing that I just figure they are going to hate me sooner or later, might as well speed it up. I've pretty much dismembered my 2year relationship within a weekend. I know I'm going to go home to somewhere empty. I feel no sense of self, I keep getting scared I'll have a motivated day and just fall off a building, just the thought of the falling sensation makes me feel lighter, and I've been concerned with it for a while. I'm scared.
