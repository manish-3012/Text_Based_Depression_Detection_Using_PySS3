I don't even want to die, but I just feel like I have no other options.My parents won't get me the treatment I need for ADHD. As a result, my grades are always suffering and as a result of that they're always mad at me. I'm just tired of having to put up with the screaming and yelling all the time. I'm not even allowed to cry because I "have no reason to be upset". My psychologist hasn't done anything to help. I'm at a loss. The stress has started to take tolls on my body and I'm having breathing issues and headaches/stomachaches constantly. I can't go to my parents about it because they'll just get mad at me. I'm never happy anymore and I know that if this is my attitude about school then I'll never be able to do anything in a workplace I'll be happy with. I don't want to have to live the rest of my life being unhappy.
