A friend ended his life and now it's all I can think about.I struggle daily with the thought of putting a pistol in my mouth and aiming upwards. I am very sad that my friend did this but in a way I almost envy him because he had the guts to do it. He seemed very happy the last time I talked to him but now I wonder if that happiness was because he had finally made the decision to do it.

I've heard people say that suicide is the "easy way out" but that is not true. It takes a strong person to complete the act. If it was so easy I'd have done it years ago. The thought of doing it occurs to me every damn day. The one thing that stops me is that I don't want my family to suffer so basically I'm only living for other people.

I'm going to try and find a good therapist to talk to, I know these thoughts aren't normal.

Thanks for listening.
