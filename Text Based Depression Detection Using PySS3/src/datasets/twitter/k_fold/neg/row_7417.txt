I feel unwantedSo I'll keep it short. I feel unwanted by people, no matter what they tell me. I feel I'm not good enough for anyone. Also, I have multiple other problems like dealing with my self-hatred and fear of death. My parents seem to hate me, my brother doesn't give a fuck. I just feel like suicide would be a sweet release from all the pain. This is not a goodbye yet, it is a call for help. I need reasons to keep going or I might have to prepare for my last day on earth.
