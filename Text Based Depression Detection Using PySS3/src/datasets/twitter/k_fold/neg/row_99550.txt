Depressed, paranoid and semi-suicidal.I've been depressed quite a while and honestly? I'm getting tired.
While I haven't exactly been suicidal I really don't feel the "want" of life. For example if something would happen (I don't know what, cancer? Getting attacked?), I would not feel the energy to fight it. I'm always passive, don't enjoy company yet I'm always going out with people because if I don't I grow paranoid and think that everyone hates me. I don't talk much and I enjoy to listen and observe things, but I usually don't say what I see since I don't feel the need to express it. Some days I simply don't get out of bed. I just lie there awake until my shitty alarm clock turns itself off, then I drift in and out of sleep until my brothers get home. Every now and then I literally collapse and half sob, half roar in anger I can't describe until my legs fall asleep and I faint. I find myself waking up with my teeth hurting because I grit them in my sleep. I feel underachieving, useless and pathetic because I don't feel I deserve to feel bad. But there are two things that really scare me; How I started actually hurting myself, like holding ice until my hand goes numb, holding my arm over a lighter or cutting myself. I'm scared because this mixed with my sudden outbursts of rage might make me hurt someone. And how I can one day feel "You know, things are actually looking brighter," and then at the slightest setback go back to feeling like shit and feeling sorry for myself again. For example the girl (not to sound cheesy) I think is the only one I've ever "loved" canceled our plans and it ended up with me collapsing again, thinking I've done something wrong or that she straight out hated me. 

So yeah, that's pretty much it. Even though I'm not 100% suicidal I wouldn't really fight for my life, I don't feel like I'd make much difference. And what is there to fight for anyways? To see how the game of thrones series ends? To /maybe/ get together with the girl I like only to have her dump me because she won't be able to take my outbursts and collapses? Tempting, but no. Maybe I'll do it myself, maybe I'll wait for it to happen, but I just don't have the energy or want to live anymore.
