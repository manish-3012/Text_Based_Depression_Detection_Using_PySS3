Telling the voice to stfu, it's still poking, but I think I am winningAfter waking up and thinking that the bottom of the barrel feeling I had yesterday was gone, it suddenly came back like a massive wave smashing into me.

As soon as I realized it, I texted someone I know, even though I don't know them that well, I just texted them said I need to talk to someone tonight. We have plans to do that later.

Now that I am completely resubmerged in my self-hatred that voice is telling me "no, you don't need to talk to anyone, stay in bed. Stay comfy. Why go out? Who would actually care?"

I am fighting the urge to cancel the plans, but I think I am winning. Just gotta hold on until tonight.
