The girl I'm in love is wants distance from meMy (18M) friend (18F) who i am seriously in love with, who was the first person i ever opened up to about my suicidal thoughts etc, who I have called and texted whenever I'm feeling really down or whenever i need someone to talk to, who sadly also has a lot of personal issues to deal with right now, has decided and told me, she needs distance from me. I am so heartbroken and seriously have no idea what to do. I attempted suicide last week, and since then she's started acting this way. I can't believe I'm this toxic. I hate myself so much and just want to die because i don't see the point when one of my 3 friends doesn't want to be with me anymore. I can't risk another failed attempt. I really want to guarantee a successful suicide so I can just be free of all this pain.
