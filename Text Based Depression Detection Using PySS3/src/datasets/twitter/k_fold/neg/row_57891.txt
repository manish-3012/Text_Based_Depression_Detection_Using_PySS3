Janurary 8th was supposed to be the dayI was going to do it that day, yet here I am.

I had it all planned out, spent a few weeks nailing every detail, yet when I woke up, I couldn't do it (no surprise there).

For a while things were looking up, I was coping, happy even, but here I am, sqaure one.

I started planning again.

Hopefully I'll see it through this time.
