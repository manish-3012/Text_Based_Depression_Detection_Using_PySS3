To my boyfriend, at least empathize with meI know I'm overthinking. I know I should be there for my mom who misses my father (who lives in another state) and is getting drunk. I know that I don't have to drink with her. I know that everything I'm feeling now is irrational and that I should be doing homework due tonight. I know that it isn't logical. Thank you for telling me things I already know about myself and my situation. It makes me even more aware of how shitty I am right now.

I don't need suggestions about what I could be doing better. I just need you to at least give me words of comfort, if you're here with me, maybe to hold to hold me, and to say that this feeling will pass. 

You just stating what I should be doing and how I handle things makes me realize how problematic I am and I just want to end it all even more. I love you, but please, no more.
