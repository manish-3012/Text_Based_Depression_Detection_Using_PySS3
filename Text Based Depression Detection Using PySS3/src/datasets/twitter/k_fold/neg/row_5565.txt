I want to admit myselfIâ€™m 17 and I want to admit myself because of how bad Iâ€™m getting. I have a suicide plan, and my mental illness is getting much worse, but I have a dog and Iâ€™m scared to leave her with my family because of how abusive they are. 
Iâ€™m not sure what to do. Iâ€™m currently sobbing. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t want me to admit myself either but I donâ€™t think he understand how bad I am right now....
