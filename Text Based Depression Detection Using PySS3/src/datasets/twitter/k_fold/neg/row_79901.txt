So a thought about killing myselfSo i have posted here multipul times because i really want to kill myself, like really, everyday shit gets worse either way what i was going to say is im 23 now, i graduated highschool at 17 and i was thinking i really wanted to kill myself back then but i didnt i thought things could get better but then today after another interview that went nowhere i thought if i did kill myself 6 years ago there  is nothing that i have experienced that i would regret not getting to experience except maybe a few good video games... lol, so with that being said, 6 years nothing good worth noting and thats just the past 6 years, School was even worse because there was bullying ontop of all the faliure.

just tell me its ok so i can head over to the cliff near my house i just want it over so fucking bad.

i said to my mom, who i still live with at 23... isnt the world sposed to be somewhat even arnt you supposed to get some good with the bad... but no its bad bad bad bad bad
