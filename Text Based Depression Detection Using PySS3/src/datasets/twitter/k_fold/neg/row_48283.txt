I thought about suicide today. For the first time I'm scared I'll really do it.Depressed for years, although things have gotten better recently. But I'm still isolated and helpless. I'm terrified that one day I might do it and all my dreams will become ashes.

I feel I'm pathetic and useless. I don't do any work completely, even if it is doing something I love. I'm afraid of talking to shopkeepers and strangers.

I'm scared and alone.
