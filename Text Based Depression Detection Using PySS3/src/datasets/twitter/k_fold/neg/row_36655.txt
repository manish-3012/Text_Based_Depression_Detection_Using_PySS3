Gonna do it, no reason not toDon't really have a reason to live.

Everyone at work hates me. Works going awful.

No family, parents despise me.

No friends, they all went to college and left me behind.

Yeah so like no one will miss me right? I have aspirations and shit but no one to enjoy them with. I'm not someone that can function by themselves I need friends. I don't have any though. And no place to make them. So yeah been depressed for going on about 8 years now. Tried to kill myself once. Gonna succeed this time lol.

So yeah it's a wrap.

Then again i'll probably just watch netflix until i pass out, wake up for work get home and repeat the same process...
