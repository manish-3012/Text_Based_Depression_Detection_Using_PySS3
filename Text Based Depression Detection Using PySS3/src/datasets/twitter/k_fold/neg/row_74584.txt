advice??hi. one of my friends has been posting for like 6-8 months on her twitter about wanting to die/hurt herself etc., and usually i will message her and try to help her out but yesterday it got pretty bad, i was really worried so i called the police to her house. weâ€™re under 18 so she lives with her mum. her mum did not know she is suicidal but now does,, my friend kept telling me i should have thought about what she wanted etc., kept telling me that the police being called was the last thing sheâ€™d ever want and that i should have talked to her first. this has happened dozens of times throughout the past 2 months especially. i donâ€™t know if i did the rigjt thing or not
