I'm tired of people telling me how much potential I have that I don't use.As a child I was said to be "gifted". I could read and speak two different languages before I hit first grade. 

In my first couple of years I excelled and had the best grades in class without effort. I was always distracted and lazy though. I could never really 'focus' on my work and often rushed it off. I was also active as I participated in cricket and athletics. 

Long story short, I had good friends but was bullied a lot. This started to affect me negatively in fifth grade when the bullying became so bad that I absolutely hated going to school. My grades dropped and I was miserable. Eventually my parents found out about it and I switched schools. I was diagnosed with depression at age 10 and put on anti-depressants. 7 years later I still haven't recovered and I'm back on anti-depressants. The bullying incident lead me to become anti-social and distrustful. I never formed any friendships in High School and my grades are very poor. I hate my current high school so much that I've considered running away. I'm an outsider. I feel like I don't belong here, and my parents are pressuring me to perform but I'm constantly distracted and I can't focus on schoolwork. 

I feel as if everyone is pitying me. I'm a useless teen with no ambition or motivation and I just want to get out of this lonely existence but I'm too much of a coward to end it.

I intentionally skipped the details, it's hard to make people what I feel. I'm full of loathing for myself and jealousy for normal people who don't have to go through this.

Someone with experience, please tell me it will get better because I don't think I can stand this for another second.
