Im gonna do it.Im gonna kill myself. Not today (its mothers day, that isnt fair for my mother) but in two days. Two days left of my pathetic sorrow. I feel almost at peace. Im gonna take all the pills I can. Im gonna leave a note to my family, my friends and my ex. Trying to tell them that its not their fault. It isnt. Its all me, and the void inside me. The void won. The void always wins. 

Do you have any advice on what to do before I die? Im only 21, I dont feel like a will is necessary. I have few possesions and like 150$. Its not worth it.
