Sexual AbuseIt's been 8 years since I was sexually abused. I want to kill myself now because I feel there's no alternative, i'm living day to day based on fear of physical pain and fear of upsetting my family. I feel so low and there's no one to help that understands. This is definitely a cry for help.
