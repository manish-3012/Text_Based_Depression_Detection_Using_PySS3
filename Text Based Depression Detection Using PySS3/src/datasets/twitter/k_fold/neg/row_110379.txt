what do you do when you get strong suicidal impulses?sometimes i'll just be out or at home thinking and i'll get overwhelmed. it'll be the only thing on my mind. i'm usually depressed, but i can hold the urge back. the main reason i don't kill myself is because i feel like everyone would be mad at me.

sometimes i don't care. i almost walked out in the middle of a shift at my job today to go...you know. i scare myself. anyone else? please help
