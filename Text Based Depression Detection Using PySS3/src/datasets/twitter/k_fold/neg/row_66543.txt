Committing suicide just to prove a point to someoneA while few months back, I went inpatient. I have BPD. My doctor there told me that I only felt suicidal because I was just moody. Maybe I should succeed at a suicide just to show him how â€˜moodyâ€™ I am. And it would be a good thing to include him in my suicide note. Just to a point.
