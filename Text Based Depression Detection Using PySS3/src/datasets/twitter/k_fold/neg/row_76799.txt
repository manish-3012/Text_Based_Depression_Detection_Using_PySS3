My â€œfriendsâ€ bring me to suicidal thoughtsI just want to start out by saying Iâ€™m a college student who moved here with a couple friends. I do not work and go to school full time while all my friends work and go to school part time. Since I do not have a job my parents will help financially if need be. Iâ€™ve battled with suicidal thoughts but my friends make them worse.

Ok, it all started when my first semester in college when my friends would joke about me being â€œdaddy &amp; mommyâ€™s money.â€ This didnâ€™t bother me at first and I would joke back with them and weâ€™d all have a good time. But, it got worse they began doing it when around other groups of friends and posting about it on social media making me feel like Iâ€™m worthless. The insult began to get worse ranging from â€œbumâ€ to â€œbroke bitchâ€ and now they use it as a crutch to impress other people. These words and actions run through my head at night and make me think â€œam I really worth living?â€ Or â€œmaybe my family will have more money without me.â€ The only thing that has helped me was my dog who has been by my side for the past 6 years but now he lives with my dad and the thoughts have been coming on strong recently and more frequently. One of the biggest blows was when I was with a girl and my friend and we all decided to go out to the bars for the night. While we were all hanging out they decided to start telling her various things about me and tell her how broke I am and how I wouldnâ€™t be able to get her drink but they could.

All this makes me feel like theyâ€™d be a lot happier without me and life would be better for them. I always get to the point of ending it but get to scared. but here recently itâ€™s beginning to feel like I wonâ€™t back down and actually go through with it.
