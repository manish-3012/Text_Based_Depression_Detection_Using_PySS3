Thereâ€™s just no pointIâ€™m fucking up the wall. There is absolutely no point in continuing to live. Iâ€™m physically and emotionally drained all the time. I have no friends and my family doesnâ€™t even acknowledge my existence. Iâ€™m so fucking alone. The only person I see is my mom and thatâ€™s maybe like once a week. I have no motivation for anything anymore. I donâ€™t wanna do college work and sit in online classes for hours at a time. I barely leave my house. Iâ€™ve lost interest for absolutely everything I was interested in. Iâ€™m not even good at anything. All I do is cry all the time. The only good thing that has happened to me recently was meeting this guy on a zoom class and we started seeing each other. But I canâ€™t even let myself have that because I donâ€™t even think Iâ€™m worthy. Like he has so many friends and such a great life, I donâ€™t understand why heâ€™s attracted to me. I genuinely wish I never met him. Tbh, Iâ€™m ready to just kill myself. Iâ€™ve said that so many times throughout my life, I just need to finally go through with it. Iâ€™m so done.
