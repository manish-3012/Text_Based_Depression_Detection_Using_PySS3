who caresTrue to my name, I am sad. The people around me say I look "better" than I was before. Admittedly, I don't feel "better" anymore. I feel like shit. I feel like everyone I have ever known has already, or will eventually betray me in the worst way possible. I feel as if I exist only for people to compare themselves to, and say 'At least I'm not as bad as him.' The only thing stopping me from ending my pointless and wasteful existence right now, is the fear. The fear of 'Will it hurt?', 'What happens to me after?', and 'What will people think of me if I go through with this?'
