No real reason, just would like to dieI feel a bit bad at writing this, as I have no real reason for suicide. I'm just becoming more and more thrilled by the idea. It would be such amazing release. Absolutely nothing would faze or hurt me anymore, no more remorse, no more sadness, no more longing for the lost glories of the past. Even the absence of the few things that I like wouldn't mean anything to me, as I simply wouldn't *be* anymore, there would be no one to miss these things. Death is surely the greatest gift to man, an instant and permanent way out of the horror of existance.

What's stopping me is the thought of what it would do to my parents and maybe to a precious few friends. I am, however, worried about the day when that just doesn't matter to me anymore. I was driving in the countryside recently and began thinking that if I unbuckled the seatbelt, pushed the throttle down on a straight stretch of road and crashed into a tree at high speed, I'd have a pretty good chance of dying. The beeping of the seatbelt indicator would make a fitting tune to accompany my death. Perhaps they wouldn't be able to figure out it was a suicide, I guess that would make it slightly easier to take for my parents. I'd have to be careful with the speeding though, I wouldn't want to accidentally kill some innocent five-member family or something. Also, damn shame about the tree and the car, I wouldn't own any of them, so that'd be kind of a dick move. Dick move sounds about right for suicide, all the sweetness of the end for you, all the sadness for those left behind.
