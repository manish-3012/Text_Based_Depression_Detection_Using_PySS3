I really want to give upMy life feels meaningless. Iâ€™m not passionate about anything, I donâ€™t even know what makes me happy. I havenâ€™t been happy in such a long time I donâ€™t even know what that feels like. Iâ€™m sick of being such a disappointment. Everyone around me hates me and I hate myself. I genuinely just want to give up. I know itâ€™s not gonna get better, Iâ€™ve been feeling like this for years and all it got was worse. I want to kill myself. I hate it here. I hate how it seems like everyone around me knows what theyâ€™re doing and Iâ€™m just here waiting for something to happen. I hate how all I feel is pain. I hate how all I can think about is wanting to end my life. I just hate myself and I really really  want everything to end already.
