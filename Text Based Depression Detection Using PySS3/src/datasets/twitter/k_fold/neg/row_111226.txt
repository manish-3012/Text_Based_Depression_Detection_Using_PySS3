life is pointless I donâ€™t understand iti donâ€™t really understand the point in life Iâ€™ve been trying to cope and understand consciousness for the past 5 months and my brain just doesnâ€™t understand it. the more I think about it the more disassociated I feel from the world I feel like Iâ€™m living in 3rd person and I feel like a different person everyday and I donâ€™t feel the same anymore I came to the conclusion that death is a really good option to really find out how to end consciousness and this weird burden I have that I canâ€™t explain I do not have any feelings or anything inside
