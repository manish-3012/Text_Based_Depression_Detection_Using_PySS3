Giving up on lifeAs the title says yes I really am just giving up on life because every day for the past at least 6 months Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself at least once a day and itâ€™s driving me fucking insane, for instance about an hour ago my phone charger broke and for me itâ€™s  half 2 in the morning and Iâ€™ve set an alarm so I can get up early so my dad can phone my doctors to see if I could get meds or sumthin cause Iâ€™ve have depression for like the past year and a half 2 years and now that my chargers broken my phones at like 11 percent which panics and upsets me because Iâ€™m thinking oh no I wont be able to go to the doctors tomorrow cause my battery will be dead then Iâ€™ll have to ask my dad to buy me a new charger (I think heâ€™ll be pissed cause Iâ€™ve gone through like three in the past month) but even still then I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s my phone thatâ€™s godly a dodgy chagring port or cheap chargers and thatâ€™s pretty much how TINY inconveniences turns into me wanting to die itâ€™s not too fun

â€¢sorry I know itâ€™s my second time posting here and nobody will really care  or anything but itâ€™s literally tiny things like that that are starting to push me over the edge and Iâ€™ve seriously had like enough of it
