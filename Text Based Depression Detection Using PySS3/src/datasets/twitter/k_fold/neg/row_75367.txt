I'm so tired of trying to "get help"I was in therapy and taking medication for years and I still dont want to breathe any more. I don't want to "talk it out" with some hired stranger in a sterilized room or over the phone. even if I get back on medication theres no telling if it will even work I dont want to spend my life constantly experimenting until I find something that just numbs all my experiences. I just want this to be over all ready why do i have to go on
