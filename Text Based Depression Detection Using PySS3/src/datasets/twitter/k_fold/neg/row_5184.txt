I don't wanna do this anymoreI feel like an idiot, pushing forward for no reason when it's so hard.  

Maybe some people just don't fit into this world? Maybe I just wasn't born to live? In the end none of us matter in this endless universe. And maybe it's okay, maybe I don't have to keep on going.  

Or maybe not. I wish I knew how to feel better about life :/
