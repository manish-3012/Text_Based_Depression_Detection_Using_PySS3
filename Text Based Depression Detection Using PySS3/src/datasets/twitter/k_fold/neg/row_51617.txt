What's stopping me?Am I the only one who just thinks that I'm only one shitty little human with no qualities and dying wouldn't make a difference. Don't even know if my family would care. It'd probably be a great money-saver if I died, everything would be perfect if I died, less people to feed, you could buy a smaller and cheaper house, less worries about how pathetic and hopeless my future looks... etc

Why can't I do it? Why is my brain stopping me? 
I also think I'm going to regret posting this because it probably looks like I feel really sorry for myself
