Iâ€™m coming to the conclusion that I was raped when I was a little girl by my sisterI called the suicide hotline and the person was no help at all and I feel even worse and I donâ€™t know what to fucking do. Sheâ€™s in my life and I love her and I canâ€™t tell anybody about it so what the fuck!!! Iâ€™m just supposed to live my life knowing this and letting it go??? How???? Iâ€™ve suppressed it for like 22 years and it was just triggered the other day and I just.....I donâ€™t know what to do
