It's almost here- the year they're going to carve on my tombstoneI always thought that it would feel morbid to type that but it actually feels great. 

My last New Years Eve and my last one where I fret about being all alone once again (protip, youngsters: after about 30, maybe 35, your peers just stop doing NYE stuff and then you've either got someone with you or you're alone).

Another year with no raise in my salary, but certainly a raise in the rent.

Another year I can't afford to buy property in this overpriced garbage heap of a town. 

Another year of medical bills and a failing body.

Another year of depressing news, political strife, dead celebrities, the daily outrage, maybe even a good old-fashioned war or two. 

Almost tempted to stick around just in case a global nuclear war gives me the option for the world's cheapest funeral. Almost.

Just a few months left. So long December, you were always one of my favorite months.
