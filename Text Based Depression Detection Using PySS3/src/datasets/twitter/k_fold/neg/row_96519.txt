im trying to stay sane. I dont know how much sense this will make but im gonna write no matter what. 

Im losing my mind every day a little further. I started using drugs alot since last april and also met a girl. Was sad before that, now girl left and i still take drugs when i can which is every other day at this point. The sadness has been amplified aloot since she left. I dont even know if i loved her like i think i do or if i just used her as someone i could take drugs with. im so confused. 

Im feeling alone, depressed and like the biggest failure in existence. At 25 im still living with the parents, no GF and almost 0 emotional relationships. 

Used to think i was smart and slowly becoming successful and now im begging to either think or realize that im a loser. With no future. I have a 2:2 degree (had a major depressive episode in last year. or was that just an excuse i give myself idk anymore). i have friends that ask me to take drugs so im pretty sure at this point they arent my friends.  so no friends. 

I pushed away and badly hurt the one person who maybe cared about me (the girl). Or maybe she did. Maybe she used me too. idk. Im losing my sanity because i dont know who actually loves me. i think im unlovable and broken. with an ugly personality. I dont know who to trust anymore. Not even myself my own mind. 

Now days im beginning to think i was always stupid and some how convinced myself i was smart and people just went with it to make me feel good. IDK. 

I honstly dont know anymore everything around me is not what i used to think it was and im lost alone and i think i am going crazy for real. 

if you have read his please just help me make some kind of sense of this. Am i going crazy....is this me overthinking or not. 

im fucking scared to go to therapy because if i am losing it and its a reality i think ill end myself. But with the way things are going im gonna end myself anyway. IDK man im so confused and scared of what my reality is right now that i cant even function.
