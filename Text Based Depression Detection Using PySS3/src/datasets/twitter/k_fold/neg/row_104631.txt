Swan SongWith it being so close to Christmas i've decided to wait until after it's done and over with, I don't wont want to make it any harder then it has to be. I've had this plan, this decision made, for about a week now. I'm tired of losing everything I have, of making the wrong choices. you know, people say not to worry, that you're loved by friends and family, that people do love you and to forget about "him" or "her"...but what about your feelings? What about what I love? 

Why is it you have to go through this life enduring so much bullshit all ranging from being molested several times by several older guys to dealing with a emotionally and physically abusive drunk father that you can't tell you're gay because you're literally scared for your life, you're entire life. And when you finally find that one guy that's so special to you, that you still get that warm feeling just from seeing them, it all ends. I've got no illusions about what's led me down this path, I know I made the wrong choices and I can't stand that. I'm tired of fucking up, i'm financially fucked and i'm only 20, i've got three close friends but they're not even in the same state as me the rest are just simple acquaintances or people that i've met on this site in my short time here.  

And then there's the people tat say there's more fish in the sea, don't worry about it, go out and find a cute guy to fuck. That's not me. That's not who I am and that's "wrong" in the gay community, the majority aren't monogamous, it's ok to be in a relationship and sleep around and I'm not cool with that. And while I don't do stuff like that I certainly don't knock anyone who does but I get told that i'm wrong, that i'm old fashioned and my opinions were shaped by Christianity and my straight monogamous family members. I believe in love, I believe it still exists. So i'm not really sure if anyone got this far but it's pretty much this, i'm going to kill myself a day or two after Christmas, maybe even New Years to give it a bit more time. Why? Because by the time I decided I loved my boyfriend, he stopped loving me, because i'm ashamed of what I did and unlike most people i'm not afraid to admit that I am the one that fucked up and I can't live with myself knowing that I had him, that one I cared more about then anyone else, and because love isn't dead, just me.
