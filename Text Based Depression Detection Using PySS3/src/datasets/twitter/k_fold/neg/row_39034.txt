I set a date.One year from today.  I checked the calendar.  It'll be a saturday.  Summer.  Should be a nice, beautiful sunset.  I want that to be the last thing I see.  I'm going to start writing my letters, getting my affairs in order.  Give myself plenty of time so I can do things a little at a time without anyone noticing or giving away and major tells.  

My wife will be well taken care of and she'll be free.  Upset and sad at first, but the relief should set in very shortly thereafter.  

I'm not even sad anymore.  Just numb.  Setting the date helps.  I know what the endpoint is.  I don't have to wonder or be sad or upset.  I know nothing will get better so now it's just a matter of making things better for everyone else.  Making it easier for them.  I can put on a normal, happy face and just go about my business knowing this will be over soon.  None of it means anything.  I'm relieved.  Finally.
