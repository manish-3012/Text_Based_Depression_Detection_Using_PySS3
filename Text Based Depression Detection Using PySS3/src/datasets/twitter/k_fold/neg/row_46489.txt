Losing everything, including my will to liveI was doing so well, then I started struggling with depression worse than usual after a friend took her life last year.  My GPA started plummeting, I now have incompletes which I had to beg and plead for looming over my head, and I've lost both my financial aid and my SSDI within 2 weeks of each other.  I'm lucky if I can get out of bed and I keep setting records for consecutive days with panic attacks.

It doesn't help that when I was supposed to see my psychiatrist this past week, they stuck me with a totally unfamiliar NP without even telling me, who wound up telling me in the end that she had "absolutely no clue what to do" with me.  This left me dealing with nightmares and flashbacks of past trauma and feeling like I'm not worth it.

Right now, I have nothing.  No income, no future, and I can't handle it anymore.  I feel like I have nothing left to live for.  I have to swear up and down to every therapist and doctor that I see that I don't want to hurt myself but it gets harder every day to keep the dividing line between wanting to curl in a hole and pull the hole in after and just outright wanting to stop existing.
