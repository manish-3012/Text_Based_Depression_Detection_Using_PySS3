I was doing so well....15 years plus depression, possibly bipolar II... more recently I think maybe just depression and adult ADHD as it's pretty much only ever just impulsively with money and motivation because I can't stay on task and I get frustrated.

I found a great job 4 years ago.  Started paying off stupid debts.  Got a truck that work paid for, didn't pay it off faster, instead just piled on junk food and pizza, a camper for work, work didn't like that and cut the rate so it was losing g money for me.  Can't sell it upside down.... had a bright idea to buy a small one that would work.   Work starts shuffling me between jobs out of nowhere.   Now I'm fucked. Start to panic because I've saddled with 80k in vehicle debt based on a 60 to 70k a year job.


Yeah.  So I got 'laid off' 

I'm not sure if it's because I was complacent.  I think it was.  All I know is I have had a single job prospect seem to go well. And then around when I expected him to call my old work for the reference they assure me was good.... he dodges my calls.  The new employer.   So... I think I'm fucked.  I'm going to be bankrupt, lose my assets and probably owe 50000 when it's all over. 

I'm thinking about killing g myself a lot the last month.   Money is running out, job options are running out.  No one is calling me.  I ate two bites of chicken to say and threw up, I didn't eat yesterday at all, except a few sips of soda to try to stay conscious.   I'm ashamed... and lost.  I don't have any options.  I don't want to hurt anyone I love but... I just don't see a point.  I haven't felt love in years... I don't see anything to look forward to in the future that isn't hollow and meaningless.... even awesome technology and inventions.... soon fucked by our corporate overlords into something devoid of meaning and value.  Why go on living?  So I can die later?  What for?  I don't want kids.  My brain only let's me feel pain now. 

I wish I owned a gun.
