I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My livelihood seems to be at a standstill and Iâ€™m really debating just ending it.I was having a good time hunting in my video games and slaughtering all the evil griefers . The servers have went down in red dead online and I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been sit in my room for the past 9 hours doing nothing clicking refresh constantly and itâ€™s just not working.
