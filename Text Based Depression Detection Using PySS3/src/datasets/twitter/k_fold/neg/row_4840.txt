Life is bleakI just tested whether I can hang myself. The tie I brought seems unsuited for it. I will have to use rope.

I don't really feel depressed right now. I have dealt a lot with depression for the past 8 years and it doesn't really feel that way. At least not with the heavy heart and feeling of despair that I have come to associate with depression. Not with the complete inability to act either.  
I am just apathetic really. I used to have goals and things I wanted to do and I still try to set goals, but they don't motivate me to do things. I don't really want to do things anymore.  
Every winter I get depressed and this year was rough, but it seems to be over now. The worst thing about being depressed is not being able to do things. That is incredibly boring. However even when not depressed, I have increasingly run into the problem of not wanting to do anything, and it makes my life boring and uninteresting. I still do things, and they can even be interesting for a while, but they don't make my life fulfilling.  
I don't consider my life bad. I have my studies, am in good health and have family and friends. I also have access to professional and financial help. In theory my life should even be pretty good, but in reality, it just doesn't seem interesting enough to be worth living, and there is no sign of that changing. I hope that I will be able to kill myself within 10 years.
