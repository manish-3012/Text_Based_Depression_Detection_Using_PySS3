I'm just a monsterI always manage to fudge up. And I always try to change myself to become a better person. And I always end up right back at the start.

I'm very socially awkward and have a hard time getting close to people, so I have very few friends. Those few friends I do have, I value more than anything. Idk where I'd be without them. Yet I always end up hurting them one way or another. I misunderstand what they say and then it turns into some argument where I say things I regret and end up apologizing over and over as they ignore my calls and messages. There's only so much of this crap they can take until they give up on me and cut this toxicity out of their lives. I really can't blame them if they do. I don't deserve the patience and care they give me everyday. I'm really shocked they're still sticking with me.

But today I messed up again after a long time of what seemed like improvement. I messed up. I'm awful at putting my feelings into words and it came out wrong and she got hurt and now she won't talk to me and I feel like I don't deserve to live because what sort of monster does?

I cause nothing but pain to other people's lives. I'm a burden to everyone. My mother works so hard everyday to keep me healthy and well-fed, but I'm just a pig who eats up all the food and doesn't do my chores and sits around all day being lazy. She is losing her job in a week and won't be able to pay for my monthly doctor visits. My health is in very poor condition right now and sometimes I pass out.. sometimes I stop breathing.

I've reached the point where maybe dying from my condition is a good thing. My mom wouldn't have to constantly pull together funds for me. My friends wouldn't always have to be hurt by me. I won't have to burden everyone.

I'm just way too much of a coward to actually do anything about it. So I'll just let my own body kill me.
