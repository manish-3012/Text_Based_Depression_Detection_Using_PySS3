Why I like hikingItâ€™s not for the exercise, the views or the feeling of accomplishment. Frankly I hate the burning sensation of my thighs as I make the climb. But itâ€™s about the control I have when Iâ€™m standing on that cliff face. The overwhelming desire to jump. When Iâ€™m alone, I think about shooting myself in the head pretty much 24/7; Iâ€™m not able to control those thoughts but itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m able to do it. I donâ€™t have access to a gun. Thatâ€™s an out of my control. Whereas when Iâ€™m standing at the top of that hill or cliff, with nothing in between me and the ground apart from a couple hundred metres; itâ€™s my choice what happens. Of course a gust of wind could topple me over the edge, but thatâ€™s up to fate. I feel in control of my desire to kill myself. And stopping myself from jumping feels like an achievement in itself. A sign that maybe Iâ€™m not really ready to die.
