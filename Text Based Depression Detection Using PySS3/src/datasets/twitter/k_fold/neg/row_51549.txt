i'm pitifuli can't care for people because i'm emotionally idiotic. i push them away by being clingy. and i don't even listen to people, i'm so selfish i only hear the things i say. i'm slowly pushing away the only person i really care about and i can't watch myself do it, i can't look in the mirror. she's being polite but i know she's tired of me after this decade. i'm in love with her but i don't want to be. i could never be a good partner to her so i never want to be with her. i used to be friends with her ex, and i'm like 1/10th of the man he is. whenever we hang out and she leaves i get so sad, i don't want to be apart from her. but that's the clinginess talking. i hate myself for many other reasons. i did terrible things. i hate my dad and don't care about my mom/sister/gramma. my other friends will be fine. this girl i love, she will be sad, but also relieved. i have the supplies in my amazon cart, so i could die by this weekend with two day shipping.
