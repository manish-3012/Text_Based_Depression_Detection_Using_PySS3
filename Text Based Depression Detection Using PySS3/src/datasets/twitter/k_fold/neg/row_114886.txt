Seriously if my shitty life isn't enough to put an end to my life then knowing how bad the world is and how much worse it's going to be in the future is the final nail for me.Just look at it. People are getting worse, especially in the US. Authoritarianism and tyranny is rising without end, people in the future will be poorer and much worse off, violence will be everywhere, the biosphere will be trashed both figuratively and literally. I could go on but the future is nothing but all bad. I don't want to live to see it even if my life improved.
