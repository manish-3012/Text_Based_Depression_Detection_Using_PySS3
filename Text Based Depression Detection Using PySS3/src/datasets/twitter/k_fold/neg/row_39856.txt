I need helpI just typed my heart out for a good half hour but guess what? My internet cut out and i lost it all so ill just give a quick summary ive my life. Im 15 going to an alternative school because i argue with people. i have a few good friends but i cant see them because my parents are too lazy to take me anywhere. Theyre fat 300 pound assholes who usually add on to my depression by calling me names (Verbal abuse) The main reason why im depressed is my first year of 8th grade i slept all day and then played video games. I failed. My second year in 8th grade we moved and since im not allowed in public school, It took 3 months to be put in a school. I failed 8th a second time because of the amount of days i missed. So yea ill be 16 in 8th grade. secondly i barely get to hang out with anybody. Even the girl that i secretely am in love with. we have been BEST friends for 3 years. even though shes a 20 min drive away i cant see her because i have no ride. Also since 6 hours ago i realized ill be 16 in 8th grade, Even if i had a ride im to embaressed ( probably spelt that wrong) to talk to anybody... Lets cut to the chase my parents are the type of assholes that would luagh if i said i wanted to kill myself. And believe if i had a way to do it to where there was no pain, i would. But i dont have a way so i know i should get anti depression pills but im not sure how to confront my parents. They have no idea that im even depressed. btw im out of school right now because its summer. my daily routine is video games and sleeping.
