20 (M) Tried/was contemplating suicideMy brain is a mess, I keep hearing this evil voice in my head telling me i'm pathetic and constantly bringing me down. It's horrible and it is hard to talk to friends and family. Yesterday I was on top of a bridge that leads to a big fall onto train tracks. I was standing on a ledge and thinking about it now, I'm surprised I didn't seriously injure myself as I was drunk! Two people stopped to talk to me and as we were talking I ended up leaning backwards and fell back onto the footpath. Police officers came and said that I was just over exaggerating and was just being a drunken idiot, and when I had told them that I constantly feel this way and am depressed they laughed at me and took the piss out of mental health! This pissed me off so much and then as they were following to make sure I was leaving and going home, I stuck the finger up at them and told them to get fucked and mental health is a real thing and that I had their license plates. I started jogging after that because I realised they probably were going to chase me which they had done and I ended up legging it through a park. I fell over a few times in the process scraping some body parts and ended up hiding in the bushes. More had happened on this day but icbf explaining what had happened. Worst part was that my suit got ripped when I was hiding and had fell over :( 

Tl;DR: just a sad story about a loser
