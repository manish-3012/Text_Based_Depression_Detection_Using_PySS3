Should I talk to someone about my suicidal thoughts?I would really appreciate advice, this feeling is looming over me and ruining EVERYTHING I try to accomplish... 

So, I think about suicide everyday now and I know I need help, however I've read stories about people opening up about their suicidal thoughts to their therapist only for them to be locked up in a facility somewhere.

 Then they have to pretend they're all better to get out. 
Does this really happen? 
So I'm wondering, what's the point of talking to a specialist if they're just going to send me away?

Anyway, I don't have a therapist (too expensive...) but I was thinking of telling my family doctor. 
Should I? 
If I do, what should I say?
I want them to know that I'm suicidal, but I have so much anxiety over this. I really need help.
