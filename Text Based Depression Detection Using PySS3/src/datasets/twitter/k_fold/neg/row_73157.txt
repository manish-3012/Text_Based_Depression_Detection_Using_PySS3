Iâ€™m killing myself tonightThereâ€™s nothing stopping me now. My mind is clear and my thoughts are set. If I donâ€™t die then Iâ€™ll just try again. Over and over again until I finally perish into infinity and sleep forever. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m typing this. I wonâ€™t be remembered. Nobody will be saddened by my loss. Iâ€™ll just fade away into obscurity and I will be forgotten. Nothing is stopping me anymore, so, I guess this is goodbye yâ€™all. See you on the other side.
