Is it possible to speed up heart disease?

I have a muscle wasting disease after a specific heart break last year I decided enough was enough and I'm trying to be alone..  Long story short guys... I can't go on like this I'm now wheelchair bound I've become a burden on my family I don't recognise myself anymore since I lost my job all my friends have either married or left
I'm tormented... nobody cares about disabled men I've met disabled woman who are never alone I've been lucky  enough to also have heart disease so I'll die in a few years I met men who have survived and it scared me to see my future may involve electric wheelchairs and being spoon fed my dinner every female has a boyfriend or is married while the men have to find nurses
I want to kill myself.. Is there a way to speed up my heart disease? 
Having md is awful I wish everyone who made it this far the best
