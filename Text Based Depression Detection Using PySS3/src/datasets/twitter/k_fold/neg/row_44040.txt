I think I have reverse seasonal depressionThis happens every year around this time. I start to feel like shit. My mom reminds me of how stupid I am because i get low marks in math and science and I hardly see anyone because they're all off to various places with better friends. My girlfriend lives in a different country and I don't feel the need to live anymore. I just feel like I'm not important to anyone, that the world is going to shit and I'm just another mouth to feed to society.
