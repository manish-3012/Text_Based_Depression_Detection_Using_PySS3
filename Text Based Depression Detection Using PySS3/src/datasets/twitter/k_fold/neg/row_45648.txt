I'm right on the edge. I don't know what comes next.28 years old, 28 years of feeling down. Far back as I can recall I have always felt sad. Its not that I'm sad for a reason, there's really not much that should bring me down in life. Except for the sadness and the damage it does. I love my family and have great friends. My life has been full amazing experiences and endless amusement. Yet under lying all this is a pit of endless sorrow. a deep reaching pain that curls its self around my brain.

I was always the top of my class but the older I got the deeper the pain, the more I resented life. In 10th grade I dropped out. Failure.  I went on to trade school and then some college, to be a 3 time college drop out. Finally gave up on my education. Since then I have gotten and lost many good  paying tech jobs. One by one I lose them as fast as I gain them. My depression cripples me, I reach a point of breaking and they end up firing me. I was engaged and also lost her for this reason. My life today is empty and void. I see very little reason for a future or even a tomorrow. I lost my Job today, not because of my work, quality of work, or amount of work. I was fired because I didn't seem to be into the job, they fired me because they thought i had a poor attitude.  

I started therapy for the first time ever a month back and was started on meds last week. If they just could have waited a few more weeks, I know I would have turned around. I was already making some good head way. I actually have been spending less time in bed and even cleaned some of my house the other day. But today was just the push I needed to realize that maybe I wasn't meant for this world. I doubt I would or could kill my self. Not in a violent manner, I dont have any hard drugs or any thing so I'll probably just sleep for a few days. I dunno.
