How can I stop my immediate thoughts of hanging myself whenever I fuck up?I thought it was just a phase, a one time thing. I would see my bad grades and a picture of me hanging from a noose would pop up in my head and it was very tempting. I shook it off. Then I see more successful, more social, more meaningful people and me hanging comes back. I feel sick to my stomach and want to cry because I know I'll never achieve such social and educational success.

I made a post barely over a week ago, thinking it'll help. It did for a day or two. Then I fucked up again and I was just about to lean over the nearby balcony and just hear my head crushing against the floor and I'll be happy. Talking about it makes me want to do it now actually.

But I can't. 6 days ago on my Reddit post some guy said I didn't want to kill myself or else I'd already be dead. And he's right. I really have to follow through.... but I can't. I just can't. Why can't I just get it over with? Why do I keep putting it off? A false sense of hope that I can be better is probably why.

I don't like talking about my feelings because who cares? They're stupid and vain and I know a lot of people out there would love to be in my position. But I really just want someone to somehow stop these thoughts... I'm dancing with depression and need I say, she's great at salsa...just let me suffer instead of being tempted by these thoughts. Please.
