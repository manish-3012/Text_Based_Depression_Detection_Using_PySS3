Birthday BluesI turn 20 on the 5th of August and I'm not happy about it. I feel like I'm so far behind from my peers. Everyone is moving forward with their lives and I'm stuck in the same place I have been for years. I can't do this anymore. I feel like a complete failure and disappointment to everyone around me. I know everyone is different and most people my age are still trying to find themselves but I'm just exhausted. I don't care anymore. Everything just feels so overbearing. Life is just too difficult. I don't see the point of living. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up again. Is that too much to ask?
