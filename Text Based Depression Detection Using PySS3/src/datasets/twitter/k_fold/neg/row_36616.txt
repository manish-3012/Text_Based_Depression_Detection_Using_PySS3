It'll be ok.On 5/25, I tried to kill myself.

Not really try, I succeeded.  My heart stopped, and I was revived.  My story is pretty trite and selfish in retrospect.  But I almost lost the two best things that have ever happened to me, my fiancÃ© and her son.

Whatever you are going through, talk to someone.  There ARE people there for you.  You CAN get through it.  You do not have to feel like you do not have a choice.  You are LOVED.

I feel like I've been given a second chance on life.  Regardless of your religious beliefs, know that if you end your life you will leave devastation and pain in your wake.  You will ruin lives.  You will irreparably harm those who love you.  I am not saying this to put more stress on you, I just want you to know that there are people who care about you, and will miss you.

Talk to someone.  Talk to me, anyone.  Talk to your cat.  Talk to a potted plant. Call a hotline.  I wish I did.  I made the worst mistake of my life, and I almost paid for it with my life.  But more importantly I almost lost the things I care about the most, because of stupid issues I was too proud to bring up.

Learn from my mistakes.  Please.  This life is worth living.  The sun rises and falls with my family, and for a brief moment I lost sight of that.

In an instant, I almost gave it all up.  Don't be me.  Tomorrow is a new day, and whatever your problems are, they can be solved.  There are people in your corner.  There is life left to be loved.

Keep sucking air.  It's worth it.  Pain lets you know you are still alive.  And there is nothing, absolutely nothing worse in this world than the dead, numbness I felt that day.

Sometimes things suck, and there seems like there is no way out.  But I'm here to tell you every day is a new day.  Nothing is written in stone.
