I have called someoneMy sister, thanks to the bar on the side here. It was hard and I don't want to feel like a leach. But I also had to think about the depression that might ensue for her if I committed suicide. I can't start that domino effect. I don't care about my life at this point but I do care about hers so I had to weigh it out. She's rational enough to help me get proper meds and on track. Many thanks to the person who created the bar on the side. I believe you have prevented a lot of pain.
