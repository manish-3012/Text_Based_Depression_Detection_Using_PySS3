Things have calmed down.This is an update to everything recently. 

Things have gotten better. I'm back in touch with my friend, his boyfriend has stopped being a jerk once everything was explained to him so he stopped seeing things that weren't there. That relieved a lot of stress. 

Few co-workers on the job this week so that's a relief, I'll talk with my therapist next week about the Asperger self-disclosure again but I really think I'm going down that road. I had a chance to talk to a couple of older buddies this past weekend that I hadn't spoken to in years and both said I didn't react well to change, etc. so letting work know would be good. 

On being a non-believer, least of my worries right now.

Thanks for the reading and questions and all that everyone has given me and reached out to me.
