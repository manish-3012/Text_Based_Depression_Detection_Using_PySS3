I'm sick of thisI feel so lonely it's pathetic. I hate myself for being needy and stupid. I just want to stop existing. I may be fine, and then numb in just a matter of seconds. I usually cut when stressed but two weeks ago I did it again just for the sake of it and it was the very first moment I didn't feel remorseful. I wanted to be but I just couldn't. I've tried to change, to be more extroverted but failed. Life is not for me. I'll always be alone. Why can't I stop making a fool of myself? Twice today and it's only midday. Fuck me. These feelings of hopeless and self-hatred have always been there and somehow I managed to handle them but they are starting to take over me. There's not a day that goes by that I don't think about how good it would be to be dead. I just want to go through it but I don't understand why I can't.
