That's it I'm taking the pillsI am tired of feeling this way. I am tired of being a worthless piece of shit. I would be better off dead I should of done this a long time ago. I dropped out of highschool I don't have a job and I am going to be 18 soon. My family never understood the bullying, my depression or how there actions effected me. My family always has put me down and made me feel like shit but they are right I am a piece of shit. Bye everyone I can't do this anymore. âœŒï¸
