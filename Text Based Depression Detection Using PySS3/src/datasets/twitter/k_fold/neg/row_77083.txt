Canâ€™t see myself living past 25I am absolutely horrible at socializing. I donâ€™t even know how the hell I have friends. The bigger question is, why the fuck am I depressed when I have friends and family who love and support me? Lots of other people donâ€™t even have that and theyâ€™re not depressed and suicidal, so why am I this way? I donâ€™t understand.

I had a dream last night about an old crush of mine and after waking up from it, I felt really depressed throughout my entire day. It makes me feel awful that I cannot even talk to girls I am attracted to. I hate my own guts, so why in the hell would they like someone like me? Iâ€™m easily replaceable anyways. Theyâ€™ll always find a guy thatâ€™s better than me in literally every aspect. Anything I could do, thereâ€™s TONS of other people that could do it way better than I ever can. Video games, socializing, grades, you name it. I am complete shit in everything I do.

College is coming up soon and I literally do not know how the hell I am going to socialize with others. Iâ€™m awkward as fuck and I do not want to join any clubs or social events. During the few social events I attended in high school, it seemed that everyone was just better than me at absolutely everything. Everyone was better looking than I was and they actually new how to socialize unlike me. I felt suicidal almost everyday at school. I always fantasized about committing suicide and wondering what people would do and if anyone at school would even care I killed myself. Maybe I should have just committed suicide in high school.

When I would talk to people, I tried my very best to put on a mask to hide my anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. I honestly do not know how the hell I have friends and family who care about me when I am a piece of shit person. Hell, Iâ€™m just making this post for attention. Hereâ€™s to hoping I can purchase a gun within the next few years and off myself in the forest or something.
