i can't do this anymorei can't believe i'm even posting here. i've never wanted to die before but tonight i do because i just don't have the strength to deal with this anymore. i know that i would never actually kill myself but i just really want to die and its scaring me. my boyfriend broke up with me over a month ago and i just can't deal with it. everybody said that it would get better. the first 2 weeks were hell. i just lay on the couch all day and cried. i barely ate. things started to improve after that. but now they're bad again. they're so bad. i don't want to feel like this anymore.
