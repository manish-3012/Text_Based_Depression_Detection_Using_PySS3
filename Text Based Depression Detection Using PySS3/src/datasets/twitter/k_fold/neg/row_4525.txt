I'm doneGood job L, H, everyone in the community who figured they knew enough to pass judgment and give me shit for it all, and everyone else who helped keep it fresh. You left me with no one and nowhere to go, drained of all inertia, of hope, of faith in people. I'm heading out this week. Probably won't live long, but definitely not coming back.
