hi everyoneI've been a lot on this sub lately. Only watching, hanging off the branches of other posts and other people in distress. First time poster. I guess some would find it hypocritical to leave a last note in order to be remembered but under an anonymous name online.

I am sick. It's not big news because I have been since I was abused when I was little. But 2 weeks ago, I got a lot more sick. And slowly but surely, I gave up. My friends and the people I have around me... well, I keep them in my heart since they didn't come to see me. 

I really tied to be a good person. Smiling, cheering people up, kind. Sweet enough not to be a burden but boring enough not to be remembered. 

Day after day after day, I've found it harder and harder to keep the pace. And now that I'm alone and don't have anyone to blame for it but myself, I'm reevaluating.

I'm leaving. Not my country, not this sweet town, not this decrepit hospital or the cold bed I'm in. I'm out. I'm done. I don't want to go on. I give up. 

I have spent a good part of my life learning to speak this beautiful language, I still make a lot of mistakes I'm sure (sorry about that). It makes me sad that I can only express myself like this, I know someone that'd say it's another way to push away the ones that want to help. I love songs and music from every horizon, but I can't find on to put on this situation. Nevermind.

J'espÃ¨re m'endormir encore mais cette fois-ci ne pas me rÃ©veiller. Plonger dans une obscuritÃ© oÃ¹ je revis, une Ã©ternitÃ© de quiÃ©tude au bout des doigts, prenant Ã  bras le corps mes regrets et mes peines. 

Thank you for reading this
