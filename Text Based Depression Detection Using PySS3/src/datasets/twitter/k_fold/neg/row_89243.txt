Want to dieI am just very tired. The more I try the more i want to kill myself. The person I love the most, I hurt him and now Im trying to fix it. But it seems like nothing matters anymore. I really really want to die. Just want to shot my head with a fucking gun. I am sick of crying myself to sleep and pretend like nothing happened, then repeat the cycle everyday.
