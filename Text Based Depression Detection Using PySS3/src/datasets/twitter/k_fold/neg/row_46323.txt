Just want to be talked off the edgeI'm really feeling like just of a cloud of illogical horrible depression is over me right now. Just having a ton of doubts, regrets and fears overcome me all at once. I can't sleep. Family keeps a loaded weapon in the house and I really don't want to hurt myself but I feel like a physical nag to end my life. Will someone please distract me till I can fall asleep I would be so grateful
