Need advice- brother attempted SuicideI got news this morning that my brother intentionally crashed his car on the freeway this morning in a Suicide attempt. It seems that the injuries are minor, but he is still getting checked out. I think he has been admitted into the psych ward. I havenâ€™t been able to speak with him yet. Iâ€™m boarding a plane now to be with him this week.

His girlfriend of 5 years broke up with him a year ago and he took it hard. Since then he had another 7 month relationship which he just chose to end- I know he felt guilty about it because she took it hard. Heâ€™s also been dissatisfied at work because he does not make as much money as he would like. He had been planning to move to work/live closer to my brothers and I.  

All that being said, I speak with him frequently and he seemed very stable and happy, but ready for a change. I would not have considered him depressed and NEVER would anticipate this. Just yesterday he was texting me normally and happily. He has many friends and is good at his job. Iâ€™m in relatively good health. I know he mentioned that he regrets that sometimes when he drinks with friends he goes â€œoverboardâ€ and gets more drunk than intended, but that did not seem to be a big issue in his life. Iâ€™m worried, but in a very rational place. My parents are completely distraught.

Do you have any advice on what to say to him? Or to my parents? Like I said, Iâ€™m not expecting a miracle so no pressure.  How can I help him feel better and get better? Any common pitfalls that we need to avoid? Any good resources I should know about?
