How to talk a person out of comiting suicide? (Not urgent, don't worry)A week or so ago a girl I'm close with was thinking about ending everything. I stayed up all night talking to her.

I want to be more prepared to handle something like this in the future because I have a feeling it might happen again soon.

Any help?
