This looks like the endMy friends hate me because they think Iâ€™m a habitual liar, which Iâ€™m not anymore. I have changed, but there are some people who spread lies and convince my friends that it was me who did it or said something. They believe them too, and left me. My life is already going to shit, maybe I just might kill myself tonight. Iâ€™ve got a bottle of sleeping pills somewhere in the house. I just feel miserable right now. I donâ€™t see any point in living life or any way that things will get better or change.
