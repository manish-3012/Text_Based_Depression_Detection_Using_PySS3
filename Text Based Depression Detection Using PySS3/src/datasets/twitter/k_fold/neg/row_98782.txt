Is this really over?So I'm having this kind of a new long-distance relationship. We have been together for 4 months now and I have to join the army in 2 weeks. The first time she really visited me went really well except for the part when the next was the day she was supposed to leave. She almost killed herself telling me that I'm the only reason she's still alive for and she won't make it through my 6 months there.
So what should I tell her? Is there a way to prepare her for that? I already made it sure that well me texting and calling everyday and visiting each other as frequently as possible but I know that she meant those words and I'm really scared..
