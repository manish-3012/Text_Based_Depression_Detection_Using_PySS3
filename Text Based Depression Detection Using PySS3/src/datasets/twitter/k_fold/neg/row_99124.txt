I wanted to die in peace.I wanted to die, talking to someone who slowly let me drift away, showing me the tiniest sliver of peace.

But no one is there to bring me peace. Even my closest friends knowing my darkest thoughts just abandon me. No one gives a shit about my happiness. They just dont want a burden of death. They dont care about me dying, just that a person shouldnt die. I have no reason to live. I cannot live like this. So dreadfully lonely.  


I wanted to die in peace. And I couldnt even have that. I'll die afraid of death and full of confused thoughts. Fuck.
