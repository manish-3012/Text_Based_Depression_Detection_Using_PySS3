Leaving the showIâ€™m going to kill myself. I need a method that will work and I can escape the pain. I hate my god damned life. 

Iâ€™m sitting here with my young kids on the off weekend I get to be with them. I barely enjoy it because it ends so fast and Iâ€™m left with my shitty life and lonely world again. 

I used to be happy. I was married, had a job, we could travel. Now divorced, unemployed, and barely seeing my kids. I hate my life. 

God damn you god for watching and doing nothing.
