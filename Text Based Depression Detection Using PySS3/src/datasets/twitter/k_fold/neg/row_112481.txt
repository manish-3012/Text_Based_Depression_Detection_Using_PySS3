Please ReadAs it is very obvious, this sub is full of people of all sorts. Most of them debating suicide or looking for somebody to relate to. I'd just like to say that I am open to anyone wanting to talk. Don't be shy to admit anything, I am not fit to judge either way. Just consider chatting with me on reddit or we can take it to a different social media app. Love you all
