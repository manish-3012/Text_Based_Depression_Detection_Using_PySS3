AloneBeen struggling with suicidal thoughts for the past 5 years or so, but haven't acted upon it because I lived with my mum and i didn't want her to see me like that. Now I'm moved out to university and i could just do it. Part of me doesn't want to, but I think the only way to stop myself would be to move back home again. Im physically disabled, frequently in pain, and feel pretty useless overall. I either kill myself, keep pretending Im ok at uni until i inevitably kill myself later, or admit defeat and shamefully move back home knowing my mental health and disability have beaten me once again. Fuck. Why did I even think I could live independently. I can barely live in general.
