The end's coming soonThere's not much else to say that I haven't said before. My life is a lie. Everything I had with my bf was a lie. Broken promises. No trust anymore. Can't do this again. Don't have any reason to stick around now. He was the only reason I really bothered to get out of bed and now I find out about all the bullshit and lies.

It's all my fault of course. It always is.

I really tried to. Stopped cutting. Quit drugs. Everything because he asked me to. It all meant nothing.

Fuck it. It's all gonna be over soon anyway. I've a mountain of debt at this stage and can barely afford food. All I have is cornflakes right now. I guess they'll be my last meals.
My parents can sell my car and some other things to pay off what I owe I hope. I was always the disappointing one anyway.

Thanks for being here. So I don't feel so alone when I go.

If anyone finds this and realises who I am... I'm very sorry.


See ya later!
