What should I doHey guys,

I'm asking this honestly. I dont know who's here. I'm not even bothering with an alt account because it doesnt really matter. I've down about 3/4 of a fifth of coconut rum (delicious), and I'm really just considering getting the gun and ending it. I was a software engineer, I had a full ride to a top twenty school but couldnt finish it because my mom got schizophrenia and I had to work to help the family, I've done about as much as I can and I've very tired. I tried, I think I did well in life, but I'm just so tired. I don't really know why I'm posting this. I guess I'm hoping someone can give me a little inspiration to just keep going. I dont want to. I have no father, my mother left her mind when I was 18. I kept trying, but its just so hard to keep trying now.

I've had a failed engagement, I blame it on my depression but it was really just me. I'm now dating a beautiful aspiring actress in San Fran who is about to graduate from the San Fran School of the Arts with a BA. She's going to do well. She deserves so much. I feel like I'll only bring her down. Again, I'm not sure why I'm posting this but I just wanted to get it off my chest. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm lost.
