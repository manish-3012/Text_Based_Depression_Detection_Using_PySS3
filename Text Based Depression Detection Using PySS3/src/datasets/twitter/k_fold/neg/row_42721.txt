it's really for the best.I think about dying every day, always when I'm alone, sometimes around other people.  It's been this way for years and I've drifted along the spectrum of severity - until now, my most serious planning was last February.  Obviously I didn't go through with it, but I don't really remember why.  Kinda wish I had.

I've been depressed for as long as I can remember - the first time I remember saying seriously that I wanted to die I was elementary school.  Anxiety became worse as I've gotten older, and occasionally I'll become more severely OCD in reaction to anxiety (ritualizing to try to control it). 

Last week I seriously fucked up at work and did something well....really fucked up that I should have known better than to do.  A friend of mine tried to kill himself and it's thrown my anxiety and depression into overdrive leading to several bad decisions, but that one in particular.

No one in my life knows, but I really can't take it anymore.  The only thing holding me back at this point is finding a way that won't fucking hurt (seriously, I'm the biggest wuss when it comes to physical pain).  And the fact that it will destroy my parents, but I plan to at least write a letter and try to explain that it's for the best.  Obviously that won't fix things, but it's the best I can do.

I guess I just wanted to tell somebody.  Kinda hope I won't make it through the end of the month, but I suppose that depends on how brave I can be. Thanks.
