I have some opportunities and I hope I won't screw up.Hi everybody! I used to lurk a lot on this subreddit so I feel that I need to say goodbye. I'm still depressed and I don't know if it's over. But there is still time. There will always be. I'm changing my environment so I'm trying to browse more positive stuff. Maybe I will manage to get some friends this summer and fix my problems. If I don't, it's over. But at least I'm putting 100% effort.

I know that some people are going through bad times and I'm praying for them (although that probably doesn't help).I hope that everything will get better for everyone because I'm tired off suffering and seeing people suffer.

Goodbye r/suicidewatch and please don't give in.
