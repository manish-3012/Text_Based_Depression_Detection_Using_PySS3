Both of my parents have tried to kill themselvesSo as the title says both my mom and stepdad have tried to end their lives. My mom tried a few months back by taking a bunch of pills (l ran to a friend house to call 911) and recently my stepdad tonight (cutting his wrists with his knife and has also been excessively drinking) so at this point I dont know what to do. Both of them have tried and failed but I dont know what I as their son can do to help them since my stepdad was taken away by the cops for psychiatric help and counseling, but again I dont know what to do.
