Hey _x000D_
SW, _x000D_
I _x000D_
think _x000D_
I'm _x000D_
going _x000D_
to _x000D_
throw _x000D_
in _x000D_
the _x000D_
towel.Please hear me out here because I really don't want to sound like a whiny, moaping emo prick. _x000D_
_x000D_
About 3 years ago I came very close to ending it all. I had absolutely nothing going on for me at that time. I was left so vacant and empty that sometimes I think I was already dead before I attempted suicide. My existence was a utterly parasitic one. There are a lot more details that I'll omit, simply because I'm sure many of you have heard it all before. That's not why I'm here._x000D_
_x000D_
Fast forward to the present, I'm no longer in that dark, miasmic head space; at least it's not as bad as it used to be. I'm somewhat happier, with a job and what some would call, an average life for someone in their late 20s. From the outside at least. _x000D_
_x000D_
The thing is, even after coming out of that dark place, I can't help but feel an overwhelming sense of futility. Except for my immediate family and a couple (maybe 2 or 3) of friends, I have nothing on this planet. My passion and love for music is one of the few things keeping me going, but at my age it's highly impossible for me to achieve what I want with my music. It's way too late.  So, to survive, I'll have to jump on that mind-numbing bandwagon that almost everyone else takes without question. Just survive.  _x000D_
_x000D_
But I can't do that. I find that an existence in which you are unable to do what you truly want to; in which all you're doing is merely surviving and not living; is one that is not worth continuing. It's parasitic. It's disappointing. It's pointless. Futile. There's no good. I'll just be another person contributing absolutely nothing yet consuming everything. Just so I can continue breathing? Then what? Hope I get married and pray my children don't turn out like me?_x000D_
_x000D_
Which, again, will never happen because all my attempts at relationships are so foully cursed that I've resigned to the fact that I'm never going to find this thing called love._x000D_
_x000D_
I'm a failure through and through. To my parents. To myself. To the world. Complete and utter failure._x000D_
_x000D_
So what SW? No dreams. No love. No achievements. No fulfilment. All I have is my family but even their burdens will be significantly reduced without me around. It'll be devastating for sure but time heals. I've seen it happen. They are many times stronger than I'll ever be.  _x000D_
_x000D_
I'm not sad or depressed. Or maybe I am. I don't know anymore. I just don't see a point. I don't see the logic. _x000D_
_x000D_
I'm just throwing this out there. I don't know if this is a plea for help but that was definitely not the intention. If you think you have anything to say then, please by all means. I'm not the only one you could be helping. Otherwise, I'm truly sorry if I have wasted your time with my rambling. _x000D_
_x000D_
Take care SW.
