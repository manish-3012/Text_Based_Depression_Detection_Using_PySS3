I wish...I wish I could make friends.
I wish I could hold a job.
I wish I had people that cared.
I wish I had anything that I could be proud of.
I wish I had decisions I didn't regret.
I wish I hadn't missed the first time.
I wish I could end a night without crying myself to sleep.
I wish I could think that the world wouldn't be better without me.
I wish I could sleep.
I wish I could think about anything else.
I wish I had anyone who would care that this is goodbye.
