Being sober makes me realize I have nothing to live forLast week I fucked up again, like I have thousands of times before. I got my second DWI arrest and now, being forced to be sober, I can't think of a single reason to go on living.

I have no dreams; I have no hopes. I've been friendless for I don't know how long. Drinking has been the only thing that has kept me going, kept me interested, given me something to look forward to.

I knew a year ago that my life was going to end in nothing but tragedy. One event after another just tells me that I wasn't meant to live. The one I love being totally gone from my life, her last words being, "You will survive without me." And here I sit, a year later, lost the only job I was ever good at, alone. This is surviving in the truest sense of the word. 

I've always been alone, ever since I was a child. I just never clicked, never understood people. Now, without alcohol to distract me I'm faced with the grim realization that truely, there is nothing to live for.

I envy all of you with families, friends, wives and girlfriends, children and parents. I envy all of you who get excited about things and have things to look forward to.

I envy those who don't feel that it is a burden to live, that it is easy to be happy. I have never been happy and I never will be.

If only I wasn't such a coward I would end it all. The only thing stopping me is the finality of it all.

I don't know what else to say. I just want this to be over already.
