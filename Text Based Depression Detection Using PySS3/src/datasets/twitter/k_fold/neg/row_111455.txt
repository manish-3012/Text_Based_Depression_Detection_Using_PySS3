FloodI find a lot of comfort in knowing the music I'll be playing if I ever do go through with it.  Lately I'm listening to it on loop and I picture myself dying hundreds of times over.  I don't really feel like acting on it completely but the images are getting more and more graphic.  

I'm not sure if I should tell someone because I'm finding comfort in the images too.  I imagine the feeling of release.  And the music feels like I'm adrift at sea.  Alone.  Forever.  This is all I think about lately.  Tonight I actually hurt myself a little bit trying to see if I could feel a little bit of the release I imagined in my fantasies.  I feel so stuck where I'm at.  Both my physical living space (which is toxic) and the place I am mentally.  Tired of the ups and downs and leaving everything unfinished.

The images play through my mind all day.  I have an appointment in 3 weeks to be reassessed and prescribed medications (i'm not med compliant now because the place prescribes me 5 meds and i'm not a person anymore when i do take them).  I don't know if I should call and say it's an emergency and ask to move it up or keep indulging these fantasies.  I just took 5x the dose of benzo I'm supposed to and I want to find a warm place to lay my head.
