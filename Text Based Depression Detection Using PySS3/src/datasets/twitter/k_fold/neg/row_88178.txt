Iv exausted all optionsÂ  I feel emotionally overwhelmed yet numb.Â  Its like im experiencing every emotion at 100% intensity.Â  Yet i also feel numb.Â  I just dont care anymore.Â  Iv lost interest in my hobbies.Â  Iv destroyed my career.Â  I cant live with who i am and what little i can do.Â  I have no control over my situation, what happens happens.Â  Life likes to fuck me over one way or another.Â  No matter what i do or how hard i try its never enough.Â  Therefore i quit.Â  I want to curl up and cry,just be left alone,to yell and scream,to just release my rage all at once.  My boyfriend broke up with me, my best friend is losing her job.  My parents force me to have 0 sexual experiences before marrige.  I was homeschooled and bullied so i have no social experience.  Im touch starved but i cant meet/match with anyone.  Im tired of having no control and life fucking me over and over non stop.  My suicide is my only option now.  Iv tried getting help for my mental health but it only made it worse.
