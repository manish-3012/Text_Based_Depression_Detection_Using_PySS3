Best way to live stream a suicide?Would like some ideas on the best way to stream a suicide, preferably on a phone. Unfortunately don't have a Facebook account (No friends, or family who cares), but will sign up if that's the best way. I don't want to die alone, and an audience will make it tougher to back out. Would also like the last chance to say goodbye to this community that's help me cope so we'll up to this point. Thanks
