Fuck my parents, I want to fucking dieMY fucking parents man. 
I do so much and study so much, get a 4.1 gpa, pass my algebra 2 skip test, do my chores everyday, help around the house, yet they still just talk down to me. It seems like all they focus on is the negative things i do, and never the positive. For example, i went to my sat class today to take a practice test review, and i come back. I decide to play some videogames after playing with and taking my dog out. so i tell my mom at 4 25 that im getting off at 5 15, so i can avoid any insults being thrown at me or any talking down to me. So when i get off, its 5 20. My mom goes fucking ballistic. tells me im worthless, i never study or do anything, even though i do every single day. I just want to fucking hang from the ceiling with a note saying "Its your fucking fault" to my parents. Every fucking day. I just want to end it. What's even worse is I do everything they say. But of course not, they only notice my mistakes. IT WAS FIVE FUCKING MINUTES YOU ASSHOLE. And to top it all off my sister is absolute dog shit in her studies, never does any work, but still manages to never get yelled at. Always me. It's always fucking me." You never do anything, you're a lazy person, you are worthless, you're gonna embarrass us with your college admission" even though my gpa is good and same with my sat score. Never anything positive.
I WANT TO FUCKING KILL MYSELF AND JUST END IT
