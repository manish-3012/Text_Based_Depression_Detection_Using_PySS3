QuestionsWhy do I suffer so much? why do I like it if it is bad? why is it hard for me to think? why are there no guaranteed cures? why is it so difficult? why is it so hard for me? why am I so hopeless? why do I see the bad in the present? why do I remember only the bad from my past? why do i avoid my parents and the psychologist by having both of them? will i have to keep from the psychiatrist all my life if i don't work? why am i so clean in my head and efficient but somehow something changed in me? why don't i cry? Why am I shameless but I can't even think about crying? why do I reserve my intelligence, which I believe is internally disciplined, to think about everything a lot? why do I see suicide as good but reserve the right to do it and argue to others that it is "worth it"? why do I waste time saying what I feel about things that will not be solved for me? explaining to a community of strangers, in a language that is not my native language, when I feel that they will not be interested in me? why do I lose satisfaction? why am I like this?  
But luckily, I think, no one is really alone
