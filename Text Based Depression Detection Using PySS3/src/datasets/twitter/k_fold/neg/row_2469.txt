I don't know how to keep going.I've had bipolar disorder for about ten years now. Earlier I was on and off medications. I've been on these for a few years now with some adjustments. During this period I was diagnosed with an incurable disease, I lost my grandma, I lost my grandpa, and I have no relationship with my mother. All of these three people had been the rocks in my life. All three are gone. I felt like I was doing okay for a few years, but recently things haven't been good. There has been problems with work (harassment), anxiety about surviving and other things. The straw the broke the camel's back came Thursday night. I have been living with him since the beginning of the year. I loved him. He made me happy, he would listen, he would be supportive, he was who I wanted to be with. He decided that he was done. There was no reason. He left and took everything of his while I was at work. Prior to this I had the feeling of not wanting to live anymore. Now it's becoming stronger. I'm ripping my hair out, I'm cutting, I'm smoking, I'm drinking, and who knows what I will do. I can't take time off for help. I know I shouldn't be alone. All of my friends are surprised at this, they say not to do anything and ask for help. But the truth is that I'm tired. Between my disease, the loss, the depression, I feel like I can't continue this. Which is stupid. There isn't anything for me to even be depressed about. But I hate myself for this. I should be fine but I'm not. I feel like a piece of shit. A burden. A liability. I can't do this anymore.
