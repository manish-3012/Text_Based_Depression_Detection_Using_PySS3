Right now is just one of those daysWhenever something goes bad or I think about past events for too long, I start wanting to harm myself. I start to cry and stuff along those lines.  Tonight is one of those moments. I got yelled at and now I'm just laying down thinking of times where someone has yelled at me, thought I was weird, and got embarrassed.  I just want to disappear and die whenever I think of it. 

Thing is the next day, I feel happy almost. Like nothing happened, and this makes me feel invalidated. Like I was being overdramatic. I shouldn't be acting normal if just 7 hours ago I was crying into my pillow wanting to suffocate myself. This happens often enough to where I feel like it's a pattern or repetitive. I've often thought about talking about this stuff with a close friend or stranger on the internet,  but I am horrible at articulating my feelings without my message being screwed up. I don't want them to be confused or get the wrong idea. Is this normal to go from happy to suicidal back to happy in a relatively short amount of time?
