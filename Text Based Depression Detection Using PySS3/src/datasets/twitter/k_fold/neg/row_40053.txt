There's no point to me still living20 year old recluse living in my parents house, failed uni twice, no job, ugly and oversized, complete waste of life. Tell me why I should still live, besides "potential" that I will never achieve. It will never get better, the future is only pain and blackness. Everyone will get over my death quickly because I don't contribute to anyone's lives and my mom already given up on me. Everyone is asleep so why should I not hang myself right now
