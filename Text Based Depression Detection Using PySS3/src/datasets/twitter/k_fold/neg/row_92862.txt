I've made my mind upYeah I've been posting on this thread for a little while. Everyone is always trying to tell me to stay strong and that things are only temporary.... but they aren't temporary. I do appreciate the kind strangers that are on here, just trying to help, but i cant be helped. A person like me lacks the ability to be helped. So I appreciate it, But i've been thinking a lot today and I made up my mind. I'm going to finish writing my letter tonight and say my goodbyes and such. I don't want this to seem selfish or anything, I've tried to be happy, I really did... I just think certain people are put on the earth to be just that. Not happy. Although I have no idea why that is, Its how i realized life is.
