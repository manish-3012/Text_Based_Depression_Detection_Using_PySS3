Why bother?I've been feeling low for a long time, and now I've just had enough of it. I'm lonely. I only have my dog. I moved hundreds of miles away from the rest of my family to live close to my brother, but now he's got a wife and a baby - he doesn't have time for me. He doesn't need me. I took a week off work for my mental health, and hoped that I'd get to spend time with him. Nope. He had better things to do. I only saw him for 5 minutes to drop off a plant and that was it.

I'm just a spare part. I'm lonely. I'm fading and slowly giving up. I don't know if it's good or bad that the only thing I have to hand is herbal medicine and that won't do much harm (I know - I Googled it). But I just don't want to be here anymore. I'm back at work tomorrow, and I just don't want to. 

There's no point. I spent so long at Uni studying. Now I'm working in a grocery store stacking shelves. I can't even fucking do that right because I'm "under review". I want off. Please ... I just want it to end.
