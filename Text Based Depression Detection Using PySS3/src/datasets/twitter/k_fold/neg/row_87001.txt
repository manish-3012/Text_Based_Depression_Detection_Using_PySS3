Am i sabotaging my life..I just want it all to end, I am the person that arrives and everyone just glares at. My mere existence makes people sick and its all too much. I have a wonderful family, wonderful girlfriend... but i keep screwing up and letting them all down. I know they all hate me i know im no better than a pile of shit. I just have it all bottled up because everytime i try and speak out im faded out by someone or something else. Its better if i just disappear just cease to exist. No one will miss me, i always picture it where no one will miss me and all will continue as if nothing and that gives me some sense of relief knowing that i wont cause anyone pain with my disappearance everyone will just be happy i will no longer be a burden to anyone, my parents, my brothers, my girlfriend... theyâ€™ll all be ok.  Everyone steps on me and well i am just tired of it...
