Do you ever feel like you're just delaying the inevitable? Like it's a when and not an if.The way I've fought with this for so many years and made literally no progress whatsoever shows this isn't gonna be fixed. I'm either gonna have to numb the pain forever however that might be or go before it gets worse. Everybody dies eventually and we don't usually know how it happens but I feel like I do. To be honest anytime I've come close but haven't done it I've regretted not doing it. I've never thought how glad I was that I didn't end it whenever, because it's been more or the same or more likely worse since then. It makes me think someday I actually will, and it'll only be more pain leading up to that. I kinda feel like there's no point to anything if I see this as the end sooner or later anyway.
