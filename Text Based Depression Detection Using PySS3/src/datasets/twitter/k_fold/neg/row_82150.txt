a poemi have felt the kiss of death

 what a pleasant release it was peace  

my problem comes from being worn down  

you could say i am  an old pair of shoes

see people walk all over me  use and abuse me too

 some people don't understand 

yet i have romanced with death and  have had a long day 

i earn for her to come kiss me good night and tuck me away 

i know she is not coming to day  or  tomorrow 

i  still have too much to do

 i have friends to talk to and yet no family 

but my friends are there to help me

now when she comes to kiss me tonight 

i need to tell her i must fight 

for i have people that care 

some how i am attracted to her pretty hair 

now i stair with a gaze

 every thing goes into a haze

no not today i have told you i can not

 i love your peace and how i will fell but tonight is not the night

so tonight i go out with my friends  to blaze

and forget the haze 

that awaits us all till death do we  reunite

ps i have died i know how it fells and this is how i fell i think i can only express these felling in poetry form with out

being an out cast for romanticizing it ama idk at this point
