i hate that i'm actually considering iti just want it all to be over yknow? i just know I have no future. theres nothing for me and im so tired of feeling like this. I'm trying so hard to not tell anyone or show it but I think im finally getting the confidence to do it. i have almost no energy to even move recently but the second I get enough energy I'm done.
