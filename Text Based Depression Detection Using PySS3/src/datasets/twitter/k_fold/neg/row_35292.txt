Getting kind of desperateI'm 24 and have never had a real job. I know, the first thing that comes to mind is that I'm a loser, a slacker and that I'm not trying hard enough. I feel that way about myself, but I really don't know what I'm doing wrong. I left university at 22 with a bachelors degree in Psych, and for the past almost 2 years I've been applying to jobs, especially ones that don't even require a university degree just for the sake of trying to have a job, any job. At best I receive a letter of rejection, at worst I don't hear anything back. With each rejection letter I get more and more demotivated and dejected. And depressed.

I know the guidelines for r/suicidewatch say not to dispense "tough love" advice but I think I really need any help at all as to what I'm doing wrong. The sense of helplessness and the hopelessness after 2 years of unemployment is really getting to me. I feel like a burden on my family and I don't feel like I have any purpose or anything to live for. I avoid my friends or any social contact with anyone because I'm ashamed of having to answer the inevitable questions about what I'm doing with my life. I just sit in my room all day, every day, dependent on the internet to distract me from how miserable and useless I am. But then there are days where it hits me how my life is going nowhere and I'm essentially a parasite.
