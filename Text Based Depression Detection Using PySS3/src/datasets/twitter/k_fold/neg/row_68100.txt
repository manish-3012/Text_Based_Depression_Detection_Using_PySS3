Another Pathetic EntryI post bc I have no one. I feel like a disgusting monster. A man of no moral or worth. A sickness....a burden. I place my head down bc looking up and being apart of society is useless. My mere existence is contrary to societyâ€™s development. I have hid my desires of the same sex for too long. I have been told of the fire and brimstone waiting for me on the other side and at this point, iâ€™m done living in agony and anxiety. Iâ€™m fed up with being a loser and a lost soul itching for someone to love me. Iâ€™m now a shell of skin and blood. I feel like nothing. A smile here and there but nothing more. Iâ€™m so empty and sad. Iâ€™m scared to die but I feel so trapped in this world. My desire is detestable not only to the one above but the ones around. Once my family knows, I will be next dayâ€™s trash on the curb. I am sick and undesirable. Iâ€™m disgusted with myself and feel itâ€™s my duty to rid the world of my existence but am too scared to carry it out. I guess iâ€™ll just stick posting here as a public diary of sorts. Iâ€™m sorry to myself for being such a sick individual. Iâ€™m repulsed by myself and assume the rest of the world is, as well. I canâ€™t hide anymore and I wonâ€™t marry a woman in hopes of acceptance. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to kill myself but canâ€™t help uttering the opposite every day of my life. Goodbye. Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m so sad. I thought I would be important......I guess all kids do, right?
