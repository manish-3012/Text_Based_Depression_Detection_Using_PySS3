Every advice is useless and the same thing, so whats the fucking pointI have so many problems i couldnt list them all here. But im really jealus about people thats got something going on in thier lifes, I shut my self away from the world a few months back and I mainly only talk to 1 friend since im an idiot. Enoth about that, I have been trying all my life to be good at something, anything really. nothing works and i suck. so I tryed really hard to do something with my dreams. and i can say it doesnt matter whenever im singing building stuff or createing a game all the way to drawing. nothing is ever gonna happen. its all the same and i feel like its worthless, I just can't see my self ever haveing a bright future and its been bringing my self to alcohol problems.
