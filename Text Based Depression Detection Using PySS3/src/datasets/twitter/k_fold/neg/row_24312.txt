I don't know how long I can go onHey lovely people

I don't know how to keep going.  Everything seems so meaningless and I feel like a constant disappointment.  I'm nonbinary and my parents are pretty shitty about it, my best friend died over the summer, and I feel like I just can't go on like this.  It doesn't really help that he was the only one who I really talked to, and now I can't.  I don't know.  I just want to end it, but I don't want to hurt anyone.  Any suggestions?
