I have HIV and am gay and want to die because of itIt was extremely unfortunate to be born in the age of AIDS and be gay. A disease that ravages and destroys my body, less I pay ungodly amounts of money to pay for the medicine and deal with the rude, greedy doctors, is my future. Surely there could be no worse fate. I am 22 now and enjoy have sex with other men. I suppose someday many years from now young gay males will speak of AIDS as something they're glad they don't have to deal with, I was not that fortunate. Suicide makes sense.
