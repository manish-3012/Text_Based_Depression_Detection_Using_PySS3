Should i let friends talk down on me?So my friends and some people at school always talks down on me even tho i don't really care if they do so and is this normal for me to not care? in my 17 years of life in this world the negative outweigh the positive feeling and it fucked me up really bad im not the person i used to be before,the past me was so energetic,happier and could make a real smile not a fake one but the present me is so fcked that i let people talk down on me as if i don't have feelings.The only feelings i feel everyday is sadness,boredom,emptiness and low self esteem.
Oh and the postive feeling that i feel everyday is love for the girl i love from the bottom of my heart if i could i would go to where she is now but that would mean to disappear from this world.I wish i could go to where she is if there was a chance i would gladly disappear from this good for nothing world and be with her If there is an afterlife but the chance will only come when i'll die of old age or getting serious ill or if lucky dying in a accident. Maybe some of you guys are asking why not commit suicide that is because i don't want to hurt my family if i didn't have a family then i wouldn't write this on reddit and finally be with the girl i love or go to hell if there is one. So i am stuck in a loophole and that means i only have to wait and suffer and hope that i will be able to meet her again. In this world a men can only hope or dream this is the only thing keeping me going.But not the hope that it will get better the thing is even 
tho sometimes it will get better but most of the times nothing will get better.Sorry for writing so much i just got carried away because i can finally say the truth about me and how i feel.I know that some of you guys are going to say your pain is nothing or you are a pussy get over it and fcking kill yourself or go search for other girls because they are all the same.
If there was another girl like her.I think i wouldn't have this problem but the problem is she is the only one i can love from the bottom of my heart.Thank you so much for taking the day and time to read my post
