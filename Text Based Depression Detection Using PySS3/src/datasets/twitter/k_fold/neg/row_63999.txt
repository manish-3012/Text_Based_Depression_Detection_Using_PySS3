I don't belong here.That I don't belong here. I suck at my job. Someone just made sure to make a fool of me in front of everyone in the office. The only person I love in my 23 years of existence doesn't like me anymore. I have no dreams. I have no talent or skill. I am extremely insecure. I've lost touch of most of my friends from the past. I know I will lose all my friends I have now. My family is poor and is expecting more money from me soon.

What point is there to being alive?
