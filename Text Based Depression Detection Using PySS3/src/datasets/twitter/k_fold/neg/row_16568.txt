I'm just doneEverday its like a empty lake slowly filling up inside my head. These past 2 months what little intrests and hobbies I had are just not there. Can't even do a simope fucking sketch without wanting to snap my fingers. God I wish id just die instead if slowly feeling my body and mind degrade. There is no reason in even trying to get better at this point, and even if there was, there was never anything worth trying to preserve anyway.
