I donâ€™t have any real friendsever since my girlfriend left me i realized that all my friends are just people I play video games with. none of them are really there for me. every day they go out and do stuff but iâ€™m never invited. none of them check in on me even though they know how much i struggle. and my mental health never comes up organically in conversation and when i do bring it up everyone just gets quiet and it just makes things awkward. they donâ€™t make time for me if its even the slightest inconvenience to spend time with me they wonâ€™t and theyâ€™ll spend hours before responding to me in the middle of a conversation about why iâ€™m suicidal
