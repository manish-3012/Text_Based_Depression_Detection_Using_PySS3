Thought about my suicide noteI want to kill myself. Obviously. The idiots at my school telling me I'm faking when their IQs are lower than my fucking sense of humor aren't helping. I've been dealing with depression for 3 years, since I was 10. No real catalyst, just started. Back to the point, I'd tell my family that it wasn't their fault, I'd tell my friends to not think about it and move on, I'd tell those assholes to get some brains and stop being jack-asses, I'd tell my teachers they did a good job and ask them to read the note completely uncensored to the class. Sure, it may seem low to subject them to it, but they should know why. The way I'll do it is a helium tank attached to a mask. Painless and simple.
