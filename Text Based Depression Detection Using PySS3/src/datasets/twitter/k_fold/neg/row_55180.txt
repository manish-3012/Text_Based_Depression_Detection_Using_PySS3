So the OD didnt workSo instead I'll be using a handgun I bought and is on the way. Itll be sometime to go through the process and everyday is l get so uncomfortable being in my skin. I just want it to be over so badly. I feel so sick because I just want to stay in bed all day and sleep but I cant because of my job. I'll be putting in all my leave and fingers crossed that I'll be getting the gun in time. I truly hate being alive. It's hard to put into words how sick it makes me feel to be alive when I know it's my time to go.
