Depressed. Autistic. Also has a toxic personality.I relapsed. My best friend is doing his to help me and I appreciate it but there's also a part of me that does not believe he cares. I don't think he deserves the treatment I'm giving him. I fail to see sometimes that I'm hurting him when I push him away. Or at least that's what he told me. But if ever he really does care, I just want to save him from the monster that I will become. I also don't want him to be there when everything becomes too dark for me to consider moving forward.
