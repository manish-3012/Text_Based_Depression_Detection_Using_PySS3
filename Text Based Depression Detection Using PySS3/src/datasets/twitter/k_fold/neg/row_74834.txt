And I'm back.I have posted here multiple times before. I just need to tell someone.

This is my 5th year of working a low pay, terrible job. Yeah, some might say I am lucky to have a job, but when it is eating away at you it isn't good. I had a job from when I was 16 to now. I recently quit my first one and got a new one this summer. The first job that I had for 4 years was a food job. Subway/DQ. Summers I was working almost every day about 45-60 hours a week. I got "promoted" and was suppose to get paid more, but they never did. They messed up my W2 form, they messed up paychecks, paychecks bounced. 4 years of this.

I don't have many friends because of this. I never had a summer once I turned 16. I was always working. I don't get along with anyone. People just see me as no one, someone "scary" since I listen to Metal music and like horror movies. The only person I have is my girl friend. The only reason I haven't killed myself is her. I have attempted a good dozen times. I just can't take any of this anymore.

I have been to therapy, been to a counselor, posted on here, tried different types of medications, everything. I barely have any emotions. I am always depressed. I have been for such a long time. Sitting in bed when I was in 5th grade thinking of killing myself. Since I was 11 i have had thoughts of killing myself. 

I want to get help so badly but nothing works for me. People will say to keep on looking, but with how many things I have tried, I have just given up. I really can't do any of this anymore.
