I fucking hate people. To my core.

Struggling with suicidal thoughts is a bitch. Struggling with my dislike/hate for people too is even harder. Why bother when people are so incredibly selfish/greedy/evil? I fucking hate how inconsiderate people are and the little things add up to a lot. Maybe they're just oblivious, but I still hate them for it.


If I could, I would cause the human race to become extinct. Humans are cruel animals that think they are above everything else. 


I don't see how someone like me can get past wanting to die. I hate myself and I don't like people. What's the point in living?
