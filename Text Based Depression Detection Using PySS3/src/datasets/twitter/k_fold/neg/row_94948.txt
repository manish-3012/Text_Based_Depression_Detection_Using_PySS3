Fuck this kind of shitty,entropic and chaos driven realityLife is shit. You work for spare change, develope health problems while working on top of the ones you already have. Living is mental torture, everything is so pointless in the grand scheme of things. 

I don't want to continue this ride. I have the right to die and I am denied that at least let me buy a gun so I can do it myself. I am not asking anyone else to pull the trigger, but nooo... You have to go to the psychologist to tell you that you need to reframe your outlook. Reframe what my chronic pain, that anything I pick up with my left arm without shaking the thing I carry with it like I have Parkinson's disease... To be drugged up with meds that the all-knowing psychiatrists. The hell they are, they are playing a lottery with the stuff they give you. They only have a vague idea of how they work or none at all. Side-effects are there, but hey you are alive, we know best, so STFU.

You know how the rest of the medicine works too, they remove the cause of the like in the case of cancer for example and hope the body will heal itself. 

And for anyone else suffering from similar things, it's okay, you can be selfish. They are selfish for wanting to keep us here and continue our misery.
