I wish everyday to stop breathing.I'm tired. I don't want to fight anymore. I'm tired of PTSD waking me up every night making me check to see if mom is raping me again. I'm tired of having a professional license which I know is completely worthless. Worse, I hate it when I get completed for my attorney skills doing Pro Bono work in court because I know it's just evidence I have the talent but it'll never be realized. I'm tired of hearing a male voice when I speak and seeing a face deformed by testosterone. I'm tired of knowing I'll never get pregnant because I was born a boy. I wish I could mother a child so bad.

There's no point to this life. I hate the memories. I hate the daily reminders. I'm just waiting for the day I feel safe enough to end it all. Safe enough that everyone will be sad but understand there truly was no hope for me and my death was for the best.
