Things I've always wanted...The things i want are not things...i dont want a big house, or a fancy car, i dont want to get my nails done or have a LV purse, i dont need brand name clothes or invites to any vip...

Here are things I've always wanted... a list of insignificant things.

To feel completely secure with who i am.

To be myself without any reserve.

To love without being scared.

To trust without being anxious.

To be enough.

To help people and be of any significance to anyone around me.

To not feel so small.

To not be needy.

To be honest with how i feel without fear of rejection. 

To be heard.

To be thought of.

To be worth an effort.

To be loved.

On my bad days, i believe with all my heart i dont deserve or will ever have these.

So those days i want to give up. 

I want to stop pretending I'm in anyway strong. 

I want to disappear.
