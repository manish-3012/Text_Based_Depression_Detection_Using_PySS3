Addicted to alcohol, can't stop drinking, family woes make me miserable, nobody trusts me anymore, I'm called wicked and evil so I should goSo I'm addicted to drinking alcohol. I don't think I can live without it. Especially when everyone around me is a heavy drinker and refuses to get rid of it for good. I've been called out by family far too many times for lying about my drinking habits and now nobody trusts me. Everyone here hates liars to the point of considering them spawn of Satan. I don't make enough to move out. Everything is making me miserable. I want out of life so bad I can't think of anything but death.
