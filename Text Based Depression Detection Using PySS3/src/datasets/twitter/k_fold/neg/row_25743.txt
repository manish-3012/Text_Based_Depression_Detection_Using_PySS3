I don't think I'd ever do it, but the thoughts alone are so painfulI have been dealing with a lot of loss recently. My mom passed away this past summer, my best friend moved very far away, and my dad and I don't get along because of my, as of 3 days ago, ex girlfriend. 

I spent all my time with my girlfriend and best friend/roommate. Probably 99% of my time with them, really. My roommate moved out last weekend, and my girlfriend (somewhat out of nowhere) ended it with me this weekend. 

I got in a huge fight with my dad about her the night before we broke up, Thursday, and some things were said and we haven't spoken since. I don't think I can bring myself to tell him that my girlfriend and I are done for many reasons. 

I'm just so lonely right now. The thoughts keep getting worse. It'd be so easy to do. I don't think I'd ever do it but the thoughts scare me - they keep me up at night. I'm in a hole and life keeps tossing shit at me, and I'm losing the motivation to climb out.
