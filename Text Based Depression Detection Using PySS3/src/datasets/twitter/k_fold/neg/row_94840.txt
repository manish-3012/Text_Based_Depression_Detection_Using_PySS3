Itâ€™s my faultEverything is my fault. I screw up everything and I canâ€™t live with the mistakes that Iâ€™ve made. I make everything worse, I always do. Iâ€™m my own worst enemy. Things would have worked if I wasnâ€™t such a fuck up. Itâ€™s my fault, everything is my fault. I wasnâ€™t supposed to be born anyways so I shouldnâ€™t be alive. But I canâ€™t end it, not right now, so I have to suffer for longer. I hate myself so much.
