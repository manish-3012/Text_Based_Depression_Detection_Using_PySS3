Things only get worse.Things only get worse. Sometimes, I get confused; it seems like things are starting to get better, but that confusion is caused by the fact that things are actually getting worse.

Things only get worse. The more effort I put in, the more faith I have in hard work, in taking risks, in putting oneself out there and, the more I ruin myself.

I am almost positive my life is about to implode; it's about to get so horrible, so fast, but that makes sense. Things never stay the same so of course in lieu of positive growth there is decay.

I don't want to die. I feel like a person held at gun point begging for their life, but the only one who will take it is me. It's just, there is nothing here, just embarrassment, shame, frustration, failure, humiliation, dread, pain, and schadenfreude at my expense.

Nothing I ever did was right, nothing I am doing is right, nothing I can find, no information I can gleam, no experience I can attempt to have, nothing was correct, it was all wrong.

I am wrong. I am all wrong. I don't fit in, and fitting in is important. I have no power, I have nothing, I can't talk because I hate myself and this world, I can only lie, but people know I lie, they don't know why, but they can tell. They can tell I am putting on an act, I am, but only because I feel nothing but dread and shame. Because I am the perfect example of how to fail, an airplane stalling for seemingly no reason at all, but somehow all the reasons at once, a bit of everything. If they knew how I felt, why I am who I am, they would never talk to me at all. Sometimes, I can even convince myself, but at those moments others are best at getting me back to where I need to be, the gutter, who I am and who I will always be.

I am just scared, I am scared because it's death or pain. Death or pain. Death or pain. Do you see? There is only misery. For me, anyway, because the runt of the litter can't do shit, it gets pruned from the pack in all of nature's beautiful wrathful glory, death without a care.
