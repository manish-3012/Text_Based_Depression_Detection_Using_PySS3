The only optionIve held out for it to get better, ive tried meds, ive tried to be happy, its all impossible and will never work. I have been stuck on the top floor of burning building for years. The fire has finally cornered me, I can burn alive for the rest of my short time here on earth or i can go my own. No one would be upset if i was really on a burning building and choose to jump, but i am just not physically. The fire is my mind, i cant get away, i cant get a break from it. The truth is i know im a terrible person. I know i dont deserve to live anymore. Ive had depression for years, Last year i tried to take a bottle of pills but i puked them up. I didnt tell anyone i actually tried to take my own life. I just told them i had depression but no one cared. Now im back at college for my 5th year. Im going to fail, im letting everyone down. My family told me if i messed up my grades im out of the family. My family is the only people that i feel happy with. They are the only thing ive seen that makes me want to go on. I know they love me. They just want whats best, they wouldnt kick me out of the family, i just cant see their faces when they know ive failed. I cant face that. there is no way i can pass. My life outside of school is none exsitant .  Im not here trying to say how i want to die. I dont want to die, i want to live, i want to feel the wind, see the sun, but being alive isnt an option. I know i have to die. I know its the only way i can get out of the hole ive dug for myself. I guess i just wanted to write some of this down so hopefully out there when im gone one person in the world wont be angry at me, but rather say he couldnt handle the fire anymore. He was up on that building trying to get away from the fire from so long, that i was a good man not a coward.
