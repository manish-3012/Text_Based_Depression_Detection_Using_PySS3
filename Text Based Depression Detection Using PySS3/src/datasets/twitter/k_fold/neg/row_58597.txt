Live with too many people, there's always too much noise, always being interrupted.There almost always seem to be no point in even trying to write. My creativity was sapped by depression over the years and it's almost always hard to try to utilize what little of it I do have. 

At this point I think I shouldn't even try to finish something and get this shit over with. It's not like I have any chance of making anything out of it anyway.
