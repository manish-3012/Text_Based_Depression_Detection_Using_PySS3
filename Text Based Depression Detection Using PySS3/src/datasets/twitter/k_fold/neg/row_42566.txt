I'm not sure what to do, and I'm faced with a choice.Hello,

First off, I'm transgender. I just fully came out to my mother. It was a really scary experience and I know I'm supported, but I'm afraid that I'll make everyone miserable in the longrun. I know that I have family that would resent me, and I'm worried that they'll feel the same about my parents.

I don't know if these few days will be my last, as I don't want to see others-- including my family in that kind of pain. I sound like all I want is attention right now, but I just need help right now, sorry. 

Thank you.

EDIT: If I didn't make it clear enough, the choice is to either: Live and have my family and I suffer the hatred, or kill myself and have those around me be upset.
