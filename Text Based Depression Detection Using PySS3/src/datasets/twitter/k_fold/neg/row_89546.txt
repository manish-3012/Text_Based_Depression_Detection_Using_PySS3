I don't want to die.But I want to live even less...

I'm 16 years old and about four months ago, I was happily going about life in an optimistic fashion; lots of hopes and dreams and ideas. I really enjoyed life. Now I want to die.

One day, I noticed an unusual feeling in the back of my head and was having a little bit more trouble remembering things. I didn't think much of it, though, and kept living my life assuming I was just under a lot of stress from finals. But even when summer came, it never went away. A month and a half later, I was in my final week of summer camp having a blast, when all of the sudden the feeling got so much worse and started switching sides. I also noticed that I was having a lot of trouble thinking/remembering/speaking to people. It was like I was in a brain fog.

Of course I was worried, so I went home and started going to doctors. Fast forward to 3 months and 80 zillion doctors later: I still don't know what the fuck is wrong with me. I walk through everyday lost and confused and barely able to hold onto my own thoughts and forget having a meaningful conversation. 

Life just isn't worth living anymore. Everyday is like torture and the only reason I'm even alive right now is because I'm holding on to a small piece of hope that maybe I'll return to my old self. I'm not very hopeful though, and I'm not really sure why I'm posting here. I really don't want to die, I want to live a fulfilling life. Ugh...

EDIT: Just got results back from neuropsychologist and there genuinely is something wrong with me. While this sucks I'm glad that I finally feel validated. Maybe the neurologists that all diagnosed me with anxiety will finally believe me that something's wrong. Still holding on, but still feeling suicidal... :(
