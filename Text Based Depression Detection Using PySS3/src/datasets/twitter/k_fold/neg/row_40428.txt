Took a lot more of my meds than I was supposed to, can I rant until it kicks inMy mom just figured out I overdosed from how there's no more meds left and she and my dad just said that they're used to this and that they'll take me to the doctor tomorrow if it gets worse. I mean, I'm not looking for attention, even if I seem a bit attention seeking rn. Posting it here rn seems attention seeking too ig

Idk, I just feel hurt. I don't like how I'm living, my parents don't like anything I do and I can't ever reach their expectations and they keep me at home and they hurt me physically and they say the worst things. It doesn't help that I don't have many friends either and I kind of made someone who cared about me and was all that I cared about run away because I was being stupid.

They've decided my life for me, now. The last time I committed, I don't think anyone knew except for a friend and he didn't really care. And my parents told me how they expect me to make them proud and achieve their dreams which are nothing that I want. The person that cared doesn't anymore. I guess it's just to say that my parents don't need me unless I'll fulfill their dreams for me and I don't have people that care. So if I'm living life for myself, I don't want to live.

Thanks for listening, my head really fucking hurts and my stomach feels weird and I feel out of it and my ears are feeling weird.
