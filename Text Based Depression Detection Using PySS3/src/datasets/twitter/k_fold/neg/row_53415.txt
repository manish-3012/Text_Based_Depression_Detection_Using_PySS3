my best friend just tried to hang themself.i just came for the advice about what i can do.
i am also suicidal, so i know what it's like, and i do already give them that best friend stuff like caring, listening to them, etc.
i try my best to help them however i can. but looks like i am the worst best friend that ever existed, because they told about that attempt several days later, when they got drunk, in a group.
i don't know what to do. the only thing that i am myself still alive for is them. i love them very much, and i will do everything to help them. but maybe i am not doing enough, so yeah. i need advice.
