Confusing 'end it all' planAs someone who has suffered with severe death/health anxiety since 16 (23 now), my family and friends are aware I'm on medication and having CBT to help these thoughts. 

The bigger problem though, despite these fears, I still get incredibly suicidal and can be very impulsive in acting on it. I was sectioned and put on a ward at 20 after an attempt, with all staff very confused to then check my health/treatment history and find out that I was assumed to be very low-risk. 

Recently I've been having these suicidal thoughts for a few months and feel increasingly tempted. 

I find people are extremely confused that I can be suicidal but also terrified of death, it feels almost impossible to find some kind of help or way out.

It seems like there's no other way but to end it. I'm miserable. Nothing makes me happy anymore and everything is a struggle. This week I hope to have a plan to get it done this month.
