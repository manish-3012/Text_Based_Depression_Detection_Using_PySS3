Canâ€™t stop thinking about ending itIâ€™m fucking sad. I told my mom about how things are weighing on me, and she said, â€œIâ€™m sorry things are weighing on YOU!â€ in the meanest tone ever. Yeah, and this is my cry for help. Nobody cares about me in my personal life. Iâ€™m fucked up and donâ€™t want to live. It never gets better, either.
