It feels like my parents really donâ€™t give a shit about meI got into a pretty bad argument with my mom over some dumb shit and ended having a meltdown where I said I hate my life and donâ€™t want to live anymore because this family is driving me insane.  
Not only that but she even said I need to quit saying my bull shit and stop pretending to be the victim, my dad tried to calm me but all he knows to say is just â€œcalm down and go let off some steamâ€, Iâ€™m getting extremely tired of even living with these people and having to put up with the constant arguments and screaming, although my mom is not a terrible person she can be a huge bitch and it pisses me off. 

I just donâ€™t know how much more I can put up with this, Iâ€™m going to try my hardest to move out sometime this year and take a long break from my stupid family that literally doesnâ€™t believe me when I say that Iâ€™m constantly miserable and in pain.
