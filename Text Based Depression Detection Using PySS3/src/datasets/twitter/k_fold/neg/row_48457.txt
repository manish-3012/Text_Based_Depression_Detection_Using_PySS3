I'm really thinking about itI just don't feel good. I want it to end. I don't want to exist anymore.

The only thing stopping me is that my parents and sister and extended family would suffer a lot and I don't want that.

I just want to stop existing. This is the first time I thought about actually doing it. Every other time I've wanted to go to sleep and now wake up, but now I actually thought of ideas. I'm scared.
