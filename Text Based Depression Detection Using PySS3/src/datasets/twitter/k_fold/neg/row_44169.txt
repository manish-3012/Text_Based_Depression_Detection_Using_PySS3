not sure how far depression can justify my fuck-upsi'm gonna be 20 in a few months and have no plans for my life. I have no interests and no energy and can't get off bed much without feeling like i've been awake for 40 days and emotionally drained. I've been wasting away in my room for about three years now. I dropped my therapist bc I can't get out of my house so often (once a week). I have no reason to be this way and my family is just sure and vocal about how I just lack character and am a generally shitty person, and I'm inclined to agree.

I don't see the point to keep struggling. What is there to it when you've been spiraling out of control since you're 14 and if left alive, will just continue to be a unhelpful, miserable 30, 40, 50yo who hates their lives? Why should I stay for this?

I'm too childish, untalented and stupid to be 20. After almost 6 years of this I know I'm just setting myself up for failure and pain if I stay alive past that.
