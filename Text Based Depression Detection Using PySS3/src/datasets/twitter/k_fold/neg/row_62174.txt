What's the point in living when the only thing I think about is how much I want to die?I've felt like killing myself every day since about 6th grade. I haven't had a friend in many years. I'm going to be 20 in a few weeks, have no education, no job. I was diagnosed with bipolar type 2. Even when I was going to see a psychiatrist and was on medication, the people I loved so much as my friends just put up with me. They never wanted me around, but they were too kind to tell me to get lost. Eventually we just went our seperate ways. I miss them, but I don't blame them for not wanting me around. I don't really want me around either.

It just hurts me every day that I'm such a burden to my family and old friends. If they had just told me sooner that they didn't want me around, I would have understood and saved them the years of pretending. I don't really feel like there's a place in the world for me. There hasn't ever been, and if the future is anything like the past 10 years there won't be. I genuinely hate myself for hurting other people so much.. I just wish I hadn't failed at killing myself when I was 14 so that maybe my old friends would have cared. Honestly if I died now, I doubt any of them would give it a second thought.

sorry, just had to vent a little bit until the next time I feel this way.
