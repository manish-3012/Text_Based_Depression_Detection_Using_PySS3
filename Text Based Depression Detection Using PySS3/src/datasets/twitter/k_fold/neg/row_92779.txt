I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to anymoreMy boyfriend said I was being too negative, and I donâ€™t want to be annoying. I have no friends, they are all fair weather. Work is pushing me to my breaking point, and I am never going to amount to anything. I want to end it so badly, but the funeral costs would be too much for my family. They probably couldnâ€™t afford someone to clean up after me either. I hope it will get better, because it is so hard to be alone.
