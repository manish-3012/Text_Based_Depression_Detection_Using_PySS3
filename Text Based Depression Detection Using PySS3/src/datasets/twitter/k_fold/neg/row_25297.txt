Iâ€™m just sitting here all lonely, thinking about killing myself. Hi everyone,

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s the good place for this. English is not the first language I learned, there will definitely be mistakes. 

Tonight is a really rough night. Last Wednesday night I was ready to kill myself, but I passed out drunk before finding how I will do it. Tonight Iâ€™m ready once again. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening with me. Iâ€™m tired all the time, but I canâ€™t sleep. Itâ€™s really hard to start my day, I need a lot of strength. I cry all the time. I writing this post on Reddit tonight because nobody knows about how I feel and I want to keep it secret for the moment. I donâ€™t want to put my family in constant fear of having someone suicidal close to them. I once was happy, a couple of years agoâ€¦ There is a voice inside my head telling me that I can be happy again, but the voice is more and more quiet every day. 

A couple of years back, I had a ton of friends. It was easy for me to go out and chill. I dinâ€™t even have to text my friends, it was obvious that we were going the be together. During this time, it was not surprising for me to be with friends 7 nights a week. Years have passed, Iâ€™m way closer to 30 than to 20 years old. I lost most of my friends. Some moved in another city, some bought a house, some had children. They donâ€™t have money and time to go out anymore. I understand that and Iâ€™m not angry about it, but sometimes I really sad because I miss the good old times. Things start changing 3 years ago approximately. Opportunities to go out were already rare 3 years ago, but itâ€™s a this time that I realized itâ€™s hard for me to be lonely. Today Iâ€™m able to go out with a friend about 1 or 2 times a month if Iâ€™m lucky. Iâ€™m not on Instagram, Snapchat and Facebook anymore, it was too hard to see people being happy. I deleted my Instagram when I saw my friends together in a bar close to where I live. They didnâ€™t invite me, they donâ€™t invite me anymore, which sadden me even more. Iâ€™m know Iâ€™m not a cool guy, Iâ€™m not entertaining, Iâ€™m not the one starting the discussion. I tried in the past 3 years to be a better person, a more friendly person. It didnâ€™t work. I tried to do my best to avoid being lonely. The fact that Iâ€™m writing this tonight is the proof that I failed.

I can write about how my job sucks, but I already wrote too much stuff.

Iâ€™m just sitting here all lonely, thinking about killing myself. My face is corroded by tears. My selfish mind is dragging me through hell. My short-circuited brain is a coward. Iâ€™m not in command, Iâ€™m just a passenger of my life. My hands are shacking. My breath is short. 

Why does it have to be like this? How do you go out of this hole? Where am I going? Am I sick or not just a fit in this world? I can see what was wrong. I canâ€™t pretend I was right.

Iâ€™m will do by best to go see psychologist in the following days. I need support for the moment I guess. Iâ€™m not a good person, and deep down inside me I know nothing will save me. Itâ€™s just a matter of time.

Thanks to anyone reading this, you are my last friends. My last chance. My last breath.
