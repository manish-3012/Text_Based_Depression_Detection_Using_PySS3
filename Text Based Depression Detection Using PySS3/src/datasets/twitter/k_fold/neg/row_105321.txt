Just tired of being like this. I don't want this to be my life anymore.**Edit**...Well, not sure what I was expecting to get from this. Apparently, it turned out to be nothing. I guess I'll do some thinking. I really just feel too messed up. Not sure what I am supposed to do. Maybe some people cannot come out of depression and cannot receive help. I don't know.
