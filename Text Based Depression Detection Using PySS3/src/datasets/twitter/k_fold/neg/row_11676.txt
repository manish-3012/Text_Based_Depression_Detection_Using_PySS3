Bad day?Anyone else having a bad day? I have been fighting with my depression for 12 years now. Been medicated for most of them.(Zoloft) Couple of real suicide attempts in the past. (Pills)

I'm having one of those days where I just fantasize about shooting myself all day. Thank god I don't own a gun. LOL maybe that's why it's my fantasy, I don't have the means to pull it off. It just seems like the air has weight and breathing is hard and the world is too bright and life hurts. I want to keep fighting, but I'm so fucking tired. I'm emotionally drained. 

I'm not going to quit. I can't. If nothing else I can't do it to my parents. I don't have anything particularly great to live for but I keep telling myself it beats the alternative. Permanent solution and all that...But it all hurts so fucking much and I'm so tired.

Ok, I will stop being a whiny little bitch now. Just wondering if anyone else is down today.
