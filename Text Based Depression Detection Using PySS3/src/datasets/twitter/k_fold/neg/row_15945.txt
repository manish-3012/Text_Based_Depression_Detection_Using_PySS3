Can't See a Point in ContinuingI am turning twenty this year, and have been fighting depression since I was twelve. I don't see a point in continuing the struggle any longer. 

I've fought fought for a long time, developing good habits to make sure that  I wouldn't become an inconvenience in spite of my lack of grades. However, I couldn't fake relationships like I could fake an interest in work. I don't feel close to anyone. I have tried talking to mental health professionals and friends alike, but those interactions were either ineffectual or drove people away. I feel as though any relationship I have cultivated has been characterized almost entirely by my attempts to fight past my depression.

Honestly, I don't know what else to do. I've lost my resolve to get myself through life any longer.
