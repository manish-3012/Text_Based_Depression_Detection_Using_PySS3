A day late and a dollar shortWell... If I can't come up with 900 bucks within the next week, I'm on the streets. I lost my job a couple months ago and have been living off of plamsa donations, and pawn shops. I've lost everything. I literally just have a bed (mattresses), my cell phone (one week left of service), and a few more packs of ramen. 

The good news is that if I can make it to August 1st,  I will have a place to live and a job in another state. But can I make it that long? I have zero sources of income right now and no more 401k assets. I'm broke. And so is my soul and well being. I didn't get unemployment approved and my appeal hearing is not until August. I haven't been able to get a job anywhere. Not even at the local gas stations and Walmart. I have no more money for gas to even get me to interviews and after my cell is shut off, no more correspondence. I'm fucked. 

With nothing left, I feel my only option is suicide. Another case where a financial situation forces one to take their life. Sucks. I never thought I'd be this close to it, but here we are. A day late and a dollar short. I just needed one more month. One more fuckin month and I'd have been ok.

I imagine starving is painful. So I may as well just do this on my own terms. I hate this. I don't even know why I'm posting this.
