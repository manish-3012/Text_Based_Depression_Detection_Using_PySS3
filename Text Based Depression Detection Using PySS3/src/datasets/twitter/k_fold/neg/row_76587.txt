17 and doneI don't even know where to start. Life just hasn't been normal for me since I was about six.

My brother tried to kill my mother 11 years ago, and was diagnosed with schizophrenia. He's been on and off his meds ever since, and has had an episode that has ended up hospitalizing him annually, almost like clockwork.

My father passed away seven years ago, and that was one of the most crushing blows to me since him and I were so close. I still think about him often and visit the cemetery as regularly as I can with my schedule.

Buried in the same row as my father is one of my closest friends, who drowned nearly a year to the day after my father passed away. I suppose you could only imagine my surprise when I found out they were going to be buried so close together. 

From there on out, it's been family members and family friends almost annually. I have struggled with depression ever since my father passing away, and all of this has really taken its toll on me mentally.

I once sought professional help after almost killing myself sophomore year, but it was almost to no avail whatsoever. 

The last string of years has just been failed relationship after another, and then nothing. I've more or less strayed away from most of the friends I had, and am in very limited contact with the few remaining.

I don't know what to do anymore, I don't have much motivation to continue if this just never gets better(which to me, certainly seems like it.) I graduate high school in a matter of weeks, and I'm on the fence about going to college next year. Suicide just seems so easy at this point, and sometimes I am ashamed I'd even consider it, but lately, I've become so indifferent that I feel like it might be my time to go from this misery and constant misfortune.
