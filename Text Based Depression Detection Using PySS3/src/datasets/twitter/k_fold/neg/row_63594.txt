I think i am readyIt's just enough pain for me.....the glass is full and it's overflowing now.

I am getting ready, i am really sorry for every mistake i have made in my life thus far, i am sorry for the pain i have caused to my loved ones, i am sorry that i couldn't live up to everyones expectations.....i am sorry that i am me and that i was born.
