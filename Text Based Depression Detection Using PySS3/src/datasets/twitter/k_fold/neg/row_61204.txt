I keep coming back to feeling suicidalAnd why is that? Well, I do things that make me more suicidal, like smoking too much weed, drinking too much, dulging back into the porn addiction. Eating junk food. I do this because its most fucking real feeling i've ever felt. Wanting to be dead and fucking gone from everybody. Fuck this whole world. Whenever I do productive things daily no matter I still hate life, but like 10-15% less. But I don't like hating life less. I want to fucking hate this dumpster trash world as much as I can.
