I was doing okay and then I got cyberbullied by "jabberwockjess"I joined reddit because I don't have anyone to talk to. I'm desperately lonely and I thought finding empathy would help. But the user "jabberwockjess" has made my life hell and triggered me. I don't have any other way to leave a note but here. Jabberwockjess is a cyberbully and because she is an admin on reddit, she can override blocks. I want her to know that I am going to shoot myself in the head because of her. I am taking my life **because of her.** Because her words have consequences. I don't expect her to ever face any consequences because bullies never do but I wanted everyone who reads this to know who triggered me. Maybe I would've lived another day if she'd left me alone.
