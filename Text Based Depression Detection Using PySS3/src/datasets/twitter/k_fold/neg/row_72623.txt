I am a World-Class Fuck-UpI'm not good at much, anything really. 24, nearly 25, no friends that I still keep in touch with, and no prospects to speak of. I'm in my 7th year of Uni and at risk of failing out completely, this was my last chance.

&amp;#x200B;

I've had every opportunity for success though. Middle class life in Canada, parents help me pay for school and are supportive for the most part, been able to travel a lot for my age. And I have a nice girlfriend. I was born with advantages  across the board... but I fuck things up at every turn. I work hard at summer and part time jobs, but never at school and never for myself.

 

I'm an out of shape, socially inept, academic failure with no talent and no drive. All the things that a future employer doesn't want in an employee. I have mental health issues and I just all around suck. I don't think anyone of sound mind would want to emulate me in any way.

&amp;#x200B;

I also have no desire to do anything with my life that would be considered a smart or profitable career. The only things I enjoy are eating, hiking, and writing stand up comedy (I'm too big of a pussy to get on stage).

The last few weeks I've just wanted to end this suffering. 7 years with depression and anxiety since I was a young kid is enough.

Fuck I feel so suicidal right now.
