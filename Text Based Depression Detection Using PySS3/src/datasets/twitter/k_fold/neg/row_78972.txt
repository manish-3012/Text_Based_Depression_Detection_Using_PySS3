Drinking, crying, realizing I have nothing. Since 7pm I have been laying out on the bathrooom flr of my bf's parents house. After realizing my bf who ive been on and off with since 2003 is a selfish ass prick who has made my life shame filled based on one relationship i had during our off time, while his engagament with prostitutes and even now posts on craigslist to lick pussies and jack offs to girl friends of his on fb are all something I "just dont understand". I'm broke because ive been paying for school that is expensive. I have also been doing poorly there. My family have all turned me away bc I didnt like being abused as a child and have become angry in adulthood. Siblings have picked on me my entire life. In such debt now and I have no home. I think ive cried every day for the past year. Loved the in between guy but he wanted more than I was able to offer at a fragile time. This bf now is very rich and he keeps it to himself. His parents even havea foundation to help ppl who have no money for education, and I'm in $75,000 debt. Im beautiful but have been used for sex and status since I was 16,over 10 years ago. My father has outwardly called me trash and my mother says she sincerely does not care for me. They are both dying now. 
*look to ground*
we'll be dead longer than we'll be alive anyways.
