I just want to matterI donâ€™t matter. I know Iâ€™m not worthy. I know everyone is disappointed in me and no matter how much I try to change. I donâ€™t. Hell, do I even try? No. Iâ€™m just lazy. I donâ€™t even want help I guess. I thought I was so happy recently but I just realize Iâ€™m never going to be. Emotional abuse sucks. Iâ€™m never going to be anything but the person who let him hurt me. I just want to be held and told itâ€™s going to be ok. I canâ€™t stop thinking about him. I stalk his and his current gfâ€™s social media. i feel so bad for doing it. But he made me feel like I need him. But no. I just donâ€™t want to change I guess. Everyone says something is wrong with me and I have the nerve to try to change and think differently for once and it all comes crumbling down because I just wanted some advice to stop checking in on him. I feel so empty yet angry and sad and hurt and lonely. I jsut want to go to sleep and stay there with dog curled up beside me. I want to stay in that moment forever. I know life isnâ€™t worth it but I have tricked myself into believeing it for a second. Iâ€™m so sorry. I know Iâ€™m so dramatic. I wish I could escape this so much. Please just stop reading this because you are wasting your time. I wonâ€™t change I will never change because I really am worthless. I wish someone would just come along and hurt me again and get me to actually kill myself. Iâ€™m so tired of hurting and Iâ€™m so tired of being a burden and hurting others. Iâ€™m just really tired.
