Tried to vent, was told depression was my choice. Now i'm...just lost and I've started planning how to off myself.I vented, to two people  
One being my fiancee and the other a friend.  


my fiancee, probably tired, and also stressed over work among other things. Told me that I just want to be depressed. And that hurt so bad, still does tbh. My friend, as good natured her attempts are. It feels like a contest of suffering with her. And I don't want it.  


Am also seemingly triggering her own desire for death. So now I've learned that I can't vent.   
But I can't not vent at all. So here I am. With a short note, a website to get a body bag and carbon monoxide.   


I live alone so this is really so easy. The question is when.
