I feel deadI guess I've had some sort of depression for the last 7+ months and I developed some small suicidal feelings early on and now I feel even worse.
Only recently did I start feeling horrible.
One girl I knew, she was attracted to me. Problem was, I wasn't attracted to her back.  She was just a really good friend.


Then she started dating one of my friends  recently and I miss her and I hang out with her everyday and I've fallen in love. I talk to her every night but I never say anything about it.

I want to be with her but I don't want to fuck up any sort of relationship especially if she's happy.

I just want to kill myself but I can't because I know there are people who care even if I think they don't. I don't want to waste everything my parents have done for me but if I had the chance to save a life whilst dying in the process I would go for it then.

At least I'd be somewhat fucking useful then.
