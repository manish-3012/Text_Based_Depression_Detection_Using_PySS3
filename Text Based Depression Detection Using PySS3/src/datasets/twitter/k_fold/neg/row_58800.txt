It's getting twisted.Despite my desire to achieve my dream and do something that I always wanted to do, it might not ever happen and I might just bury every idea that I had with me if I kill myself or I might pass my ideas to someone into the right hands, but I am pretty sure they won't even credit me as original creator and take it from me like it was all theirs. Anyways, I don't think it will ever get any better, I am just living to suffer, if I want a change, I should change something by myself, but I can't even afford that change, so I doubt it will ever happen and every day for me gets a little twisted or just passes out without anything new or something exciting.
