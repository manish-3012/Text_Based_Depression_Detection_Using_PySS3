How can I tell my parents Iâ€™m depressed or have suicidal thoughts?itâ€™s hard for me to sit down and have heart to heart serious conversations with them, not because theyâ€™re not understanding but because itâ€™s very uncomfortable for me and I hate the feeling of it. is there any way I can come out to them that isnâ€™t talking face to face?
