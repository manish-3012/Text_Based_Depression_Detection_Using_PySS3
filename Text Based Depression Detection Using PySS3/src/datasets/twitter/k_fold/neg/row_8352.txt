Judgement, or perceived judgement (mental illness)?Anyone else feel like they're always being judged before a word even comes out of their mouth? I realize I'm not attractive or normal looking, but I don't understand why people eye me like I'm about to shoot  the place up any time I'm out in public. I think that I look weird, but not in any malicious sort of way. I always avoid eye contact now though because I hate the way people look back at me (or at least I hate my perception of how people look back at me).  Do you guys think it sounds like I'm autistic, schizo, deluded, insane, or just severely lonely and confused? I'm a bit better about eye contact and communication if I'm being introduced by someone I already know, but I'm still really overly anxious around everyone, to the point that I just never know what to say, making things all the more unbearably awkward lol. I've never been a total social butterfly or master of conversation, but I do remember things coming more easily and stressing me out much less growing up, which makes me think I might have something like schizophrenia (about to turn 21). It's really frustrating because group work and going to class is absolute torture when your mind works this way, but I have no interest in therapy or taking meds since I've already tried both and found them both to be artificial/temporary happiness, with side effects/consequences that outweighed the benefits. Any responses or suggestions are much appreciated
