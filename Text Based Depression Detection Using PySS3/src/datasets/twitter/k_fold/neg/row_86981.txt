I feel like Iâ€™m having less of a reason to live everydayI go to therapy and I have friends and family who care about me, but everyday I feel like more of a fuck up. I ruin a lot of things and itâ€™s hard to love myself when I know what kind of a terrible person I can be and sometimes am. I really want to die a lot and whenever I bring it up I feel like an attention whore. My past relationship with someone was pretty toxic and they told me to kill myself a lot anytime I brought it up, and I do want to kill myself. Anyways this was a fucking long vent but I just wanted to get it out of my system.
