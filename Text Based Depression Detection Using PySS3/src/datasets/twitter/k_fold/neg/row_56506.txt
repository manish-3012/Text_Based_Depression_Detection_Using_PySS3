i did it last again tonight im done...my girlfriend broke up with me for the second time two days ago. i actually was happy last week for once, my school was fun and i was doing well in football. all has changed. my gf meant the world to me and i have been incredibly depressed since. i think im killing myself somewhere in the next week, i cant hold it anymore. ive not been going to classes and ive been fighting with my mom and dad.


last night i actually cut my wrists. its still red and it was bleeding. i dont care anymore. im doing it soon again.


if you care try to convince me im wrong, but i dont think you can.
