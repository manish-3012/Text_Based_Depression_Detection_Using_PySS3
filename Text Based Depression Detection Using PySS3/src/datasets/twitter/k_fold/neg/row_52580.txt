At what point is enough enough?I am terminally [lonely](https://old.reddit.com/r/ForeverAlone). Statistically speaking, more than half of my lifetime is spent, if we assume I am healthy, (and I am not). Every moment feels like drowning, like a nightmare from which it is not possible to wake up.

Anyway, the historical data speak for themselves: after nearly 10000 days of no contact with a potential mate, we can expect day 10001, 10002, ... to end in the same way.
