Life is a dinner party, and I'm ready to leave.I feel like I'm at a never ending dinner party. I have a lot of friends here, at times there will good food, laughs, and the occasional flirt. But I've become numb to all of it, I'm just tired and feel ready to leave.

Sure, life has been pretty kind o me, some hardships but none major compared to what's out there.

I've done fine. Enough to feel that I'm not worthy of the excuse of leaving, and I can't bring myself to do it since I know how much it will hurt the people I know. I told one of my best friends I tried to leave when I was a child, he broke down i tears and said I could never think like that again. He left last year. At that moment I swore not to do it to my loved ones, but the struggle is real.
