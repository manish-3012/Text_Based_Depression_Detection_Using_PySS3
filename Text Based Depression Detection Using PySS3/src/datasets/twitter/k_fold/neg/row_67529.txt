Feeling like you did everything right but it still turns out badly.I've spent a large part of my life not taking risks.  Something was ingrained in me at a young age that made me think every decision was of vital importance so I better not mess up.  So now I'm sitting here at 34 knowing that I need to eventually end it because nothing I've done has added up to anything.

I was getting better for this past year, I really was.  For the first time I actually felt like I was working towards a regular life, of not just wasting everything that was given to me.  Then she tells me we have to be better on our own and reinforcing how absolutely meaningless my actions are.  

Last night I tried to get help and was endlessly amused and frustrated that all the help lines were busy.  I'm trying to talk to friends and family, to let them know how much of a disappoint me I am, but no idea how that will pan out.  Meanwhile when I talk to her I get told "it'll get better" over and over as if she has any sort of insight to my emotions.  

She'll get better.  She a wonderful person who didn't need someone like me holding her down.  I hope by the time I manage to do it that she never finds out, she deserves better than knowing she was my last chance at life.
