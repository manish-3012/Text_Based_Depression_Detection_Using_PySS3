I donâ€™t know where to go.I feel awful. All I think about is how evil I am! I donâ€™t want to be around! I just donâ€™t know where to go! I want to find somewhere that makes me feel like Iâ€™m welcome and like Iâ€™m going to be ok! Finding that place is so tough! Any got any suggestions? With lockdown itâ€™s just so tough...
