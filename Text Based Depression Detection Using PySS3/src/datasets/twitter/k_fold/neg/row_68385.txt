You know what the most fucked up thing is?The fact that your only valued when your happy or positive. Other people don't value you, or want to be around or be your friend when your not. If your feeling down, then bam everything changes, people don't want to be around you. I get it, but fuck its cruel, its so so hard, how we every gunna get better man, how. 

I hope one day we can find happiness.
