Recovery is a life-long struggleRecovery is a life-long enterprise. When I feel good it's amazing. When I feel bad I want to give up. When i feel bad and try to find the strength inside to keep going I remember that recovery is a life-long journey and I want to give up. "It gets easier" they say. But I'm so tired. Exhausted. Even when there are little slivers of hope, maybe if I do this or that things will get better. But the more I keep going the more it all becomes a pipedream.
