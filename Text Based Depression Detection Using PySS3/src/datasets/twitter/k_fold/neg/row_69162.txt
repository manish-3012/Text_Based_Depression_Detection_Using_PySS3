I've determined that I'm missing that part of a person that makes someone happy.I keep searching for all these things that will make me happier but they just don't exist. No matter how good my life might seem, no matter how happy an accomplishment my make me feel for a short while, im just missing the part of me that's meant to be content. It's like being born without a vital organ. Unfortunately they can't screen for what I'm missing in prenatal care, or else I'd be aborted.
