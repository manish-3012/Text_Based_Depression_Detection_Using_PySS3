Life gets worse and worse.I made another post on here months ago about being tired of people telling me â€œit gets better.â€ People still fucking say that to me and guess what. Itâ€™s an empty promise. I finally started to think maybe I could actually figure things out and now Iâ€™ve been laid off. I canâ€™t even file for unemployment because I donâ€™t have WiFi and it keeps timing out on my phone. Normally Iâ€™d go to the library or something but everything is fucking closed. 

I have started getting calls for job interviews and I canâ€™t take them. I have nothing to wear to an interview. I have no money for clothes. What am I supposed to wear if I actually get hired? Plus thereâ€™s the crippling social anxiety on top of all of that. 

Iâ€™m fucking over it
Iâ€™m tired
Iâ€™m not smart enough to be a functioning adult 
I just want to go to sleep and not wake up
