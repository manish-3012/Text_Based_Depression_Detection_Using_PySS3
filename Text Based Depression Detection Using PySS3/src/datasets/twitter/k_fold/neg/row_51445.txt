Anyone else feel anhedonic?I feel pain but no pleasure from life anymore. The pain is almost starting to feel nice because at least I feel something other than dismal sadness. I have a fantastic job, working on my masters degree, Iâ€™ve been eating and meal prepping, doing 30 min daily workouts, going on dates, but thereâ€™s always been this part of me since I was 13 that just didnâ€™t want to live. 

Can anyone else relate to this empty feeling? The hallow shell of existence in an otherwise good life? I canâ€™t help but feel like a cry baby constantly complaining.
