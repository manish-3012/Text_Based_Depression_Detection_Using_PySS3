my cats were my reason to live. now theyâ€™re gone.taking them to the shelter tomorrow because iâ€™m not allowed to have them and thereâ€™s nobody else who can take them in.

taking care of them is the only reason iâ€™m still here. i donâ€™t want to be the one to take them to the shelter or get rid of them, so i think iâ€™m going to try to kill myself again tonight. 

round 8 letâ€™s go, lol  :â€™)
