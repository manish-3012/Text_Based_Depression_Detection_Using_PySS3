Anyone Else Not Want a FuneralWhen I die I don't want a funeral. I don't want a eulogy where someone lies that I was a smart, funny, caring person. I don't want people to feel obligated to "mourn death" (there's nothing to mourn), or "celebrate life" (there's nothing to celebrate).

The worst part is knowing that nobody who attends wants to be there. The few who bother do so reluctantly because they feel obligated. They snicker and the whole thing ends with "what took so long?"

The last thing I want is to be embarrassed after I die.
