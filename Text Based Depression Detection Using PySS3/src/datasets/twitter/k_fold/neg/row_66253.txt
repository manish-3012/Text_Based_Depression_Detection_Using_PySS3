Why does it feel like I'm not cut out for this world?I just feel so out of place here. I'm expected to get great grades in college, create my own projects, internship at companies, while holding down a job I hate to pay the bills, go to the gym to get healthy to lose all this fat on me, eat little which makes me stress out, and maintain my relationship with my girlfriend. Any time that I do spend for myself is extremely wasted because all I do is try to binge watch TV or lay in bed all day hoping to find some bit of relief by sucking the dopamine out of every activity to fill this void of a hole I have in my life. I pray and wish that something in life would come up and give me purpose, but nothing is coming to me. This pressure is so great that I have just folded in and given up on so much. 

Today is my 3rd day calling out of work which is almost a guarantee I'm fired. I did fill out a lot of applications on the days I called out but it scares me because last year I was jobless and it took a while to actually get hired somewhere. I do have some money which should last me a month if I'm careful but I just feel guilty. I'm never happy anymore, it's been years and my crying depression has just turned into numbness and I am becoming depression. I can't imagine how people maintain crappy jobs and whenever I talk with anybody about it they always make me feel like I'm not strong enough to last in a job I don't like. I just feel trapped and I am depressed as hell and scared. I thought about suicide earlier after calling off work, but I don't think I would ever do that. I just need help. Sorry I'm just posting my thoughts in no particular order.
