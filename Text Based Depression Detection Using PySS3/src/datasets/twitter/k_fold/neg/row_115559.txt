If you are reading this, I am deadâ€¦

	Suicide has its benefits. When you are dead, nobody can bother you, hurt you, and all of your problems or future problems will be erased. The very moment you die, your personal problems go with you.

	I know that I have major issues and I need to solve them but no one can help. I do not tell my parents about what is going in my life because of how these problems are caused. Everyday I am angry and depressed and it is not good for me or the relation I am currently in. If I were to die I would not look back at my family. My final thoughts of my life will be of my girlfriend. She is the most special person I have ever met in my entire life and any guy would be lucky to have her if he knows how to relate to her. Whenever I had thoughts of suicide I always thought about her first. My family would never consist. I do not care for my life. I really wish I was never born. I would not be going through the pain I am experiencing now if I was never born or if I was dead a long time ago. If only someone fully understood what I was going through perhaps I would still want to be alive. But even if I do that my problems will never go away. I strongly believe that I am a problem towards my girlfriend as I always start the arguments and get angry with her over the littlest things. So, what do people usually do with problems? Get rid of it. Therefor, I must get rid of myself in the most permanent way possible; dying.
