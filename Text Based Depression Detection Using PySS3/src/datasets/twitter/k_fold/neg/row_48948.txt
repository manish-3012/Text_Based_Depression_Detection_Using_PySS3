Suicide felt like an option, and now it's THE option in my head.I've always kept suicide as an option, if things were really bad I could do it. And it was comforting because of that, and everytime I struggled in life I felt empowered but also reassured as I never wanted to actually take action, so I knew I'd be ok in the end. 

Until now. It became an active plan last year, I distinctly remember it as I wrote it down in my journal. And it's not left me since even if it's not been right infront of me, no more than shutting a door makes the outside world disappear. It's just there, waiting.

I've done a lot of research on methods, I was disappointed to find out my method of choice had a high failure rate so now I'm planning to use a combination approach with pharmaceuticals, alcohol and blood loss. The big 3.

I've been to therapy, I've got support of friends and family (although I would never burden them with my intent, they'll suffer enough once I'm gone without me foreshadowing it). I've got a decent life. From an outside perspective I have very little to justify my thoughts. 

But the truth is I'm struggling anyway. My heart hurts. My body feels lifeless with the weight of what I feel. I can't sleep without medication. I just... I've reached the end of whatever strength kept me committed to this life. Everything hurts. 

I just wanted to tell someone.
