I am broken and I don't think I can be fixedRecently I've realized my parents broke me. They have broken me so badly I don't think I will ever get better.

I don't know what love is. I loved people so fiercely I gave them every part of me until I had nothing left but my broken self. It turns out that this is unhealthy. I will never be loved the way I have loved others.

Even though my expectations of love are unrealistic, I can't let go. I don't trust people, I don't believe they love me, because no matter what they do they will never be able to fill the emptiness. I can't feel loved.

This is killing me. I've been in therapy for so many years. And for what? The realization that I am broken. That when I tried to kill myself when I was 15... fuck. I should have done it right.

My boyfriend knows I am suicidal. He didn't stop me when I left the house. He is healthy enough to take care of himself now. He doesn't need my depression and bitterness and black empty hole he can never fill with love. He sets boundaries and is succeeding at school. He can't help me, and he doesn't need my help anymore.

I wish it was different but it's not. I can't anymore. I can't live knowing everything my heart craves will hurt other people. That I have to live in a black hole or cause others pain. It feels like it's time to set right what I fucked up 10 years ago and just fucking die.
