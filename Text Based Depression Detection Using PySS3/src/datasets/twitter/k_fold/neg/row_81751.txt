I'm broken and exhausted.Hi all, first time posting here. Idk what to expect, I just need to vent.

I'm so incredibly exhausted by living. I'm broken in some fundamental way and I can't be like other people. I don't think I'll ever be normal and therefore I won't ever be happy. I feel deeply sad all the time but that's not why I want to die. I want to die because I can't fix myself. I've seen relatives with my condition and they're all alone, everyone hates them because they're such terrible people. I'm following their path against my will, I can't be anything but a negative influence on people so what's the point? I can't be happy or content in myself, I bring misery to those around me so what is my purpose? I'll never be fixed so there's no point going on. I just can't relate to other people, I feel like a robot or an alien and I don't know why I'm so disconnected, I just am. 

I've lived such a life of misery, I just want it to end.
