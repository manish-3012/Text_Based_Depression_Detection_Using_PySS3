I need a girl/woman/femaleI ainâ€™t tryna be a creep, but I just feel much more comfortable talking to a female. I lie awake every night thinking about suicide, thinking about ending my life. I was in this position about 6 years ago, I stood atop a multi storey car park and wanted to jump. But I couldnâ€™t bare the thought of hurting my mum. Now, I donâ€™t care. I have a you son, but Iâ€™ve never felt like I truly love him.

I just want to end my life, but I want to do it right. I want somebody to talk to. Please. Maybe this is my cry for help, I donâ€™t know. Maybe I wonâ€™t end my life, I donâ€™t know. I just donâ€™t want to feel like this. 

Iâ€™m fucking begging for somebody to talk to
