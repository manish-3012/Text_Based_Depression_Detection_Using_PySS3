I need help for someoneSo my friend has been chatting with a girl on snapchat and he found out that the girl is very suicidal, like really on the edge.
 
Right now we (friends) are searching for a solution to this but its kinda urgent. My friend wants to look for some proffesional help for this girl because he doesnt really know her, but he really doesn't want to carry the blame if said girl ends it. 

Does someone know where I can find help? All websites we looked for say the same: talk with her, recognise the signals,... but what do we do next? We can't really stop her, definitely with the quarantaine. 

It's also not an urgent situation yet, but I really don't want to wait till it is. My friend has been depressed in the past so I don't think he could cope with it if she would kill herself.

Thanks in advance
