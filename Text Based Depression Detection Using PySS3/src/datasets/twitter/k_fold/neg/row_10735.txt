I feel like a freight train careening towards a cliffI feel totally out of control.  my life is full of manipulations by everyone around me.  I hate everything.  nothing brings me joy anymore.  how did I end up so out of control?  I'm emaciated and I can't even peel the leeches off fast enough.  why can't people just be decent.  everyone is out for themselves and if they can stomp you into the ground to gain the illusion of control or even a momentary satisfaction they'll do it.

I pretty much think about it all the time.  Is there life before death?  Why does the world have to be so cruel?  I've worked my guts out for years and have nothing to show for it.  I'm used up.  I'm sick.  I'm tired.  I just want it to end.
