My DadI think my Dad is going to commit suicide. For the past few weeks he has been saying about how he hates his job and if he got another one, he is not in the position in life to find another well payed job that he would be able to afford the things we want/like. I think that's what is bearing on him, not being able to get us things we want or like. As I write this I have tears that drip down my eyes even thinking about it, twice now he has said in a more of a saddened and serious tone of voice; 'my only option is to commit suicide'. I can't handle that I would have to go back to my mothers house, were I was constantly tormented and emotionally abused. That thought is unbearable, my step mother cannot work in the position she is in. I find it hard to deal with and contemplate. My Dad is the only thing in the world that I can hold onto the thing that I have left. As the days go by I see his eyes dull and the emotion in his life slowly drain away. I hate it, I cannot bear it. I need help, if he did, I would not have a purpose to live here anymore or the will to live.
