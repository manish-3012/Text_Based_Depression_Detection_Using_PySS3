At the end we're all aloneI just want to come here and remind everyone that it's okay to feel alone. Now I don't know all your guy's situations and some of you may feel like your only way out is hurting yourself and that's your choice I am not judging. 

But, what I have to say is that we'll always be alone in life. No matter how many loved ones you have, friends, acquaintances, girlfriends, wives, boyfriends, etc. at the end of the day you'll be by yourself with your own thoughts.  
My belief is that all the people in ones life sort of distract one from that loneliness way of thought. Sometimes you just have to embrace it...actually it's probably more healthy for you to accept it and live with that idea instead of surrounding yourself with as much loved ones as possible. 

So if you're stuck wherever you are in life don't give up just because you feel all alone or you feel like no one's out there for you.(It's not hard to find help at all), but know that even with that help it's ultimately on you to support yourself. You're the one that wakes you up in the morning. You're the one doing things for your survival.**It's all you**. Everyday is a hard day for all of us. Don't ever think you're nothing(unless you rape and kill then fuck you) because life is hard on it's own; you waking up everyday is a lot of work and is a feat that gets looked over. It's okay to be sad, to mess up in life, to lose people, etc.(except for again killing and raping people fuck that shit). 

Better yourself and avoid complacency. Don't stop and keep going as long as you can.
