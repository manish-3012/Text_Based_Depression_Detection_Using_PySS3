I can't deal with school anymore.I'm just so tired of high school. People talk shit about me behind my back, mock me in front of others or just plain ignore me. Even my supposed friends ignore me. My parents ignore me. I stay around my friends but they never try to start a conversation with me. Then they ask me why I seem so sad and am always lurking behind them. I tell them that it's nothing, then they invite me to the front, promptly ignore me and I end up alone and ignored, again. I'm getting 80+ in every class but I'm mocked for being teachers pet because I actually want to get my work done instead of spending an hour talking to people. I sometimes just disappear from the group, and they don't give a shit where I went, but if someone else disappears then it's their top priority to find them.

I want to die. I don't want to endure this neglect anymore. I want dependable friends, reliable friends. I want to enjoy living, not fear it :(
