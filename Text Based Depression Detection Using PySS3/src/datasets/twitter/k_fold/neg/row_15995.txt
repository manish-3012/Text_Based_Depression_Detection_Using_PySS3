Depression is on and offI have quite a few friends. My biggest problem is that sometimes I feel really depressed and suicidal, and other times I'm happy and optimistic. I have not been diagnosed with any mental disorders/conditions. I'm not bipolar, it's just sometimes I feel like I'm in a rut and there is no reason to live.
