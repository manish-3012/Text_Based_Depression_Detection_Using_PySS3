Today I had the strongest suicidal thoughts in a long time.The following wonâ€™t make an sense I just need to put this out there

Why are we here? I hate everything about myself.  I canâ€™t do anything right. I feel like my life is just a Ferris wheel, I just keep going round and round and round and round forever and ever. If youâ€™ve seen the music video for 3005 youâ€™d understand. I just donâ€™t think I can go in anymore. Worst of all, sometimes in class Iâ€™ll just think these really messed up things and then I swear to god the people in the room can read my mind! I feel like they know everything Iâ€™m thinking and itâ€™s terrible. As I said in the title today was ye strongest my thoughts have been in a while. They were so bad I felt physically weak.
