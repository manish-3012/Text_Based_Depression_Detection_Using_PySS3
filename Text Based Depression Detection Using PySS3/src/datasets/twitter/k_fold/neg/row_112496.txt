Worthless, UselessI'm 19 been suffering for a while now, got a job, nothing got better, nothing gets better. I want to quit my job after 1 day, my mother works constantly to provide for me and my brother but here I am absolutely pathetic and wanting to quit a job, I feel nauseous everyday and my stomach hurts, I wish there was a way I could just kill myself without hurting my brother or mother.
