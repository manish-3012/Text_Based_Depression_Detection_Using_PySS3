I can't help myself anymore.It's sad in itself that I'm turning to the internet to find any consolation.  I'm male, I'm turning 22 next month, and I can't recall the last time I've truly felt okay ... The frustration I feel is absolutely gut wrenching,  and I feel like the only way out is through death. The only way I'll ever stop sabotaging myself for past failures is if I can just find the courage to put an end to the source which is my fucked up mind. The depression never ends and the only remaining comfort I have left is in the fact that I have a viable means to escape everything.  I hardly even have the willpower to get up in the morning.. my academic life has gone to shit, I'm unemployed,  I have horrible social anxiety,  and every one of my relationships have pretty much withered and died.. I just don't know what to do with myself .... there's a helium tank and bag in my closet and I'm terrified as fuck... I know this is what I want and I've considered over and over again all the implications.. I've cried myself to sleep thinking about my mother coming across my lifeless body when she returns from work.. the pain haunts me, but the personal  anguish and loneliness I feel has become unbearable .. I feel like a fucking loser and I just want to die.. I'm only one out of 7 billion.. I'm nothing and it ultimately won't make a difference once I'm dead. No use continuing this suffering
