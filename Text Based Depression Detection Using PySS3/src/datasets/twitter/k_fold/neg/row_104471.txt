I want to do it tonightI've been trying to improve my life for the past month. But that blew up in my face as well. I struggle with a lot of mental illnesses and eating disorders as well. For the past 6 months I gained weight because of my mental illnesses and binging,but this month I decided to turn my life around and fix my diet. So far I've been happy and dropped a couple of pounds as well. Today, after an attempt to get my boyfriend to do it with me as well and a well meaning comment on how he shouldn't let his boredom be a reason to binge unhealthy stuff for days (he complains about stomach issues, heart problems) he became aggressive and told me I've been eating like a donkey for the past 6 months and thats not my place to say. I've finally broken down. I already struggle with EDs, I finally thought I could at least turn that aspect of my life around but no. As usual everything has to go to shit. Now I feel like restricting until I die. No meals or anything. In fact I might just go ahead and kill myself tonight after pushing it off for months. Not that I deserve anything good in life.
