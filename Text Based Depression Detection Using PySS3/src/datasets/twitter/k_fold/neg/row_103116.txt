Does anyone feel like just talking?Preferably via PM. I'm just feeling...really bad lately. It doesn't have to be a conversation about anything depression-related, any old topic will do. I'm just trying to get out of my own head. 

Fairly new account, this. 24 year old English guy, if anyone's interested. Dark and miserable here, bloody freezing as well. 

I don't know. I'd just like to have a conversation with someone. About anything. I don't care.
