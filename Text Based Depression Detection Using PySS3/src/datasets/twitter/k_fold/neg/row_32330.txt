I've been dreaming about saying goodbye to all my old friends.I'm an old man who has had a sharp uptick of incredibly negative self-talk and suicidal ideations. 
I've always been something of a lucid dreamer and the past few nights my morning wake up dreams have been disturbing.
I find myself in situations where I'm saying goodbye to old girlfriends, including goodbye sex.
I'm saying goodbye to old friends. I'm saying goodbye to my dead father.
I dream that I'm giving away my possessions (some fabulously imaginary) to young people who I dream are younger relatives. (I have none.)
It seems like my brain has decided to let go. My psyche has had enough.
I'm a total athiest. I have no friends or family. To speak to about this. If my VA mental health provider read any of this, I would be "arrested" and held in an involuntary 3-day mental health hold.
I guess I don't have a question. I've been living alone with no friends or family to speak of.
I guess it's just my time...
Everybody dies...
