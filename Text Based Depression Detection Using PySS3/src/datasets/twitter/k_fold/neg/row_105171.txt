Had a night out with my friends. I want to off myself.Everything was good.  But I just couldnâ€™t really enjoy everything.  Was literally on the verge of a mental breakdown. Everyone was taking pictures of each other.  I looked good in some, in others I looked unprepared and distorted. My sis and my friends took some ugly photos and showed the group and was laughing.   Even my friends had pics where they were unprepared and laughed.  But I just couldnâ€™t.  I felt sick.  

Sure itâ€™s supposed to be funny but me having body dysmorphia and already struggling  with my appearance made me want to kill myself.   I always checked what I looked like in the  toilet and my camera.  It was a damn struggle.   Anyways, I still feel ugly and insecure and I feel bad.
