I want to kill myself.I really want to do that. At least fall from the balcony in my house or take some medicine. I take antidepressants (escitalopram) but they donâ€™t help me. Week ago i was happy and shit, but now i want to kill myself and sad af. I still miss my uncle and i am scared to tell my parent that i self harming and that iâ€™m pansexual. 

I want someone just to hug me, then i can peacefully go kms.
