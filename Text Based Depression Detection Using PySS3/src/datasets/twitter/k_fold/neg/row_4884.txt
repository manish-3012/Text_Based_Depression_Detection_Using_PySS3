I'm scaredI keep having urges... my mind keeps telling me you should take one more pill, or you should just pick up that knife to look at it, you *could*, you know?

I don't know how to deal with this. I don't know why I haven't given in. I don't understand this at all. I've been suicidal in the past, but this is different. There's no cry for help in this, no regret, no cowardly running away from the future this time. I just... don't understand what's happening to me. I'm just scared that in a moment of weakness, it'll be over.
