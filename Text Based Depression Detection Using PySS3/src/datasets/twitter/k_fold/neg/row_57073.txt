Read below- that's just what I have to sayNothing makes me wish to live. I feel different to those of you who feel and live. I feel lower and duller. I feel glad that there is some happiness in the world. Truly. But happiness seems like holiday postcards sent from a friend- there is life, colour, sense and feeling that I can understand. But I simply will never share it. Hope that makes sense. I wish for it to end.
