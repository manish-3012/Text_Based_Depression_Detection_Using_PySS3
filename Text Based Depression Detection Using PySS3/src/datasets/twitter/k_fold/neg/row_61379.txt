helpi know no one will read this but no one wants me around anymore. iâ€™m so tired of being alive knowing i have no future anywhere. my boyfriend is trying to make me feel better but he has girls staying the night at his and i feel like heâ€™s getting more and more tired of being with me. my mum says sheâ€™s there for me but iâ€™m not allowed to be upset around her because she gets angry at me whenever iâ€™m sad. i just want to end it and i donâ€™t know how.
