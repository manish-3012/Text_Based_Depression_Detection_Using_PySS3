Has Reddit HelpedIâ€™ve been wondering after reading some Reddit posts on this sub if posting actually has helped them through their dark periods. Itâ€™s difficult to know if posting and receiving support through this sub has helped. Of course, we wonâ€™t know if someone had unfortunately taken their life but I want to know if someone became so inspired that it actually turned their life around. I hope so! I can really use the positivity.
