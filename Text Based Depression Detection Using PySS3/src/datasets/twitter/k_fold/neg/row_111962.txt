Being logical. Where is the light at the end of the tunnel?Ugh no matter how hard I try I can't keep my posts short, I just feel like writing my story out but it's too long, no one will read it. Here's my 3rd attempt to keep it concise.

****Sob story, feel free to skip to below to my actual point****

I went off my medication with consent from my psychiatrist, basically as a gauge to help me understand or 'feel' what my medication is doing for me, since being on it for almost 2 years now I'm just popping pills and really can't feel how it helps (well my antidepressant, other drug I'm on I can gauge better). I also wanted to go off because I felt like it may be doing more harm than good. I felt like it made me kinda of paranoid and I guess since in general my depression lead to my breakup (attempted suicide was last straw for her D: ) with the most wonderful girl in the world, I just wanted to say "fuck the drugs I want out". Not to mention many times I missed a dose or 2, I felt 'really' good. My psyc explained this is pretty normal as if you go off them for a bit you still have the leftovers which provide the benefits but you also get rid of a lot of it which means you no longer have the side effects either.

So anyways, I went off them. Things were fucking fantastic. I actually felt like I was cured. I was thinking soooo much clearer and I was feeling so many emotions I didn't realize I wasn't feeling, or atleast didn't realize they were so washed out. I told myself "Fuck I'm NEVER going back on the SSRI or other anti-depressants". This I thought was fine. Over-time my base-level anxiety skyrocketed back to before i started taking medication, but I thought "I feel great and am thinking clearly, I don't need anti-depressants, I need anxiolytics, something that's milder then my lorazepam but acts over a longer period of time".

Things seemed like they would work out, I would be A LOT happier and level headed and just be "better" all I had to treat was my anxiety which inst a big deal. The thing though is that my SSRI (Cymbalta) has a low half-life so it should of exited my system completely a long time ago. It's been like 5 weeks, but then all of the sudden (not entirely without a trigger...) I had..Not sure if it was actually my first, but it was undeniably (due to it's intensity) a manic phase. In a few hours it went through my life and tore up my beliefs and goals and basically re-wrote my purpose in life. Don't get me wrong, this was very productive and gave me some deep insight into my own life. The problem is when I finally got to bed I woke up to a mixed emotion state, which again, in of itself was traumatizing, then back to depression. It totally fucked with my mind, I donno where it came from and I saw a part of me that just was so...not me. I feel like I don't even know who I am anymore.

Over the next week I was/am in shambles. Everything just fell apart, in the span if just sitting in lecture for 3 hours I almost burst into tears atleast a dozen times, probably closer to a dozen and a half. I've been flipping between depressive states and normal states in the span as little as half an hour.

My point is, my 'condition' has apparently gotten worse over the years and have much stronger bipolar tendencies then when I first started the medication. The drugs seem to have been hiding things getting worse, so with much reluctance I went back on the drugs I have. I still need to see my psyc when I go home.

****My point****

My point is where is the light at the end of the tunnel? I take medication hoping to get better. I go off it and realize how much of a zombie I've become and how shitty and bland, specifically, anti-depressants make life...Yet when I'm off them I become almost crippled in anxiety and feelings of want to die and just a total loss of control of my own mind.

I'm in psychology, studied neuroscience, always been a science/bio nerd. I get it. I really do. I get why things are the way they are, medication helps but is always a trade. Is this what I have to choose between though? Living as a zombie just to get by, seeing the world with a mask on, or like it's tinted grey; or endure incredibly suffering and risk the loss of sanity just to be able to have those very brief moments of clarity where you can see how beautiful the world truly is and genuinely be happy.

I don't want to be back on the pill. I want to be 'better' but with a history of severe depression (suicides) from my mom's side of the family as well as my dad's I just got shafted. My psychiatrist says he believes there is a very severe chemical imbalance that can't really be fixed. He eluded that I'd have to take a nice cocktail of drugs to 'fix' me, which I have no intention of. I just want to be "better", I don't want to have to take any drugs and I want to be able to see the world as is without having to worry that like a switch literally any moment I can turn into a sobbing mess.

I just want to be able to live my life like everyone else. Even if I live a successful life and overcome many obstacles in my way and have an amazing wife, kids, family, friends...while I guess happy, I'll still know that it is only a fraction of how happy I would be without being on the drugs.
