don't know what to sayI don't know what to say to my mother. She knows I don't wanna live, but I just feel like she gets very disappointed in me whenever I'm sad. I haven't told anyone else, I don't know what I would say, but I really need someone other than my mother to talk to. I just wanna fucking die.
