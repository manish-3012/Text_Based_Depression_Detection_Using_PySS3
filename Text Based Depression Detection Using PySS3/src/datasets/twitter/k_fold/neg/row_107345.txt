Worst night of my lifeHad a girl from tinder over. Couldnâ€™t get hard at all and had to tell her to leave.

Backstory: My girlfriend of five years and I broke up two months ago. I thought I felt open to the idea of hooking up, but as soon as I saw this girl at the door I knew it was wrong for me (shouldnâ€™t have answered the door). I started thinking about my girlfriend as soon as I let this girl in and realized how wrong it felt for me. 

I know I canâ€™t have my girlfriend back but tonight I had a wake up call that Iâ€™ll never get over her either. 

I want my awkward, pathetic life to end already. Iâ€™ve never been dedicated to anything and at twenty two years of age have no goals or career interests. My girlfriend was all I needed to make me believe having those thoughts were ok. But now that sheâ€™s out of the picture...
