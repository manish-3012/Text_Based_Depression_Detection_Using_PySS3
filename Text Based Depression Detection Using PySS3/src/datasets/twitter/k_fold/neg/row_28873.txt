I'm torn between wanting help and wanting it to be overGoing through a rough divorce that may or may not be going through (currently separated, physically and maritally), but we still love each other, we saw each other this week and mostly just fucked and cried. I cheated on him, I'm going to start therapy once I can, and I'm trying to see if I can get into inpatient therapy.

I'm on anti depressants, I'm in a job field that isn't particularly difficult most of the time, but I'm just so tired. I don't want to wake up. I want my husband back, I want my life back, I want to be a better person, but most of all I just want to be done.

I'm scared because I've been planning. I don't want to die until my husband is back on my life insurance, I don't want to hurt him or my sister or my dad. My mom killed herself, and I know it's not a good idea, but the idea of being done is so fucking attractive it scares me.

Just.. I don't know. I need help.
