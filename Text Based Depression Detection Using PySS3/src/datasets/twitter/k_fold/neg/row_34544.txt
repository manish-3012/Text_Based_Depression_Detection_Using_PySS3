I don't wanna live but i don't have balls to kill myself.i think i have finnaly lost my mind it's fucking over. Shit has been going for some years but now it's different now i literally lost myself my mind is fucking sick i hate everything and everyone and i keep pretending every day that i have a good normal life , guess i just don't fit in normal life. i have literally no future and i don't find joy in anything i joy , i wish i could have some reason to wake up in the morning , i really want to die but i can't manage to kill myself but everyday i feel like i'm more stronger to do it.
