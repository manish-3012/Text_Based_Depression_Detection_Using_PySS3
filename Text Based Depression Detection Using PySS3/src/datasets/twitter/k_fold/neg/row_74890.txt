Degenerative mind. By me.Mind, body, spirit. Those are the things that make us human. When our mind starts to go crazy, the human in us disappears. The urge to do something keeps me up at night, does that mean I disappear?

My mind is breaking, please help me. When Iâ€™m alone I canâ€™t feel any emotions. I just want to feel something. The silence is going too kill me.
