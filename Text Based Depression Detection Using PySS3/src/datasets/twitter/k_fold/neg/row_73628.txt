Why tf am I like thisMy relationships work on point systems; I always have to beat my last highscore or I'll lose that relationship forever. If I don't feel useful or needed by someone (so if I'm not winning "points") I get depressed or sometimes just angry, which usually makes them leave faster. I don't know why I'm so dysfunctional. I've been trying to stop for years but I always fall back into bad habits.

Every relationship I've ever had, romantic or otherwise, has ended with me being left behind. Usually I don't even know why. What's so wrong with me that everyone hates being around me so much? I isolate myself from others to protect myself but really I'm terrified of dying alone. It feels inevitable at this point, though. I've been more suicidal these past few months than ever before. I know it's only a matter of time before I do myself in and I know I'll have to do it alone, just like everything else in my life.
