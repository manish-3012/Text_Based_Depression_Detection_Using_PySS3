2020That is when I will no longer bother my friends with my problems and they will live their happy lives. That is when I will finally stop wasting my parents' money because I don't deserve any of them. That is when I will not be a nuisance for my school and the teachers there. That is when I will leave this world for good.

February wait for me. I will live as the burden I am until February 2020. February 20th to make it even.

I will be free. Everyone around me will be free. Who would want an ungrateful brat like me to keep on living anyways.

I don't need help. I've already made this decision. I just felt the need to say all of this. I have no idea why. Maybe subconsciously I still wanted attention even though I deny it? I mean if you're reading this I clicked the post button so maybe I'm looking for something. No idea. I just don't need help.

Be free, dear stranger. You decide what free means to you. For me it means death. For you it might mean running away from your abusive family, quitting your job and having a fresh start even though it's gonna be tough, asking for help, calling your friend to tell them you're feeling like shit and you want to get rid of what you're feeling. Do what will make you the happiest. But death isn't always the answer. Quite ironic coming from me I know. But I've thought about it for so long and I have set my mind on it. If there's a tiny bit of hope left in you don't do what I'm about to do next year. But if you've suffered for too long I can't help but understand you. I don't know you, dear stranger. I don't know what's going on in your life, I don't even know what's going on in your head. But I want you to know that I'm aware that you exist. And I will support your decision.

I don't know who you are, however I can't help but be thankful to you for reading all of this.
