at the end of my coping resources, unloved, frustratedI am coming up to my one year anniversary of being "together" with a guy that refuses to even call me his girlfriend, even though I go to family occasions, he buys me jewelry, we do everything as a couple.

I had been in a relationship that ended badly (my partner's mental illness deteriorated and he took his own life). I then dated a few guys all of which I didn't really even like.

I let my guard down and fell in love unfortunately with the emotionally unavailable man. I am at the end of my coping skills. He was my last-ditch attempt at love, the one last time I was going to fall in love.

I had a terrible childhood and have zero family support or contact. I have many friends but keep them all at an emotional distance.

I have a fulfilling paying job as well as mentoring teenagers as a volunteer. but I'm just done.

I'm done with life. I have had a previous attempt where I almost made it, I was an idiot and tried to take pills.

This time, I live across the road from a very high freeway overpass. The barriers are only chest height.

I have nothing to live for. I am not good enough for the man I love and I will probably never be good enough for any man that's not hideously ugly or really old. 

I can't face one more day of this torture. I am simply done.
