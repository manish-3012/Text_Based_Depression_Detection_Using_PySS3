I overdosed and survived and my sister told me to do it againI'm fucking tired of living , my sister always tells i am fat bipolar bitch , i overdosed on 20 antipsychotic last week
I was so  sick , i couldn't even walk i had trouble breathing but deep down i was glad i survived my sister didn't even bother checking up on me ,my mum wanted to take to hospital but i couldn't walk and my sister refused to help my mum carry me , there's no emergency in egypt , i got a little better she saw me walking , and said  i should overdose again .
I don't know why the fuck I'm living in egypt ,  I'm danish somali girl born in the uk , left england when i was very young , as you can see my english is not very good , all my subject are in arabic its quite hard I'm in alazhar school which means 18 subjects i take islamic studies,  i  memorized  the quran  twice , guess i what I'm a fucking atheist lmfao I'm living a lie , what gets to me is that I'm in the same school year as my bitch of a sister .
I was held back a year because i got bipolar at 16 and had to go to psych ward for 3 months i was skinny at that time , and gained like 20 kg after , my mum calls me names but most of the time she's caring , i wanna get out as soon as i Finnish school but my dad wants me to study at alazhar uni ' says i wont find education in  the uk because of Brexit im thinking of hanging myself i don't know
