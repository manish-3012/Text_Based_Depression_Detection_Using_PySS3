I've failed my college entrance for the second time and im thinking about ending it all.The title pretty much say's it, i've always had family issues and not many friends.2-3 friends i have are in another city far away studying, my family is disappointed that i didn't get into medical college and i honestly have never been closer to just killing myself. I mean being a doctor was my dream, im unable to see a few friends i have and i feel like i don't have anything to live for anymore...
