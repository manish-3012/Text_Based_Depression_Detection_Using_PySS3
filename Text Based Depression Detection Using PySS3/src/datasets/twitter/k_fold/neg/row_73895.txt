At a all time low tonight, thinking of doing the 'deed' sometime this weekendSo my dad flat out told me that a person sometimes deserve to feel the emotions you're currently feeling, he knows I'm depressed but he doesn't know I'm this close to suicide. That sentence bummed me out and I have no feeling of self-worth anymore, I didn't pass the test to adulthood, I am a failure and a nobody. I have to pay him $500~ by Monday or I'm out of the house. I'm currently unemployed and I have less than $2 to my name. I have searched for jobs for several months but nobody wants to hire someone like me, I have applied for welfare, but they have rejected me time and time again. I am out of options.

I want to live a happy life, but every single time I take one step forward, life pushes me down into the gutter again.

I could sell my computer, but I will lose every bit of support I get from my boyfriend (he lives abroad) and other stuff.
