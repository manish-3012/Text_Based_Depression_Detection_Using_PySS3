i dont knowi have breakdowns almost every night usually crying myself to sleep. I feel like a selfish ass since im with a well off and loving family and i know people have it much worse than me but i still think about killing myself a lot. I feel so much pressure having to live up to expectations i feel overwhelmed. The only reason why i dont do it is because im too much of a coward. I have a dream of becoming an astronomer the stars always calm me but i dont think i can do it. Getting up everyday is the same repetitive thing each day but i always have to act happy and i hate it. I dont know it sounded better in my head before typing it
