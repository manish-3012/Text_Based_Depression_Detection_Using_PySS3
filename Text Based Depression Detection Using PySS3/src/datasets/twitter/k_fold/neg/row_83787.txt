Will medication fix me?Is it going to make me "better"?
Is it going to take away all of the hurt?
Will it help motivate me? Will it stop me from feeling so worthless?
Will it stop me from praying that I just never wake up? Will it stop me from crying every time I do?
Will it stop me from my random crying spells at all?
Will it help me socialize with people? Value them? Will I ever be able to look another person in the eye and have a real conversation with them without me feeling extreme anxiety/discomfort?
Will I ever be able to just put a stop to all these violent, suicidal thoughts that just seem to fall upon me each day?

I'm trying to hard to push myself to be stronger than this... I really am. I've been trying for most of my life. But I don't think I have it in me anymore. I tried many times before. I was okay for a while, but it always ends up just like this, no matter what.

I've tried therapy and medication, neither of which proved to be long term solutions. I've been thinking of trying again before I give up for good. This is really the only thing I have to cling on to; that I just didn't have the right meds. That feels so pathetic. Even as pathetic as that feels, I guess part of me hopes it's true... that there's some pill out there that will make my stupid mind function normally.

Another part of me says why bother? What's the fucking point? What's so wrong with a person not wanting to be here anymore?
