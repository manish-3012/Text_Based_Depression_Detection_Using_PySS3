It's timeI've thought about it a lot these couple of days and it's time to go.
I'm home alone for the first time in quite awhile so there's nothing that can stop me.
I've learned how to hang myself and I also know where my mom hides all meds so I don't overdose on them.
I'm going to try first with hanging and if it doesn't work I'll take all the meds.
I've made my peace with death and thank you to all who helped me here.
