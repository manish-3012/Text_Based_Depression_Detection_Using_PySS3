Stuck between a rock and a hard placeI'm currently quite suicidal and dissociative but I can't really tell anyone especially my loved ones because they all have their own problems right now and are busy with their own lives.

Honestly I don't want to burden them and I don't think that I need to, I just need therapy but the only place I can afford that are actually good just disappeared from the internet and idk how to reach them for info and booking appointments. I'm desperate for help rn and this situation isn't really helping at all.
