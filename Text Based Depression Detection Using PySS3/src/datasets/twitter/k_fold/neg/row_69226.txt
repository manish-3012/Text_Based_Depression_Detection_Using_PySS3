I'm so tired of having to be aliveIts physically exhausting. I dont know why its hard going forward. Every day I feel like I'm not good enough. Not good enough at work, not good enough paycheck, not good enough anything. 

I'm just so tired trying to keep up. I'm tired of trying to make people understand what I mean. I can't explain this feeling I have, that while you're supposed to be excited for tomorrow, that you're supposed to be excited to be alive. I just look at all the days I'm supposed to live and I am so tired.
