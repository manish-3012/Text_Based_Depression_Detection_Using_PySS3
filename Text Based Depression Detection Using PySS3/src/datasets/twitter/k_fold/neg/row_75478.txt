Feeling sad af rnfr feeling sad af rn. I wanna kill myself. no one likes me and everyone thinks I'm retarded. people would only mourn if I died because that's obligatory when someone passes, but I am a piece of shit whose absence will contribute to the better of society. I always doubt myself, I have no accomplishments, and there's no one in this world that has anything good to say about me and it's all my fault. I am so fucking stupid. I have no reason to live and I'm just taking up space. literally anyone else on the street is so much better than me even a fuckin homeless guy. My family would mourn but they'd honestly probably be better off without me. Workin out boosting your morale is bullshit because here I am sitting in my 7th month of working out and I feel like total shit. people have told me countless times how retarded I am and I never acknowledge it because I think they're just messing around but I actually am, and all that i've ever made in this world is a nuisance. I was gonna hang myself a few months ago but then I decided not to because I was too much of a pussy. I should have done it so that then I wouldn't be harming others anymore like I am every day now. and I'm so fucking stupid that I'm not even aware of it. I'm such a pussy I'd probably need a gun because any other method is too painful for me. at first I didn't want to because I would literally destroy my head, but there's no purpose since no one even cares about me. All my life I thought it was everyone else but it's me, and there's nothing I can do to stop it because it happens underneath my nose and I can't even notice.
