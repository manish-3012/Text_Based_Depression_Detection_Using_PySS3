I thought and began an attempt last week. Now I'm feeling worseNothing grants me pleasure anymore and I'm unable to do anything, like watching a series or a movie. I just can't.

I've annoyed too much my friends with my problems. They don't deserve to have a horrible, depressive, anxious about everything, friend like me. And I don't deserve the great people they are.

I think that it'll be a good action to kill myself. I need to kill that horrible person that's me for the sake of others. I feel like a selfish, pathetic, useless piece of shit, and I can't find a way to keep going.
