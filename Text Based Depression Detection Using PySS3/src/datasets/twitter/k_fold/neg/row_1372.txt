It feels like I already diedI deactivated most of my social media a little over a week ago. Iâ€™m a guy that scrolls FB for several hours a day, and I just found it to be making matters worse so I deactivated it during a rather tense time with several people to try and escape. 

Well, Iâ€™m bored, and I know nobody will notice if I reactivate it again for a minute and just check how everybody is doing. The way everybody has just gone on with their lives, new profile pictures here and there and hardly recognizing some people after just one week offline. 

My best friends who never even noticed I had gone, and suddenly havenâ€™t spoken to since, sharing regular posts every few hours. 

My big girl got a haircut and seems to be getting on fine with her cousins.

My mom, sister, and other family just sharing their memes and jokes as normal. 

My crush sharing events and things that are important to her but arenâ€™t really my bag, further distancing me from getting the courage to talk to her. 

It feels like I died, and missed all these things. The regular same old, and the new. That this is what it would really be like if I could just take that fucking step. But I can tell myself nobody cares at all, but I know you guys here do. Or so you say.  I feel like the support we find here is all that keeps me going. And I guess thatâ€™s whatâ€™s important. But I drained myself so low by doing this.
