I just need it all to stopI hate the way I feel all the time. Everything hurts and I just want to block it all out. And then Iâ€™m so numb and empty and life has no meaning, and I need it all to stop because I canâ€™t handle it anymore. Life never feels good for me, I self destruct, and I hurt, and I just crave the numbness and peace of death and I know itâ€™s not the answer, but I donâ€™t care because I canâ€™t fucking handle this anymore
