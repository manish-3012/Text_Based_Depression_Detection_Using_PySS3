Does anyone else ever feel like they don't belong in the family?I feel like an outcast but only by myself. I feel like nothing would change if I was dead, I already have so little to do with them so its like there would be no change in their lives at all. I wish they could've had a better son. I'm sorry that I couldn't have turned out normal. Its my fault and now they re stuck with some worthless pile of flesh and bones that needs feeding everyday they deserved better than me and they didn't get it. Yet they still love me for some reason I wish they didn't. It would make the whole suicide thing alot easier but who cares if its a hard choice for me. What matters is that its going to be hard for them . I hope they can forget about me.
