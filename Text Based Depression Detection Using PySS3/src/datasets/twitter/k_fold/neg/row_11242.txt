weekends are so dismalEverything seems so good in the week days. I have great friends, doin well at school, met a great girl. And then the weekend comes. I always hope I'll not happen again. But it always does. Every time it's the same. My step-father is a dickhead and my mother is an unstable alcoholic. The only thing I can hear is shouting and door slamming. 2 weeks ago however I heard something noone should hear his mother say - "I want to die.". And she almost did. She took some kind of pills. I was concerned, obviously. But they just moved on, pretending that nothing happened. And here I am today. The same situation. She almost did it again. The terrifying part is that, for a while, I wished she would die. Maybe it would be better, easier without her. I can't function normally with such a family. I tried to help. Everyone from the family tried. Nothing works. For how long can I go on like this? Monday will come and I"ll be hopeful again. But it"ll not change anything. It would be so easy to just give up. Would she say what she did if she would love me? I feel like a disappointment, yet I try so hard.
