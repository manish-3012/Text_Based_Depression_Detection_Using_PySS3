The end of a truly evil person... and it's for the best, really. I'm a horrible person. I've done some truly evil, unforgivable things in my past. I don't even want to post what they were because I don't want the police to come looking for me if I'm unsuccessful tonight. Trust me, death is an appropriate thing to happen to someone like me. Society will be rid of a piece of human trash.

I will say that I'm in my mid thirties and I've completely wasted my life so far. I spent a big chunk of my 20s in a drug and alcohol induced haze. I managed to get away from that and get a good job with a decent career track. But I'll never be able to achieve what I could have if I had made better decisions instead of being a scum-bag drug addict.

I have a daughter that I haven't seen in more than 10 years. Her mother discovered the things I had done and said that if I ever tried to contact her or my daughter again, she would go to the police with the evidence she has (and still has) and I would go to prison. So I stayed away. I've always paid my child support, but that does little to alleviate my guilt for being a deadbeat.

I used to think that I could leave my mistakes behind me and try to be a better person. But I now realize that there are some sins that you can't be forgiven for, no matter how much time passes or how many "good" things you do. I'm still a monster and I always will be. There's no absolution for the things I've done.

I know that my family and friends will be shocked and saddened, and devastated by what I'm about to do. And that fills me with even more self loathing, they'll be the final victims of a fucked up individual they had the misfortune of loving. 

But on balance, the world will be a better place with me gone. Humanity will be rid of one of it's worst members. This is something that should happen. It's just and right.
