I should be happy right nowI have everything going for me right now. I have a caring family, girlfriend, a car, place to live, good school and amazing job. But it seems like I don't feel anything.

I was in a car crash recently and my car was totalled. Most people would be distraught and upset but I wasn't. It was like another thing that happened that day. Get milk, go to work, crash your car, get coffee, etc. 

Sometimes if I am driving I will think about veering off the road. Or running into a building or hitting a pole. Thinking about if it would kill me or if I would be mutilated beyond recognition. 

I have been getting other suicidal thoughts over the week but no desire to commit to them. I just need help I think.
