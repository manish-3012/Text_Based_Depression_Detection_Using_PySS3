Im a piece of shitI always hear from people who have depression, who tried to kill themselfes, thier problems are a big deal, they have real problems. I dont, but still im here, thinking about suicide, my problems are shit in comparison to thier problems. What the fuck is wrong with me. I got a friend, she told me she tried to kill herself, shes depressed, she got real problems. I would talk to her about my problems, my reason, but just comparing our situations, her problems are bigger, why would shwe care about my small shitty problems, she would think I only do this to get attention, so i wont tell her. 

Do i even have problems? I must have, these toughts and this shitty dark heavy feeling cant just come from nothing, or can it? Maybe i dont have any reason for this, so how the fuck do deal with it then, i got nothi g to talk about, no problems, no reason. Maybe I do t need a reason to do it anyway.
