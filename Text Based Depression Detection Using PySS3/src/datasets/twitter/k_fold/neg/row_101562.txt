Iâ€™m just a looserI know this is the typical clichÃ© of the suicide profil but Iâ€™Â m feeling like a looser.
Everything I tried in my life, I fail. I work hard for something, Iâ€™m failing, everybody around me success and telling me how much it was easy and how they just improvised. And every time Iâ€™Â m feeling worst. I wanna make a great scholarship and I dream about this so I work hard but I fail and Iâ€™m feeling just stupid.
Iâ€™m just a skinny person, Iâ€™m listening all my friendâ€™s problems and they are just  telling me that Iâ€™m a good person, I try to be funny and I make joke everyday but every time Iâ€™m alone Iâ€™m feeling sad, ugly, with no talent I have a personal reflexion about if I wanna die or not. I donâ€™t want help but I jut needed to say it to someone, please I know that itâ€™s very ridiculous to have suicidal thoughts about things like this but donâ€™t judge me.
Sorry my English is very bad (Iâ€™m French), hope you understood.
