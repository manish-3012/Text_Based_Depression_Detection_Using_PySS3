To note or not to noteI have been in a bad state recently. I just want out. But I also feel completely trapped by my current circumstances. I have made a lot of poor financial decisions in my past. I'm not running away from my debts, in fact quite the opposite. It will take me a few months to finish fixing my debts. I just can't leave that burden with people I leave behind. This situation is giving lots of time to plan. Who knows, maybe in the next few months a miracle will somehow even restore my hope for a future. But as of now, I can only think of one thing. Do I leave a note? Do the people I leave deserve an explanation? Or do I just go? My plan should leave no evidence so my minuscule life insurance can pay for funeral arrangements. Is it kinder to relief the financial or emotional burden left in my wake?
