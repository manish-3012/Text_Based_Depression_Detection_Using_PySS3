I am always the last choice for everyoneIt seems like no one ever really needs me, I am  just there being friends with people that dont really care about me even though I care so much about them and always try to be there for them. No matter where, every friend I ever had chose someone over me. It just makes me feel worthless. Since I was a little kid I was always the last choice. I am always there for people and try to help them, I give so much and never get anything back. It just never changes and I am tired of it. I am 18 years old but my soul and my heart feel so heavy and old. I just feel useless and worthless. (I apologize if there are any errors or mistakes in my grammar, I am not a native speaker)
