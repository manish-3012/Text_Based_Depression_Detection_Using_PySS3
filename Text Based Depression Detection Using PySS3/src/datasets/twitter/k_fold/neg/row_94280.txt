What an fucking awful year this has been...Some context:  I'm 25 and a brand new ICU nurse during the worst health crisis the world has seen in decades. I have worked pretty extensively in my hospital's Covid ICU since May and we are showing no signs of slowing down. I believe our death rate has decreased, but the patients keep rolling in. Regardless, I have seen so many patients die it's depressing. In fact, one of the patients we had recently was a 19 year old college student who died from Covid complications. And no one fucking cares. The country is a boiling pot of political rage. People have had enough of the Coronavirus - I am so fucking sick and tired of arguing with people over the stupidest things. The virus is REAL you stupid FUCK! People are at each other's throats. I haven't seen my friends in months. I hardly go home and see my family in fear of getting them sick. I have had basically no other human contact outside work since this all began.

All of this and then now I suddenly get diagnosed with a DVT in my left leg. I am otherwise perfectly healthy. I eat right, I exercise, and I am in shape. Most likely, it's genetics (my mom's side has clotting issues) and I won't find out the details until my follow-up appointment on Tuesday. So on top of it all, I could have nearly died from this blood clot in my leg breaking off and floating into my lung or my brain.

God fucking damnit. I told myself in college I would kill myself by the time I turned 25. Well, that was back in September. Look at the state the world is in right now. Every day is like living in hell. What a golden opportunity to kill myself now huh? There is no way I could have predicted this would happen years ago, but isn't it ironic that everything seems to fall into place? Fuck why couldn't this DVT have given me a fucking stroke and I just collapse in my apartment and die alone lie the worthless, sack of FUCKING SHIT I AM.
