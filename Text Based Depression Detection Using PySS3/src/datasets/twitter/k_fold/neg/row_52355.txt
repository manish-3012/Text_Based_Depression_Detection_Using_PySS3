I lost it all (13 M)I used to have a normal life. I had friends. I went out alot. I had a good house and family. But then my family started arguing with me and I fell into a deep depression and cycle of waking up acting like I'm alright all day going to bed then crying all night. I did this every day for years. Then I started exploding with anger and sadness. I lost all my friends. Im basically homeless with a family full of toxicity and hate towards me. I lost it all. EVERYTHING I CARED ABOUT IS GONE. EVERYTHING. This is my last resort for spilling about my feelings. I want to die so bad. I'm going to kill myself. I don't know when or how. But I will
