Suicidal thoughts(Just something that I realized today)

I was at work today and some of my co workers for some reason were talking about suicidal thoughts, one girl mentioned that she only had a suicidal thought once in her life and then the others agreed with that... I was kinda of chocked cuz I thought that it was something common, normal to be thinking about that almost all the time...
