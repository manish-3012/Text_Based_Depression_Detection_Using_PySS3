Iâ€™m absolutely nothingIâ€™ve realized that my life is a waste of time.

I am currently in grad school. Iâ€™m a mediocre researcher at best. Itâ€™s all I want to do but I will never be good enough. I donâ€™t have anything worth saying, and even if I did it would be for naught.
I donâ€™t feel close to anyone in particular, I would not leave a hole in anyoneâ€™s heart if I were to pass. I just live in a world of my own paranoia, and I canâ€™t see the way out.
I feel alone and empty. I feel hollow and hopeless. Iâ€™m absolutely nothing.

And people say â€œdo thisâ€ or â€œdo thatâ€ if you realize you want to die. Like I donâ€™t know how to live. I know how to live. But I have no reason why.
