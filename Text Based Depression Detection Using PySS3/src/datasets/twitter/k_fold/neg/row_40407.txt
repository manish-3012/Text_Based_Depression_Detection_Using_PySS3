I'm not good enoughI'm not good enough. Life has no meaning. The pain won't stop and she doesn't love you anymore. I'm not good enough. Time keeps passing and I'm tired of trying to keep up. Just let me lay here. I'm not good enough. So let me sleep and forget all about me. I'm not good enough and I never was. I'm sorry for ruining your life and I'm sorry for loving you when I know damn well that I'm not fucking good enough.
