I hate myself. I guess I'm trying to psych myself up to do it. I'm a worthless fuck up piece of shit and I just want out.I've been dealing with depression for over half my life now. I've got a therapist, I've got a med doc, I've got a mood stabilizer, I've got an antidepressant, I've got a DBT group I just started a couple weeks ago.

But I keep fucking up and getting further &amp; further behind. My world and life is so small. Pretty much all I have and all I do is my job and video games.

I hate myself and all the things I can't do and how much of a fucking loser I am.

I'm so tired. I'll never be able to be happy. I'll never be able to do anything right. I'll never be fucking good enough.

Like, this really is just the only solution, like it's just a matter of time. I've known for years that I was going to kill myself.

And like I know it's stupid to fucking post on reddit then.

I guess part of me doesn't want to. But I suck and everything is fucked. But why haven't I yet then? I have everything I need. I put out extra food for my cat. I guess maybe I'm just trying to psych myself up. Maybe because I like know it's real this time? I don't fucking know. I just need to fuckin suck it up and do it. Fuckin piece of shit.


Also posted on depression. Idk why.

I'm really trying to talk myself into it. It's like just what I need to do at this point.

Cool, thanks reddit I'm doing this too much."
