I feel empty. What should I do?There's nothing I want to do. I feel like I have no energy at all. There's things I wanted to do, just a couple weeks ago even, but now I just feel no reason to. I have no drive at all. There's literally just nothing I've had depression for 5 years but I've never felt a lack of complete drive in anything at all. I mean before I at least still had some goals that meant something to me. Now there's nothing. I don't know what to do. There really is nothing left keeping me here now. It's never been like that. It's kind of fucking scary.
