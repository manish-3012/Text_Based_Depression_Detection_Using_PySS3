A little help for a friend?So, I just met this girl. Literally only last week. She's been through so much in her 21 years of existence, from a sexually abusive brother, abandoning mother, death of her firstborn, abuse from her father (who is in prison for life) and constant judgement by everyone for her alternative look (facial piercings, side-shaved head, etc.). I only just met her, and she's been pretty open with me about all of this. She's been telling me she wants to kill herself because she doesn't see a point to living. I keep telling her that it's going to get better, and that she needs some solid friends. She thinks I was "leading" her on, getting her hopes up (because I really am just a nice guy, trying to be a nice friend, but she just had a bad breakup and she's looking for a long-term relationship already, but I'm not). I did nothing to lead her on. I've only hung out with her for a two nights, only for a few hours and talked. I don't know what to do. She saying no one cares about her and that she should just off herself. She thinks I don't care, and that I can't care because I barely know her, but I DO care. 

What should I tell her? I've basically tried everything. She need to see a therapist, for sure, but she won't listen to that. Even though I hardly know her, I care a lot about her and would be devastated if I found out she killed herself.
