I am home from the hospitalI sincerely appreciate the help you all did for me here. I am still kind of a hot mess and I have quite a bit of therapy and aftercare to go through. The abuse is not my fault. I am loved. I deserve to be loved. Its going to take time before I am healthy but I think I a can do this.
