I have to figure out a way to end this todayMy wife left last November. Every day since has been nothing but pain. I'm completely alone all the time and just want to die. Other people don't care if I'm unhappy and alone as long as I'm alive. I know I will be able to do it if I keep trying but I need it to be today.
