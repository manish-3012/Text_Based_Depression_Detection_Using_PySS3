On the edgeIâ€™m almost done with this life. Iâ€™ve been a piece of shut my entire life. Doing heroin and Xanax to make me feel better and comfort my feelings. It numbs the pain and takes every bad feeling away. I hadnâ€™t done anything in a couple months because I got out on probation but last night I got blackout on Xanax again. Iâ€™m so fucking depresssed and sick of my life. I donâ€™t have a car because I canâ€™t work due to my mental health. My memory sucks from doing so many drugs and all I do is upset my parents and stress them way the fuck out. I really want to overdose somewhere Iâ€™ll die in time without being saved again and again. My parents are like drill sergeants expecting me to be perfect my whole life. My anxiety and depression is really starting to take over, I sleep maybe 2 hours a night. Iâ€™m just done with this life. The only thing I can think about that makes me happy is when I do drugs. Iâ€™m fucking done.
