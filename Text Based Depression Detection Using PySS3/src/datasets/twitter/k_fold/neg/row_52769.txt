There's no reason to continue forward.My situation is steadily declining and now I'm facing homelessness. I've been through this before and I know how fucking awful it is and I just don't see the point of trying to continue. It's like every step forward I take I get fucked back 20 steps. Everything I've used to try and get help has basically told me to go fuck myself (outside of RAoP). My mental health was already on the rocks even when I had a place to stay. It would just be so much easier on my family and SO if they didn't have to support my hopeless ass. I don't even have a bed to lay and cry in all day and I have no energy to do anything else. This has been an uphill battle for so long with no end in sight. I just want to stop fighting so badly. It's so much work with no reward. I have no one to talk to and I had to go off my meds. I'm considering doing an inpatient stay so I can get back on meds and try to figure some of this shit out but I know my SO won't want me to. And that's only a week of housing, I don't know where to go from there. I don't even want to think about an hour from now, much less a week. I'm just so tired.
