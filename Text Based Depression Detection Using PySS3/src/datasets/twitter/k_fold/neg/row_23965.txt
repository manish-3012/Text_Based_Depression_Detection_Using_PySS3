Katanas.My dad bought katanas for my brothers before they moved to college. They're extremely sharp, and he forgot to lock them up, like the rest of his knives.

Tonight, I'm going to wait til everyone is asleep, and slit my wrists, diagonally, and cut a few arteries.

I wish you well SW. You helped me through some tough times. But this isn't another tough time. It's just a way of thinking.

I just wanted to say thanks. I'd rather not try to get talked out of it.
