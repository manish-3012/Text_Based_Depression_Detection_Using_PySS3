Life isn't for me I guess.I've been depressed for a long time now. Nobody knows though, not my family, friends, or my girlfriend. I can't even think about telling them without thinking about being ridiculed or being looked down upon. I can't tell my girlfriend because she is depressed easily and she shouldn't have to deal with my stupidity. I told my friend a while ago, but she didn't really care...I just bother people. 

Even people on here think I'm a waste. I've been called a "pussy", " selfish", and countless other things many times. It's all true. I'm a pussy who can't fight some stupid depression or whatever. I only think about myself and how I want to die. I never think about other people.

I couldn't even stop my friend from killing himself. I'm so fucking stupid. I can't do anything. 

I put this mask on every day and at night I cry myself to sleep. I can't even out my situation into words. I'm really truly useless...
