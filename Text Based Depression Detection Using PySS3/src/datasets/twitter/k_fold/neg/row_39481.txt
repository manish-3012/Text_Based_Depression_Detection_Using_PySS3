Two months to figure it out.Today i got what amounts to an eviction letter. Two months. Two months to make the choice. Im 29. I have no money. No assets. No future. This was kind of my last chance place. I have no where to go. I deserve this.

The worst part is, im too broke to find a proper way to kill myself. I dont have access to a gun. I dont have the funds to even buy a proper rope to hang myself. At this point, the only options left to me are stealing pills while i go for the cliche slitting of my wrists. 

It's my own fault that im here. I know people want to care, but i dont deserve it. This is just me shouting into the void. No one can help me, because i cant help myself. I deserve to die, and that's ok.
