I've been imagining ending it all dayI've had depression nearly all my life. Sometimes things are good and sometimes it just hits hard. A month ago I acted too heavily on my insecurities and emotions without listening to what the love of my life was saying and I ended a beautiful relationship. I realized my mistake and texted and emailed to work it out to the point of becoming crazy that he wouldn't even so much as read them or respond. I can't breathe, I don't want to get out of bed, I thought I was finally getting to the point of becoming somewhat livable when I just couldn't stop thinking about killing myself today. I know this is stupid. But I don't want to live a life without him and I fucked it up and I just want to end everything because it is just not worth living a life so empty and hollow. I feel pathetic and maybe everyone would be happy in their lives without me in them. I've made too many mistakes and can't stop crying.
