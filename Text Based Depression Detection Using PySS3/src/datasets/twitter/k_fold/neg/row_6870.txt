I feel that if I kill myself, no one would notice.I feel like I need to kill myself. My brothers perfect compared to me. I'm supposed to be just like him, but I can't. I just can't. If I was to kill myself, that would relieve myself of those expectations. But I feel that if I killed myself, that no one would notice, that it wouldn't change anyone at all. I try to hide that I'm very sad about that I can't be perfect like him.  I just can't be perfect.
