He wants to kill himselfSo Like a few months ago I started dating this guy and things didnâ€™t go well he was really cold and had anger issues so we ended up breaking things off but then he apologized and stuff and asked me to be friends with benefits and I just thought oh well heâ€™s not really into me he just wants sex whatever and so I said ok because I mean if thereâ€™s no one emotions involved in it whatever. So anyways I mentioned that Iâ€™m talking to a few other guys a few days later and he got upset and asked me not to do that because he was still into me apparently And he told me that he wants to date me heâ€™s just not sure when he wants to figure things out first I guess because heâ€™s not ready for relationship. Well anyways I would always flirt with him and he would never really flirt back and he would act cold him he would tell me he cared about me but it didnâ€™t feel like it. So today this guy who is my best friend that Iâ€™ve known for 10 years and liked on and off for four got in an argument with me on whether I was pretty and stuff or not and I expressed a lot of issues and he told me that I am his girlfriend now because he feels like he has to protect me from the other guys and I thought that was cute so I was like OK Iâ€™m your girlfriendâ˜ºï¸ So I started dating him and I went to tell my ex what happened and he started screaming at me telling me he hated me and that he was planning on asking me out this weekend and that heâ€™s going to kill himself. So he cut himself really badly but heâ€™s not dying and I convinced him not to die but my boyfriend dude just told me that we should break up until I figure out my shit. And with this ex I asked him why he was so cold and stuff and he told me it was like a defense mechanism from getting hurt because heâ€™s been abused a lot and so he didnâ€™t want to show emotions but when he wasnâ€™t showing emotions it made me feel insecure plus we were kind of toxic but I just canâ€™t stop blaming myself Because Iâ€™m like the only girl heâ€™s over served over and now heâ€™s over here thinking about suicide and cutting himself and I donâ€™t even know where he lives because Iâ€™ve never been to his house so I canâ€™t necessarily call 911 he told me he bandaged up his cuts though and that heâ€™s going to bed and that he should be fine but he doesnâ€™t want to hear from me for a few days And he told me he never wants to get with me and that I hurt him really badly And that he doesnâ€™t care what I do and heâ€™s going to pretend heâ€™s not hurt even though he is. But I canâ€™t stop blaming myself and itâ€™s making me hold back from this guy that I know thatâ€™s really going to treat me right because Iâ€™ve known him for 10 years and I actually trust him and I donâ€™t wanna lose that opportunity with this guy because the other one wants to kill himself and I canâ€™t stop blaming myself over it. What should I do?
