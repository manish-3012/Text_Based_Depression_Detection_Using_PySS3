Some Advice for When It All Feels Like Too MuchFor a really long time, I had felt suicidal. One day, I made an attempt to kill myself, but since I didn't do any serious damage to myself, the hospital sent me home with my parents. After coming home from the hospital, I saw my dogs and thought to myself, 'If I died, what would happen to them?' Whenever your feeling down, just look at your dog, cat, fish, lizard, or whatever pets you have, and say to yourself, "Who will take care of them if I'm not here?" Animals will always love you, no matter what and will always be there for you on the days when life just ends up being too much to handle.
