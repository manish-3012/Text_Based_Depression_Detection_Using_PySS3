No point anymore, there may have not been one in the first place.Every day is shitty. Nothing feels good. The last few days of my vacation have been fucking awful, my parents have been angry at me for 8 hours straight yesterday over my failure in college, I skipped my finals and I skipped class for weeks before hand, this is all my fault, I've failed them, but more than anything, I've failed myself.

They're giving me a second chance to try again in college, and I'm going to try to do things right, but it might not even be worth it. I've got no friends, nothing at all to live for, every time in the past I've tried to meet people I've been met with disgust.

I have the absolute lowest opinion on myself, I'm dumb and not attractive in the slightest. 

More than anything the cause of everything is most definitely my penis size. I have a micropenis about 2.5" long and feel like absolute trash. People are going to blatantly lie to me I can already tell, but I have no fucking chance, I've been a laughingstock throughout my school years and I'm about fucking done with this. Even if I was to get my degree, there would be no point to living out life as a slave to a company and gain no happiness in return. I can't even enjoy my holidays because I'm being criticized nearly every second of the day. 

I've thought of slitting my throat multiple times as it's the quickest thing I have access to. 

I'm even getting yelled at right now, fuck this shit, I'm done, they can fucking complain when I'm dead. The last thing I want to hear about is what those faggots think. I hope this effects them.
