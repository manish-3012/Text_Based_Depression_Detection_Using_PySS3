I need adviceI have my ups and my downs, but mostly downs. I want to try to get straight to the point.

I have been overweight or rather obese all my life really, but it's getting worse. I was happy 2 years ago when I was losing weight and living with just my mom and my brother in an apartment. I dropped 40 pounds from 230 to 190. I am a 5'1 21 year old girl, you can imagine that every pound truly counts. But now I am at my all time high of 248 pounds. I don't know how it happened. I have become truly unhappy with my retail job working in the bakery. I hate my job so much and the customers there, I cry before going in to work. People treat me horribly. I feel incredibably uncomfortable in my uniform now as well. In the last 4 to 5 months I've gained 45 pounds.

I live with my father now and my brother (my mom currently lives with my grandfather, its a long story but basically we moved in with him and my grandma because my grandma had cancer. she passed away, and my grandfather became a horrible person I couldn't stand to be around). I moved out in desperation. My dad allowed me to take his room and I feel horrible for that, he sleeps on the couch in this small apartment. My room is horrible, carpet had been pulled up for only half of it. This place is horrible, but anything is better than being with my grandfather.

I gain weight so easy now, and I try to eat better but I lose so slowly, and then I cave or I binge like crazy and gain 5 pounds. It's hopeless cycle.

I feel like I'd be better off dead. I hate my job and I feel stuck in my life... Like I'll never find happiness ever again, if I ever was happy at all, I've always been sad about my weight but I've sort of become numb to that pain. Although now, I am nearly 250 pounds, and no idea what I want to do with my life, I have no friends; only a boyfriend of 2 years who I hope loves me. I just don't know what to do with my life and my depression and my thoughts.
