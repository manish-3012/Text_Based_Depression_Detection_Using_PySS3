No muscle to live another day.What is the fucking point? As part of the youth, the future seems bleak and nothing matters. Wage slavery is inevitable and suicide just seems rational the more I live in mental hell. Graduating high school is not an achievement since that is expected and no lie it is easy.

I do not think there is anything wrong with me. I think the world is the problem and I may just eliminate myself. Literally cannot take the bullshit any longer. What good is asking for help when it is human nature to be selfish? Why bother for temporary help if I want a permanent solition to begin with? Existence is the problem for me, not living. No strength, no will to survive. Everyday is the fucking same.

Doubt you care and I do not blame you.
