No one would believe me if I told them anyways...I am in my early 40's and I do not want to be here anymore.

The real disappointing part of it all is I am single but not lonely at all, in good shape and rarely have trouble getting a date, educated in two completely different and high demand fields, have traveled and met new people, and have money to live OK. The list goes on but I have had absolutely zero interest in anything for as long as I can remember and use activities to distract me. I'm running out of things to do.

A few years ago I was diagnosed with Recurrent Brief Depression after decades of high functioning depression and not being taken seriously by mental professionals. A psychiatrist even told me â€œSome people are just sad.â€ I have one good day every 4 days with rushing negative thoughts and despair surrounding it. I've tried 6 different types of medications with no affect and have even gone strict vegetarian to see if that would help, which has not.

I will definitely be someone most people would not have suspected would die by suicide. Even the way I do it is anti-climatic. I just want out.

Depression has to be the worst disease anyone can be burdened with. Such a burden.
