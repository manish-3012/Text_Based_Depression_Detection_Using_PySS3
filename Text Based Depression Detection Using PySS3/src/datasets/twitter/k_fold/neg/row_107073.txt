I dont think I would call for helpIf I sat in my shower stall and slit my wrists right now, I dont think I would call for help. I could call to my fiancee downstairs. But I dont think I would. I dont think I would change my mind or regret it.

I'm having a hard time coming up with reasons not to do it.

I'm hoping I will fall asleep first. But if I dont do it tonight, there are so many other nights. So many other ways. I dont know why I wouldn't do it. If not now, then its only a matter of when?
