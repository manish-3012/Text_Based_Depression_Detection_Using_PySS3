Iâ€™ve lost all hope...You literally canâ€™t do anything without being reminded of how much of a pile of shit Humanity is.

Weâ€™re all terrible people.

Weâ€™ve always been terrible people.

We always will be terrible people.

Whatâ€™s the point anymore?

We all deserve the nuclear hellfire thatâ€™s inevitably coming our way.
