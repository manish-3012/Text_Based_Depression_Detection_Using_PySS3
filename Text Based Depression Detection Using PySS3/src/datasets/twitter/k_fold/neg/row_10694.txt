I cant talk with my mom and im suicidalEvery conversation i have with her ends with an argument and im left crying
My parents divorced, Iâ€™m 15 years old and I live with my mom
Iâ€™m trying so deeply to make it work but our characters just collide
Iâ€™ve been depressed since February last year I donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m going to do something I want to go somewhere where I can feel at home but there is no such place
