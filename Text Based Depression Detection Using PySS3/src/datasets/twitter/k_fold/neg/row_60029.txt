I want to die but I don't know what is stopping meI attempted to kill myself by hanging one and retreated(October). After that, I did a lot of research and turned to gas poisoning( nitrogen hypoxia). I am afraid to approach the gas dealers as I am only 17. I am not scared of pain anymore but I don't know why I am still alive or what am I hoping for. sometimes I think I am trapped in life and that feeling is awful. I just wanna die before I graduate from high school.
