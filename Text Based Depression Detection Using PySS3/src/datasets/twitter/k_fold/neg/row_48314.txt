This isn't going to happenI'm dwelling... I take so many meds, I could easily kick it with out taking any for two or three days...

But I won't... I think... 

I keep having these, "It's a Wonderful Life" scenarios... Running through my head...

Life insurance = Bills paid, car, paid, food in kids bellies... Clothes... And hell., you die, everyone gives your family food for weeks... BAMB, food NOW and not fucking bread and peanut butter.

I mentioned this in another post somewhere on here in some thread today or yesterday, Time doesn't really exist that much for me...

I yelled at my 17 year old for being hungry! What kind of fucked up parent yells at their kid because he asks for a dollar to buy something because he is tired of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.

I really laid into him...

I apologized. I felt really bad. I feel worse now.

I know the logic. I know the stresses and the lost moments, and we are all human, and its okay, and he understands and... yup... Still yelled at a child for being hungry. 

I know 17 isn't that young. He is sensitive... HE has made a personal choice in his life to not swear, (I have only heard him ever swear ONCE) To have integrity and self-respect. I am so proud of him.

I have to go... Thanks for letting me vent

I wouldn't kill myself for insurance money. But damn... They would be okay then. for awhile...
