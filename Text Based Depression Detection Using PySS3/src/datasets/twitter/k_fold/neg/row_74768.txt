i don't see any other way outI feel powerless in my life. My psychopathic mother ruined mine and my family's lives, i get ignored by the people i care about the most and everyone just expects me to be fine. i got fired from my first job and then had a PTSD attack at a party and nobody has talked to me since. the girl who i am madly in love with just blocks and ignores me, and everyone at my school thinks i'm some fat, creepy psychopath who want to shoot up the school or something when in reality i don't want to do anything. i don't want to die. i just wish my life would get better but i just don't see it happening. i haven't left my house since the PTSD attack.
