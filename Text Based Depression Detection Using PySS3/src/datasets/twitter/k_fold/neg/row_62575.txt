Sending a message.Day after day its horrible.  Not going to lie I've been depressed every single day since May.  I have some pretty bad physical issues and depression.  Honestly I want the pain to stop, each day is worse and things don't get better.  Not only that, I want to send a message to everyone.  I want them to know I'm not just lazy.  I want them to know how much pain I'm in and they do not support me.
