Passive suicideI look at things this way. Back in 2014-2016, my life was the best it could possibly be for me. The best I could personally ever hope for. I had reached limits beyond what someone of my looks, intellect and social skills should have achieved.

But it was still incredibly shitty and depressing by most people's standards. And I still self harmed and wanted to die. I still had a break down. It wasn't because of underlying mental health issues either but granted they played a part.

Anyway. It would take a miracle, a literal miracle, for me to get back to a place in my life that good. And it won't ever happen, but if it did, I'd still be depressed and want to die. So what's the actual point? None. Something happened that means my mind will never be clear or free again.

So, Internet poster, why don't I just commit suicide? It's fucking hard, part of me is scared, I know it's for the best, but I can't see it happening. So I've been letting myself decline to the point I'll die young.

But that's a shitty way to do it, passive suicide. Because you'll feel worse and worse and get more health issues until you die. So obviously a quick suicide is always best case scenario.

But I'm too much of a pussy bitch for best case scenario. God I could have years left in me. I see stories about people slitting their own throats and I can't help but ask how they got the balls to do that. I mean really. Bro. 

They say it's the cowards way out. Not really. It's more cowardly to starve yourself to death. Now that's torture I'm sure. But think about it.

You're too sad and depressed to live. No hope. But your too scared to physically end your own life. So you sit in the middle, too scared to do anything, and die a very painful and prolonged death. 

But the quick act of a bullet to the head? Man in my mind that takes a serious set of steel balls. Closet I've come is 9 days without food. And I bitched out.

Just my thoughts and opinions anyway
