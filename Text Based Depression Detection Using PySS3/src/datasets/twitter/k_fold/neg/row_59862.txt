Freshman at university hasnâ€™t made a single friend in 3 whole months... 19FI donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I do know that I am socially inept and have been told so by the few people I was brave enough to strike up a conversation with.  It just hurts so bad to be this unlovable. While I have been called â€œawkwardâ€, â€œweirdâ€, etc., I have also been told I am very good looking just as often, so being unattractive is not a factor. No one ever approaches me or strikes up a convo... thatâ€™s supposed to be my job I guess...But the problem is I have crippling anxiety and start to panic; my face turns red, I sweat and I get the shakes. It doesnâ€™t go away until about an hour after, but when I try to go to sleep at night, the only thing I can think about is the conversation. How dumb and awkward did they think I looked? I have a hard time speaking when Iâ€™m having an episode so I unintentionally reverse my sentences and sound like god damn yoda. I also think about the â€œwtf is wrong with this kidâ€ expressions on their faces. I moved to a new city from my hometown for uni. The only friends I have are the ones I made in elementary in my home town. Now I have no one. People avoid me like the plague: there is no eye contact or reciprocated smiles when I try to be friendly to who I walk past. Maybe itâ€™s my body language.. possibly a rbf or bad vibes as well. I canâ€™t do small talk without risking a stress induced aneurysm. Everyone is repulsed by me for whatever reason, and I just canâ€™t figure it out. I have depression and BPD along with GAD and Iâ€™m on a ton of pills to keep me sane, but not even lorazepam makes it easy to chat. Iâ€™m a pariah that no one wants to be in the vicinity of and I donâ€™t know if I can live this way much longer. I get good grades and have gotten into many hobbies during my solitude; Iâ€™m very good at art and music. Despite my talents and looks, I feel like such a loser that would be better off dead because no one wants me around.
