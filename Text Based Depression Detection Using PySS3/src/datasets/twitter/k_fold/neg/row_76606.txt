Why do I keep coming back here again and againNo matter how hard I try to make things right, to do things the right way. It just never fucking works. There is always a obstacle. There is always something wrong. Something has to go wrong every damn time. 

It's a cycle. I can't escape it. No matter how hard I try. No matter how long I try. It always ends here. 

I try to do good, try to be happy. It just never lasts. Why can't it last? Why? Why can't things be alright? What am I supposed to do? 

Why do I even bother trying if nothing is going to be fixed anyway? How the hell am I supposed to get up every time. I just can't. I tried and failed. And I don't know if I even can stand again. 

I try to remember the happy days. And they were happy days, but why don't they last. So much time and hard work you spend, and then it just comes crashing down. Like a building a tower with cards. How do get up again. Why do you get up again. Is it even worth it anymore. Why can't shit just end. It's okay of you didn't bother reading, shit makes no sense. Nothing makes sense anymore.
