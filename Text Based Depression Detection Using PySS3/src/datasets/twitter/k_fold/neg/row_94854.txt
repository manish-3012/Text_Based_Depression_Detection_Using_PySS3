I'm extremely neurotic and it's making my life hellI had an argument with my ex, made a fool of myself and was being very annoying. She ended it with the cruelest message possible. I feel so fucked up by it. It's been 3 months and I still feel depressed because her words destroyed me. They were extremely demotivating because I'm neurotic and things like that always repeat indefinitely in my mind ðŸ˜“ Something died inside of me after it and I'm very scared I'll never get it back again. 

I'm also so incredibly tired of fighting my mind all the time.. Why can't I just be like 'fuck what you've said, I don't care about you..' No, I have to make a big deal of it and let it repeat for months. FUCK. Never contact your ex when it isn't necessary..
