Is it normal to think of killing yourself everyday?I have never been a very happy person and I have very low selfesteem,  I have had bouts of depression from time to time but I thought it was normal, "Everyone is unhappy from time to time" I told myself, sometimes I fantasized of killing myself, when I told my parents that I was sad they said the usual stuff, "be happy", "you are so lucky to be alive" or something like that. When I saw other people I said to myself "How can they be so happy?". Last year  I was diagnosed that I had BPD after I cut myself in bathroom of my college. Now I think of killing myself everyday, no matter how much I try a voice in my head keeps telling me that nothing matters, that I'm a failure, that nothing is going to pay off, that I will let everyone down and that I should kill myself. Thanks to that I can't concentred in my studies, I can't enjoy things I like, I'm scare of saying or doing the wrong thing in front of other people, I don't want other people to hate me. But every time I think "Maybe this is normal, maybe I just want attention, maybe I'm wrong, maybe everyone wants to kill themselfs".

Sorry for my ramble and my bad english.
