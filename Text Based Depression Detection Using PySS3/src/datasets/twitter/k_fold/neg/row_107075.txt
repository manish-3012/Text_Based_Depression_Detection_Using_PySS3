Why should I even stay?I feel awful day in day out, and there's nothing I can do to even start to fix things for another two years. I might not even feel better after that. If my family might not accept me, my friends might leave me, wherever I work might fire me all because of how screwed up my head is, then why should I even try? It fucking sucks to see pictures and hear stories of people who actually held onto something and pulled themselves out of the mud, but if every single day I look in the mirror and I'm disgusted by what I see, if every day I am silently judged by the vast majority of people I see daily, if every day is a battle, then why should I keep fighting? I didn't choose to be this way. I never would have wanted to be this way if given the choice. I have no guaranteed reward or happiness after all of this, and there's a chance I can be denied treatment of the one thing I'm confident will help me to love myself and make the anxiety and depression dissipate, so why not just take some pills right now and be done with it?
