I feel so alone. Anytime someone tries to understand me, they get it wrong and always say they know best. Im a fucking akward and useless retard. Why does anybody want me around other than for thier own sanity? I hate myself so much. Someone please kill me.Im so shit. Ill never be good. I try my best, but I never get anywhere. Im only needed for my friends and family sake and I like them too, but I cant do anything besides play video games and entertain them. Im so akward and I never change, I always fuck up socially and it ends terribly for me always. Im about to fail junior year so yeah, looking forward to that. Also im really looking forward to my friends and families dissapointment. I dont know why I never do anything right, or improve. Idk might kill myself soon but ill just keep playing smash and see how things go.
