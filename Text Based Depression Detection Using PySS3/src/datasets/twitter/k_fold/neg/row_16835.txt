I just need a place to say what I'm feeling without being afraidThis is kinda stupid, but I just needed somewhere to talk where no one knows me.

I'm scared to say anything out loud to really anyone. Years of abuse make it hard to trust and say what's on your mind. I wasn't allowed to be myself - maybe I can soon.

Mentally I'm broken - PTSD, OCD, ADHD, anxiety, depression, you name it. Physically I'm not much better. I've got what the doctors say resembles CP but after 19 years of my life (I'm 19f) they still don't know what's wrong.

I used to be wheelchair bound. They thought I would never walk again. My childhood was abuse and hospitals. I grew up and am trying to change that. I want to escape who they tried to make me be.

Somedays I can walk, other days I can't. Mentally and physically I'm tired. I'm just so tired of this constant fighting and still feeling hopelessly alone with nothing to look forward to.

I'm in college, I've got a boyfriend, I've got medical care. The essentials I have. Yet I still feel dead. I'm blessed. I've got so many nice things I've worked hard for, but I'm still tired.

I feel alone and ignored like always. I'm in pain. I'll never be independent as my physical issues are supposed to escalate with time.

I've been working on myself, trying to healthily lose weight since I used to be too anxious to eat at all. I really try to work out and better my mind. I work till I'm burned out. Till I literally can't anymore and I just break.

That's where I am again. Suicidal thoughts I've had for years, memories of horrific abuse, the phsycial issues. I'm just tired. I want it to stop.

I get it, I'm a fighter. I'm a rock for everyone else. I'm sorry I can't be strong all the time.

I just want to be loved, but I'm not even able to see myself without seeing everything wrong with me. I want to be that person people care about because I care so much about them. I want to be hugged and told that I'm safe for once.

I just want to make it stop.
