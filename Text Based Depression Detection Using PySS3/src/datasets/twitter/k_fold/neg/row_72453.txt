I don't have the energy to live.I just want somewhere anonymous to type how I feel. I almost called 111 because I feel so suicidal. 
I couldn't sleep last night. My anxiety is boiling over, no matter what I do it seems to get worse and worse. 

I went on holiday last week. It was nice to be in the sun. Swimming in the pool and ocean makes me feel like all my problems melt away, I felt happy and care free. But now I'm home, sat in bed in tears wishing I could disappear. I had a panic attack on the plane ride home. I'm not a nervous flyer but I felt so claustrophobic and out of control. 

I hate myself. I need help. 

How do people summon the energy to enjoy life, to work, to see friends, to open up to family, to wash, to put on makeup, to pursue hobbies? 

All I want to do is lie in bed and for to be forgotten about.
