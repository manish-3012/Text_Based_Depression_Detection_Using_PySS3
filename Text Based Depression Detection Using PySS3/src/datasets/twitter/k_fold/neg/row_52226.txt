UPDATE: I'm gonn kms on christmasSo hey again guys hope ur doing well. So I've made a decision. One guy I've been messaging has really helped me turn around how I wanna live and I want to meet people like him. As I mentioned in my last post, my family is absolute shit. I dont want to live for them, or anyone but myself. My life is about me and I decide what happens. People who reached out to me really, thank you, from the bottom of my heart. People dont realise that their words can have an impact and man ur guys' messages of positivity really helped. For those reading this and going through a hard time, I hope you find your light, a reason to live. Because there are many, you just gotta find them. Overall, I'd like to thank you all for your concerns and messages of kindness. Thank you reddit, for helping me get out of a hard place.
