iâ€™m not okayi donâ€™t know what happened but since i woke up this morning i havenâ€™t felt happy and it just kept getting worse and worse throughout the day and i was being productive and everything so i donâ€™t understand

itâ€™s also late at night now and i canâ€™t stop crying and for some reason my head just keeps telling me to kill myself even though i donâ€™t want to, and never before in my life have i heard voices in my head but now as you can guess, i do and i donâ€™t know whose voices they are or what theyâ€™re saying but i canâ€™t take it

i donâ€™t know what to do since iâ€™m just a 15 year old child with ignorant parents

what can i do i really canâ€™t stand this
