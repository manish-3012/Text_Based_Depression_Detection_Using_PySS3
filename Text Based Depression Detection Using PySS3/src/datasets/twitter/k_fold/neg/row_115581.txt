I'm very tired.Maybe someone here can convince me that life in general is worth continuing with. I'm 21 this year, and I've been more or less a shut-in loser for three years. I left high school after realizing I simply lacked the ability to be around large groups or even do something so simple as speaking to people. My only interaction with other human beings comes from contact with people through text online, and rare trips out of my bedroom to get food or other needs.

I'm a disgustingly hilarious parody of the basement dweller trope, albeit outside of a basement. I'd be satisfied with this if it weren't for the fact that every day is the same thing. I wake up, do whatever, then go to sleep. Wake up, do things, go to sleep. Every day has been the exact same thing, and every time I try to muster up the will to go out and actually do things, I fail.

What is there in life for someone like me, exactly? At this point, I'm willing to die just to avoid a life full of disappointing others with my worthless personality.
