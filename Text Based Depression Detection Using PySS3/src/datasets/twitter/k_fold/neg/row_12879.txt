The mods of this sub-reddit are harming the people they are trying to help.By deleting comments you see as "potentially harmful" you are reducing engagement, destroying any meaningful discussion, and trying to surpress and stop your own guilt by cautiously stepping on egg shells, stopping anything you see as potentially catalytic to people you believe are "mentally unstable" (whatever the hell that means).

By trying to divert people's thoughts and feelings through censorship, you are effectively doing more harm by trying to supress natural dialogue that takes place.

You are the worst kind of people to exist. The kind of people who would give a sick child a gallon of ice cream, subsequently make them sicker and more ill, as long as it assuages their own discomfort at being powerless to cure that child's illness.

And the worst thing about this, is that you do it without even realising what you are doing.

You make me sick.
