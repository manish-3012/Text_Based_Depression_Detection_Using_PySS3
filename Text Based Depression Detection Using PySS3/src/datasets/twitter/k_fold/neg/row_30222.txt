AtpAtp im thinking about killing myself before the end of october because nobody seems to care about how I feel. Why should I live if I donâ€™t even care about myself? Nobody likes me. I donâ€™t feel loved at all. Iâ€™m just a disappointment and a disgrace to everyone. Why shouldnâ€™t I kill myself since Iâ€™m the biggest problem. Fuck my life. Iâ€™m really done dealing with this like Forreal. Itâ€™s for the best. Iâ€™m in school and shit has really been making me think. Iâ€™m already very worthless. I feel like a huge bitch. I donâ€™t deserve a life nor do I deserve to live at all. Iâ€™m so done.
