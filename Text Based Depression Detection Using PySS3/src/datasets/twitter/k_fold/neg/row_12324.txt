I can't even kill myself in my dreams.Back before the stress got to me, and sleeping at night became harder, I used to jump straight into lucid dreams. These days, I have to rely on the triggers I've trained myself to realize to take control of the dream. Lucid dreaming was a nice escape. Still is on days that I can get long enough sleep. But a good night's rest is rather rare these days.

Anyway, after a rather loud argument with the parents, I took a nap. My way of shutting everything out for a good hour or two. Sadly during that nap, the argument continued, you guessed it, in my dreams. I managed to say in that dream what I couldn't say in real life. I guess that was my mind's way of really getting out what I was thinking. I still remember the conversation, five hours later.

I took control and called up a knife from my collection. And no these aren't cheap chinese knives. I mean actual quality knives. A blackwashed Kershaw Cryo II in this case. When I opened it, I tried stabbing myself in the head. But then it closed. So I tried again. The knife refused to stay open, and until I woke up, I was just banging the closed knife against my temple crying on the floor wanting to die.

Guess who woke up crying?

Real life sucks, I can't lucid dream on command anymore, and my normal dreams just manifest my inner thoughts. Fun.
