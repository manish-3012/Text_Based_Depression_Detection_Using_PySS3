Hard to find a single positive thing in my whole life. Every day is harder.I'm 28 and I feel like I'm falling apart - mentally and physically. Anything I loved to do has become painful. Running, gym(my back), walks with friends, recently even god damn computer games (my wrist). Can't even swim much before my shoulder starts hurting. And god, I hate swimming.


I used to love having sex, but now I can't even feel my orgasms any more or last longer than 10 seconds. I used to be able to last as long as I wanted to just some 3-4 years ago. I used to have an amazing sex life. The worst thing about this is that it makes me feel like I'll never be with anyone ever again. I'll never fall in love or feel a girl's kiss. The thing is the way I am now - I don't really want to.


How do I find the strength to carry on when there is literally zero things to look forward to. I try every day to stay strong but that reality keeps chipping away at my soul. I'm not suicidal right now but I feel it comming, not today, not this week, but I know I can't do this forever.
