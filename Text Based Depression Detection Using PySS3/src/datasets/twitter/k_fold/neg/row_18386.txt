I am less than nothingI'm 22, and I have nothing. I have no money. I have no job. I have no friends. I have no boyfriend. I have no family that actually loves me... My family hates me. They tell me so. I'm hated.
I have no good thoughts, ever. I have nothing to wake up to. I hate myself, too. I can see why no one likes me. I understand why I have nothing... I don't deserve it. I'm not worthy of happiness, never have been. I just exist.
All I have going for me (I guess) is that I'm a recovering drug addict. I have been clean a few months, but I think about using constantly. It was the only thing that made me happy, yet when I wasn't high, I think it made me feel worse. But I actually had something to look forward to with it. I'm thinking about coping a fix and overdosing to end my disgusting, miserably pathetic f**king life. I'm going to finally do it.
I've honestly thought about killing myself since I was 13 years old, and my life has gotten to the point of being such utter shit, that I'm actually going to do this now. Thanks for reading.
