Not interested in going onSo over the last couple of year the suicidal thought have been growing and growing. After spending lots of time in therapy and having spent two stays in the hospital I have still come up empty. I have been on just about every medication in the book and have yet to really have any complete success. Im surrounded by an extremely supportive family and friends and truly care about them all so much. I myself can have really good day and can enjoy doing thing and constantly try new things in hopes of it helping. I try my best at exercising regularly and eating well enough, but have yet to have it change how I feel. 

The problem for me is more often than not,  I do not feel depressed or unhappy. I just donâ€™t feel much of anything. I donâ€™t feel weight down or a failure or anything. I just donâ€™t have any desire to keep going. I just would prefer to stop. After working through this for so long and diving back as far as I can, I can honestly say I felt this way since I was 5 or 6 years old. Iâ€™m 24 now and really feel like Iâ€™m staying around because I donâ€™t want to hurt my family and friends. I had a sibling take his own life around the same age as me a few years back and I watch it completely destroy my parents and other siblings. I just canâ€™t bring myself to put them through more of that. I feel very trapped in the situation and donâ€™t really know what to do next. I have spent every bit of money I have traveling and trying new places hoping for the best and the feeling has just stayed. I donâ€™t know really where to go from here.
