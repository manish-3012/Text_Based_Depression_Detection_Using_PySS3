matter over mindiâ€™ve thought about this for some time. these are really just undeveloped theories, but they seem to make some sense.

first, this premise: people hate responsibility and will avoid it at all costs. 

â€¢ why are mental issues stigmatized? people donâ€™t want to be responsible for you.

â€¢ why do people brush things aside? avoidance of responsibility.

â€¢ why is it that when someone does ctb, a party is thrown in their remembrance? people hate responsibility, and by praising the dead, they avoid it yet again. surely, if one praises the dead and lauds them, they never could have been at fault or a contributing factor, yes?

thus, every one is self-centered. no exceptions, but people cannot be blamed for *be-ing*.

â€¢ then thereâ€™s crying wolf. just shut up or do it, yeah? no one is a winner with this point. . . i mean, theyâ€™re not actually gonna &gt;!*oh fuck they actually did it*!&lt;

even in the common sentiments such as â€œit gets betterâ€ or â€œget helpâ€, there is the slightest notion of responsible avoidance. just get them help, theyâ€™ll fix themselves. . . right? maybe the only one that makes sense outside of this context is â€œstay aliveâ€. no reason, just do it.

i guess i find myself asking, why care? that extends to myself, even.

second, a problem is not a de facto problem - it is a problem because it is *considered* one. therein lies the truth: opinions are the very constitution of a problem, and not the problem itself. it is a mental judgment of a thing that causes distress, and not the thing itself.

i dunno. too much self-absorption on my part with all this. too much introspection. not enough, though. still donâ€™t know what that is. just another text wall, then.
