If there is a God please listen to me.Take my life instead of someone else who has purpose and a wanting to live. Iâ€™m dead inside and am ready die but I wonâ€™t do it under my own power. Every time I see a tragedy in the news it breaks my heart to know some happy people lost their lives. I hope there are others that feel this way
