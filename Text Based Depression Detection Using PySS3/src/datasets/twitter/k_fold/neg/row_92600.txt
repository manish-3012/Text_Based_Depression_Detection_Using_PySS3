I probably wouldnâ€™t want to die if I had a support networkBut I...donâ€™t. Iâ€™ve never been able to talk to my dad about anything serious. My mom had a mental breakdown last time I tried to breech the subject with her. Thereâ€™s no one else in my family that Iâ€™m really close to. 

I donâ€™t have friends. Usually when people say that they have a large network of people oh their life that are friends, they just donâ€™t consider themselves close to them. I donâ€™t...I donâ€™t have that. I have one person I could text and be like hey letâ€™s hang out, but they donâ€™t really care about me. They never reach out to me first. I understand. Iâ€™m a ghost. No one thinks about me when Iâ€™m not there.

I spent too long being wrapped up in a relationship where all my friends were their friends, so when the relationships ended so did the friendships. Any old relationships, Iâ€™m ashamed to reach out to try and reconcile with them, because Iâ€™m ashamed where mental illness had caused me to be in life. I lost years to being undiagnosed, and now my life is pathetic. I was known as the smart one, and Iâ€™ve done nothing. Even with medication, the schizoaffective disorder, the general anxiety disorder, the major depressive disorder,  the autism spectrum disorder, the PTSD, with all of that, itâ€™s almost impossible for me to function in life.  I work three days and I need four days off to recover.

I want to try going back to school, but I donâ€™t know how I can handle it and work. Iâ€™ve never been able to do it before. Iâ€™ve barely been able to handle school, having to take classes over and over again. I wasted all of the money my parents had set aside for me for college, and Iâ€™ve not even accomplished two years of it. 

And I have no idea what I want to go back for anyway. My dad says to do something you like or youâ€™ll never stick with it but the problem is I donâ€™t like anything. Nothing makes me happy. Even with high doses of medicine Iâ€™m still not god damn happy. The thing in other people that gives them drive, gives them joy, makes them want to get up in the morning, makes them fucking content, that thing is fundamentally broken in me. I just want to sleep. I just want to sleep.

Therapy. Iâ€™ve tried therapy. God how Iâ€™ve tried therapy. I donâ€™t know if it did any good. A special interest of mine is psychology. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been given some mind shattering revelation, been told anything that I didnâ€™t already know. And knowing that the only person who cares about my problems, the only person that I can talk to, is someone Iâ€™m paying to care? That doesnâ€™t exactly make me feel great.

Iâ€™m desperately lonely. But I know Iâ€™m not worth the trouble.
