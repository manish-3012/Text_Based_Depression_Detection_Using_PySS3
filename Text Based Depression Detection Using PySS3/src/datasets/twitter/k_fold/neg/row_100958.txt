I Almost Went Through With Killing MyselfI've been to to counselors but they aren't really doing much for me, ill feel okay for a bit but then my mood  plummets down to where it usually is. Yesterday I couldn't stand being home so I went for a walk, got a drink from a cafe and sat down on a bench. With the road behind me I suddenly got invaded by the thought of just jumping into traffic. This usually happens but today it was much more intense. I even typed out a suicide letter on my phone, I really wanted to do it. I then got up and then just walked home.
