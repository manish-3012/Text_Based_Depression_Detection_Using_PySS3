Mom is tearing down my confidenceOver the past few days, mom has been reminding me over and over that she doesn't see a future for me. That I'll never get a job, that I'm not qualified for anything. It hurts me. I'm a sixteen year old girl, I've had depression for a year and social anxiety for one and a half year. I'm antisocial, and mom doesn't understand me at all. She looks at me like I'm an robot. I won't mourn or feel sad for anybody I don't like if they're hurt. I won't swim in the sea either, that's something my mom hates. 

I got depression and mayor anxiety one and a half year ago because I found out that I'm a lesbian, but my family didn't handle the news well when I came out to them. After that, I fell head over heals in love with a classmate, my best friend. She was okay with it, but I became slightly unstable because of hormones and being in love, which caused mom to scream at me, in front of my family "You're a psycho!" it hurt me a lot, since I was extra vulnerable to comments. I had many sights of me swimming further and further out in the sea until I drowned, or jumping from a tall cliff to end it, but I'm scared of self harm.

I don't know what to do. It sucks to be me, and my mom is my problem. I'll live on a boarding school nearby once school starts again, but I don't know how it'll go. I'm not like the others at the school. I don't share sexuality and view on life a.k.a. Religion with them. I only applied because it's a musical school.
