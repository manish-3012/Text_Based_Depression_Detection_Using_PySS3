I donâ€™t see a reason to live.So here am I. Iâ€™m writing this because Iâ€™m really close to end it all for good.
I donâ€™t wanna live anymore tbh.
I donâ€™t have any reason to stay alive. 
I only have reasons to end it. Everyday bad things happen , small thing or big. It doesnâ€™t really matter, because all this bad shit that is happening to me just stack up to the point I canâ€™t take it anymore.
My mind have limit for all the bad things that it can take , and I think i have reached this limit.
I canâ€™t take it anymore it hurts so bad to live with all the memories and feeling that are hunting me everyday.
I tried to improve my life, but I donâ€™t fell any different. So whatâ€™s the point of living...
I canâ€™t really turn to anyone, I have couple of friends I havenâ€™t spoke to in years. 
I donâ€™t talk to my mother and I think my father is disappointed in me, when he was my age he was such a great person and Iâ€™m failure.
My colleges are making fun of me and I canâ€™t really blame them, cause Iâ€™m such a toxic and bad person.

Iâ€™m really thinking that after my shift ends I will go to my local mall and buy some booze (so I will have courage to do it) and then I will hang myself. I have already find a tree where I will hang myself. Before I will do it, I will call cops and tell them that I found a corpse in forest so my body wonâ€™t rot here for long.

Is there someway I can cope with all that thoughtâ€™s in my head?? Because now it seems like suicide is best thing that solves every problem.
