no one caresi feel like i didnâ€™t get a say in how my life is turning out. like i wasnâ€™t responsible for my depression, my anxiety. currently, i feel separated from my mental state. as if it were itâ€™s own being and i had no say in its actions. i donâ€™t understand why everyone criticizes me for being this way, if i wasnâ€™t responsible for it in the first place. 

why doesnâ€™t anyone want to help me? does anyone even care what happens to me? doesnâ€™t my mother want whatâ€™s best for me? then why is she against medication? donâ€™t my friends want whatâ€™s best for me? then why are they leaving me on read, knowing that i am currently in a rough, emotionally unstable state? 

or am i the one at fault here. 

i donâ€™t want to kill myself, but at the end of the day i feel as if itâ€™s best for everyone involved.
