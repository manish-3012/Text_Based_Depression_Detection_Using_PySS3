Life seems bleak.As a kid growing up I've always felt like this world held potential, as an American male, born into a good home with a father and mother I had high hopes. That all dropped when my family broke up, I started living with my new step-father after I lost my house because of my father, my step-father was verbally abusive at point and made fun of me constantly. Even if it was joking a kidding, it hurt my confidence, not to add to it I had horrible acne on my face that made me a social outcast at school - I became more and more asocial day and year after year, eventually this year I began to evem start shaking when heading to school some days due to the social-anxiety I now experience. For the past 3 years I have been on-off dating a girl that has cheated on me multiple times and has still always ran back, each time I've taken her back and been angry with myself for ever loving her. I'm a genuinely good person, actually highly intelligent too and I give to people even when I don't have enough for myself - always muttering under my breath cursing myself for being nice. I recently went to a football game for school and got a bunch of items with sugar in them just to try to help cope with stress or at least suppress it - this only lead to me having a freakout and almost passing out from the speed of my heartbeat. I just feel like becoming an adult in this day and age seems bleak and unforgiving. I wish I had someone I could truely trust, as I was raised on the previous generation's morals of being a good trustworthy person, but it seems that's no longer of value in this world. I feel like I should just give up, let the depression, sadness and weakness take over. I've given up on hiding it all, it doesn't seem worth it - nothing seems worth it anymore.
 
TL;DR: Born into nice family, divorce, see world for what it is, learn how bleak and worthless life is and begin to feel like giving up.
