I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m cut out for existenceIâ€™m tired. Honestly, exhausted. I know no one likes me. I have one friend and honestly I think itâ€™s because sheâ€™s too depressed to find any other friends. When she tries, sheâ€™s better at it than i am so I know she could. Iâ€™m ugly, I hate my body, my face, my voice, the way I talk, how much I talk. I love being around people, love going out and partying and having fun. But I get so anxious and shut down and then I get awkward and no one wants to talk to an awkward ugly chick. Simple facts. 

I have BPD, depression, anxiety. Meds donâ€™t work. They either make me feel sick or I abuse them. Iâ€™ve tried killing myself 3 times and Iâ€™m only 23. How many attempts until it works? 

I have a fiancÃ© that loves me, a stable job that pays well, I have the opportunity to go to school with only moderate amounts of loans. And still. Iâ€™m unhappy. I have to be broken somewhere. Not every person can be cut out for life, right?
