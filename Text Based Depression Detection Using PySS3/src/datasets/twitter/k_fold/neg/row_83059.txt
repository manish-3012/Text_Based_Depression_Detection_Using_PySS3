An interesting title, who knewTonight/tommorow morning I plan to hang myself in the woods not far from my families home. Itâ€™s cold outside so i need to drive, I donâ€™t want them to find me or my car. I should hope to vanish. Iâ€™ve lost everything I hold dear, a son my partner my everything. 
Iâ€™ve got everything I need, Iâ€™ve tied the knot that should end my life over 50 times. And I think I should be able to find peace at last.
