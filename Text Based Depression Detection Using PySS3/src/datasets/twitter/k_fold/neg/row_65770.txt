My 6 Year Friendship EndedSo I don't know if this belongs here because I would never kill myself ever. I'm honestly afraid of death and what comes after it. Before I tell you how I feel and what not I should explain what happened.
      My friendship of 6 years just ended on bad terms I guess. There was a fight and then we resolved it and he just ended it and stopped caring. Me and my other best friend are extremely depressed and I honestly want to die even though I can't do it. I want to die but at the same time I'm really afraid. We've always got in arguments that "ended" our friendship but this time I know its real. 
      I just need someone to talk to or just help me because I honestly don't know what to do anymore.
