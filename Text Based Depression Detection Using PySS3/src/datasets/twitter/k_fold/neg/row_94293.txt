I really donâ€™t feel like I can go on anymore.I just graduated about a month and a half ago and Iâ€™ve been working full time at my dads construction company. I had severe depression throughout Junior year and Senior year that made me unable to get the energy to talk to many people, made me secluded and always made me feel like actual garbage. It went away right after graduation for about a month, mostly because of a girl that I met. Long story short, while most of the time with this girl is great, sometimes she makes me feel like shit, and seriously makes me consider suicide. About 5 minutes ago I held a loaded shotgun under my head and tried to pull the trigger. I canâ€™t do it yet, but Iâ€™m really getting closer as time goes on. What is the point of living? My job sucks, and literally crushes my soul, every girl I have ever dated has treated me like garbage at least occasionally and I just havenâ€™t been able to find a point to living for years. Iâ€™m scared of what is going to happen to me soon, but I also really want all of this to end. I seriously canâ€™t take it anymore.
