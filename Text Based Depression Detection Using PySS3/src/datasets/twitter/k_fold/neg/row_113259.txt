Im a cancer in my family and completely worthless.Im a 22 year old male, ive been dealing with depression for sometime now. I went back to university after having trouble with my depression. After the first semester back I had passed everything, felt good like i was making a change in my life, then today 2 weeks back I am no longer enrolled in classes and have been kicked out. I choked on my midterms / finals and didnt do as well as was expected of me (being a drop out the first time around). I had panic attacks and have been using all sorts of medications(doctor prescribed) to attempt to deal with my anxiety. I am smart on homework / assignments / labs i never got lower then 90%, but i fucked up the big exams. I wanted to do well, i studied i did my homework, but i just couldnt handel the exams / midterms. I wanted to do something with mylife, ive had a good childhood a good family, parents who love me, and supported me though everything, i wanted to give something back i had a dream of working for doctors with out boarders, i knew how much work it would take and i really threw myself into and gave it my all.

I feel like a cancer in my family, i hate myself with every fiber of my being, im sitting next to a box cutter, i want to slash my face and body with it to show everyone how i feel about myself. 

I havent killed myself yet because i dont want my mom to find me, and ruin the value of my parents house. But i dont know how much longer i can hold on. I tried my best and i fucking failed because im a worthless piece of shit. Its not like i have a reasonable condition for this, im not a drug addict or an alcoholic, im just a whiney little bitch who deserves nothing more to end up in the ground, where i can stop being a burden on everyone around me.

I keep calling a suicide hotline but i dont wnat to waste their time, i odnt think i will kill myself today but im sick of being this person and being a waste of space. Im nothing, im a nobody. Im just tired of it all,.

Update: Called a crisis hot line, calmed down and took an ativan. Then booked an appointment for monday with my doctor to get  on some stronger meds, which i clearly need at this point. Would like to thank everyone for the kind words, and letting me vent i highly appreciate it.
