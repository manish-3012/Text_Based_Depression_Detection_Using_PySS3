I feel shocked by this strong suicidal feelingI'm sorry. I honestly have no one else to talk to.
It's 5AM and I've been up all night. I'm scared of going to sleep, but I don't know why exactly.

It started last thursday. It's so fucking strong. I'm 22, and I've never, ever felt this much hopelessness. 

I've been crushed and sad before. Even, I don't know, sadder than how I feel right now. This isn't sadness. It's a heavy pressure in my whole body, especially in my head.

A void in my mind. I can't think straight.

I never would have imagined this feeling would be so fucking strong. I've been thinking about this constantly. About just ending it all. This is so so strong. So fucking strong.

I'm sorry. I'm just extremely lonely and scared right now. I don't know why I would even want to reach someone. It's just instinct I guess.
