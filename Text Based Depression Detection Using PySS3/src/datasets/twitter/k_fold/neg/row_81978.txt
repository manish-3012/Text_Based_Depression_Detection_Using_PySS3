Never ending QuarantineSo I normally don't post to reddit but I'm only doing this in the vague hope that someone can relate. Lately, I've been seriously contemplating suicide after years of having dormant suicidal thoughts, the event that probably triggered this was that I had once again, failed an exam I need to pass in order to obtain the license for my field. Unlike before, I don't feel any sort of real regret and I feel completely numb after years of failure of not achieving goals and if that's not enough, neglect from those around me. My friends and family aren't all that prevalent in my life and quite frankly, they wouldn't give a shit until I'm actually dead and act like I mattered to them.  

I'm tired of failure, being unattractive, my disabilities that hold me back (dyspraxia, depression, anxiety etc) and sick of lacking much connection with anyone. The only consistent thing about my life is that it's been a never-ending quarantine and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore. The few things that gave me some bit of joy and distraction (mainly video games) have completely worn off and been a bit more detrimental and by this point it's just too late for me to even catch up to those around me. 

Idek if anyone can relate to this, maybe it's all just me but I'd like to think that it isn't. Can anyone relate?
