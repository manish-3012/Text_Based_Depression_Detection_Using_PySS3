My Dark MindHey i have a Problem that i take every thing hard on me. I have the feeling everyone hates me. I have the feeling i am worthless and useless. I also feel like i cant do anything right as if my existence only makes problems. I am not sure if i feel like the right gender or even if i have right right Sexual Interesst. I startet to Cut myself again in the legs so i can wear my mask everyday. Every time i try too be happy the voices inside me make me feel bad again i just cant take all the hate inside me. I feel like everyone would be happy when i would be gone. I cry and drink and cut every day because i cant take the pain. I got suicidal again and everything just falls apart. I dont want all that anymore i cant take it anymore and day by day i feel like if i snap it will end my suffering forever
