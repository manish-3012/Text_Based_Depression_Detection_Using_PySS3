"You souldn't mess around with suicide it isn't fun..."Why people around me think I'm messing around and joking when I open up and say what is happening with me?

I have always been the happy guy from the group doing things by impulse but in the past few months it has changed. The regrets of dumb decisions are almost impossible to handle. But when I search for help I get the same response "Oh that's not funny" and they ignore me thinking I'm fine.

I'm tired of hiding my pain with a smile why they don't get it? Almost done with this life. Soon enough everyone will see the pain I felt.
