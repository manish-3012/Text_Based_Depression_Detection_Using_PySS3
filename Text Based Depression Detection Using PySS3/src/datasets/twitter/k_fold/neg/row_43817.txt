Tried to kill myself early this morning, rope snapped and I still feel the sameI've heard countless stories of people who attempted suicide, lived, and went on to regret it change their whole views/life yadda yadda, I tried to kill myself this morning, using a rope I found in my parents' garage and I guess it pretty flimsy as it snapped and I fell to the floor, knowing that it could've all been gone in that moment doesn't make me feel shocked back to senses at all. It makes me upset I have to keep fucking going. I honestly wish that shit worked cause now I have to find a better way to end it.
