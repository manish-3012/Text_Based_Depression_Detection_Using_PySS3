My own experience regarding suicidal ideationsWhen I was a child, I suffered from anxiety although at times, I can play and talk with others. Almost normal. Three vehicular accidents had occurred to me, two of them were from my childhood days. One of them is when I was from 9th Grade, the time where my first glimpse of suicidal ideation and existential crisis occurred. At first, I did not care. But as time goes by, the anxieties and suicidal ideations manifest in me. One good thing is that I have yet to commit suicide. I have researched about cheap and effective ways to commit suicide. I do not believe in myself and in my own potential as an individual. I indulge in self-loath and pessimistic philosophies. Mood swings also happen frequently. Mental breakdowns, impulsive thoughts, you name it. What can I do?
