Hoping The Universe Picks MeI am not suicidal. Not anymore. I have come to grips with my "depression voice" and know its tricks. And it still drags on me, even more now in the past 6 months. I am at my worst mental state that I have been in the last 8 years. My mind is constantly feeling those tell-tale pains. I am desperate to stop these feelings and be at peace. 

But I won't kill myself. That part of my mind that is willing to end it is no longer there. Instead, I have turned to the universe and am constantly hoping that it picks me for death. An accident, car crash, random act of violence, freak happenstance. I want to be ended, but want the responsibility taken from me so my family doesn't wonder for the rest of their lives why I killed myself. 

It's a coward's move, I know. Such a millennial thing to do (sksksksk, roflcopter). But my depression voice is that thing that kept me from killing myself last time, so I know it would happen again, so it's no use trying to get by it.
