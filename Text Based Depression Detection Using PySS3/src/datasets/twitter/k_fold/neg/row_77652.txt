To diewill be awesome, I mean no more stupid people, no more bills, pain, work, waking up. Oh man, why I shouldn't die? These perks are to die for. Fuck the other shit. "Well dude, yo fam will miss you" or " well dude, when you die, this is it." or "well dude, life is precious. Fuck all of that. Thing is that suicide is very hard, but not impossible. I will try anything to kill myself...but it has to kill me. I got a few ideas tho.
