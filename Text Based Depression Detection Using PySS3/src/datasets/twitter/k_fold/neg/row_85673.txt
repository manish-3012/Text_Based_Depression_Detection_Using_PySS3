i always think of suicide but no courageAlways when i think about commiting suicide i realize  it is just too difficult and i am too scared of the pain and death etc

always when i want to do it i think if i can commit suicide i can do something more cool like going to the jungle and die there or something risky fun behaviour..

and than i am actually to mentally weak to do those things landing in a vicious circle
