want to kill myself. don't know why. feeling won't stop.i've felt like this as long as i can remember, at least since i was 14 (i'm 20 now).  nothing is overly wrong with my life but every single day i put this facade on and pretend be to be content, happy even.  nobody knows how i feel, i come off as a perfectly happy fun to be around guy, but every day i consider killing myself and the myriad ways i could do it, who would be affected, how they would be affected, why they would be affected, everything.  i can feel the facade breaking and i don't know when it's going to shatter.
