Medical help is too expensive and its going to be the reason I'm going to be deadI overdosed last night. I didn't intend to, but when your on ambien you do stupid shit. I've overdosed about six times. I planned to hang myself. I've gone to inpatient two times. I did a partial hospitalization program. I need to suck it up, don't I? The hospital recommended that I needed to go to therapy twice/week to not relapse. But that would be $250/week. I can't do that. They also put me on a mood stabilizer that costs $600 with a savings card they gave me. My copay without the savings card was $1200. All that would be 

I stole from my mom, I drove drunk, I am an addict, I've made people uncomfortable, I treat my friends like therapists, I am financially irresponsible, I stole my brother's pain pills, and I use people. 

I'm one of those piece of shits you hear about with a toxic personality. I have a moral duty to kill myself. I can forgive myself. And to top it all of, I'm having a pity party. I imagine I will get responses to kill myself and that I'm a piece of shit in the comments. I absolutely know I will.

Berate me until I have the courage to do it.
