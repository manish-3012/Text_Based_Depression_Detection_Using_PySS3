Am i with depression or i am just being dramatic?I very often feel that i cannot do anything right, is so annoying. I am really bad at eveything and my grades are often F and C, but i think i will need to repeat year. My friends say i need help because is not normal that i feel that i am stupid and useless everytime. I have been like this for 3 years and idk if it is real depression or i am just being dramatic. I often feel without appetite, my family says i am too thin, and many times i want to kill myself because without me, the world would be beutiful, and what the hell does a retarded person can do to the world, nothing! I would have killed myself if i wouldn't have met a friend, that really helps me a lot. Should i tell my mom about this? Do i need a psycologist? And also, is there any form i can find out i am no retarded and that i am very good with something?
This would help a lot because rn i have only 1 friend that helps me about this because the other ones say that i am just being dramatic
