Success/money/relationships aren't the cureI see a lot of posts about people, mostly young individuals, being unhappy with their lives and thinking that they would not be depressed if they had money, or were better looking and found an attractive partner, or were 'successful'. I used to think the same a couple of years ago. But then I achieved most of those things. 

 My family went from being poor to attaining a decent amount of wealth. I was a failing student but pushed myself and was able to improve my grades and attend a good university. I started working out a lot and am became more 'attractive'. I have the opportunity to marry an amazing person.

 But I'm not happy at all. Actually I feel even worse now because I realize all those things were an illusion and there really is no cure. I was suicidal before, and I'm more suicidal now. The dark feelings just manifest themselves differently. People say 'things get better', and that may be true, but 'things' aren't the problem in the first place. Some of us are just broken individuals, and we will struggle until the day we die, no matter what. 

 I have people who care about me and that is what forces me to keep going. It feels like blackmail. 'Don't try to escape the pain, otherwise, your loved ones will be hurt beyond words!'  I pray every night that I don't wake up, I hope the universe listens someday soon.
