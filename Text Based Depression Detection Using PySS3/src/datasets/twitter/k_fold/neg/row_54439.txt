Just ventingBehind some smiles, there is a story of tears shed in solitude and the helplessness of seeing no other way than death. When I commit suicide, my friends and my family will not know why. They haven't seen my struggles. They have only seen the happy, optimistic mask I put on. They have only seen the person who when faced with any problem says "yeah, this can be solved" or "oh, it is just a minor inconvenience". They don't know that is because I am fighting a losing battle with myself. I wish I had a shoulder to cry on but I know that if someone asks me how I am doing, I will reply "great" and that would be the end.
