Streetlight Manifesto - A Better Place, A Better Time


[Here's a link to the lyrics](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/A-Better-Place-A-Better-Time-lyrics-Streetlight-Manifesto/89B29D44FCA00CF348256E0000063652), this song really hits close to home, but also reminds you that life will carry on. I hope this helps someone out.
