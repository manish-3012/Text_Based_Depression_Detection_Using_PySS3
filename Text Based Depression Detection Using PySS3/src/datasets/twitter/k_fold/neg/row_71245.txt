My dad admitted he doesn't love or care about me...at the end of an argument that started over me giving a tip to a cashier. 

He said, "I don't care about you! Go move out as soon as possible!"

My mom just keeps trying to tell me why I'm wrong and dumb and stupid.

I've cried enough over the past hour to give myself a headache. 

If I was dead, I wouldn't have to deal with them anymore...
