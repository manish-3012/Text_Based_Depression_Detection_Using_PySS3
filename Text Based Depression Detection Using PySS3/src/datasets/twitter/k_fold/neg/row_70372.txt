Can someone tell me why I should live?So, hi today I've gotten physically abused threatened to have the police called on me for doing nothing get put into a mental hospital and screamed at all day and at school I had 2 mental breakdowns all my friends full on fucking ignored me, my bf well he wont respond to my texts and he hasn't for the past 2 days my family obviously doesn't care they cant even tell that I'm suicidal asf I've slit my wrists before but I've gotten caught I'll never cut my arms again however I will cut other places but I cant deal with this abusive shit anymore and yes I could call the police but they would take my parents side so that wont help and music is my one coping method that's not harmful and that's what I'm doing whell typing this but it's not helping well the only other non harmful coping method is hanging with my bf but hes not responding and he wouldn't be able to come over anyway so can someone plz tell me why I should live? I literally have zero will to live
