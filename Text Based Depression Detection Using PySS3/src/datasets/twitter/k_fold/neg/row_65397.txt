I'm about to be homeless... againI can't do it another time. I have plans that if I can't secure a job within 30 days that I'm going to take the bungie cords in my truck and hang myself. 

My mother isn't mentally stable and can't hold down a job, she quit another one today and when I confronted her about it she said I could get the hell out. 

I have college credit and am very smart, why the fuck are there no jobs?
