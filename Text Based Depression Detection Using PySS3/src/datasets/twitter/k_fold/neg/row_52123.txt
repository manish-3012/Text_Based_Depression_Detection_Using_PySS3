Broken and runningI never know what to say. I hit rock bottom if im posting here i suppose. Im jealous of so many people. How happy and carefree they seem. Im not a good person.I dont think im ever gonna feel good about myself Im a toxic. sick. horrible. I hate myself and one day ill get angry enough were ill finally just do it. I tied belt to the railing and put it around my neck to know how it would feel. But i didnt jump off the chair. I had a gun but could not figure out how to take off the safety. Nothing is worth livin for anymore. So why dont i just kill myself and get it over with instead of suffering everyday. I dont have anything really complying to say. I never do. i know it and there no need to hide it anymore. Ill NEVER EVER be good enough to do anything i want.(Vague i know) Im inferior to everybody and everything. Everything i do can be done better by some else. Im a waste of resources. I was doomed the minute the sperm fertilized the egg.
