Avicii's deathWhen I first heard the news that he had passed I hoped so much that it wasn't suicide. As a producer myself, all I want in this life is to be as successful as he was, and it really makes me question if I should even keep trying. The only thing that has been keeping me going for the past few years is my music and the hope that one day I'll be famous/successful, but I'm now starting to realize that neither of those things can prevent someone from being suicidal.
