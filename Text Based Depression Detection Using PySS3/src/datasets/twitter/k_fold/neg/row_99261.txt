And here I am. At the end of it all.I'm ready. I feel light and free now. I've been so tired. I'm tired of being walked on, i'm tired of being nice, i'm tired of being strong. I've been so nice to the people around me. I was so nice to him, and now look where I am. No one even liked him but i stayed faithful, I have always been there. I have typed out my note in my college towns McDonalds and I ate a hot fudge sunday because that's what you do before something like this right? I have a large cup of antifreeze and it smells quite good. I've said my goodbye's in the least alarming way possible. I love you all in my life. But i need to do something for me now. Goodbye Reddit, i've lurked on here for quite a while, you've helped. My last goodbye is for my sister. My last family member. If there is a God may he be a merciful one, for I am about to meet my maker.
