The mildest annoyance and inconvenience will immediately make me think of suicideIt was all so much better before my parents decided to bring a life into this mess of a world we live in. I can't find peace in life so I have no other choice. All the generic advice online has no effect on me. I don't remember a time where I had no worries in the back of my mind. I have no friends irl and no loved ones irl. I have a few online friends that I rarely chat with but I even question if they care about me. I care about my one friend a lot and she's great but I just don't feel like telling her whats on my mind. She's suffered enough and for her to care about someone else thats depressed will just pull her down with me. 

I wasn't built to thrive in society. I simply don't have the genetics and I wasn't raised to become anyone special. It's all far too complicated for me. Nothing makes me happy, nothing excites me. Every day I'm bitter and angry because I have to share an apartment with my shitty family. School and work is causing much of my sadness. I can't describe to you how much I hate school. I've tried different schools but I hate all of them. No subjects are interesting to me. I can't get a job because I'm stupid, useless and high on anxiety and BDD. So I'm stuck. Suicide is the answer. My life isn't significant.  I'll take my life because life is just not for me. Some people like being alive but I don't. Now I just have to figure out a painless way to do it which is easier said than done.
