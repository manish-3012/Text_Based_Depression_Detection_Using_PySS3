I canâ€™t do it anymoreSince the past 5 years I have been suicidal and every years seems to be getting worse. Every aspect of my life is so horrible and everything keeps going wrong. Here are some of the reasons why I want to die: Iâ€™m not smart and Iâ€™m not doing that great in school even though I study so hard. Iâ€™m insecure about the way I look. I donâ€™t have any real friends. I keep embarrassing myself constantly. No one cares about me and I feel so unwanted. My parents prefer my brother over me because heâ€™s smarter and better looking. My â€œfriendsâ€ keep treating me like shit and I have to stay with them or else I will be completely alone. Iâ€™m not very good at making friends I feel like people donâ€™t want to be associated with me. I have gotten bullied a couple of times and I canâ€™t stop overthinking about all the things that hurt me in the past. I donâ€™t know what I want to do in life. I hate feeling this way and I just want everything to end. I know a lot of people have it worse than me but itâ€™s just too hard for me to handle. I tried to kill myself a couple of times but I wasnâ€™t able to. I had hope that things may be better but itâ€™s judging getting worse and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
