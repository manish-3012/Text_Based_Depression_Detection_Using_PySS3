Being alive just hurtsI hate every minute of it and I am so close to ending it. I have a bunch of medication that I could overdose on to get seratonin syndrome, which I'm pretty sure would kill me. It feels like an effort to even press these keys right now. Everything feels like such an effort. I just want it to stop.

I don't know if I have the courage to go through with it, but I really hope I do.
