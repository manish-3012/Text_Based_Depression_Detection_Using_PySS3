Feel so empty and aloneIâ€™ve never felt so alone and lost as I do at this point in my life. Iâ€™m in my 40s and I know itâ€™s not that old, but I feel my better days are behind me. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost everyone Iâ€™ve ever cared for. I get treated like shit by my boyfriend. I can leave him. Iâ€™m not able to financially support myself alone. I know a shitty reason to stay with someone but thatâ€™s not the only reason. I do care for him but I donâ€™t know how he really feels about me. I just want happiness again in my life. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever have it. I want to be motivated again. Like I used to be. I want to have something to look forward to in life. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s even possible for me to physically feel any happiness or joy. I just donâ€™t. I feel so dead inside. Iâ€™ve often thought about killing myself because it just doesnâ€™t seem worth it to keep on going like this anymore. I donâ€™t want to hurt my daughters who are now grown up. But I also donâ€™t even have a relationship with my youngest anymore. I donâ€™t think she would even care if I wasnâ€™t here anymore. Iâ€™m just constantly sad and donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll ever be able to get out of this. No matter how many pills my dr tries to throw at me. :(
