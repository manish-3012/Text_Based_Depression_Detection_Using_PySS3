My life is getting worse and I feel like the only way to help myself would be to end itI really wish i wouldn't wake up tomorrow, everything that could go wrong in the past few months, has. The only person who makes me happy is enlisting next month and will be gone for 4 months, i have to be with my abusive family for at least 6 more months. I just want to move with him, we were planning on moving for months and it made me so happy. I would move on my own but i don't know if it's safe for me to be alone, i don't have anywhere else to go. I feel like if i was enough for him to be happy he would choose to do something that he knew didn't hurt me, but i also know it's not fair to feel that way. He's my fiancÃ©. I really wish i could die without hurting him. I was diagnosed with schitzoaffective disorder a few weeks ago, I've been going to therapy for a little over a month, I'm trying to see the psychiatrist at the same clinic but my insurance hasn't gone through and i can't until it does and I'm getting sicker. I'm not okay at all and I'm getting worse.
