If there was a painless wayIf there was a painless way to do it if probably would have a few days ago, I guess I have to wail until I get my hands on a gun. 
I'm so tired of school. I'm tired of feeling like no one cares about me. I'm sick of my mental state and how every thing hurts me and scares me and makes me cry. When I think about cutting my wrist, that way, in the shower it makes me tear up. I don't want to, but it's going to happen soon. I just want to shoot myself these days.
