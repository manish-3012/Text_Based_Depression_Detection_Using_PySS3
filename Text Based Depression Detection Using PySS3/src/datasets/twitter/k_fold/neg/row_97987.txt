I set the dateIn August of 2016 I was hospitalized after my second suicide attempt. Today, I've set my new date. I'm hopefully not going to fail this time. This place isn't where I'm meant to be. Things don't feel right. I know giving up isn't the right move, but I'm not strong enough to keep going. 

edit: the date passed and I didn't do it. still fighting through all this bullshit.
