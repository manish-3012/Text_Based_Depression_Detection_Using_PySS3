I hate myselfIve been dealing with suicidal thoughts now for about...6 years now, it all started when my family on my dads side started dying, first my grandpa, then my dad, my greatgrandmother, my moms dad, my grandfather...list goes on...all of them were extremely close and my dad i bairly got to know besides the fact he loved me and the only time i got to see him was in a casket at his funeral...i dealt with bullying from people at colorado in the elementry school and middle school, one in elm trying to get me expelled for fake hurting him, middle school was worse, kids harrasing me all day, hitting me, calling me names, making fun of my long hair (im a male Cheyenne) and whats worse is the teachers and the principal condoned it...im not joking they let it happen finally after leaving woodland park middle school, i spent most of my freshmen year on online school, Alone, then we heard my moms dad had gotten cancer, my mom dropped everything and stopped working to come help moving us out of our small cabin in the woods which i loved and was a home my dad got us to rent back in colorado, when we got out here to Massachusetts via driving and flying, we took care of my grandmother and my grandfather, he got several cases of melanoma, lung cancer, he had half a lung, had a pace maker, and was in his 70s, on valentines day 2 years ago, he died, cause the hospitals staff overdosed him on steroids cause they were not paying attention, we now take care of his wife who is mentally ill due to past issues and her own insufferable ways. Ive had very little friends in my life, i had a few only to be taken away via the bullies back in school, or too few hang out with me, part of me feels like people hate me, i hate me...ive never had a relationship cause of this, i almost had one but before my girlfriend and i could meet since we met over online, she got brain cancer...and last but not least im not un employed, tried joining several jobs only ever got one which was aweful, to sum it up one of the worst things was getting beaten up by patrons and not getting a bathroom food or regular break for a 12pm to 1am shift at a local farm for a event where i dressed up in a costume for halloween.

My life is hell, ive never gotten to be happy, ive been plauged by suicidal thoughts day in and day out, i dont wanna act on them, but, its like torture...to myself by myself

I hate myself i feel people hate me i feel worthless and i cant find any kind of way i can make my life better...
