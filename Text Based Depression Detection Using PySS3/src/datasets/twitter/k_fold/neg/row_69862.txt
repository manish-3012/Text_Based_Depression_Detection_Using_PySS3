I should get an award for being the most trashy personI don't make anybody happy or feel better. I make everyone get annoyed and bored. I'm too needy. I'm so weird and random. I'm just a complete idiot i can't believe how can someone be this stupid. Everyone hates me and would want to replace me. I would never be anyone's first choice. I'm so disgusting. I'm too quiet and shy, awkward. I'm a disappointment. Everyone just likes me to laugh at me because of how trash i am. I'm worthless and so useless. I never do anything right. Nobody likes talking to me. I feel like everyone wants me to go away and die. I'm unwanted. I deserve to be all alone. People tell me that they like talking to me and that i'm not worthless but after a while they all realize that i actually am worthless. I know they all want me to die. Everyone just lies to me but truth is that they don't care about me at all. I'm a bad person. I'm EXTREMELY pathetic. I'm not good enough and i never will be. I never make anyone feel that i care about them because i never know how to show it. Everyone thinks i'm rude and selfish. I'm never helpful enough. I just wish i was never born. I hate myself so much. I don't deserve any care or love. I wish i was better and everyone else wishes i was better too. I deserve death and punishments. I'm just a trash human being. I need to kill myself. I don't have a rope to hang myself i have pills but i'm scared that i'll fail.
