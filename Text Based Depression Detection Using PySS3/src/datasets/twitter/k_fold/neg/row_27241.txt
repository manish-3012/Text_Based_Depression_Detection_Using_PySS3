My account hit -$10Iâ€™m out of $. Stripping hasnâ€™t made me anything and since thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve been able to do to hide the fact I had fired from my waitressing job after my manager asked me to fuck him, I said no, and was then fired for â€œstealingâ€, Iâ€™m at a loss. Iâ€™m waiting to hear back from a few places Iâ€™ve applied at. But my account is at -$10. Tomorrow morning Iâ€™ll get an overdraft fee. I could walk to the bank the next town over, but then I wonâ€™t be able to afford going to the shitty club job I hate tomorrow. I already owe them money. I owe my school over $800. I still owe rent for the month. Iâ€™m so in debt. Like thatâ€™s not even including my student loans and unpaid medical bills. And I canâ€™t ask my parents for money again. Not when they think I still have a real job and Christmas is coming. But I canâ€™t sign up for classes until this student debt is paid. And this guy Iâ€™ve been stupidly in love with for the past three years has been shitting on me the past few days saying none of my anxieties over global warming and the poor getting poorer matters because his dads rich and heâ€™ll be fine. So he doesnâ€™t give a fuck. Thatâ€™s literally his reasoning. I just. I donâ€™t see good in the world. I donâ€™t see good in anything. And Iâ€™ve been going minute to minute just trying to make it to finals without swallowing every pill I own. And tbh I donâ€™t know Iâ€™m make it through tonight without doing it.
