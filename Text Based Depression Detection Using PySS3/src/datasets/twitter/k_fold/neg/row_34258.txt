I don't want to do anything anymore.I can't control anythings in my life anymore.

Whatever I said, I always make it worse, for me for the person I loved.

I don't want to do anything. I need this to stop. for good, for everyone happiness.

I don't want to hurt anyone anymore. I am so sorry. I really sorry.

I don't enjoy anything anymore. Everything I do was for nothing.

I am so tried to explain. to express.

I'am so sorry, If I hurt you. Failed you. Drag you down.

I want to just rest.

I'm so sorry.

I want everything to stop.

I can't do it. I'm just a coward. It's so painful.

How to make it stop?

It's so hard stop giving a fuck. But I'll try.
