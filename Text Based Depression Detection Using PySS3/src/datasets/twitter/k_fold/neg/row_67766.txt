All my friends replace me for their relationships and I'm done with itTitle says it all. I've been diagnosed with PTSD from the last thing 

If you want to hear any of the stories you can reply here and I will explain but I would really like to shorten them all and explain only to those who want to hear it.

At 16, my best friend left me for her boyfriend after rejecting me and telling me "I have a boyfriend now, I don't need you anymore" and never talking to me again. I tried everything, nothing worked.

At 18, my "cousin" (we aren't real cousins, marital thing) who we went together so well and who I relied on for most of my problems and she relied on me for hers more often, left me for her boyfriend after having me help her start a relationship with him. She did it because I told her not to have sex with him, and she did, told me she did, and said that I treated her like shit and she would never talk to me again.

At 22, I am called to a motor vehicle incident. When I arrived I was the first one on scene and it was a wrong way collision, head on. There was a truck and a car, car had drifted into the wrong lane. Both the occupants in the truck were okay but the woman driving the car was unresponsive, but I instantly recognized who she was when I saw her face, it was the girl who left me at 16. By the time I pulled her out of the vehicle my buddy and paramedics had already arrived and performed CPR, but to no success. She was to be taken a local hospital, I followed shortly after and was told that she had died likely before I was even on scene. Her mother, who recognized me also, from so many years ago told me that "I was the reason her daughter died, I let her die", but there was nothing more I could have done. 

I never got the chance to talk to her again or to make things right with her, and now I never will.
