I donâ€™t know what to do. I want to OD but I know I canâ€™t die from that, and I want to go to a psych hospital but I know itâ€™s gonna make the relationship I have with my dad worse, BUT I donâ€™t want to rack up a hospital bill.I have the suicide note ready, I have the aspirin ready, but if I donâ€™t die (which is very likely), then that means that thereâ€™s gonna be a hospital bill. If I ask to go to a psych ward or something, there probably wonâ€™t be as large of a hospital bill but my dad wonâ€™t take it seriously enough to believe Iâ€™m truly suicidal, and heâ€™d only realize itâ€™s a problem if I did try to OD.

Itâ€™s not that he doesnâ€™t love me, but he doesnâ€™t want for me to be on meds, and he disagrees with every therapist Iâ€™ve had, and he hinders everything and I wish he wasnâ€™t involved with my mental health because Iâ€™d probably actually get the help I want instead of suffering and wanting to die. I hate this.
