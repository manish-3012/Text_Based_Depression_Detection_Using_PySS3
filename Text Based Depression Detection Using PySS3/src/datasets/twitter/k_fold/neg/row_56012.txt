I don't think I want help? (trigger warning)Before you even get to reading this I just want you, whoever you may be, that I do not want your pity. I do not want you to sit there and tell me that "things will get better" and that I should "just wait it out" because in all honesty I do not, nor will I ever, believe it.

In 2014 I was raped but a youth worker, yeah I guess things were bad before hand but when that happened there was no way of stopping what was to come. I wish I could say that I'm no longer effected by it and that I'm stronger now but I cant lie to you like that. It was like a domino effect. As soon as the first domino goes down, they rest of them go crashing down with it.
After that happened I kind of lost it. I stopped eating, I stopped sleeping, I couldn't do anything but hide away and avoid everything. I even attempted suicide a number of times. 

Fast forward to October, 2015, my mother kicked me out because she could "no longer help me" although she hadn't tried to help me in the first place. Between October and January I lived in 3 different places plus spent 2 weeks without a home. Again, I tried to kill myself a number of times. 
March, 2016, my mother officially cut me off. She said she no longer wanted me to be involved with her, my step dad and all of my siblings. I was "a danger" to them all for the ways I tried to hurt myself.
April, 2016, I turned 17. And as many times before, I tried to kill myself.

I'm sorry for having this dragged on but I'll get to the point of this whole thing now. 
Its the 9th of May, 8:00pm, and after 5 years I have finally come to the conclusion that there is nothing here for me. There is no "happy ending". Life DOESNT get better. It will NOT be okay in the end.
