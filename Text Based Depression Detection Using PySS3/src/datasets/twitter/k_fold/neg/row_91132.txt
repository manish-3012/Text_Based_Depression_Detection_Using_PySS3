Feeling a little better, but still want to kill myself because I donâ€™t want to feel bad again[Long post]

So a little over five years ago, I was very suicidal and wanted to kill myself, but I decided to wait and try to improve thing for five years and reevaluate at that point. I think at the time I was really hoping things would get better. 

Throughout that time there were some times where it was very bad, especially the first few years. 

Then the fourth year or so that was a really low point. I felt so bad constantly, that I figured Iâ€™d try running, which I hated, but since I was in so much pain, it didnâ€™t hurt any worse. And between that and a lot of other things which turned into a rigorous set of rules to follow, things got better and I was actually happy. It took so much effort to build up though and a lot of effort to maintain. 

Then I made friends which I suck at, but these friends actually wanted to hangout with me instead of me trying to tag along with them but feeling like I was invading. 

Then I started dating one of my friends. 

  But at this point, my happiness bubble had kinda popped, and it was harder to keep up with my rigorous set of rules, so I started dropping them, and running made my knees hurt to the point where it was unbearable and now I canâ€™t really run regularly without them hurting. 

But dating was a good distraction, way better than playing on my phone or watching tv. And we really only hung out once a week, which at times was as much as I could handle anyway. 

And it surprised me. I cared and liked aspects of dating that I hadnâ€™t thought I would. But then around the holidays and the five year mark, my SO stopped talking to me. I know the holidays are hard for them, but no contact for three weeks is long, especially with the third week was me trying to reach out about once a day. 

So it was a slow drawn out break up from then on, since that was a pain that was hard to deal with and had happened in small increments before, which I had mentioned too.  So I broke things off since we werenâ€™t really talking anyway, and I thought that would help. 

It didnâ€™t. Things got a lot worse. I was stressing about why and how things went down there and obsessing over how I thought things would be better (and almost were after the five year mark) and my family support system was disintegrating within the next 6 months but the drama would still be there, which had gotten worse. And I still hadnâ€™t moved on from a job I hate when so many others had, many of which were less skilled and had spent less time there. 

And I just didnâ€™t have the energy to climb that mountain again to get where things are good again. And I donâ€™t want to try again if things just get worse again. 

So I waited until my familyâ€™s birthdays and graduations had passed and I took time off to kill myself. But now that time has come. But things are slightly better now and my motivation to go through with it is less. But I have everything prepared and this timing would hurt my family the least and minimize my impact. 

Also, if I do keep trying and keep living, to what end? The world is becoming a political nightmare, Iâ€™m loosing rights over my body, the world is dying and capitalism is making that happen quicker and is going to cause all sorts of chaos as it does and I donâ€™t want to live through all that, but if I live a natural lifespan, I will.  And these things are destroying the things that I enjoyed and made me feel better, but since they are going away it just makes me depressed when I try to feel better. 

I have tried therapy in the past but it didnâ€™t help. 


I know you canâ€™t say I should go through with it, but if Iâ€™m just going to kill myself at some point, is there really any downside from doing it now instead of later?

 I feel that that would just save me a lot of pain and help avoid people getting closer to me and then being more upset when I do. 

At this moment Iâ€™m not max upset, Iâ€™m feel neutral. Not empty, or numb, but neutral. But it doesnâ€™t take much to make me upset and for the last few weeks, Iâ€™ve been trying to picture a scenario where I would be happy, and I havenâ€™t been able to. Even if I won the lottery and found a really close friend that still wouldnâ€™t fix my problems. I donâ€™t have any passions or anything I want to accomplish, and I donâ€™t think I ever did. I remember my interests but everything I liked was very casual. And if it was a deep passion, I would be over it in a few months.

TL;RD Iâ€™m not feeling the worst, but I donâ€™t want to feel really bad again. Iâ€™ve tried every option I can think of. Is there any downside to killing myself now instead of later? Or is there any point to trying to live in a dying world?
