Suicide by cop, who the hell wakes up and this is the first thing they think??? Me.Been increasingly suicidal this past month, with being homeless, everything is in storage, unemployed over a year, no hope in sight, really run out of options. Well I was 2 years ago, utterly obsessed with â€œdeath with dignityâ€ and almost got myself some dignity then, but something pulled me out of it, and right on the edge, things turned around. Things are 10x worse now than they were then. So I was going to do the DWD thing, but my gear is in storage so the SBC thing popped into my head 2 days ago, first thing when I wake up. Quick and easy. Then I read these things are on the rise, and a guy did it on the freeway, stopped traffic for like 3 hrs, no cops were injured, no civilians were injured, suspect dead on the scene. It is not at all dignified, at all. Everyone there now has PTSD. And I know, it is a bitch. Feel like my lifeâ€™s run its course why not end it this month. FML!
