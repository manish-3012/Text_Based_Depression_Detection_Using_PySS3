Better off dying alone.The happiest way to live is to be alone. Everyone you love WILL die. Some people spend the time with their loved ones thinking just far enough into the future where they're together and happy. Personally, all I can think about is that one day, I'm going to notice they can't jump as high as they used to, can't walk as far as they used to. They're starting to forget important things more often. The grey in their hair, the wrinkles in their face, the cloudiness in their eyes.

Every phone call when they're away could just be the one that lets you know they were in a terrible accident. Every hour past the time they were supposed to be home could just be the day they don't make it home.
When your pet dies, sure you can get a new one. You'll outlive it. A new spouse? One of you is going first. Best friends? They'll replace you with  someone who will do the things you don't want to do. 

Love makes some people stronger but all it does is erode me. What is the point of loving anything if it is so sure to hurt you in the end?
