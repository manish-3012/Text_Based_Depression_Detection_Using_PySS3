P.S it never gets better
Will I honestly ever be happy. Iâ€™m always extremely depressed around this time. Always before my so-called favorite holiday. I canâ€™t have good birthdays or good Christmasâ€™s. I think I just have to accept it. 

Will I ever be enough? I spend nights in my room crying and no one ever knows. With my uncle in the hospital, the anniversary of my sexual assault, and my boyfriend hurting me again, I question what worth I have on this earth.
