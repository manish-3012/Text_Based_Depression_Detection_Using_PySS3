how do you create distance between someone you were once close withIts an embarrassing scenario that makes me feel worsr when I think about it.

I have liked someone. We used to talk everyday via phone calls and text messages, and I became accustomed to our daily conversations. I tried opening up how I felt to her, about my depression. She is the only person I have talked to about this. but I feel suicidal because I was sexually assaulted and contracted something that still makes me feel terrible. Im leaving a lot of micro details out unintentionally because it is hard to cover a relationship, because bonds are special. 

For the record, I completely respect her and her boundaries. I just want to abide by what she feels comfortable with.

I seek advice on how to distance yourself from someone I have been thinking too much about. I want to give her space if she doesnt want me in her life, I love her as much to agree.

I deleted her phone number to prevent myself from trying to communicate with her, but i have accidentily memorized it. I have deactivated instagram, facebook, and deleted snapchat.

I could be overreacting. I just want to stop feeling bothered by my self proclaimed circumstance. 

this has happened before, with her and I. We stopped talking for a while. Then She texted me asking how I was doing. and we started texting again. Then I texted her a lot. I felt like i wanted her to be the only woman in my life. And that could be scary and overwhelming for people to hear. So i want to stop feeling it. i am not objectifying her, I have nothing but respect for who she is and all that she has been through.

I just want to be able to get over this.

If you read this please dont think poorly of me, for I will spend the rest of my life, trying to prove, the good I can do.
