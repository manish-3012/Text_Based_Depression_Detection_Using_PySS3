i canâ€™t do it anymoreiâ€™m going to do it tonight. im so tired of living and faking being happy for people. iâ€™ve tried everything from therapy to medicine to working out and nothing has worked. 
i grew up in an abusive household and iâ€™ve been depressed since i was 12 and i have anxiety issues. both of my parents abandoned me and basically all i have is my brother. 
now iâ€™m back at uni and itâ€™s even worse because all i do is lay in bed. i donâ€™t have the motivation to get up and do anything or even eat, all i do is sleep. iâ€™m just done. iâ€™m tired.
