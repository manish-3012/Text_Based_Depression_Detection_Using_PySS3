I just dont care anymoreim numb, my panic attacks are getting weaker and so is all of my emotion. i just dont care, i dont care that i dont have real friends at school and i dont care that its my fault. I dont care about anyone, no one, not even my family. my hands dont look real, my face looks like a stranger's, i feel like im floating with no control over what i do from time to time, like im in a dream. i never open up to make an excuse to myself that my friends arent friends because they don't *know* me. im burnt out, pitied and rejected, as i reject others, burn out others, pity others and im a toxic person for it. i dont see the point, fear holds me back from just ending it all.
