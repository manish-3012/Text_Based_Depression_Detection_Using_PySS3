Death all around usAs bad as this pandemic is I feel jealous of the people who have died from coronavirus. I WISH I could take their place and get it and die. I wish I could get sooo Iâ€™ll that I could barely talk or think and donâ€™t care if my death is slow or fast. I tried to strangle myself to death today but i was too much of a coward to keep going. I hope I get this virus soo bad that I die
