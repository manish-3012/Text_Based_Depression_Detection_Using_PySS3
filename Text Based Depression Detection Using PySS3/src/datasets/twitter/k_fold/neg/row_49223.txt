no goal, purpose, or desireWhat the fuck is the point in anything? Why is there absolutely nothing I want in life except to kill myself and escape the world? There's no place for me here anyway. I do absolutely nothing with my life except play video games and endlessly browse the internet for content. 

I have literally no purpose in being alive. I don't want a job, I hate college, and I absolutely refuse to join the military. I don't want to change my life. I see no point in changing it if my only desire is to commit suicide. I don't even imagine living to see myself graduating college.  I'm pretty much a lazy piece of shit loser. I hate myself with every fiber of my being. I can never imagine someone loving me or caring about me unconditionally. Just the thought of that happening is such a foreign concept to me. It's literally all my fault too. It's my fault that I am such an unmotivated worthless human being. I do absolutely nothing to change my situation yet here I am still bitching about it. The weird thing is, I don't even want to change myself. I'd rather just let these thoughts consume me and commit suicide. 

I guess I'll just end the post here, I have already made enough pity parties already. One day I'll eventually stop posting here and swerve my car into a tree. Only then will I escape this bullshit garbage world.
