Sometimes I wish I wasnâ€™t here.Sometimes I imagine a world beneath the earth, a world where I can sleep. One where Iâ€™m beneath the breeze, where my thoughts are silenced. Where I can finally be at peace. 

One where my family doesnâ€™t have to worry about me. Where I donâ€™t have to fake this smile anymore. I canâ€™t imagine taking my life but I also canâ€™t imagine living this life anymore.
