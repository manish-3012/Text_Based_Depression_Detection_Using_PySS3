My brother haven't left the house in 3 monthsMy brother is 16 years old, we live with both parents and another brother. And he haven't spoke to any of us in the last 4 months. 
He didn't leave the house in 3 months but when his friends come over he speaks with them normally. 
He also doesn't want to go see a doctor. 
I feel that our options are limited since he doesn't speak with us but we really want to help. 
Any advises on what can we do?
