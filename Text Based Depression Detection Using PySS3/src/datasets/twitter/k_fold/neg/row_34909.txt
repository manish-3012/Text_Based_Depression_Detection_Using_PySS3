Am i all alone here?Hello. This is really hard for me, but im a 34 year old male and i am struggling to cope with the ever increasing thoughts of suicide or the days when my mind decides to start planning on killing people or acting out violent revenge on people who i only imagine are wrong doing me. i am currently pn a 5 month waiting list for councelling and anger management. At this current time, although i have an amazing wife and child and some good friends, i have never felt so alone. Sometimes i find talking to someone who is going through the same thing helps a little to make me realise im not alone in this world. please leave a messagd if you would like to chat.
