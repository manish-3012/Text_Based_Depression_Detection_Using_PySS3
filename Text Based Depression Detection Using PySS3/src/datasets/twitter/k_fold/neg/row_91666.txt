Melodramatic or...?I didn't even know this subreddit existed until tonight and because I have friends that actually check my comment history, I made a new account, so forgive the "for a day" thing.

Honestly, I really don't know how I feel... about much of anything. I'd be lying if I said that suicide hadn't crossed my mind before (it has... for the last 6 years, at least), but it isn't like I have things that bad off.

I've tried the psychiatry route and it really didn't help me much, if at all. I was put on numerous medications of numerous different dosages and all that happened is I felt really out of it and hated how I would sit around unable to focus on the things that used to matter to me anyway. I've also spent time in a psychiatric ward, though because it was a private, for-profit institution, I was let out far, far earlier than I really should have been.

I just can't seem to get over any hurdles; I was kicked out of my original college for being one one-hundreth of a point under their GPA requirement (not even joking) and could never get the funds (or the support from my parents) to make it back to where I already had an established group of friends. I have a girlfriend, but we're 300 miles apart, so I can't really can't on her support unless its verbal//via text messages.

I also have a very deep seated hatred for most of the rest of humanity; I can't hardly walk around in public places (the mall, wal-mart, movie theatre, whatever) without trying my damnedest to avoid eye contact because of the sheer volume of stupidity that exists around me in those places. Because of that, I spend a lot of time at home, either playing games, browsing reddit, or what have you. This does nothing to boost my already low self-esteem.

Add to that that I'm constantly questioning my own choices in life and the paths I've taken (who isn't, really?) and that I'm always extremely dissatisfied with them. Parts of me want to change, but parts of me don't. What really horrifies me is I just don't see a point to living another 10, 20, 30 years; I've never liked children and the thought of having one of my own terrifies me. I can't imagine myself working a "regular" 9-5 job, and I'm just not great and the major I've chosen.

I have historically poor luck, from braking multiple bones to having surgeries (15 and counting, something like that), and I've been cursed with chronic sinus pains, depression, and I've even been diagnosed as bi-polar, though I long ago stopped taking my medications, and after my psychiatrist retired, I just kind of fell through the cracks of the system.

I just don't really know what to do with myself, or how to continue. Some days, I'm *almost* a normal person, but then I have days like today where I just can't stop contemplating it. My father, the only person I live with, can tell when I have these bad days, but he doesn't really know whats going on in my head and I've never been able to talk to him about serious stuff, particularly when it comes to my feelings.

I don't know what I'm asking for, but maybe getting this off my chest will lift a bit of the weight and I can wake up the next morning and not wonder if I'll make it through the day.
