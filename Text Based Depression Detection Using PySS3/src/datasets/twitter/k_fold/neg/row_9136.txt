Every single night when I fall asleep I wish Iâ€™ll never wake upOk. Im posting on a throw away account because Iâ€™m paranoid as hell someoneâ€™s going to find out who I am. Ok, I really canâ€™t turn anywhere else on this one. This is just more of a confession that I gotta get off my chest. So every night when I lay down I just lay awake and wish when I fall asleep all the pain I feel will just go away. And it does. When Iâ€™m asleep I feel nothing and I love it. Iâ€™m sick of feeling numb all the time. Sometimes itâ€™s better than other times. It always comes back. I will try to over sleep every opportunity I can and when I wake up Iâ€™m bitterly disappointed to be alive honestly. Iâ€™ve thought a lot about killing myself. Even going as far as to test to see if my closet rack would fall if I tried to hang my self with a belt. I donâ€™t know if this is normal or not. I canâ€™t really tell. Thatâ€™s probably the worst thing. I just probably need help and Iâ€™m scared, itâ€™s hard to admit both of those things. A part of me doesnâ€™t want to ask for help again because it will just turn out like last time. I was in therapy for anxiety and depression around my freshmen year of high school. I got cold feel about it all and told them it was all gone. They believed me. It took a lot of courage to just tell someone who could get me into that therapy that I most likely needed and still need. I just need advice on what to do. Thank you, and Iâ€™m sorry.
