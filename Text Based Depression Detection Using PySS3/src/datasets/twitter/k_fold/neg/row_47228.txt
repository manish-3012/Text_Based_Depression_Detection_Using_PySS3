It's been nearly a yearHi,

Earlier this year I approached you about my longer term depression and the split with my fiancÃ©e that nearly killed me. I had moved in and met someone, gotten on with my career and tried to get healthy again after losing 10kg's through stress. I'm thankful for help and I'm here to ask again.

Since the split I've been miserable. The first and last thought I have is of my ex. And it's a real disservice to what I can only describe as a girl who should be perfect for me. At first I write this off as its ok to be sad.

But now it's more then half a year later. The slightest mention or reminder of my ex sends me anxious and depressed. Nothing seems to bring me any joy. I've been on a holiday, indulged my geekiness and my partner is literally helping me be stable my ex couldn't. 

My current partner has really done everything possible to fix me but nothing helps. Everyday I'm upset and miss my very imperfect ex. I've moved on so much but I'm stuck there.

I don't think I can take another day of this
