What is even the point?I don't get why I'm still living. The people that cared about me died and are gone somewhere else that I can't reach them, I'm a total punching bag towards everyone around me, I feel like a total burden towards the people that stayed in touch with me and it just feels like I drag them down with my emotions. I hate it, I've tried seeking help and it never really helped me the way I thought it would. Everyday I think about just taking these expired meds or just getting the ropes ready and just ending it all in my garage as no one will notice me being gone. Why should I bother in living anymore? Nothing brings me joy like it use to and almost everything brings me pain.
