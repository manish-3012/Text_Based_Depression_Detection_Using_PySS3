Why should I continue?Seriously though, everyone on the world despises me (shut the fuck up if you say shit like "but i don't", no, stop right there), no one ever approaches me, my music taste is inferior, I'm legit braindead and I have no energy to do anything. Not even talents or skills. Yet everyone else is just shitting success stories like they're fucking unicorns shitting out skittles. Everything is so fucking pointless.
