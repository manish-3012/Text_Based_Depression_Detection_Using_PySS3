I don't know how I'm going to get through thisHey reddit
As I type this on mobile the police are searching for me for something I havent done, my mum wont let me stay at home anymore, and Im just shit at my job which Im probably going to lose. And to top it off I have serious father issues (Ive never known him), Im battling depression and I still greive for my grandad who died seven and a half years ago. I just want a home and a loving family. I almost broke down in tears of happiness when my uncle said he loves me and him and a few others mean so much to me but I just dont have a way to make things better. Im not even getting treatment for my mental illness. Please reddit, let me know everythings okay
