itâ€™s almost my birthday and i wanna dieevery year i wanna kill myself. when i was younger iâ€™d promise myself not to kill myself, to go another year, or 6 more months, see how i felt then. but i always only felt worse. every year. i still do. wish i did kill myself one of those times. nothing ever got better.
