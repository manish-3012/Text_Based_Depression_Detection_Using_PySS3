I feel like suicide is my only option for me but I can't bring myself to do itI don't want to be alive anymore. I hate myself and i hate going through life with depression and childhood traumas. I've been depressed for a really long time, I can't remember what's happiness anymore? I feel like I'll never be happy and the sun will never shin on me again. I really wanna kill myself, I tell myself just one more step and you'll be free from all this pain but in the end I don't kill myself because I'm scared of failing or saved and be forced to live my life in a wheelchair or hospital. Do you feel my pain????
