Just need to vent.I want to die.
The people in my life wouldn't be effected by my death. 

My husband knows about my intentions. He seems alright about it. He's sitting infront of me in the living room right now playing video games while I'm ugly crying and writing this on my phone. We've talked about my kids staying with my mom if anything were to ever happen to me. Which is good, she can provide more for them and they like spending time with her better anyway. 

My mom and I don't have a relationship. We communicate about my kids, because she loves them. But I'm just a long list of disappointments. If she had the kids, there wouldn't be a reason for her to even want to contact me. If anything it would be like a weight off her shoulders if I actually were to kill myself. She hated having to pay my hospital bill from when I attempted in high school, I don't want to leave another bill for anyone again. 

My dad is remarried and doing his own thing. I talk to him a few times a week. I'm not sure he would even notice I stopped answering the phone.

I have probably 2 really close friends. But at this point in my life I can see them fighting to even want to be around me. 

Lilly is trying really hard because she may be afraid I'll actually hurt myself. But it's not fair to her anymore. I don't bring anything to our friendship anymore. I have no money to do anything anymore. My life is consumed with relationship drama with my family and husband, it's not fun talking or being around me.

Matt is in the military. He's made new friends, he's doing really well. We don't talk as often. But I think he would understand. He knows this has been an ongoing issue for me since I was a kid. 

I poison everything I touch. It's not fair to anyone that I'm like this. I don't want to hurt anyone, and I'm tired of hurting. I don't mean to be such a trash person, I don't want to be crying right now.
