Adding my 2 centsHi, I've been feeling down for years now and I've decided to kill myself in May. I want to be somewhere warm and pretty. 


I just don't see myself getting any better, feeling better, or doing better. For the past 1.5 year I've just given up and going through the motion. At this point, I don't even **want** to get better, I just want to be done. No more bad **or** good. I started feeling this way when I was 16 or 17 and I'm 24 now. I think I've given it enough time. 


Today was just one of those days and I needed somewhere to let it out. I will put up a post to say goodbye in May. 


As for anyone else feeling suicidal, I hope you get better. But if you don't, I understand and you're not alone.
