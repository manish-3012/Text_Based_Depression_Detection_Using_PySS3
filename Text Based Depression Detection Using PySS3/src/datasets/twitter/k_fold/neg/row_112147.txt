urge to do it has never been stronger25m diagnosed w depression and anxiety tried meds for a while but stopped because i didnt wanna be dependent on them. Ive been having erection issues the past week and am going to a urologist tomorrow but im not doing okay mentally. there are treatment options available for sure but my life is already extremely stressful. im in grad school and my at home life is not good. im under a lot of stress and my anxiety and depression has gone through the roof the past week. its been really hard. havent told anyone about it yet and dont plan on doing so. i just hope i get through this. I've decided if i havent seen improvement within the year that I would just end it b/c wtf is the point of living if i cant have sex for real tho. I dont wanna sound conceited but i know for a fact that girls think im attractive which is a plus for sure but wtfs the point if i cant get it up. well see what happens. sometimes i wonder why life is so much harder for others while other ppl have it so much easier. idk sorry if my thoughts are rambled. wish me luck my friends im gonna need it
