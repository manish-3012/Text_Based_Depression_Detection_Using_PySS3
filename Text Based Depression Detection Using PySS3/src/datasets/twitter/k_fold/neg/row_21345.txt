What gun to use/how? idk lolDon't know where else to post this that will be non-judgmental.

I'm home alone rn from college sitting in front of my dad's guns. His safe was unlocked and it usually is which is kinda dumb on his part considering i've been on and off antidepressants for awhile lmao silly dude. Anyway I don't know how to load them or anything so I probably won't do it today. But idk if one will be easier to use/less painful??? or if someone could help me? 

I just looked them up and he has a Smith &amp; Weston M&amp;P and a Ruger MKIII. Don't know what this means or if I'll be able to use them but yeah. I'm kinda worried im going to botch it bc I've never used a gun before and i feel like it would be my luck to make myself a vegetable or something but still live so im just staring at them right now lol
