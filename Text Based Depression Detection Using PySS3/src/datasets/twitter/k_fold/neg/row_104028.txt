I canâ€™t forget my past. It seems like itâ€™s the only thing I can remember. The bullyâ€™s, the names, the embarrassment, the sadness.Iâ€™ve been bullied all my life at first I didnâ€™t realize it I thought they were just joking around but then grd 7 I was bullied all that year, the kid in my class wonâ€™t stop attacking me, i didnâ€™t do anything to him and he does it everyday nonstop, my teacher sees it but she doesnâ€™t like me either. Iâ€™m nothing. I walk home thinking about the ways Iâ€™m gonna kill myself and I live close to a river so I was gonna fill my bags with rocks and walk in and never come back up but I was afraid of drowning. But it was the EASIEST way I could kill myself. But I didnâ€™t. Sadly I didnâ€™t. Itâ€™s now grade 8 and Iâ€™m in the same class as my bully. He bullyâ€™s me again and this time itâ€™s gotten worse. All the names gotten worse the racial slurs gotten worse. The fact that Iâ€™m so dumb that I should go kill myself. One day he embarrassed me so much infront of the class everyone in my class laughing. The teacher is there not doing anything. I storm out running home bursting in tears. I had to kill myself. I had too. I HAVE TOO. once I get home I cry and cry and cry until I fall asleep. I didnâ€™t go to school the next day. So I took the advantage of that by going out and buying a knife. 
The only way I can release my sadness and stress. I bought a karambit and itâ€™s brand new and sharpened.
I cut and cut and cut. 
The more I cut the deeper I go. 
And here I am. 
With all these cuts. Not knowing if Iâ€™ll bleed out tmmr or today or next week. I didnâ€™t do anything to him.
Why me? What did I do? Why is everything going down hill? I have thoughts of just slicing my throat or stabbing my heart.
Nobody knows that Iâ€™m doing this. That Iâ€™m cutting myself. 

The more I cut. The deeper I go. 
Deeper the better.

I cannot stop and Iâ€™m-

Iâ€™m just gonna slice my wrist until I cut the vein Iâ€™m not gonna stop until i bleed out I know it will be painful but itâ€™s better than all the suffering Iâ€™ve already been through. 
I apologize if this doesnâ€™t make any sense.
But why does it matter anyways?
