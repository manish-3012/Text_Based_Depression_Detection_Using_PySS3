I fucking hate valentines dayValentines day is basically just a big "fuck you" to lonely people like me. I have no one to live for. My family doesn't love me and I don't have friends. I can't even properly communicate with others because i'm an anti-social asshole. I just want everything to end. No one's ever going to love me.
