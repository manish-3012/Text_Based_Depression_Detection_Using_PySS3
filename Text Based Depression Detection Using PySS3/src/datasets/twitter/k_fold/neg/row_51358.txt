I don't know what to do....For the past few years I've been feeling all alone, even with people around. I can make friends but can't seem to keep people around that actually care. Even when I'm in a group I feel isolated and like I'm watching them from the outside.  Now lately I haven't been wanting to live, I don't want to kill myself but I don't want to live anymore.
