Saw a post earlier with someone talking about "It Gets Better." When? When the hell does this get any better? All its done it get worse. I've heard that for years. I see no evidence.25 year old guy.
I've been at the same junior college for 7 years now, fucking up every semester I touch.  i keep trying, failing, and going back to try again a year later. 
after a two year break, i went back to school with a State Grant, because I figured the idea of losing it would motivate me not to fuck up as much, and i'd be able to have more time not having to be stuck at work in a job i fucking hate (no matter what the job is. ive, so far, never found a single type i dont hate. all i can handle is being at home. humans bother me. i need an at-home job.)

I can't keep a job for more than a year, 6 month average, because my boss always gets fucking sick of having me around. right now, i don't even have one, because my boss disliked me. all i was was a receptionist, but apparently i fucked even THAT one up so hard that they hired a new guy into my desk without telling me. 

so i figure, cool, time off work means more time for school. now i can pay more attention to it, because in the last semester i had failed so hard they had put me on academic probation and said i would lose my grant if i failed again. if you lose the grant, you have to pay it back. thats $3000 so far. 
i've already got at least $20,000 in medical bills and various other debts racked up
I have no discernable skills, besides being able to make other people laugh, and and being vaguely not-hideous. i'm a.... jack-of-all-trades, i guess. except i'm like a 5-Of-All-Trades. Jack is all the way up there at 10, that fatcat.

i fucked it up AGAIN. i am now, four weeks in, at a C-D average in all my classes, i got a D on an essay i believed to be perfectly written, because apparently  it didnt adhere to the "writing prompt" he gave us. that's the one class i figured would be able to pull my GPA out of the dirt. 


then i piss blood and feel an all-too-familiar feeling in my motherfucking kidneys. 
kidney stones. again. the ninth one in the last three years.
so now, i can't get out of bed to go to class because of the excruciating pain i feel from moving even just from bed to the bathroom, which means I can't go to class. 

if you miss 4 classes, you lose a letter grade. if you miss five, you get kicked from the class. if i get kicked or get any D's, I lose all my money and have to pay it back.  Tomorrow I have a doctors appointment to figure out my fucking kidneys. tomorrow will be my third absence from all my classes. thursday will be my fourth.
if i dont go on thursday, which i cant even MOVE OUT OF BED RIGHT NOW,  i will fail my classes, AGAIN. owe the state more money than i can possibly pay back, have ALL my debt, ******AND********* my health insurance runs out one month from today, in my 26th birthday, so I'll no longer be able to get my anti-depressants, sleeping aids, or adderall. 
i'll also no longer be able to see the doctor about my latent kidney issues or a phychiatrist for my general me. 

so i ask you this:

when the hell does it get better?
i was told that when i first wanted to kill myself back when i was fucking fifteen.
here i am, 25 years old, desperately clinging on to this hope, and seeing every fucking day that its not fucking true for all of us. 

I don't know what to do anymore. i dont know what the fuck to do. im so fucking sick of crying. im so fucking sick of seeing no future. nothing but fuzzy blackness that fills my entire head when i even try and *think* about the future. im so fucking sick of seeing every single day pass by and know that it's just another day i didn't give a shit about because it's not like i was gonna do anything with it anyway. 

when does this get better?
when do i stop feeling like the only reason im hanging on anymore is to not upset my mother and sister?
i know that one of the biggest things people say is "oh, well nobody cares about me, boo hoo." i know people care. that's the only thing that's kept me alive to this point.

my point is that the people who care about me are also the ones being plagued by me, financially crippled because i'm a piece of shit who can't even make enough money to fucking feed himself. 
what if the people who care about me arent enough anymore? i know i'm just gonna fuck them up even more, so... i dont fucking know anymore. 

i just.... wanna stop fucking crying. 
when does this get any fucking better?


(throwaway account. posting it in here, because from what i hear, r/depression just sorta wallows in themselves rather than actively trying to help. this isn't an "im gonna kill myself tonight," thing, just a "I'm probably gonna at some point unless i can find any hope in myself not being such a piece of shit. but later. maybe after my family completely disowns me. (which i see a high possiblity of, s at this point, i'm never invited to family functions and my LITTLE BROTHER DIDNT EVEN TELL ME HE WAS ENGAGED WHEN THE WHOLE FAMILY KNEW ALREADY [Another glorious thing in my life. The fucking Thor Odinson of my family gets engaged, and fucking Loki here gets to schlep through abusive relationships, literally getting beaten and insulted.])


EDIT; To top off all the medical issues, I totally think I have a hemmerhoid. It's a regular ol' episode of motherfucking South Park up in here. Fuck this. Fucking kill me. Please.
