My job...So, right now, we just hired a new manager at the store I work at. She starts next week.

The other manager we had, who had control over the schedule isnâ€™t making the schedule anymore. Itâ€™s this new lady. EVERYONE there got their hours cut! Sheâ€™s not even working yet, and she cut our hours. What the fuck. I only work Friday Saturday(I recently sustained an injury whilst leaving the building on the 13th; I guess Karma kicks you in the ass...)this week and next week only Thursday Friday? 3 Hours on Thursday. 4 Hours on Friday. Is this some kind of twisted joke?? Does the new manager think this is funny!? I need this job. I canâ€™t lose another job, again because I canâ€™t find anything else. What the fuck am I supposed to do!? I feel lost! I fee like my career life is over...Iâ€™m 27, STILL living with my parents because Iâ€™m a retard and I fucking hate myself right now. Who the fuck lives with their parents at 27!? Seriously. Why was I born!? All my life, Iâ€™ve been pushed around by people threatening to do stuff if i didnâ€™t do something. Iâ€™m DONE! FUCKING DONE! This new manager is a piece of shit!! Come one. Why the fuck cut peopleâ€™s hours, yo!!
