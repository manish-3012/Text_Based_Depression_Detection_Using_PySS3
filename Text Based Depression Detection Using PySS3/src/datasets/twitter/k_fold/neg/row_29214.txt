You went back to what you knew, So far removed from all that we went throughSo on the moment I feel very depressed. It feels so Isolated.

Nobody can see or feel what I feel inside. That makes is so difficult.

Sometimes I have the feeling that you can't be depressed.

That you have to be happy at all times and do weird, crazy things to stay interesting.

But darkness is always surrounding me, which I can't stop.

It is, as if it's calling me. It feels good to be depressed in a way,

it's comforting, it's always there, it makes me more driven to do some things that I love.  
So it goes with up's and downs. I have days that I can do anything. 

That depression takes me over completely. And I have days, where I want to do so much,

that I want to do everything in one day. It can go up very  quickly and down again.

It's hard to be in a body and life I didn't choose, I don't want to be here on this world anymore.

Still every day goes by, while I see how others see life as something beautifull, who I can see enjoy life.

Makes me feel like I am a totall stranger on this planet, where I don't belong.

As if I have to force myself to see a reality that I don't see. To me the world is black and dark.

He goes to her, but I go back to black...

Music is the only thing that really appeals to me, and gives me a home.

Yeah sometimes a dark home. As if it understands what I feel, that I am not alone.

Life and people are exhausting. If I listen to music, like Joy Division or The Cure, Nirvana or other punk/grunge music.

It feels like they understand me and experienced the same, that it is okay to feel this way.  That I am finnally home.

We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times
