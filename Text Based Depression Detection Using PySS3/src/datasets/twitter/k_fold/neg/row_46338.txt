How to die?Iâ€™m planning and preparing my suicide. Iâ€™m either doing it on winter. Hypothermia maybe. Swim on the river but I have to check how cold does the water and the weather have to be. Or i could buy ice, pour it all in our bathtub and just sleep. I still donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m thinking of doing the assisted suicide but too much paperworks it will take me a long time to die.
