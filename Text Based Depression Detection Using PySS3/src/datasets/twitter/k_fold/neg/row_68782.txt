iâ€™m sorry...i hate that itâ€™s come to this. years of therapy, lots of different medications. a few mental hospital stays, too. i canâ€™t go on anymore. iâ€™m done. i thought i was better. i thought i had overcome my depression, but itâ€™s kicking my ass. i am so tired of fighting. in two days iâ€™m going to cut my wrists and hang myself. iâ€™m so done. i donâ€™t want to live anymore. iâ€™m sorry. i just thought i would post on here just to see if anybody cared. iâ€™ve had enough of this shitty life, and iâ€™m finally giving up. soon i will be another statistic, but i donâ€™t care. iâ€™m done.
