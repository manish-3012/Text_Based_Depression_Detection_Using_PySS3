I can't handle people atm2 people are having a moderately quiet conversationin the same room and I feel like locking myself in a bathroom. Every little noise hurts and every word coming from a persons mouth feels like something is sucking my soul through my ear. I can't deal with people around me and I want to jump in a lake and drown so I wouldn't have to talk to anyone. I just had lunch and I want to throw up. I just want to die.
