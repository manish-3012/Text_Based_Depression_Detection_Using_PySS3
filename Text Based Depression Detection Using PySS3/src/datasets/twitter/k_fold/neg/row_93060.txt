I feel like I should have killed myself years ago.I've had suicidal feelings since I was 12 years old. I thought by now I would have discovered who I was, but things have just gotten more complicated and confusing.

I'm a 21 year old guy in college, and I've had my ups and downs. I was madly in love once, but I fucked things up. Mostly because of my own shitty self-image.

Add to that my anxiety issues. With enormous effort, I can handle myself in social situations. But the last two times I tried to give a speech I had a panic attack. It doesn't make sense, because I've been able to give speeches with no problem in the past. Nevertheless, I had to drop my public speaking class and I'm going to have to take it again later. It shook my confidence even more, and now quite a few people that I go to school with know that I have these issues. 

I'm on medication for my anxiety and have been for about 6 weeks. However, it's not doing anything for me.

I've never really had a problem with school or work. I'm generally a hard worker, and I put in the effort to get by. But now I'm facing a problem that is seemingly impossible to solve.

I have never wanted to drink alcohol or do drugs.. and I never have. But when everyone I know is out getting drunk on a Saturday night, and I'm staring at a wall, I start to question whether or not I'm really doing what is best for me.

I'm an introverted person, and I value my alone time. But having a few friends who I could spend time with is also really important to me.. and I don't have them. Whenever people spend time with me or go out of their way to include me in something, I always get the sense that they're only doing it because they pity me, not because they actually enjoy my company. All I really want is to have a few friends that I can sit around with playing board games and not feel guilty that I'm making them waste their time on me.

I finally discovered why I have anxiety issues and why I hate myself so much, though. (Or so I think). I have always valued traditionally feminine personality traits and qualities over masculine ones. However, I never thought much of it until a couple years ago.

I've more or less come to the conclusion that I'm transgender. I'd rather be a female than a male. And what makes it even worse is that if you transition "correctly", you can live a somewhat normal life as your chosen gender.

What if transitioning will make me hate myself less? What if it will make me hate myself more? There isn't a right decision.

I've been seeing a therapist off and on for this for about a year. I've also been posting in transgender-related subreddits.

I wish I had the conviction to make a decision and stick with it, but I don't. I'm questioning my identity on the most fundamental level possible and it's fucking me up. My life has gotten out of hand despite my best efforts to keep it in check. Year by year, my life gets worse. When I was younger, I told myself that things would get better, but they haven't. I really regret that I didn't kill myself when I was younger. I didn't need all this pain that I discovered later on in my life. It's unfortunate, but I really want to kill myself.
