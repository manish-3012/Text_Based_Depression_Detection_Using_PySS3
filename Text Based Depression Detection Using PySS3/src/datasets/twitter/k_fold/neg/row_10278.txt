AloneLife has lost all the magic and hopefulness I once felt. There is nothing to look forward to. No one to talk to. I canâ€™t help but feel I canâ€™t trust anyone. People really just donâ€™t care unless they are benefiting someway. I posted something a week ago but felt embarrassed and deleted it. But I feel so alone and lost, I donâ€™t really know where else to turn anymore. I pray every night for my life to end. I donâ€™t understand how anyone really manages to pull themselves out of their depression. I donâ€™t care to do better anymore. I honestly believe that some people are destined to be alone and unhappy no matter what efforts they make to do better. Everything has gone so wrong and I wish I could have the courage to end it.
