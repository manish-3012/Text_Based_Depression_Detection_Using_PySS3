I'm ready to be done with everything.Back in November of 2014 I went through a bad break up because I was accused of cheating. Rumors circulated around my school and now most everybody knows who I am and what I did. It sent me into depression. Meds don't help. Nothing does. I turned to drugs and alcohol but that didn't help either. Just now I find out that a majority of the people I know hate me. I hate all aspects of life and I don't want to do anything anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't think I can finish high school. If anyone has any advice, it would be graciously accepted.
