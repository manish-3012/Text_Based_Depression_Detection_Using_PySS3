Iâ€™m 21 and I hate myself more than anything in this worldIâ€™m a self destructive worthless piece of shit who pretty much only lives to disappoint everyone I know. I wish there was an easy way to kill myself but there isnâ€™t I just have hated every decision Iâ€™ve made and I go to sleep every night with the hope I donâ€™t wake up because I really donâ€™t deserve this life
