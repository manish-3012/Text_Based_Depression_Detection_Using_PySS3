Scared - no clue what this wasI felt horrible yesterday and couldn't stop crying. I am pretty sure I drove people around me crazy. It was unending agony inside and there was no off switch, nothing made the pain stop. It was terrifying. Now I'm hoping I can distract myself enough to avoid slipping back into that hell. But I'm afraid of it happening again because i feel like I have no control over the pain and I'm afraid it will go on for too long and I'll kill myself. It still feels like it's there in the background of my mind and if I dwell too much on it it will come flooding back. What can I do to calm down during these sort of episodes of despair?
