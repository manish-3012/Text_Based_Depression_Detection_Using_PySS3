Conversations that trigger thoughtsI met a lovely guy on a train tonight who immediately started talking about quantum physics, parallel universe theory, and lots of other stuff along those lines. People taking about time as an illusion is really triggering death thoughts. The thought of dying in this universe only to wake up in another parallel universe seems so appealing that it might just happen if Iâ€™m not careful.
