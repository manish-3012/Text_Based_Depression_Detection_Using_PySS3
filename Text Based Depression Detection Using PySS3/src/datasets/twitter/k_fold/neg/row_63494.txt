I'm scared I'll do something tonightIt's been a particularly bad couple of weeks in this already shitty year. I've been struggling with mental health for a while, but it was always manageable. I took some hits from life, though. Lost someone I really cared about, lost my job, became isolated from my family and friends...

Now I see myself alone, knowing that I have absolutely nothing to live for. No hope of getting better. No friend to ask for help. And I don't know, man

I want to end it all, i feel like that's the only way. But there's that part of me that wants to live and try to be better and this gets more confusing for me.

I dont know. Im scared and alone. locked in the bathroom because i dont want to feel tempted to hurt myself with something sharp i might see outside

i dont think it makes sense im sorry
