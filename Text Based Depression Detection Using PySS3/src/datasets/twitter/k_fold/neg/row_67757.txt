is my situation that bad or am I just victimizing myself?first of all, I'll try to keep as short as possible:

I'm a 16 y.o. male, my parents are serbian while I was born in Italy. we still live here, in a really small town (500 ppl) which 99% are basically just old people. my father is abusive... a lot. my mother is toxic, just like my brother. obviously all of them are homophobic and that's a problem since I'm a "closeted" bisexual. I'm basically the target where they let their toxicity on. we are kinda poor. my confidence is zero also because I have a lazy eye (which could be temporary fixed by a simple pair of glasses but my famiily cannot afford them. or atleast they act like it since when they need something, they immediately get it and do everything to get it. for example: my father's tv, my brother's brand new phone). I'm introverted but atleast I've somehow managed to make some friends; however, they live in a bigger town half an hour (by car, by bus it's like two hours) from where I live. In that town I also go to school, where I met them (now my social interactions are non-existent also due to covid, which is a big problem here). I tried to shorten everything leaving out a lot of trauma and things I'm not ready to write about yet.

anyway, is it normal that I feel so fucking miserable or am I just victimizing myself?
