Itâ€™s my birthday29. The only thing I can say for 2019 is I didnâ€™t kill myself. Woo hoo? But I am so freaking depressed right now. The last few days. Idk. 

Oh well. Cheers, and maybe Iâ€™ll survive this next decade too. Maybe Iâ€™ll find joy. Maybe our insurance will finally cover mental health and Iâ€™ll be able to get some fucking help. The future is open.
