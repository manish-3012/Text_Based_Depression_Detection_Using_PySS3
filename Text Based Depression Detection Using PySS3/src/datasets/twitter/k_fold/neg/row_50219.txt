TiredIâ€™m tired of being alive. I just want to put a suicide bag in my head and not exist anymore. The next tuesday its the day I planned to die but I donâ€™t know if that would happen because sometimes I think about my bf and I feel kinda sad so I tried to live a bit longer for him, although at the same time I feel the pressure to live and I donâ€™t want that, not anymore. 

So yeah, thatâ€™s it.
