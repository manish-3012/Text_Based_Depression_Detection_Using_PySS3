I'm only still living for other peopleI basically live from mental milestone to milestone. I didn't want to be dead before my little brothers' birthdays, I don't want to kill myself right now and ruin my gf's final few days of her well-deserved holiday. I keep postponing this thing that I know I want to do because I don't want to do it at a point in the lives of those I care about where it would sour an otherwise pleasant time. Even in suicidal thoughts I'm a pathetic people pleaser, I guess. 

I know there's people that care about me and that sucks, I don't know if I should just push them away so it'll hurt less. I don't want to imagine my gf crying over my death, or my mom falling back into a worse period physically because of grief. I don't want to hurt others, but I really, really want to hurt myself. My insecurities keep taking the driver's seat and despite going to therapy and openly talking about these thoughts, it feels I'm more being kept alive for the sake of not losing a human life rather than -my- life. 

I want to go out the villain, that would make it all a lot easier, but I can't bring myself to bring pain to those I care about the most, which I know is super ironic. 

Every night I go to sleep feeling like this, I'll wake up slightly better and some minor thing in my day will set my stupid ADHD brain on tilt and spiral me right the fuck back down. I don't want it anymore, I don't want to be a prisoner of my own mind anymore. I just want peace, and it seems suicide is the only way I can get that.
