For 18 months I was great on venlafaxine, now I feel so very depressedNothing really happened before to trigger it this time. Been on and off since October, since January been mostly depressed as hell. Then I found out my ex from over a decade ago, who ordinarily I could give too hoots about, has got his on and off gf pregnant and it devastated me. I finished him because he was an asshole and still is! For the last 10 years I have been with a great guy who I love very much. I had an abortion 4 years ago, I was devastated when I found out I was pregnant and fortunately live in a country where terminations are accessible. I do not regret my abortion but it was not a happy point in my life. I think perhaps my ex getting his gf pregnant brought this all back? I don't know, feelings are so complicated. All I know is that I feel like shit and do not know how to make myself feel any better. I have had some feelings of ending it all just so I don't feel awful anymore. I do not have a plan though and i am not sure if I will or not as I don't want to do that to the people I care about.
