im worse now than ive ever been. and i cant see myself getting betterim 25.. i hate msyelf. i hate how i look. how i talk. how i think. how i get really overwhelmed and easily overstimulated. i have a girlfriend who loves me. and a family who cares a great deal but.

i dont care. ?? about myself. ive spent years now researching ways to die. even recently. i spend all my night awake looking at ways to kill msyelf and then waking up 13 hours later with a headache and wanting to die even more.

i feel like im just. kind of in a delicate balancing act between killing myself and dragging myself along because i feel like ill hurt people or disappointment people.

anyway. i just needed to vent . lmao.
