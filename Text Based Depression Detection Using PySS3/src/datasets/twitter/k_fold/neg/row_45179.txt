I feel like im nearing the end of my life.â€œFriendsâ€ always leave me out or use me, try to exclude me, or just make fun of me. Iâ€™m ugly and and always in pain, so having fun and making friends is hard. Iâ€™m in a student council group and I feel like they always do events without me. I see them walking around and doing things that donâ€™t seem out of the ordinary for the group. The people I hang out with always seem better without me and they try to keep me away from them. I didnâ€™t do anything wrong, maybe because I am ugly and all other things. I am planning to end my life soon and I donâ€™t thing anyone will miss me.
