I always end up back hereCutting, cutting.

Bleeding. I know that I won't bleed to death, can't get deep enough...

Want pills... Wrote a note. Maybe when mom leaves, can get the pills... Unlock the door? 

I've done it before. Shitty lock, I think?

I can't escape this depression.

She compared my feelings to an open wound...emotions...reopen wound etc etc. 

Feeling nothing or feeling too much.

Always extremes with everything.

I'm sorry to those I am abandoning I know I am horrible but I can't do this...

Help me help me please? Idk what I want. Nice words? Meaningless? But nice?
