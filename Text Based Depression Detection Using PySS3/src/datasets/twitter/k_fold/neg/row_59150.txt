I'm done.Now all I have to do is wait. Everyone's left me. I'm literally by myself. Don't have to worry about parents being upset. I'm just...so tired. Too tired. Of always thinking. Doubting. No more doubting. I'll just fall asleep and never wake up. Unless something goes wrong.

Why'd I post here? I guess I just felt compelled to tell Someone, and I can't tell my brother. He's too busy. Always.

I'm sorry for breaking your heart, Toni.  I didn't realize what was going on. I didn't know it was normal. I broke you after 3 years. 4 years ago today, I told you I loved you. And I have never stopped. I just..you deserve better than someone like me. Your family was horrible to me, except you and your grandma. I love you still. I just wish I could hold you one more time, or even talk to you one last time. But I can't bring myself to. For all I know, you're with someone better.

If only you knew how much you still mean to me.
