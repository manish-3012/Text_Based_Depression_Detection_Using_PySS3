Help?I'm new to this site, but I think you guys might be able to help. My name is Triston, pleased to meet you all. I have been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and I think I have depression. It's been getting worse, and I have almost tried to kill myself twice. Talking doesn't help, and I was wondering what I could do to make the thoughts go away?
