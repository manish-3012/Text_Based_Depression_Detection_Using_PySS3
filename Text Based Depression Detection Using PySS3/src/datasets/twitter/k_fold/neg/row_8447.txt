I don't have anything to say, I'm just tiredI'm physically and emotionally exhausted. I've been avoiding classes and missing assignments. I've relapsed into old substance use patterns (currently sober though) and have been feeling a lot emptier since my group therapy sessions ended. I've been suicidal for the past 11 or so years, which is just about 50% of my life. Been hospitalized several times for attempts and ideation. Nothing imminent. Kind of thinking I might do it this summer on my birthday unless I can turn things around before then. 


Don't need anyone's help right now. Don't even need anyone to comment, honestly. I just needed a place to rant and write this shit. 

Thanks.
