Tired of feeling like I want to die every morning when I wake upI wake up wanting to die and it lasts until I go to sleep, when I just lay and think about ways I should kill myself. The only happiness I get is trying to help my friend get through his problems that for some reason he trusts me to help with. I don't agree with that, but I'm not gonna tell him to stop trying to talk to me for help if thats what he wants.

Honestly it's the only reason I havent killed myself yet, because he for some reason needs my help. I'm kind of jealous of him, he at least has a beautiful loving girlfriend to help and support him. I feel bad if I ask for any help at all because I'm just letting other people down who expect better from me. Not that they don't deserve better.

I just feel so worthless and hopeless. I've felt this way for 10 years, and it only gets worse as the days go by. I don't know how much longer I can even handle this. I don't want to kill myself but sometimes it feels like the only thing I can do to help out others by being less of a nuisance and burden on them.
