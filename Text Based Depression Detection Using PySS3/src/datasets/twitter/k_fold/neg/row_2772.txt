when i think it can't get worse, it doesnot graduating in may anymore. got kicked out of my university. bc i was dumb and got caught smoking weed. 8 years down the drain. nothing to show for it. bye bye pharmacy and mba dreams. my 2nd and final appeal just got denied today. there goes the bit of hope i had. as if my depression before this happened wasn't bad enough already. and now i have a court case to deal with. i'm 25 and my future got ripped out of my hands. i can't smoke or drink these feelings away bc i chose to enroll in a substance abuse center and they will test me. so all i can do is sit here and HATE MYSELF. i don't have anybody to turn to or anybody to talk to about it. i'm all alone and can't handle any of this. i haven't told my mom bc i can't have this conversation right now. i just want a horrible accident to happen to me so i can finally peacefully disappear. i wake up every day wishing it was over. just wanted to get this off my chest.
