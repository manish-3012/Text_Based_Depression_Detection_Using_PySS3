I canâ€™t take this disease anymoreIâ€™ve had feelings of wanting to be gone ever since High School and I canâ€™t even remember a time I was happy and wasnâ€™t filled with sadness so bad I could physically feel it. Iâ€™m going to begin putting my life together for my wonderful mother so she doesnâ€™t have to pack anything up and be more broken than it will already make her and in 3 days from now Iâ€™ll be gone. I just wish there was a way to make people know that this was the right thing for me and that itâ€™s no ones fault but my own and Iâ€™ll no longer have to be suffering...Iâ€™m just gonna go to sleep and not wake up. Iâ€™ll finally be free
