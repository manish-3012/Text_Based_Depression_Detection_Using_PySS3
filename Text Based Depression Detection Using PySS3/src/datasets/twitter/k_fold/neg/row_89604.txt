I just hope I could talk to someone, I don't want to bother my girlfriend and definitely not my momHaving the worst panic attack of my life and my exams are coming soon (completely unrelated) saw my ex best-friend opening up a new biology startup with one of my best friends. I feel completely useless and feel unproductive. My GPA is good but i am just scared i am not doing enough with my life. I have been diagnosed with MDD (major depressive disorder) for 6 years now and had written 3-4 suicide notes in the past. I just never really attempted to do it, i don't plan on to at least I hope I won't. I am not an emotional person nor am I taking my time writing this post, whatever is coming up in my mind I am just dishing it own. I feel helpless and lonely. My girlfriend is stuck in London with her family and i am here in Toronto all alone, my mom (with my stepdad) lives in Dubai and couldn't get back due to covid-19. I am not missing my girl or anything, i just feel done with life. Basically worthless.
