I hate myselfI hate myself so fucking much.

I am human garbage, vermin that must be exterminated.

I am a complete failure, on every level. 

I am without talent, intelligence, personality, humor, success, purpose, without anything really.

I am without value.

Actually that's wrong, I am of negative value.

I waste resources others in actual need could use.

All I do is bitch and moan at the expense of those around me.

I'd be wasting the time of those on here if anyone reads this anyway.

Not only am pathetic in this sense I have also thusfar failed to do to myself.

I have thusfar failed to kill myself. 

I don't understand how people could enjoy existence, and I don't understand how one could love themselves, or atleast how I could.

I just wanna die so badly and I know I deserve it and that I'm destined for it but I can't stop fucking stalling for time  like a bitch.
