I'm thinking about it.I made this account as a dummy account. Just an account that ive never posted on before. No one knows who i am. But. I guess thats how it is in my real life. Ive been strongly considering just ending it. Theres not much to live for. The one thing i want I cant get. I just want a girlfriend really. Someone whos there. Someone i can talk too and say I love you too. And someone I can trust. And even if i couldn't see her i would be happy because i would know that I am with her. Thats all i want. But I cant get it. So whats the point. There isnt one.
