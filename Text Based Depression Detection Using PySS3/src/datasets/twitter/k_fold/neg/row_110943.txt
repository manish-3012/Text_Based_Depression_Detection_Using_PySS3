I can't meet up to anyone's expectations, I am a failure, I have no friends.I really just feel at my wit's end right now, and all I can think about is jumping out of my window or ODing. This is a cry for help. I just had a really major nervous breakdown all because I couldn't get ready within 5 minutes to go to work with my bf (no he didn't get upset with me about it). But I feel like a fucking piece of shit failure. I know it's irrational. It doesn't change how I'm feeling. I feel like I always need to live up to everyone's expectations and I'm just not getting there. I can't do anything right. Any little thing I do wrong is always chastised. I'm always being scrutinized. All these expectations that I'm failing are piled up in this huge stack and *this* was the one that made the tower fall. This caused a huge anxiety attack and freak out for 30 whole minutes. Hyperventilating, hitting myself, throwing everything around and breaking shit in the bathroom, the whole works. Now I'm just lying here on the bathroom floor with mess all around me and dry tear stains. I don't even want to get up and look in the mirror and see what monstrosity awaits. I need help. But I can't get up the courage or the energy to find it. I have been desperately and relentlessly searching for friends and they have been nowhere to be found. The ones I thought I had were fake. I'm barely making enough money to survive. I'll be alone soon and have to pay rent and the rent would leave me with $5 left a month..not even enough to buy any fucking food, water, pay the bills, therapy, etc.. I thought I had a roommate but he keeps putting it off. My job forces me to participate in shady business practices that really drains my energy and makes me feel like a bad person (customer service.) It is extremely difficult to see the point in living right now.
