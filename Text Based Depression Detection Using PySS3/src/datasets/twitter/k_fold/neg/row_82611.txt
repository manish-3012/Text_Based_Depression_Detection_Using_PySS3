Abusive ex &amp; lockdown made me suicidalI was with my ex for 3 years. He hit me once, smashed plates, broke mirrors, spat at me, called me names. Id been planning to leave him for a while and when I took a break from him over a petty fight, a week later he hit me with several insults. Ugly, fat (I'm very skinny), flat ass and tits, big nose bitch. It made me suicidal. So I stayed broken up with him. he wanted to try and be friends Because he regretted the shit he said. I agreed but everyday I think of his words and it makes me hate the guy I once loved so madly. So I feel bitter. And angry. And so today he tells me I'm nothing but a child "stop crying you fucking child". And it broke me even more. I started to believe his words, and I talk to him because I need somebody but now I'm too far gone. It's been 2 weeks since the break up. I live at home since graduating with my strict family. Now London is in lockdown I'm even more restricted. I wish I could get hit by a car and escape this life easily. I just want to overdose. I can't do this. I've applied for 100 jobs who reject me. No one cares. U can walk all over me. I get mad at my mum at home and get angry. But I can't do this. I can't sleep at night. I'm lonely and can't leave my bed till late afternoons. I just can't. The doctor prescribed me some sleeping pills. I just want to take them all when I get them. Sleep forever
