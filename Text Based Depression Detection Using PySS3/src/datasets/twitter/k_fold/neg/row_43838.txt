I don't know how much longer I can hold out.I was planning on waiting until I go back to my CMHT to see if there was any fixing me but I can't wait any longer, my appointment is only a week away but the thoughts are getting stronger, more violent, more intrusive. I don't know if I have the strength to not act on them.
