How I deal...I've developed this weird habit. Every time I start to feel like ending it, I google pictures of people after they've committed suicide. Somehow, looking at pictures of people who have done it make me not want to do it. Like, I guess it makes me think that I would never want someone to see me like that. Especially if they were someone I cared about.
