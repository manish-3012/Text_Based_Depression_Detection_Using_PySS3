i'm fucking tired.A couple of months ago I accidentally overdosed of alcohol after I smoked weed so I woke up in the hospital and I didn't remember anything. I was told I could die so I realized how easy it is to die , I could just fall asleep forever and not even realizing it wow. So I want to try it again but on purpose this time , but I'm afraid I won't die and if I don't die my parents will be mad at me forever, how much do I have to drink (and smoke) to be sure I die? I'll wait until I graduate to see if my mental health gets better but if it doesn't fuck it I'm done. I'm don't even care anymore, I could not be born at all anyway, how many unborn babies are there in the world? so whatever, just tell me how much quantity of alcohol is necessary to die for sure.
