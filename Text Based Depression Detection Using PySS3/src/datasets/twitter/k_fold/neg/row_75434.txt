Telling a psychiatristIfeel constantly tired, and that life is extremely pointless; a lot of things that kept me going like video games are no longer interesting. Every little inconvenience I get nowadays sets me off into thinking about suicide and how it'd be better to end my life before a certain date. My mother has gotten me an appointment with a psychiatrist on the 26th (I have gone to only 2 psychologists in the past couple years but I have asked to stop going to them both times and lied to get out of it; she thinks I "could have benefitted from medication back then" but 'better late than never' I guess) and I am very concerned that if I tell the psychologist that I have had suicidal thoughts for the past 4 months and recently have begun 'planning' that they will commit me to a mental/psychiatric hospital, take away my things, or ask my mom to watch me. I am only 15. My father and his mother both have clinical depression and have taken medication for it, and my Mom and Dad split when I was 11. I have thought about telling my mom to cancel the appointment but I'm getting increasingly nervous about what is going to happen when I talk to the psychiatrist and am thinking of lying to get out of it. Are my worries be unfounded? Sorry for the word dump.
