Just need helpSorry wall of text

I've felt this way since before I can remember reading my diary as a kid feeling "sad" it's just so tiring just breathing and I'm scared. I don't want to worry/wake my fiancÃ© so I can't call the hotline. Been to the doctor been prescribed different meds higher doses, councilling, CBT and nothing seems to work. Spending unsuccessfully years trying to find a trigger has made me feel worse and I'm running out of ideas of trying to stay alive. I'm a burden to my fiancÃ© I'm struggling to get out of bed let alone work I feel like a complete failure and I know he could find someone better in a heart beat. I've put him through hell attempting to kill myself around the time we met I even fail at killing myself :/ I don't want to die but the thoughts in my head have gotten so loud I can't block them out anymore. I've tried everything anyone suggests I'm desperate to feel normal...just feel so numb I can stick needles in my leg and feel nothing. My fiancÃ© sleeps in another room at the moment because I snore and he's started a new job and my thoughts scream that he doesn't love me anymore, he'll leave me, we're drifting apart. I know I'm rambling just feel I have no one to talk to and I don't want to burden him anymore.

I want to be normal. I don't want to die but it's like a siren call. I'll see my family again, I'll see my dad. I miss him so much and wish we could at least trade places he would have made more of a difference to this world. 

I guess I'm trying to think of reasons to stay and I don't know if staying for my fiancÃ© is selfish because of what I put him through.
