I think the thoughts are coming backBurner account for reasons but I think my suicidal thoughts are coming back in full swing and I'm thinking about it logically, and it makes the most sense to me. 

I'm a horrible person that's hurt a ton of people, I'm mediocre at my job at best, parents are abusive and would only be sad as they're losing a cash cow since I pay a little of their bills and can't move out due to credit debts they took out in my name and fucked me over with. 

The world will still turn with or without me and I'm positive I'm not going to hurt anyone if I go.
