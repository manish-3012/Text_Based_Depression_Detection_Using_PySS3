Dead end everything and a easy way outI'm tired of living, it gives me no joy, only regrets.

For the last couple of years, friends and family have pushed me to seek help for my condition, and there have been periods of feeling better, but it always end the same. The drugs don't work, the psychiatrist treats me like a child, the psycologist does not know what to do or say and I'm back in my old ways, sleeping every second day for a couple of ours, and constantly crying about things that do not matter, and then it's time to test the new drug thats supposed to work.

If i'm so broken that the specialists at one of the largest university hospitals in sweden can not do anything. Why should i even try. Sure, I have lots of friends that would be sad, but my current line of thought is 100% egotistical and I am fine with that.

I have a plan for how to do it, it will be fairly safe, minimal chance of failure and minimal pain.

I do not want to think anymore, I do not want to analyze every word that comes out of my mouth, i do not want to carry on making stupid decisions. It needs to end.
