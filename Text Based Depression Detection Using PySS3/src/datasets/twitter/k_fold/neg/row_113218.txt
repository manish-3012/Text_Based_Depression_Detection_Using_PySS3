I can't be me anymoreThe only way out is through death or through a thousand more crippling blows to my fucked up body and mind. I just can't stand it. I'm not good enough and I can't change. I don't think there's anything good about me. The only reason to live is my family and even by living I'm torturing them. Is it worse? One great heartbreak over an eternity of small heart breaks. I'm scared to die. And I want to do things I just don't know what I want to do. Either path I go down someone will hurt for the rest of their lives. Maybe both of us. My mom and I.
