Does this feeling ever ends?I'm doing much better mentally than I did for the past 10 years, I'm going to therapy and I'm taking medictions. I'm finally feeling good. But the thing is, I still want to die. I have no reason to live on, life seems so blank and without a point. I'm still thinking about killing myself not because I'm miserable, but because I just want to skip life to the end. I know that I'm not going to do anyhing exciting so whats the buzz? I don't even have aby dreams or wishes. 

Does this feeling will ever end? I'm I ever gonna enjoy living?  I feel so empty.
