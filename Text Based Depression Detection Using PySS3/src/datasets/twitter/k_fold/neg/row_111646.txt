I feel like im in the end stage of being suicidalIts been so long now. Sometimes i sit back and think what am i even waiting for? I want to kill myself, yet im still here. My excuse is always: "i have to find the right method" or "i have to find the right date". And it kinda got me thinking...do i really want to die? Or am i just in a really fucked up stage of my life. For a long time i have believed that if you truly wanted to be dead then you would already be dead, yet im still here. Idk what im waiting for, maybe im scared or some shit idk. All i know is this shit is getting old and my patience for myself to want to get better is at its lowest. FUCK.
