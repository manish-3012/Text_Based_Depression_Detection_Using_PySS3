Need to rant... nowhere else to go... sorryI feel so worthless. I have such a horrible personality everyone hates me. If I was at least good looking people would still like me but i'm not.


I've been living with my aunt and she says she doesn't think we get along and when I move out for school I won't be coming back.

My own aunt doesn't like me.


Family relationships are supposed to be a big deal in my family and she doesn't even like me.

Why would anyone like me? I'm so annoying and obnoxious and I say sorry far too much.

And I'm ugly and everyone hates ugly girls -__-

Fuck everything. I'm so lonely. And angry. Ugh I am pissing myself off with my whineyness.
