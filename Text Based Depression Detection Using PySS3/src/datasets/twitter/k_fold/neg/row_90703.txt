Giving up...I feel like my body and mind are rejecting everything healthy I've learned over the past 2-3 years. I hadn't been happy for a long time in my life until about 6 months ago when I was finally keeping up with my mental and physical health however this past month I just sort of gave up. I haven't bathed I haven't been eating right I haven't left the house I haven't even been taking my medication and it's scary because I don't know why. I know what to do to be happy I know I should do it but... I don't. I'm back to being depressed and anxious and well suicidal at times. I want to pull myself out of this funk but I don't know if I'm strong enough.
