Iâ€™m a disappointment to my parents and myselfToday my parents called me a disappointment, they wished they had never had me and bring up tiny mistakes I made from my past. I want to cry but I just canâ€™t and it hurts. I just want it to end. I canâ€™t live with who I am. My own parents hate me. I have friends but no one who I can tell and share my pain. I hope that writing this post will make the pain go away. I hope this makes sense. I just want others to love me, but no one will and I am a failure. I try to forget and move on just hoping for something better. I canâ€™t even find a hobby to keep my mind from wandering into the sadness my parents have created for me. I just want to die just let go of my pain. Iâ€™m pretty sure no one will notice if I do die.
