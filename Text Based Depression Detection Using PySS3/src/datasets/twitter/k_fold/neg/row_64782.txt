i can't fucking talkSince I was little I was always *very* quiet and scared of making friends. I never learned how to talk. 

People have been so nice to me, they didn't want me to feel left out but I just don't know what to say. I'm not funny in the slightest, people don't enjoy my presence and I wouldn't too. 

I can't stand me. I fucking hate me for that. 

Nobody wants to harm me I just can't CONNECT to people.
I never had real friends, never had a relationship. I'm so alone.

It eats me up so much...

I think about suicide every single day. And right now it's all I can think about. 

I don't want to die... I want to live and enjoy life. I see others doing it. 

It's seems so, so beautiful. 

But knowing.. knowing with *such* certainty that it will be denied to me by my own doing. That I will never experience real happieness, the carelessness, the trust and bond to another person.. 

It's just too much. 

I don't want to hide all my life, I don't want to feel the pain every day. I want to be free.
