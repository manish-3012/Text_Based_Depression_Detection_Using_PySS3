I feel nothing at all. No anger, sadness. Just a void.Suppose I've dropped a number of threads here over the years, many of them quite aggressive. I was usually in a pretty angry state of mind (self-directed, largely), but it feels different this time. More specifically, it feels like nothing.

There's a sort of neutral state we get in, where we do not feel strongly about things. It's easy to recognize, because we will become angry, or happy, or some number of possible reactions to things going on around us. A humorous image, an infuriating internet comment, these things evoke a response in a neutral mindset.

This isn't that. I feel nothing. Spent some time browsing various things to try evoking a response, but there is none. Went out today, since it usually flares up panic responses. I felt nothing. I just existed in these times and places, present but not really living in those moments. I can feel myself responding to things said in ways people expect, but they're programmed responses. Things I know others want to hear. I don't mean any of it.

The closest I've gotten to feeling anything over the last 3 days has been hugs from my wife. There's something there, it stirs briefly before disappearing again. I do care about her a great deal, one of the few things in the world I genuinely care for. It's strange I should feel so muted about it. I don't think I like it.

Wasn't sure where else to say this. I don't know what it means. It isn't passing, as these episodes normally do. Not really sure I'm meant to exist in this state.
