Canâ€™t take joy in my accomplishmentsIâ€™m 34 years old. I divorced 3 years ago. Ever since I decided that I was going to refocus my life, be productive and work hard. Iâ€™m a paramedic and when my ex wife left me for another man I decided to do everything I could to be successful. I started going to the gym and eating healthy. I lost 40 lbs and kept at and eventually obtained a very athletic physique that I still maintain today. Itâ€™s a part of my lifestyle now. I catch women looking at me all the time, especially when Iâ€™m working and Iâ€™m in uniform. 

I decided that I also wanted to do more for my career. I decided that I was going to become a doctor. (Seemed the logical step from paramedic). Iâ€™ve spent the last 3 years working my ass off at the local community college (I had to do a lot of catching up in math). I have a 3.9 overall gpa and am a member of a couple honors societies. Everyone (co-workers, I donâ€™t have family or friends) seems to be supportive of my educational and career goals. Iâ€™ve even had doctors I worked with in a local trauma center tell me that they had no doubt I would get where I wanted to go. 

Iâ€™m at the point now where I need to start applying to universities. I started to fill out the application for my top choice and I came to the â€œpersonal statementâ€ portion where Iâ€™m supposed to write about my educational background, my goals and why I wanted to attend that university. And I had a sudden realization. I have no idea. 

I donâ€™t really take any pleasure or joy in my accomplishments and I donâ€™t think I ever have. I have no one to share them with. And I started to realize that all my hard work and dedication to both my school and physical fitness hasnâ€™t done anything meaningful for my life. Iâ€™m still lonely. Iâ€™m still sad. Iâ€™m still isolated and alone. Iâ€™m wondering why I work so hard when the end result will be the same. A life of isolation and loneliness. I just keep going to the gym and working so hard because I literally have NOTHING else in my life except my work ethic. Iâ€™m just so god damn lonely and miserable and I have been for so long. Sometimes I wonder if Iâ€™m even capable of feeling love and happiness. 

I feel so stupid and selfish for feeling this way. I feel like I have no right to feel this when so many people donâ€™t even get the opportunities to go to school or lack the ability to obtain their goals. But I canâ€™t help but just feel like the hard work doesnâ€™t matter at the end of the day when youâ€™re always going home to nothing but an empty apartment. They say the best things in life are shared.
