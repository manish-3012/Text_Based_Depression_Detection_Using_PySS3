I'm afraid of surviving it, that's the only thing holding me back.Chronic pain since I was 16.  Been ruining my life since.  Doctor's don't care anymore - at 31 I'm not getting better because it's "my fault and I'm just faking it to get out of work".  Been homeless a few times because of this.  Moved back in with my parents.  Being told I'm getting the boot in a week.  Nothing is changing, just getting worse.  Tried hanging myself a while back but it failed, now I'm afraid of trying any other method (next on the list would be gassing myself with my vehicle) and surviving that, too.  Life isn't going to get better, best option is to die, death is not nearly as scary as living like this, or making an attempt and living with the consequence of failing again.
