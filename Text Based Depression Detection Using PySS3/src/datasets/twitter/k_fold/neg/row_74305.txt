I'm [22m] in love with my best friend [21m] but he already has a boyfriendI met this guy in summer and he's absolutely amazing. I never thought I would meet someone on such a similar wavelength to me. We've become very close friends, and see each other pretty much every day. I was attracted to him as soon as we met but I always knew he had a boyfriend. They've been together now for nearly two years and are currently long distance. From what I can gather, they seem very much happy together. I have no intention of making a move, because it wouldn't be fair to him and I don't think I'd have a chance anyway. 

I thought I could be strong and get over it but it's been five months since we met and the more I get to know him, the stronger the feelings I have for him become. Today I just couldn't take it and started to cry on the bus. I'm honestly at my wit's end. I don't think I'll ever meet someone like him again. For the first time in my life I'm actually considering suicide over a guy, I can't believe how ridiculous that is but I just can't tolerate this pain anymore. It's consuming me. 

I know I should probably cut contact with him but he's my only close friend, we get on so well and I would be so lonely without him. I've tried meeting other guys but they just don't compare. I'm not sure what I'm looking for here; I know none of you have the magic solution but I'd appreciate any words of support or advice.
