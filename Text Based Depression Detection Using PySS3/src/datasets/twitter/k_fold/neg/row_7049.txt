Too scared to end my life... :(I really want to end my life for many reasons. I hate being depressed everyday i wake up, i have no future, i hate the way my life is atm, i have no parents, i have hardly any friends. And i dont want to do anything with my life and i want to end it really badly but i'm to scared to do it and i'm also scared of hurting my family and friends. So im forced to exist in a life that i want to end. I dont know what to do.
