I am married, have two young children, and feel completely alone.I'm 40. I am overwhelmed by suicidal ideation tonight. My son -- 11 -- threatened to get a knife and stab me today, and not in a "I'm a kid and I'm joking" way. I got in the car and drove for hours tonight. When I got home I went to ou bedroom. My husband just came in an, with barely one word, laid down and went to sleep. I really, really just want to go the to garage, get in the car, start it, and sleep forever.
