Mental health getting so much worseI have been dealing with severe depression, anxiety, OCD, psychosis, and an undiagnosed eating disorder for  years. I've tried CBT, counselling, different medications and nothing has worked. Everything is just getting worse. The only thing keeping me alive is that I have a loving boyfriend that I'll get to see once lockdown is over, but sometimes I fear that the feelings are going to get too overwhelming. They've gotten to the point where I had to hide scissors and medications in another room to stop myself from impulsively doing anything. I don't know how to stop this
