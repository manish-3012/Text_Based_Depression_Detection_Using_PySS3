I donâ€™t know what to doThe only way ill get better at this point is inpatient hospitalization but i canâ€™t go back there. i donâ€™t know what to do. my meds donâ€™t work and im too busy for intensive outpatient. nothing seems worth living for anymore and Iâ€™m too scared to go back to inpatient (itâ€™s all just a scam anyways). im just going to do it.
