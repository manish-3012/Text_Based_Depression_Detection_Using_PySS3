Mom attempted suicide1year ago my father successfully killed himself after we tried to get him help at an impatient program after his first attempt. My mother tried to slit her wrist the same way he did. She is in an inpatient program now, i am literally reliving my worst nightmare and cant stop thinking that she will just kill herself when she comes out. I have talked with her and she seems to want to get better, how do i cope with this situation when i am still suffering with the ptsd of finding my father dead?
