Regret.I wish I killed myself when I had the chance to. Since then, itâ€™s just been miserable and Iâ€™ve realised how much people donâ€™t care about me. I donâ€™t have any close friends and I donâ€™t think I ever will. None of them would care if I died. 

I havenâ€™t been able to self harm or attempt suicide becuase I donâ€™t live alone and havenâ€™t had enough time alone to try anything. The last time I wouldâ€™ve had a chance to was the day I got admitted to a psychiatric ward.

I am ready to be gone. Iâ€™ve been researching what to write in a note. I just wish I had enough time to kill myself.
