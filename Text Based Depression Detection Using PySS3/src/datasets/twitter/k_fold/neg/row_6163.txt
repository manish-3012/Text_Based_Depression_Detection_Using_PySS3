I can't go on.My depression started six months ago. Since then, I have been going to bed and waking up crying every single day.

It's not getting better, it's getting worse. I lost all hope. I'm an embarrassment and a disappointment. I want to feel numb, I want my brain to shut off, but it just won't let me rest. I just want to rest. I can't continue.
