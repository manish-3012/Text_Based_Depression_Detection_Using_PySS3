i never told you because i want you to help me. i told you because i want you to tell me itâ€™s okay to let go.so please stop telling me that things do get better. stop telling me that you love me. stop telling me that you care. i just want you to tell me that itâ€™s okay, that itâ€™s okay to let go, that youâ€™ll support me in whatever i do.
