Im a burden to my parents and my teachers Im 16. My life was pretty good until 2 months ago when I developed some strange disorder causing me to smell bad and feel sick to my stomach ALL THE TIME. Nobody takes me seriously and my parents keep telling me "its all in my head". They try to guilt trip me after I tell them I want to miss school about their own bullshit they have to go through and make me look like I am the one at fault. Nobody wants to be around me, I always feel sick, amd my teachers don't understand. I'm missing so much school and so many opportunities just from this stupid fucking shit and it has to end, if I never get cured for this, I'm just going to kill myself
