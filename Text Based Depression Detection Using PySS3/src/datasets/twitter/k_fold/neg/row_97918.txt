Probably tonight, who knows.I donâ€™t exactly know why Iâ€™m making this post, because Iâ€™m not going to change my mind. 

Iâ€™ve finally hit rock bottom, Iâ€™m pretty sure. My family are abusive pricks, and Iâ€™ve tried to reach out for help regarding that issue, but nothing seems to help, still.

School is the worst part. I get shoved into lockers, get my money taken, a few guys even took it as far as following me home, throwing rocks.

I donâ€™t plan on writing any notes to people, because I donâ€™t have any friends. 

Anyways, this is probably goodbye. I hope you all can be stronger than I was.
