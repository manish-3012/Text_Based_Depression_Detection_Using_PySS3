I've lost my will to liveRecently moved to GA from Florida for work witch I hate my job. My girlfriend dumped my on Valentine's day. I have severe anxiety and social problems. So basically I lost the only person I truly cared about and have no friends and I'm not close to my family at all in terms as family go. I love over 300 miles from anyone I new. I feel like people dont like my and that I'm just a flee on mother earth that just needs to die already. I have attempted in the past when I lived with my mom but she caught me a prevented it from being completed but now that I'm alone with another I know anywhere close it sounds very tempting to revisit it
