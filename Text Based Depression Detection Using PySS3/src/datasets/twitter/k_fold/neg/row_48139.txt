I'm Lost.I've been dealing with suicide tendencies since I was in middle school and got picked on and hard a really hard time getting through school and social life. I was in a relationship throughout high school which didn't end well, he was constantly cheating on me behind my back. we were together for 3 years. Met the most perfect guy in m entire life later on after. We started dating in March Broke up around Thanksgiving, but we stayed "together". Now when I tell you hes the most perfect guy in the world I mean hes the perfect guy for me, A dj, loves music, has an amazing family who he loves dearly, Made me come out of my awkward shell, Showed me new things, never let me feel judged and could talk to him freely about anything. Reddit hes the man I saw myself with and Idc if i sound like a total freak and he sees This I LOVE YOU MORE THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.... you know why were not together, because of me I lied to him about STUPID shit. I'd fight about it tooth and nail and I knew i was wrong, i just never wanted to admit to it. He ended everything thrusday, and i've bee fighting with him begging for a chance again, I just feel so lost more than I have more than I felt when I was in middle school, I'm in college failing all my classes but one, I have a horrible job that I hate so much. I deleted my facebook and I can't beleive I'm using my real account but I just dont care anymore. I dont know what to do. I have a therapist and shes helping, I had a long phone call with her yesterday. But that didnt seem to help. He wants to be friends but how can you be friends with someone youre in love with and they want nothing to do with you, I'm sorry if this is a mess but I'm just typing as things come to mind.
