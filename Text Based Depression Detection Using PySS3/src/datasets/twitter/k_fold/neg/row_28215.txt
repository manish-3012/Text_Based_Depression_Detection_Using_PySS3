It feels like my soul left my bodyI feel so broken and empty it feels inhuman. I keep reaching out for comfort every where I turn, but nothing seems to help. I just end up embarrassed. Iâ€™m not sure thereâ€™s anything even left of me other than depression. Does it ever get easier? It feels like itâ€™ll never end.
