Iâ€™m a huge loser, my life is heading nowhere and Iâ€™m filled with guilt. Iâ€™m better off dead.Here I am, perfect working body and yet Iâ€™m bitching about my life. Iâ€™m dropping out of school because Iâ€™m a loser, I got nobody in my life and Iâ€™m always angry at everything. Iâ€™m sick and tired of being abandoned, of being manipulated and hurt.

My entire life all I did was try, everything was so easy for everybody else. Relationships, making friends, social interactions and such. Iâ€™ve always had to try extra hard for everything and itâ€™s never enough, Iâ€™m never enough. I pour my fucking heart out into all my friends and everything I do, itâ€™s never fucking enough. Iâ€™m never actually good at anything.

I wish I wasnâ€™t such a fucking asshole sometimes, I wish the people I care about could actually show some damn loyalty once in a while, I wish I could just live like a normal person for once. 

Iâ€™m always so full of hatred for myself, I can barely breathe. Maybe I should just get it over with already, I just donâ€™t wanna make my family go through this because this donâ€™t deserve it. They didnâ€™t ask for this piece of shit to be born from their line, my only actual skills right now are complaining and getting wasted for no reason.

Iâ€™m at this point in my life where I just canâ€™t change anything, I just have to ride it out and wait for things to get better because itâ€™s off my hands. Itâ€™s fucking frustrating, Iâ€™ve been trying all my life and it never gets better.
