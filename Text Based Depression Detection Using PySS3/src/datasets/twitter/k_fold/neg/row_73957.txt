I don't know if I'm suicidal but I'm getting there.Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this in, I just wasn't sure where else to go. I have an emotionally abusive mother (granted she's trying her best) and suffer from an array of mental disorders.  This includes somniphobia, (Fear of sleep). I also suffer from a physical deformity known as femoral retroversion. (my leg bones twist, basically). None of these details are random.

Now what happened today was a fairly small infraction but basically, I have been kicked out of my own room because my grandmother is using it. She had hip surgery so I understand but I have autism, so change is hard.  I play games to cope with things like this, and frankly, the friends I made on there are about ten times better than the ones I've made in real life. They're my lifeline because really they're the only people who make me feel human. My mom hates games, and hates when I play them. So does my dad (my dad hates the social aspect.)

my parents ever growing disappointment in me, my depression, my increased social isolation, its all catching up to me, and today,  their leash around me tightened.  again. more regulations.  All I'm doing is hurting, all the time. and now, all I want is to hurt, even more, I want to keep breaking and breaking and breaking until I shatter and then, maybe, finally, I get my release.  I don't know why I posted this, I just wanted someone to know I suppose.
