Why should I care anymoreI think I may be extremely at risk and i dont know what to say or do. I'm just a lazy bum on my cousins couch cause I got kicked from my exs. All my cards are gone and I have to get them. I don't have my meds and my cousins are scared that I'm going to off myself around them. Im jobless carless miserable lazy bum living in their living room like some kind of fucking goblin. I'm no good to anyone. Just useless. Lazy. Miserable. And I dont care anymore. Im so fucking tired of it all. I'm sick of men not liking me and I'm sick of not being stable enough to talk to a man. I should have died many times over these past years. Many many times. I'm sick of the fucking bullshit survivor role. I'm sick of it all.
