Tonight is my last night aliveTomorrow morning on my way to work Iâ€™ll jump in front of a train. Iâ€™ve been severely depressed for ages, and treatment isnâ€™t working. I know Iâ€™ll upset my friends and family, but Iâ€™m just a burden to them all and if they are about me itâ€™s simply a waste of energy.

Adios
