I'm worried no one will take me seriously because I'm 16I'm 16 and have been depressed since I was 7. I no longer have the will to live. I go to a councilor, and that helped for a while, but it's getting worse. I have friends and I try to talk to them all the time but they don't know how to help me. I'm starting to think no one can help me. I've tried medication and it didn't work. I want to stop living this way but have no clue how to.
