Landed myself in a toxic friendship veiled as support systemI'm in a sticky situation. I think I've finally made a friend. But this friendship is super risky. For me especially.  I am putting myself in a potentially complicated scenario if things go south. And it can go south very very quickly as I've witnessed when one of us did something stupid. But the thing is. We are both suicidal individuals and after having found each other we have decided to stay alive for each other. But we seem to be holding that over each other and it's so difficult to know what the correct thing to do is here. I already saw how devastating it would be for my friend if s/he loses me. And if I lose  him/her I would likely commit suicide. I just want to die and not have to think about anything or anyone dammit!
