LockedI want to get out of there. College fucked my registration out. it was my only way out. I want to get out of there and I can't. I cannot handle this place anymore no matter how much I love a few people. I I don't want to fuck their lives up by killing myself, but I won't bear to stay there neither. It's been since March. it feels like a kidnapping, but the culprits are the ones i love.
