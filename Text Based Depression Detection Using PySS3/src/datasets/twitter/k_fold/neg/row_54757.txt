Life is so hardI have some kind of problem, I can't handle my life when I have more than one thing to do in the day. 
And when I'm not ready or something unexpected happens I suffer so much, how am I supposed to keep living without a good reason at all and when the everyday life for everybody cause so much suffering to me? 

I stop working when I have a lot to do, and the most I had to do in all my life was on college (that I could not finish) and I had nothing to do home. How can I not suffer if my future is just me suffering everyday because I have to make food and wash my clothes? Or that I have to pay my bills? 

There's just no way for me to keep living, this is just one of my problems, suicide is the most logical alternative.
