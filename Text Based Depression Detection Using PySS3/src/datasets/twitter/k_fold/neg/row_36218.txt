got laid off yesterday. feel like shitI lost my job yesterday. I've been looking for work all day today and to be honest the prospects don't look good. I realize I may have gotten lucky with my previous position. My degree will get me a job for 13/h and thats about it. Where's the future in that? I've gone from being a loser with an OK job to a loser with no job. So I'm basically a life loser at this point. Never thought it would actually happen. 

The thought of killing myself has crossed my mind more than once. My brain says that there is some hope and that I can get through this. My heart says that no - I probably won't be able to. My sense of selfworth has been extinguished since forever. Deep down the truth is that I hate myself and because of this I'll never be happy or satisfied with my life
