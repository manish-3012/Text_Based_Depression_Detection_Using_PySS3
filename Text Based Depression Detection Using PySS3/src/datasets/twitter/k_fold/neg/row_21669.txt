As someone who just got sucked into the sucuide spirale - I recall myself telling others 'Every story is worth being told, ALSO yours'. This also goes for you/myselfThis one sentence is like the wayfinder in my life. I used it to motivate my friends to make them feel safe. To bring up an atmosphere where they can talk about themselves and noone will judge them.

I had really dark thinking and was about to do it, I cried the whole day and got scared. And then this sentence crossed my mind and my old self told that to my present self. It helped.

And whoever is searching for help - remember. Your story is worth being told. Every is.

Love, Deceptive~
