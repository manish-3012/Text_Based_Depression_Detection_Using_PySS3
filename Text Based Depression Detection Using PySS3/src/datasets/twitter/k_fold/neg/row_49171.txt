Low GPA issues, want to jump off a building or in front of a trainHey folks,  


I am an electrical engineering student who has an incredibly low GPA score (3.792 on a scale of 7 which is equal to a 2.160 on a scale of 4). I have completed 3 semesters out of a 4 year degree however, my GPA is far too low for anyone other than the smallest startups to take me in. I am hoping that when I die, I will have a fresh GPA and a fresh chance of life. Someone please talk me out of this.  


Regards,
