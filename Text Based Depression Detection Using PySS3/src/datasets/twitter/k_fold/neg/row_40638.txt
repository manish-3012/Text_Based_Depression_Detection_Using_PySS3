Want to die more than anythingI'm useless, always will be, and all I want is to have love and earn it, and I can never earn it because I'm useless, I don't work at all, I don't do anything.

Nobody else benefits from me, I'm a horrible person, anybody who thinks they love me is lying themselves, they have no reason to uphold me.

I'm trying to go through methods, but I don't think there's anything guaranteed. Self-preservation instincts mean drowning and stabbing are off the table. My toaster's cord is too short, and we don't have anything to jam the tub with anyway. I don't know if we have a gun...

I just want to die, help me kill myself, please.
