I have tried to end my life three times and everytime for different reasons but one factor that was always involved was I always felt alone.  I once was having a casual conversation with someone and the conversation turned to the subject of suicide.  The person I was talking to said that suicide is selfish.  I was just listening cause I could not respond (put my face on pretending that I have never tried to kill myself).  I felt selfish for a moment but then I realised that there is only one of me.  The bad times I went threw only I could understand it and no one else.  I am one I am real and I am Human.  I am very happy I was never successful of my attempts of ending my life.  Being human sucks and its a alone feeling much of the time but I realised I am not alone.
