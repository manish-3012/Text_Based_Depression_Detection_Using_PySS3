Suicidal but don't want to die.I can still rationalize this. I don't want to die, I can't do that to the people I love. I also can't stop thinking about going out to a snowbank near the hospital, writing organ donor on my arm, and shooting myself. 

I took apart my guns and have the actions in a bag. I have finals next week and can't deal with opening up about this right now. I trust my family to hold them and not look but don't want the parts in my house. 

How do I ask someone to look after this bag that renders my guns inoperable until I calm down without alerting them that I'm struggling?
