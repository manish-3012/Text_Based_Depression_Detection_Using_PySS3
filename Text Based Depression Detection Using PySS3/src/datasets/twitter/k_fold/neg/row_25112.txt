i really want to overdose after finals are doneme and my boyfriend of 14 months are probably about to break up. he's my lifeline, my best friend, the only real connection i've really made in college. if this actually happens i think i'm finally going to attempt suicide... i'm just broken, everyone leaves and as an autistic bisexual woman who's suffered trauma and abuse i'm not meant to have friends or be cared about. i just want everything to end. 19 years is too long
