Probably gonna regret putting this here but it's eating me alive...So first I would like to inform you of my age: 17. So I've been through a kidnapping and rape trauma, It's tough cause I haven't been able to heal much lately. I feel like killing myself but I cant.. I can't leave. I have a wonderful boyfriend and a wonderful family which I should be grateful to have but yet I'm not. The messed up thing is that I've been wanting to commit suicide or possibly even have a dramatic event happen (again). It's true, I think about it happening a lot. Sometimes I'll just be siting in class day dreaming of getting hit by a car and imagining the air getting knocked out of me and hitting the ground so hard that medical attention is needed if not death. But my worst daydreams these past few weeks have been of wanting to be kidnapped by someone, which then leads to having them rape and kill me... it's messed up I know. I need help but I can't admit myself so I guess what I'm getting at is that, I need a little hope before I find myself searching from some hitman in the deep web. Cause I might just.... I'm really considering suicide... I wouldn't have posted this but I need some help.
