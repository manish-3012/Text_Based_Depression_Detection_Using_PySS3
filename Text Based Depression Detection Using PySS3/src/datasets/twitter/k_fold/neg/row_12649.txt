I don't deserve to feel goodIt hurts so much. I feel like I don't deserve anything good. I don't deserve to live in my great neighborhood. I don't deserve to study what I love. I don't deserve to be financially supported by my parents. I deserve to be thrown out in the streets, left to wither away and go crazy and die. I deserve to die. I deserve to bleed and bleed until I fall asleep forever. I deserve to be beaten. I deserve nothing good. I am a worthless piece of garbage whose only purpose is to cut herself and hurt people. I am nothing. I want to bleed. I want to die.
