Killing myself so I wonâ€™t be a burdenIâ€™ve been working myself into the ground since my first suicide attempt eight years ago, in the hopes of reaching that elusive light at the end of the tunnel. But it doesnâ€™t exist. I struggle at school with processing and severe anxiety. Iâ€™ve got PTSD and bipolar 2 both going untreated because I have no money. And I feel like I canâ€™t do anything like school or work without having a breakdown and trying to kill myself (four attempts, one really close one so far). Honestly, my dream would be to just be a housewife, write novels, and do domestic work in my home. Like, I wouldnâ€™t sit aroundâ€”I genuinely enjoy keeping a home and cooking. I know thatâ€™s anti-feminist or what the fuck ever, but itâ€™s the only shit I can do where I donâ€™t feel this crippling stress or pressure from others. Mostly because writing and being a homemaker are more solitary than school and work. I think I just hate people; I might be on the autism spectrum (donâ€™t know, no money), but I just donâ€™t know how to read people or glean what they want from unspoken little nuances. 

Fuck, I just want a life where I donâ€™t constantly feel powerless. I was raped as a kid, suffered a fuckton of violence from my dad, my babysitter (she locked us in a closet and stepped on us), my scout leader (got mad and pushed me down a flight of stairs). And school was always hard for me. Iâ€™m just not good at academia. But Iâ€™m also not good at school. Iâ€™m useless. Everyone around me tethers my worth to my success, and I guess I kind of do too. So, itâ€™s time.

Adios.
