Quarantine bringing up old feelingsThe cuts from when I tried are finally healed and just scars now but with the world quickly going to shit and the threat of my work closing down and my school actually closing im finding it increasingly harder to fend off thoughts of suicide. 

If I cant go to work I cant get paid, I have some savings put away but none of us know how long it will be and unemployment will only be 1/4 of my current pay. What will happen when I run out? 

If I cant go to work or school I will also be forced to stay at home with my mother who is living with me in my house and shes going more and more insane. I barely recognize her and shes really kinda scaring me.

And while I saw it coming for a while and kinda the least of my worries right now, its just really bad timing that my boyfriend just broke up with me. Its more that this feeds into my loneliness.

If my work closes I feel like just getting in my truck and just driving. Not telling anyone, no clues of where im going and just going. No clue of how far I'll get considering quarantines. I just really cannot stay here.
