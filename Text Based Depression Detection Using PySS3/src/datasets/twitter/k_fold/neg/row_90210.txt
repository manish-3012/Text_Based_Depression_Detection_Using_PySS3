Need someone to talk toI drove away someone who was just trying to be a friend, itâ€™s not the first time Iâ€™ve done it. I hate myself for it and it hurts but I still do it. I really cared about this person but I treated them badly. One person from here I ended up blocking even though I knew they were having a hard time and now I had the same thing done to me so I guess I got what I deserve. I have no one in my life that I can really talk to. Iâ€™m just deeply unhappy and sad and I canâ€™t see any end to feeling that way. It hasnâ€™t gotten better in the 28 years Iâ€™ve been alive. I really think I just want to end it.
