I laugh when ppl write pity stories like oh donâ€™t kill your self blah blah I saw a dad cradle his dead suicided sons body saying daddyâ€™s here itâ€™s ok. Hahahahaha hahahahaha fuckin narcissist. When the kids gone the parents can make narrative what they want be the pitiful parents. Not always the caseSome parents like mine would drive the kid to suicide and then act like the suffering victim and caring parent after. Newsflash people, when someone kills themselves most of the time ITS NOT FUCKIN ABOUT YOU. Most of you might even be the causes so stop making someoneâ€™s suicide all about YOU.
