There is no good in life. Why even try?There is no good in life.  I'm a very shy quiet guy, I probably have some sort of mental disorder, perhaps aspergers or something so social skills don't come naturally to me. 

I struggled to find a girlfriend, but broke up with her after only a month because we just didn't have anything in common.  I don't know how to go about finding another girlfriend, one that I share interests with.  I see girls at school and randomly in life and I can't say anything to them.  I mean, why would they want me?  Women haven't expressed interest in me before, why say yes to me when they'll probably have another guy hit on them that day.  

I have very little money, all the things I enjoy require cash.  Work sucks.  School sucks this semester.  I'll graduate soon but then what?  I'm thrown into the work world.  I can't stay on my parent's health insurance plan.  I won't be able to meet women through school (not that it happened anyways...).  I'll suddenly be working 40 hours a week at some job with a bunch of other dudes probably.  Or maybe I'll be a loner long haul trucker or something. 

I don't enjoy life at all.  I can easily sleep 10-12 hours at a time but with work and school I can only get 7 most nights, 8 if I'm lucky.  I can't drown my sorrow in booze, it makes me feel like absolute shit and I want to puke after 2 drinks.  

Life sucks, I have to go through it alone and stone cold sober.  Why even do it?  A girlfriend/wife, a happy family, a job I enjoy aren't even guaranteed.  There isn't even the good chance of this life turning out well.
