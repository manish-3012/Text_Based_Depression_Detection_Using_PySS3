What's the point of all this anymore?I know there are many people with much more severe issues, but I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like the quality of day to day life is dwindling right in front of me. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to be alive. I don't see anything in myself that's worth anything.

The first thing I wish I could change is my relationship with my mom. I can't speak to her with normal conversation (Nor can I recall the last time I have).

I have a few good friends, and we often associate but it would be strange to me to go to them for any problems. There is one girl I know that's always been there but we haven't spoke in months. My other "friends" I talk to never make an effort to think about or include me with anything.

I've been becoming more and more of a loser to myself. I don't leave my room, becoming messier, I'm unemployed, I don't even sleep anymore because I stay up with thoughts racing through my mind.

The list of negative continues. I have no diagnosed problems/illnesses. The word worthless describes it quite well actually.
