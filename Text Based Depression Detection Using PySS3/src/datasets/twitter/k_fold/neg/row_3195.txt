I see no point in livingI donâ€™t feel loved by anybody. At this point everyone i was supposed to be able to trust have just hurt me and left me behind. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. Tired of waking up everyday just to deal with the same things. I have complex ptsd anorexia borderline personality disorder social anxiety and major depression. I see no reason way things could get better for me. I think I might just kill myself tonight. Iâ€™ve tried it so many times that I think I finally can get myself to do it for real.
