I just can't do it anymoreMy mother was never a parent to me, I saw years of abuse, neglect, and resentment. I watched her get raped when I was 9, at 10 I watched her snort a bunch of coke then try to kill herself. I've been raped and beated. I see it happening infront of my eyes and I can't keep the visions away. I can hear my mom screaming, it rings constantly in my ears. I just can't do it anymore. I'm done .
