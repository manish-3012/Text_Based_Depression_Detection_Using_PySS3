My suicide attempt failed.Last time I wrote a post thinking it would be my last. 

I swallowed a whole bottle of pills and all that happened was me vomiting and blacking out for a couple hours.

I generally feel too weak to try again right now. In a few days, I will. 

The funny thing is that I'm a failure at everything, even my own demise.
