Do any of you hate yourselves?I need to know if anyone has been able to overcome a similar issue. Sorry if this is a long boring story that you donâ€™t care to read. I just need help. 

I meet these people. And theyâ€™re wonderful people, a real breath of fresh air compared to some fucking awful figures Iâ€™ve met. I love them. 

And I have so many casual friends. Way more guys that are â€œintoâ€ me than I ever expected. I even have a few fwb type relationships. 

But I donâ€™t actually date anyone. I canâ€™t see myself dating anyone any time soon, if at all. Because I guess I donâ€™t want to subject someone else to me. 

My mom is already doomed to be near me. My friends arenâ€™t close enough to hate me. I canâ€™t stand the thought of dragging someone down with me.

Iâ€™ve been with older men. Bad, bad relationships from a detached perspective. If I saw a girl my age with a guy the age of some of them, Itâ€™d be clearly wrong. But itâ€™s okay if I do it. I deserve it. I know who Iâ€™m dealing with. They might be predators but Iâ€™m not really prey so itâ€™s okay. 

I donâ€™t want to date anyone. No one should go through that. But I so badly want to be intimate with someone, emotionally. I want someone to genuinely talk to. And to be with physically too instead of bouncing.

Thereâ€™s a lot more I want to say. But itâ€™s just ranting so hereâ€™s the question: does anyone else fucking hate themselves? Have any of you been through it, and gotten your shit together, and learned to fucking love yourself? How? 

To clarify: I know how to make myself likable. At least, I like to think Iâ€™m likable on a surface level. I pride myself on it. But how do I make myself lovable?



Okay, Iâ€™m going to keep ranting now. Sorry if you donâ€™t care about the rest, I get it. Lol. 

I want to go to a nice school. Columbia, for my law degree. Iâ€™m not special though, at all. I made straight As before my most recent hit of super bad feels, and I have college credits as a high schooler. I have a lot of art experience and I skate. Those are my only talents. 

Iâ€™m plain, poor, and unambitious. 

Iâ€™d give anything to be obsessive over my goals. I just wish I had any motivation. Iâ€™m never going to be one of the greats. Because they were able to just. Fucking. Do. It. 

I am the loser. I am the one that will live and ultimately pointless existence. I can hardly wake up in the morning. Why would I ever be successful enough to live a dream lifestyle everyone wants me to live? Itâ€™s such a waste. 

My mom told me about the spoons thing, where your ability to exist or be productive or whatever is measured in spoons. Everyone has a different number of spoons. 

I always seem to start with half a spoon. I just canâ€™t fucking do it. I canâ€™t make myself clean, I canâ€™t make myself do homework, I canâ€™t make myself wake the fuck up. Iâ€™m so god damn sick of it. I just want to stop. It would be so nice to just not care anymore and make it fucking end. I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t either get over it or kill myself. 

Iâ€™m so selfish. Iâ€™m sorry. Thanks, if you decided to answer. I really hope none of you are here for the same reason as me. Iâ€™m so sorry
