Sometimes i wish,i could just walk into a hospital and tell them to donate my organs to those in need. Then i would be useful to atleast someoneI am tired of everything.  I'm always thinking about cutting and suicide or alcohol drugs, overdoses whatever just everything bad I could do to myself.
I dont think the world is my place. I've never been able to fit in my entire life. And I have never found someone whom i could relate or connect with. I feel like a weakling among all these people. I dont wanna be here. 

I have suicidal tendencies almost thrice a day and i can't make it stop. I don't know how long i could control the urge to kill myself. I couldn't ever do it because it would ruin my family but no matter how hard I try to avoid the thoughts they persist very often.

The worst is that i have wild thoughts like pull out that extra thin bone on wrist, blindfall from bed in such a way that the back of my head will hit the floor and die, dig a hole in the ground and lie in there so no one has to deal with my corpse. I dont know what to do and what had lead to this.
I am just truly worried about the one who finds my deadbody. I dont want to traumatize anyone. The only thing i ever want is just going to sleep and never waking up. I cant let out my feelings. I seriously want to cry everything out loud but i cant.. i just cant ..i feel hollow inside. I cant feel myself crying like just numb only tears falling down.not even shaking

 Somehow no one is able to notice anything wrong..its my fault i chose to hide it. But i dont want it. I dont even have the energy to explain what's wrong anymore.

I wish i had a reason tell someone why i feel this way.
