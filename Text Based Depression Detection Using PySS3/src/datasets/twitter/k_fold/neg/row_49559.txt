If I made people who cared for me hate me, why shouldn't I kill myself??I had several really good friends that I was close with. When I started to become depressed, they were really supportive and caring to me and prayed for me. But I had become a toxic mood-killer that unintentionally guilt-tripped and hurt those friends and they eventually left me. One made a [blog post](https://imgur.com/a/hPs2J) about how it was an accomplishment to get rid of me, and another one told me [this](https://imgur.com/a/sWujw). At this point, it just *makes sense* to me to commit suicide. Why should anyone who hurt and drove away caring and loving people keep on living? What value is there in that kind of life? I've went to college and made lots of cool friends, but it doesn't change the fact that I hurt my past friends and made them leave me, so it just makes sense to die.
