I don't get it.June 11th this year. I tried to kill myself. I took about 13 40mg pills of Prozac. About 2 hours later I took 20 20mg pills of it. This sum is about 920mg, iirc.

I'd read online it can kill as low as 500mg. 

I don't get it. It didn't work, like, at all. My pulse was completely normal. The hospital monitored me and I stayed normal.

I don't get what went wrong.
Was it that I had built a tolerance to Prozac since I'd been on it since January, at gradually increasing dosages? Was it that carbonated waters -- what I took them all with -- somehow screw things up? Is it that I didn't sleep after taking them (did I have to sleep in order for it to work -- I wasn't tired).

After about 4 hours from taking the first set, I read online something that said a dose of about 200 wouldn't kill but would cause severe liver damage. I became scared that my dose might not work and that I might just get bad liver damage, which I don't want. That's why I told people who phoned an ambulance for me. But, that was 4 hours later. I only did that because I thought it wouldn't kill me.

I don't get it... Why didn't it work? What did I do wrong? Which of these conditions made it fail?

I didn't get help because I wanted to keep living -- I got help because I eventually didn't think I'd die and would prefer living without kidney damage than living with kidney damage. 
But, I could have I'm convinced now -- after further research -- that I could have died theoretically. So... why didn't I?
I don't get it.
I'm curious.
