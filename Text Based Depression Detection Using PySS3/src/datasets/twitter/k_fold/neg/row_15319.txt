I don't want to traumatize any oneRight now tthe thing keeping me going is the idea that whoever finds my body is likely going to be traumatized by it. I wish I could guarantee that whoever does is somebody who has signed up for such. 

I want a clinic I can just walk into, say "I'm done trying", and be taken to a room and get a guaranteed effective means without worry about how it'll affect whoever finds me.
