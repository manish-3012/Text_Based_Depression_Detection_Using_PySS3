i donâ€™t know how much longer iâ€™ll lastAt the end of 2018/start of 2019 i started getting suicidal thoughts and began cutting myself (but not very frequently) but in these past few weeks to a month, everythingâ€™s picked up and i just feel like my minds in a haze and i just feel so fucking empty. i wake up with no motivation to do anything, i go to school and do everything i can to make my friends laugh and to make sure none of them think anythingâ€™s wrong with me. i keep telling myself i canâ€™t kill myself because of all the people that care about but the more i think about it, the lest i believe that people actually care. with my friends, iâ€™m always checking up on them and seeing if theyâ€™re doing okay, but i never get the same in return, they just always tell me how some days i look dead/sad/tired but they never ask me if anythingâ€™s going on. my mom has literally seen my fucking leg covered in scars and never talked me about or said anything. the only person thatâ€™s ever told me they love me is my Dad, and i donâ€™t even live with him. iâ€™m only 14 and thereâ€™s so much i want to do but i really donâ€™t think i can go on much longer in this life, iâ€™ve just been trying to build the courage and find the right ways to do end it. thanks for listening to my rant
