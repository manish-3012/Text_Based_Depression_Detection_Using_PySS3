I really can't stand stand the idea of my corpse rotting my body being examined at the morgue or shit like thatLike yeah ill be dead and i won't even be aware but seriously what the actual fuck lmao and the worst is how my family will be left with pain i read somewhere that people who lose loved ones through suicide experience grief much more differently than others. And aaaa all of this makes me want to curl up and cry. But despite all of this here i am wanting to die and setting up dates :/
