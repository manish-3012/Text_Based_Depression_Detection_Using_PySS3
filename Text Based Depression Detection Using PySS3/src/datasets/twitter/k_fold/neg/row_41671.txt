FailureMy student loans are due and they're more than what I make in a month at my shitty part-time job. I can't afford health insurance or the medical procedures I've been putting off. I can't afford to take care of myself (rent/food/utilities) and I'm relying almost completely on financial help from a man who's cheated on me repeatedly, but wants me in his life (for now) and demands that I be happy. I'm not interested in living my life anymore and I just want to stop.
