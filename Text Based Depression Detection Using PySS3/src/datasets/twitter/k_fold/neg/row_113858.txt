I constantly insult my mom and degrade other people defensively. I don't know I can live with myself anymore.I don't feel up to typing the full story, but long story short I called my mom ugly and fat and it's not the first time I've done this. I'm mean to other people when I feel like they're attacking me and I feel awful after I do so but I don't stop. I would be doing the world a favor by offing myself.
