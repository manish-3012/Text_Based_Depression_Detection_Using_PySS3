He can't get over his ex, and I can't get over him.OK, so I'm at a point where I think I can talk about this. I feel fucking stupid for getting this worked up over someone I barely know.

&amp;nbsp;

Love interest and I met on Tinder and started talking. We originally planned to just hook up, do the dirty, and maybe hang out a bit. No relationships, no strings attached, nothing. He wasn't the committing type at this point in his life, and since he travels a lot there wasn't much point to being in a relationship. I was game for this, as I've already hooked up with a few people on Tinder for casual one night stands. 


We started messaging back and forth for about meeting up, getting to know a bit about each other, etc. He was really interesting. I started getting excited to see that he had texted me, and I loved the sound of his voice. He had a bit of a Scottish/British accent- sounded exotic and kind. I really liked the photos he had on his profile that his friend had put up for him. I thought to myself that this was going to go really well.


So we set up a date to meet at the pub. When he arrived he wasn't really what I expected, but hey- Tinder right? We got to talking and having a few drinks together. He wasn't initially as attractive as I thought he was (he had grown some facial hair since the photos), and he was a bit outgoing for my tastes, but we were getting along. He'd put his hands on mine, touch my face, nuzzle me- he was very affectionate, and even though it was a bit awkward at first, after a few drinks I came to like it.


We got back to my place, had sex, etc. I thought he'd just get up and leave, but he ended up staying the night.

&amp;nbsp;

The more I talked to him, the more I liked him. We'd goof around a lot. He made me laugh until I cried. He's one of the funniest, most charismatic guys I'd ever met. Everything he had to say was interesting. He was so fascinating, everything about him. The places he'd been, the things he'd done, his views on life.


He treated me really well. Always thinking about my needs first. Making me laugh. Gently holding me. Always touching me, stroking me, cuddling me. Said I was a weird girl, but one of the most adorable, cute girls he'd ever known. I was gorgeous. He told me he didn't like it when I put myself down, and that I needed to stop worrying about him so much and stop apologizing all the time.


He made me really happy. In the moment, I had a handsome guy I was attracted to inside and out that wanted to cuddle me. Always. He'd come with me wherever I went, talk to me. Made me feel loved, wanted, needed. Held my hand, stroked my face, gave me kisses, and refused to let go. It made me feel...content. I didn't have to dress up and put on makeup to impress him. I didn't have to do a single thing except being myself. He could see me for who I truly was. Everything about me, inside. My personality got a chance to shine- and he was very happy with my body as well.

&amp;nbsp;

We were cuddling, and I nearly slipped and said "I love you". It's a habit, you know? When you're with a boyfriend, snuggling, absent mindedly cooing at one another- you say "I love you" in a contented sigh. I stopped myself- since, well, we had just met. And "I love you" isn't really something you say. He said he already knew what I was going to say and didn't think I was crazy- and that this wasn't the first time something like that happened. I apologized, and he said "I can't be IN love with you, not yet- but I love you too as a person. I like you a lot, you're great". 
And when he said that, it made my heart skip a little. I hated it. I started crying and I told him that I knew this was going to end badly. I told him about my Borderline Personality Disorder, and how I ultimately fear abandonment and I get attached very deeply, very quickly. I also mentioned that I wanted to let these feelings of "love" that I was developing all too soon- to die. He told me that those feelings weren't a bad thing, and that if I wanted to feel them- to feel them. That he didn't mind, as long as I understood that he couldn't commit at this time in his life because of his traveling and for other reasons, and that he didn't feel the same way- not yet.


I don't know if I was desperate, ignorant, excited- or what. But I accepted. I was just happy to hear him say "I love you" back to me, even if it's meaning didn't hold all the same weight. He promised that he would never hurt me. That he loved me as a human being, as a person- and even if we couldn't be together in the sense of lovers, that he wanted to be a part of my life. That he wanted to be my friend and to be gentle to me since I was a wonderful person. I felt in my heart of hearts, he meant it. Sure, anyone has the ability to lie but....I truly felt that he meant it. He did, and still does.


As the days went on, we spent more time together. Staying one night with one another turning into two. Three. Four. I was happy just to be in the same room with him. We never ran out of things to talk to. He never left my side. I felt so tranquil, so at peace with my life. He grew more and more attractive in my eyes, in every which way. Even though I hadn't known him for long, he felt like a best friend. Someone I had known all my life. Everything about him just had such an unidentifiable, familiar quality.


We went to pubs together, went out to eat, went for walks, went to many events at an art festival here in town. It was all so good. I hadn't been this content for many years.


Despite the fact that his allergies started acting up and I contracted a staph infection from my parents (the community they live in out of town is rampant with MRSA), we still texted often while he was at his hosts house for a few days, tying up loose ends and figuring out how to travel out east at the end of the week like he had planned.

&amp;nbsp;

We decided to spend one last night together before he left.


Then his ex texted him out of nowhere.


This sent me into a blind panic. He told me that they were together for several years, but broke up 3 separate times. That she was emotionally unstable and had blackmailed and manipulated him into staying with her by attempting and threatening suicide. That she stopped loving him once she started on antidepressants. And that despite all of this, he never thought ill of her. He loved her more than anything, always, unconditionally.


He told me every time that they had gotten back in touch, they always ended up back together.


So now I'm freaking the fuck out. I had a chance when she wasn't in the picture, but now?


So here I was, sick, in a rage of tears, completely shattered because I felt robbed of my chance before I even began to try.


He told me that it was also a reason why he couldn't commit. That he still loved his ex and probably always would. She was the closest person to him in his whole entire life- closer than any family. And that even though they weren't together and he knew she'd never be with him again, or that they couldn't (and shouldn't) get back together for both of their sake, that he was still hopelessly in love and that she was deserving of his unconditional love.


Well then.


I told him not to touch me anymore. The more he touched me, the more he tried to comfort me, the harder I was falling. I wanted those feelings I had for him to desperately die. I didn't want to feel anything anymore. This was all wrong. It was all wrong and I didn't want to fall into this trap. Not again.


He told me he didn't know if he could ever commit to a relationship, even in the future. Not to me, not to anyone- because he firmly believed that he was still in love with his ex and wasn't sure if he'd ever get over her. I understood. We all have a family member, friend, lover that we have falling outs with, fights with- and we never really forget them, and even years later we have feelings still.


He's only 22. He's younger than me by a few years. He may not be as wise as I mark him up to be. He likes to think rationally, not emotionally- and knows that he can't get back together with her, but still. There's a lot of emotion, a lot of tension, and I feel like I'm living in the shadow of his ex.


Love interest said he cared for me. A lot. And that if he was over his ex, he'd be with me in a heart beat. He cares for me a great deal, and that all of this situation was causing him pain too. That he wanted to just be friends, but he couldn't promise me that we'd ever be together, because he just didn't know if he could get over it. This hurt me, but what else could I do? I wanted to cut him out of my life completely, but that might not have been the answer. It's still partially what I want, since every time I think of him my heart hurts.


But I think he has a lot of growing up to do.

&amp;nbsp;


He's left East by train now. He offered to take me with him on his travels- that I could come with him any time. I wanted to. I really, wanted to. I can't.


He said he's probably not good for me. He doesn't ever make long term plans or schedules. He hitchhikes, couch surfs. He drinks a lot and he loves dangerous situations with lots of socializing and strangers. One of his favorite things is to go into a super crowded pub- shoulder to shoulder with the locals, to chat up strangers and make new contacts.


Those sorts of things are my worst nightmare.


Now, when I'm looking back on what we had from a rational standpoint- I probably am not "in love" with him. I was probably desperate and needy for human connection. For someone to want me, and be tender with me, and make me feel special and needed.


He wasn't *that* incredibly handsome. He was very cute though. He wasn't that good in bed or even that well endowed- average at best, and that's being generous- but he always took my needs into consideration first.
He's a very heavy drinker- heavy partier. He doesn't care about consequences and lives life recklessly. I can't do this, nor could I ever.
He thrives in danger and the unknown. Never plans, never cares. Takes life one day at a time. Survives, gets by. I can't do this either, nor could I ever.
Although there are parts of our personalities that overlap- and that a lot of our goals and views on the world are the same, we are both very different people- and that has left me feeling alienated and abandoned more times that I want to admit, even during the short time that I was with him.


More or less I am aware that I was craving love. Human affection. Gentleness. Tenderness. I have been alone for over a year without these things. I am a daydreamer, a hopeless romantic. Needy. Clingy. Wanting and passionate. Intense.
And when something like this was dropped in my lap? I gave in to it, even though I knew that it was a horrible idea that would only end in pain. I was so desperate, so anxious for the chance- no matter how dismal the odds, that I could have that happiness again.


What I had towards him was...probably infatuation. I liked him and the idea of him and what he represented. My want and need for adventure. For breaking the chains that bind me here and traveling the world. Seeing sights, experiencing all that life has to offer. That he and saw ME for ME- looks were completely inconsequential. He saw my soul.
He was what I needed, when I didn't even need it. He was the treasure I wasn't looking to find, and I turned a blind eye to so many of the cons, blissfully drinking in the ignorance of the moment because I felt high off the situation.


In no way has he lied to me or intentionally hurt me. It's circumstance, for once. Not him as a person- or me as a person.


I'm fighting between killing the feelings I have for him, or trying to keep them alive on the slightest, tiniest chance that years from now, we might be able to try again. In the meantime, it'd hurt constantly knowing that he's talking to his ex. Thinking about his ex. That any "love" for me is a very distant afterthought since he's still obsessed. I can't live with that. Even as "just friends".


I've distanced myself from him for the time being. I need time to grieve, to heal.


I still don't entirely know what to make of it or how to feel. I'm angry. Betrayed? Heartbroken. Frustrated. I'm so many things all at once.


Since writing this, I've given him a final phone call, summed up what I mentioned in this post, and told him that I cannot even stay friends because it is too damaging to me right now. It hurts, so much. So fucking much. But I think it's for the best...

&amp;nbsp;

**TLDR;** BPD has me all sorts of attached to a guy I barely knew. Scared of what's next. Scared of myself and my self harming tendencies and suicidal thoughts over what happened.
