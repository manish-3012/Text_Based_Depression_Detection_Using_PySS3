I'm not as important/ urgent as other people so skip over me to help others.I can tell you that I don't have a plan, and I'm currently not contemplating suicide. I'm still young so I know I have a lot to live and look forward to. I was accepted to a top, dream university that is in the ideal city and environment for me. However, my grades are in the real shitter because I'm largely unmotivated by anything. The guidance department of the school thinks I'm pretty much depressed and has asked me if I have a plan etc. I sought a tutor in a hard math class so that could do it for that class but last quarter it was across the board. I'm really concerned that they could take back their admission offer, which at that point I has only one plan. I don't want to go to a Community College, I don't want to be unsuccessful. One of my parents is dead and the other one is dead to me. We have terrible relations that I don't want to amend. I am talking to a school specialist and a therapist separately twice a week. I don't know.
