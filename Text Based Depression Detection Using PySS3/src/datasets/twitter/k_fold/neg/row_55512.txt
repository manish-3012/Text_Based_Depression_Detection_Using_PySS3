I feel like the trigger on my shotgun is like the old 'restart' button on my NESI'm depressed, and suicidal, but not on the brink. Today.

But I've often thought of the games I used to play, when I got stuck, or lost, or so far behind it didn't make sense to continue.

And I'd reach over to that grey and black box and press 'reset'.

And it would start over.

Part of me has come to believe that is what would happen if I put a gun in my face. It would 'reset'. That maybe things would go better next time. 

I've thought about it for awhile, and the more I do....the less and less it sounds crazy.

Maybe....if I just press the 'button' I get another try at life?
