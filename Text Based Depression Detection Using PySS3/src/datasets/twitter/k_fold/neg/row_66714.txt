I don't even know what to doBeen in severe clinical depression for 4 years. Doctors think I am bipolar too.  Early signs of it, since i just hit 20. Saw my cousin commit suicide in front of me, she died in front of me, so I have PTSD as well. Been thinking about suicide for a while, coming up with how to do it and a suicide note for the future. Don't want to do it though. Have my mom and younger brother to think about. But I feel like such a failure. So much unrealized potential. Feel empty. Feel almost nothing, going through the motions. Been dabbling in substances and sex to help me feel, but that makes me worse, with the guilt and all. Honestly it seems like a matter of time. Feel like I don't have any genuine human connection. Feel nothing for most people, but pretend. Sure most people are the same with me.  Feel like nobody likes me, and most of the time I don't like people either. Its all so fake.  Not much would change if I did it, yet I can't let mom down further.  Feel so unfulfilled. Idk even why I am posting this 6:10 in the morning, or what I hope to get out of this.
