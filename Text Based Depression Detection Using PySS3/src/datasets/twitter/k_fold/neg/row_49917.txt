Iâ€™m not really religious but why would you go to hell if you commit suicide like that seems unfairI always hear god has a plan and he knows how everything will go and that he is the reason everyone is born. Then by that logic I was born only to lead a life of emptiness and mental illness which will makes me want to end it and thatâ€™s his plan for me yet Iâ€™ll still get punished for it??? So why is that unforgivable
