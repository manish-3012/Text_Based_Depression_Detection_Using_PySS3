i cant fucking do this anymoremy momkeep s tryinng to help me and i don't know how to handle it. shes being nice and all but I'm too scared to look her in the eye and then she gets offended and mad and i keep saying stuff that i don't mean as mean or rude or bitchy but she keeps calling me bitchy and mean i know shes trying to help me but she cant handle me. she keeps acting like she knows everything about me but she knows fucking nothing. she doesn't know about my attacks where i hit myself and pull on my hair or how when i tell her that i hate her when shes drunk i mean it. she just offered for me to put my pajamas on and go to bed but i didn't look her in the eye for a bit and i answered quietly and after she said the first part of a sentence then was thinking and then went to her room i don't know ifi hurt her but it feels like i cant do anything fucking right. she keeps trying to help me but she keeps making things worse. she acts like shes fucking mother teresa and is a great person but shes not. she keeps doing all of these things that hurt me and i tell her they hurt me and she ignores it. she always ignores when i say that hurts she always brushes it off as a joke when i tell her i hate it when shes drunk and high and always talks about how "this would be in the show" god she keeps talking about the show. she keeps talking about how were just like this old show called Absolutely fabulous and how were just like the mother and daughter in it but she doesn't realize how fucked up that is. that its fucked up how she keeps talking about how she would be the alcoholic mother who cant go more then five seconds without fucking wine and i the child would be the actual responsible person. I'm so tired of fucking mothering her i don't want to live anymore. she just told me to look up what a life coach is to see if i would want it
