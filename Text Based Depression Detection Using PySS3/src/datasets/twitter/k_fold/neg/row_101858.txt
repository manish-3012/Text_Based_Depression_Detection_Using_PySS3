Life is black comedy.[warning: very nihilistic]

There is no real empathy and love is a tired whore. 
I feel disgust towards my own being. 

No one cares about anyone. Everyone always places themselves first. Everyone borns together and dies alone. It's very cruel that we have to watch our own life-giver die. 

I think life is black comedy. Every time something stabilizes is when a rugpull is about to happen. It gets ready for war, while we're at peace with it. Life shows no mercy. No one ever "gives up" yet everyone always loses. Staying alive forever is an even worse scenario. We just can't win. 

There is no meaning to our suffering or to anything. No one ever witnessed any real proof that we're meant to be everything or nothing at all. Life is not real, is just a theory created by ourselves to pretend that we're somewhere while we are nowhere to be found. It's science fiction. No one likes life. It's just a terrifying downward spiral for everyone.

Suicide is an escape and a shortcut to the background world beyond the forth wall. We can choose to die and end this right here and now.
So why would we keep on living?

Me, I'm not. I know I'm not. No way I am. Fuck this.
