Iâ€™m 22, 23 this weekend, I started wanting to kill myself when I was 14.Itâ€™s been 9 years that I canâ€™t really remember, Iâ€™m slowly disappearing and no ones noticing. Iâ€™m settling into the idea of taking my own life. I want to write a will because Iâ€™ve collected a lot of nice things Iâ€™d want my siblings to have, Iâ€™ve deleted all social media and not on purpose but Iâ€™ve lost a lot of friends. 
Living is sad for me, dying is peace.
