How do I deal with these crippling feelings of inadequacy? Since my wife left me, taking our 2 girls with, I have been holding together pretty well. I got my money together and retained a lawyer who is right now setting up paternity tests and a temporary custody agreement.

The problem I'm having is that I am constantly undermining myself. When I got to work, I subconsciously think 'I wonder if they'll decide to fire me today,' even though I know that I'm a good worker and they need me desperately. 

When I go home, it's very hard for me to check the mail box even though I have the money to pay bills... It's like I'm 'trying' to miss payments on purpose.

Even the hobbies I enjoy are becoming more like escapes than past times. Logically, I'm 'good' at my life, I'm capable and taking care of issues and doing good work. But emotionally, I feel like I'm wasting my time by even trying. What can I do?
