I feel kinda silly posting here at the moment.I wrote [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfharm/comments/3bx4wn/really_struggling_to_cope_now/) in the self harm subreddit and one of the places they suggested first was here.

I don't feel that I am about to commit suicide right now. It's just suddenly not as concrete that I never will. I'm starting therapy, so there has been a lot of times already that I have been asked what's keeping me here, and it's getting harder each time I think of this to answer it, but I'm trying.  I'm just feeling extremely hopeless right now and it doesn't feel like things are going to be any different for a long time. If at all. I don't know what to do.
