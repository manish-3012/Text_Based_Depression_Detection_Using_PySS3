I want to die quickly with as little pain as possibleDon't try and tell me reasons not to and stuff, I have thought about all of that a lot. 

I want to die, I've wanted to for a long time, and I'm sure if I live I will continue to want to. I don't want it to be slow and painful, I'm just bad at dealing with pain. For the last year or so I've thought of jumping in front of a train (I know how selfish it is but I honestly don't know what else I could do at this point) but I don't know if it would kill me, 65mph is average train speed and there's a large chance I wouldn't die on impact, or at all. What else can I do that will be relatively painless and very very quick? I cannot access firearms.
