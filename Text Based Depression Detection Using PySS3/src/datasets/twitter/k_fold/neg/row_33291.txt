I pushed my ex to admit that he was suicidal, I didn't react, he broke up with me few days laterMy ex and I were in a loving relationship. He has sever (high-functioning) depression and anhedonia. I had asked him in the beginning of our relationship if he was suicidal and he said no and never was (his brother committed suicide). As our relationship progressed I noticed his symptoms more and more, but he would shrug it off, sometimes he would admit to it being due to his depression. He refused opening up about it, but I would push him because I couldn't understand what was going on (I did some research since). He refused getting help. He was seemingly normal and people just perceived him as just being quiet and reserved. I knew there was a lot more there. He told me many times not to push him, but I felt like at times I was an outsider in my relationship. A month ago I pushed him and he told me that he fought suicidal thoughts everyday. I didn't know how to react. This is the person I envisioned my life with. I also felt upset because I was reassured 3 years prior that he never struggled with these thoughts.  So I told him that. And he snapped back that it wasn't true. I moved on from it as if it didn't happen, he's not comfortable talking about these things so I dropped it. He broke up with me 3 days later which seemed out of the blue. Told me it was because of his mental health. I sent him text messages to show support, tell him what I learned about depression, but he told me to stop. A week ago it dawned on me what I had done and I've been overwhelmed with guilt and remorse. I know it was this. People say that I am being hard on myself, that its not a big deal but I know it's this. I feel the urge to apologize and owning up to my mistakes. He doesn't have anyone in his life, Im the only person he ever loved.
