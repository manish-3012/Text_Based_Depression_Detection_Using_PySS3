Iâ€™m ending it this weekendNo matter how hard I try, I can never adjust to adulthood. I miss Mrs.Sonju and Mrs.Zachman as teachers from middle school. I miss all my friends. Before I leave this planet Iâ€™m going to visit them and be on my way. 

Our mental health system is just bad, people kicked you down when you show a moment of weakness and so much more but Iâ€™m going to be taking my leave. I didnâ€™t ask to be born in this cruel cold and harsh world that we have created ourselves. If we take what the planet provides weâ€™ll be locked away. You have to work your ass off just to afford the basic human necessities like food clothing and shelter. Itâ€™s basically sweatshop labor in this country. 

A human male like myself who is introverted,quiet and shy will never fit in this kind of society. 

Iâ€™m pretty much done. Iâ€™ll finish this work week and be on my way.
