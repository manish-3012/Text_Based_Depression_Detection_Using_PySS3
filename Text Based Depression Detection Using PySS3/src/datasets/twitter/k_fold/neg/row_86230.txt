I tried making a post for friends but got harassed a lot because of my disorderIt is a personality disorder (DID). I got called disgusting for having a child alter. Told that Iâ€™m lying and making it up. Iâ€™m crying and I just hate myself so much. Iâ€™ve spent most of my life dealing with this *diagnosed* disorder. Got called childish, disgusting. A random girl harassed me in PM. Others trying to â€œcureâ€ me I just donâ€™t understand. 

Iâ€™ve spent my whole life feeling like a freak for having a child alter. I just wanted to be honest about my disorder about front with new friends. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d get harassed this much. I really hate myself and feel like a freak.
