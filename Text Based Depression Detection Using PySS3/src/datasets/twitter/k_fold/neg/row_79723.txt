Do you think anyone would not be able to recover if i left?Hear me out. I know if I left it would be a bit selfish. And people would be hurt. But they'd get over it right? And they'd move on with their lives? And lead fulfilling lives independent and free of my one decision? Because that bit of selfishness is winning the battle at the moment.
