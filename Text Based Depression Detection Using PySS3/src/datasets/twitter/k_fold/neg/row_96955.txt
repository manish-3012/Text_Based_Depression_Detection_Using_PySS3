I can't be alone for more than 2 minutes without thinking about itIf you're reading this is id like to thank you for trying to help others. Anyways on to what the title says I can't be left alone with just my thought's for more than 2 munites before I consider doing "it" I find myself playing video games or watching youtube videos just for the sake of it and not because I enjoy them but so I don't have to be alone with just me.  Sure I get a laugh out of jokes at work and whilst playing with my friends but I still find myself at times pondering why not? Would anyone truly miss me? Is this normal/common? I would atleast like a second opinion and it's not like I'm on the edge of doing "it" but these thought get stronger and stronger every time.PS I'm 17 years old I work at a grocery store and I'm in school for carpeting if this helps in any way.
