Crisis Chat Lines...I've opened and closed the pages for multiple chat lines tonight but can't decide if I want to talk to anyone or just forget it altogether.


I would rather go the more anonymous route if I talk to anyone as phone lines can be traced. If you call 911 and hang up a police officer shows at your door rather quickly.

Telling someone that Im  -removed plan/method- to them taken away and an unpleasant sort of help.



**Edited to remove method, posting here at least confirmed it's the way to go and that I'm truly alone**
