done with everything, gonna kms soonbeen starving myself for a couple days now, havent eaten anything of substance for four. grades have been absolutely plummeting. graduation is on the line. have no clue what's going on. ever. can't focus on anything. no motivation to leave my room. ever. dad stopped talking to me. hasn't said a single word for four days. can't even imagine telling my therapist about this. too far past the point of bitching at people about how much i wanna die. it's the perfect setup now; family isolation, further isolation from the ones i love and complete ambivalence towards suicide. if not now, then when? fucking when? i don't tell people things, so my therapy won't help. outpatient would never help either for the same reasons. i have nothing, i'm done with everything.
