That's it.That's it. I cannot help myself. I just realized that I do not have friends. And I'm in depression. Nevertheless gf left me 6 months ago. I'm alone and I cannot stand up on my feet. I just want to sink. I don't know how to swim. It's probably fastest and easiest way to do that. I will took my last walk with depressed songs in the evening. I just want to thank you all who helped me in other posts. I managed to live to this day. Thank you! And good bye my friends I guess ?
