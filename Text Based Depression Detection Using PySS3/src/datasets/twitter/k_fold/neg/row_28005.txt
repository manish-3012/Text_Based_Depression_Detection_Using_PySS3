I hate myself. If I could leave without hurting anybody, I would.I have just had enough. I don't think I am going to even try to kill myself, though, because of the pain it will cause others. Which leads me on to why I hate myself. A few of my 'friends' (I don't know if I have any real friends, if i did would I be telling them this instead of you?) Have trouble with depression and have attempted suicise or cut themselves, and I am always there to help them and to say please don't... I hate myself because I feel that is all now a lie, because I want to as well. I had to say this, thanks for those who read it. Any insight is very welcome.
