Does it ever get any easier?I'm 19.  I'm a college student and I'm really sad and tired of it all. My firends are assholes and don't care about anyone at all. My dream in life is to find someone who will honestly like me someone I can do goofy romantic things, and someone I can care about. I'm fucking ugly, short and thin. I'm never a girls first choice. The rare time women come to me is because they want a crutch. Someone who will say no you're not a bitch, or your pretty or whatever. But they never have liked me for me and end up hurting me. I want to do this whole school thing but I'm just not motivated showing up is hard let alone studying. I want to get a degree in CS but I can hardly get out of bed. My five year long depression is getting worse and after counseling, pills, pretending I'm happy in public. Life has never gotten easier. and I'm ready just to end it. I have one alive family member and a mother who after letting my stepfather abuse me attempted to make the cops believe I hit her (thank god they saw through that shit) I have a shit ton of debt all ready. So I'm fucking done. I just don't see life getting better from here. There isn't a woman out there for me, and nothing really else.
