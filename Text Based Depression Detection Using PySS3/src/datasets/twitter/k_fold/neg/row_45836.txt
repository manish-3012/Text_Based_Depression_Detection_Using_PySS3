Need a friend .Recently my life has gone down the drain. It was a slow decline but now i feel at my lowest. It has been a steady fall into madness, after losing my job and my girlfriend, and then my son's mother moving so far away i cannot see him, it makes me want to end my life. Its difficult to want to try or have motivation to better myself when there is no will to continue. I dont need lectures about how others have it worse or i should not end it because people close to me love me, ive heard it all and honestly i just want a hug and for someone to tell me they are here for me, never had that person i could lean on.  I apologize ahead of time for the incoherent rant.. I dont know what to do the feelings are getting to me.. Please contact me on Kik if i do not reply. Thank you in advance .  Kik;alexdabs21

Sincerely,
Alejandro
