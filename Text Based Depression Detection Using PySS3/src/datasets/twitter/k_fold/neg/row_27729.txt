I dont think this place is for meIm 19, almost 20 I have a therapist who i can talk too, a strong family unit and no real major traumas have happened.

I just dont see a point to life at all, I know I have a privledged life but I just dont care if I die I die. I wish I did care and have something inside me telling me its worth living. ive looked online for similar people but icant relate to them for example many people say how they feel worthless i dont  think of myself as worthless but i just dont see a point at all it just seems like so much you have to go through to die anyway. 

Sorry for any grammar or spelling mistakes i just dont know what to do
