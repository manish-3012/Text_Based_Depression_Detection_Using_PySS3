Iâ€™m not seeing any light at the end of this tunnelI feel like I am broken beyond repair. I feel incredibly tired, alone and useless. 

I am stuck with a job I despise in a town I loathe. I have underlying health issues that make matters worse. Most of my friends moved out. The last one will move to another country by fall. My relationship is damaged beyond repair and my SO suggested a break in order to patch things up but I am feeling this is just a way to prolong our suffering. I feel like I am incapable of truly committing to a relationship due to past experience and trauma. I am incredibly furious to the one who brought so much pain into my life that now, more than 5 years later, I still have to pick up the pieces. There is so much more to talk about this but I canâ€™t bring myself to say it out loud. 

I am doing everything in my power to move out but I feel itâ€™s taking too long and I am out of patience. 

I want out now and forever, but I know thatâ€™s not the answer and this is why I am seeking for help here.  Maybe it just gets worse before it gets better. 

I am going to therapy, I am actively looking for new opportunities in a larger city in which I could meet more people like me and meet more often with my friends who live there. I know there is light at the end of the tunnel, I just canâ€™t see it. I wish I could close my eyes tonight and not have to wake up tomorrow. I donâ€™t want to deal with this anymore.
