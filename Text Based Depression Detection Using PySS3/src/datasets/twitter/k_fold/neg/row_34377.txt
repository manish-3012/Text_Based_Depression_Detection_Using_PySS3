this is itim non binary 

I'm sick of dealing with gender dysphoria. 

I have to deal with it every minute of every day.I can't stand my body and it affects everything i do. The body I feel everyday makes me sick. I just want to be able to live without feeling disgusted by my own body. I look in the mirror and see someone else looking back, I speak and hear a voice that doesn't sound like it is supposed to. I get dressed and see a body that looks so wrong. Recently my dysphoria has gotten worse its a constant pain and suicide is my only way out of it. I could wait all the time it would take to transition but it would be  more than just waiting. It would be living with it every day, dealing with it everyday. All that time wasted living in a body I cannot stand. I've made the choice to end it. I've thought about it many times so this is not a choice I've made in one night and I realized this is what I want. There are a lot of things I will miss out on, finishing high school, learning to drive, getting my first job but I'm okay with that. I don't like doing things anyway. 

maybe not tonight.
