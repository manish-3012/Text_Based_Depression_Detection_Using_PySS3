I'm giving upI just found out I'm failing out of college. Before this happened, I took out a loan to pay rent through my university, that now needs to be paid back immediately. I also just got a job as an undergraduate researcher, which I'll also more than likely lose as well. My family didn't even know that I was on academic probation, they've been telling me the whole semester that I've been doing well, that they're so proud, and that I'm going to do so well in life. I can't face them. Beyond them, there's all of my friends in college that don't know, there's my boyfriend and his family. My GPA is too low to be salvaged despite my best efforts. I'm going to be kicked. I know I'm being a coward and that I'm being lazy. I could still try again for readmission, I could try to pay off the loan, I could get a new job, I could tell my family and help them get over the disappointment, but anytime I think of it I just realize it would be easier to kill myself. No shame, no disappointment, no more living, no more troubles, or good times, just nothing. Or eternal torture in hell. It would at least end this hell though.
