The world is already dying. Why should I stick around?The way I see it the world itself is already on an inevitable path to death and destruction. Human beings just aren't good enough to improve and make a good environment for themselves. Plus we hear it all the time: we're seeing a 6th mass extinction which will eventually claim us. Extinction is soon, and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm just not big, strong, or powerful enough to help stop it. For me leaving this world is a way to escape an even shittier future world.
