Your Bucket List (good intentions)So I'm as suicidal as any of you, but I have decided I want to live a little more before I die. That in mind, I'm making a bucket list, which you're welcome to add to or borrow.

-I've already traveled enough (9 non-US countries) to satisfy my "travel bug," so that's not really a big thing--I have also lived outside the US--though if you haven't been outside the US I strongly urge you to do so. Gives you a lot of perspective. 

-(Cage) diving with Great White Sharks off the coast of San Diego/Mexico. The idea of being so close to Jaws used to scare me, but considering what forum this is, vicious, deadly sharks really don't scare me at all anymore. Hell, I'll go diving with Great Whites without a cage if they will allow me. An alternate is swimming with Whale Sharks. Personal preference I suppose.

-Skydiving. Again, I used to fear the idea of falling out of a plane thousands of feet in the air. Now, the idea doesn't seem so scary. 

-Ziplining-I have done this in Costa Rica. It's fun and a great experience to have.

-Running with the Bulls in Spain. I had thought of doing that this past July, but scheduling prevented it. Maybe I will see if there is something like this to do in the US in the near future

-Running for a political office. I wanted to do this, but ended up moving abroad instead. Don't care if I would've won. Still would've been a fun hustle. 

-On a similar note: starting a revolution (or at least protesting). I went to the March for Science in April 2017. It was very interesting to see so many people gathered together NOT for entertainment or the hopes of buying a product, but for their own beliefs. Before I die, I think it would be fun to start my own yellow vest movement here in the US regarding all the tomfoolery in the US government/capitalist society at large. People would call me crazy, but they'd call me crazy anyways for being suicidal.

-Learning a new language (verbal or programming). I know some programming languages and Spanish, so that's checked off the list.

-Working a corporate office job. One of my great regrets. I would've had fun being an office employee and know I could've brought a lot of energy and new, diverse ideas to a big workplace. I would've been the circle in the square hole (probably why I never found my way into a cubical). I'd always relished the challenge of turning a cubicle job into something stimulating and entertaining for myself and potential co-workers. Oh well.

-Eating lots of delicious food. I have eaten reasonably priced, but extremely tasty meals in France, Hong Kong, Japan, and obviously America. I am satisfied here. 

-I did not include any sort of sexual/romantic things on this list, because sex/romance (or the lack of it) is my whole reason for being suicidal in the first place. And I am strongly against the usage of prostitutes. I would literally rather kill myself than have paid sex.

-Hiking to the summit of Mt. Everest. Would be cool (literally), but too damn expensive.

-Having an encounter with Nessie/Bigfoot/aliens. Always loved conspiracy stuff. I don't think these things are necessarily real, but would've loved to have "seen Bigfoot."

-Driving a really nice car. I may consider renting a Lamborghini in Vegas. We'll see.

Remember that if costs are ever an issue-put it on a credit card-you'll never have to pay it off! Anyways, please add to my list or post your own. It can small things too, like having a chat with an old friend you haven't seen in years or resolving an old grudge.
