Why not?I appreciate kind words and reinforcement from people on here, my counselor and other, but nobody has been able to give me a good reason. Your life is yours to do with as you please, right? You can be who you want, go where you want, do what you want, etc. but what if you just donâ€™t want to try anymore? Life can be great, and you should try to make it that way. It can also be awful. There are no guarantees. Maybe one day, I will be happy. Itâ€™s also possible that Iâ€™ll die in the next year or so from nuclear warfare or worse. What we know is what has happened. Iâ€™ve tried really hard. Iâ€™ve surrounded myself with good people, Iâ€™ve seen a counselor, Iâ€™ve done a lot of things I should be proud of, but none of it has made me happy. Iâ€™ve been miserable a long time, staying alive so that I wouldnâ€™t put my loved ones through the grief of my death, but to some extent, you gotta put your needs first in life. I donâ€™t want them to hurt, but I donâ€™t want to hurt anymore either. I donâ€™t believe in an afterlife, so in my head, I just gotta do it, and my troubles are over. That sounds nice. Maybe my family can still find more success at making happiness than I ever could. Anyway, why shouldnâ€™t I? Why isnâ€™t it my right to do with my life as I please, even if that means prematurely terminating it?
