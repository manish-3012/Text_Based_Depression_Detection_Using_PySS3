Getting close to suicide.I'm just gonna keep this short.

I don't even care anymore. I don't care about living, or friends or any of that bullshit, I don't have a real family, that I know at least. People that I used to know made me look at my*self* as some sort of creepy-friendless-stupid motherfucker. I honestly have not many more reasons to live.

I don't have a real job, no friends, and don't know my real family.
I'm so close to suicide.
