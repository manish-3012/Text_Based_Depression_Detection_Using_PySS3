Iâ€™m going insaneI need some help. Some advice. Anything. Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m severely depressed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and have been taking meds for the past month and a half now. They arenâ€™t working. Iâ€™m starting to shut down again for like the 15th time in my life and crumble and fall apart. I can barely keep it together at work and do my job and Iâ€™m getting hella shit from my boss for it. All I want to do is just be at home and be by myself. Iâ€™m extremely suicidal man and sometimes it really makes me tear up. Iâ€™m so existential. Nothing makes sense to me anymore. Everything is gray to me. Iâ€™m becoming so sad that Iâ€™m LOSING my MIND. Like have you ever just felt like you were going crazy? Everyday I just feel like my heart is breaking and Iâ€™m losing my mind. The main thing Iâ€™m focused on right now is switching my meds out with something else. The psychiatrist I saw recommended I wait until January to change medication because she wants me to still give it a chance. At this point though, medication is my only hope because thatâ€™s the only thing thatâ€™s going to save me. Last night I cried so hard snot was coming from my nose and my head started to hurt and I just felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe. And I just prayed to god. I just asked god to help take the pain away. I canâ€™t even count on two hands how many times Iâ€™ve cried like that. How many times Iâ€™ve asked god/the universe/anyone and anything to just spare me and help end my life. I donâ€™t think anyone out there should have to experience that type of pain. Is life truly worth living? I feel like Iâ€™m rotting from the inside out. I feel dead, like a zombie. A zombie that canâ€™t turn back into a human being. How do I get out of this hole?
