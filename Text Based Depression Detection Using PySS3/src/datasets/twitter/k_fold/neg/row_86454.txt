I want to go somewhere nobody can hear me and scream at the top of my lungs.I'm filled with unimaginable amounts of hatred, despair, anger and a profound desire to die. I hate myself, and wish I could change everything. At the same time I want to inflict so much pain upon the people who have abused me in life and gotten me into this mess to begin with. Someone my age should not be deal with this sort of shit but we don't get what we want in life do we. I want to end my life but at the same time that would mean giving in to the things I've gone through and letting the people who have done me wrong win. This has me so incredibly livid I swear I could literally beat the shit out of them. I just want to scream at the top of my lungs without anyone hearing me.
