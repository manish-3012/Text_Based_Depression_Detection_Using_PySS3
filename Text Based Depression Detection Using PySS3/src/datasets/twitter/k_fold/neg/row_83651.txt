Whatâ€™s a good day to die?So Iâ€™ve been wanting to end it for quite a while now, but the main thing that put me off so far was the actual scheduling process. The logistics to plan a proper suicide are quite intense as I need a proper venue and audience. I was wondering whether or not I should invite my close relatives to come and watch. But the main thing is, how should I do it?
