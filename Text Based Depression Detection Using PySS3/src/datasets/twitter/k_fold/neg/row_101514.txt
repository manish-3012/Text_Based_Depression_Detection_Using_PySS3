I can't handle being home with my partner but I have no friends nearby.Staying in my apartment with my partner who is asleep and cannot be bothered by my issues is making me more and more inclined to act on my self-destructive behaviors.  I live in a major city (philly) and I'm wondering if there's any options of places to just hang out while the urge passes?
