Feeling GuiltyMy parents are in the middle of a divorce (they've been separated for a long time) and I live with my mom. She has PTSD from living with my dad, and her whole personality changed because of it. She's so stressed out and I feel like telling her I want to die (for the millionth time) would only make her feel worse. It would be so much easier to just leave silently. My dad has good health insurance but by golly I sure wish that the last fee he'd ever have to pay is for my cremation/ burial. I've been a financial and emotional drain on them since I was a baby. I sit up all night, fighting with myself, "Should I go get the pills and the rope?" and eventually pass out thinking about it. I get yelled at for everything, and I sit there, screaming silently, "Can't you see how much I'm hurting?!" Whenever I do say how much pain I'm in from just being ALIVE, I get brushed off and told, "You could have it worse." I wish I had it worse so that I could justify feeling this way. I live constantly disassociating, and being yelled at, and being misunderstood, and I just can't deal with it anymore. I have everything ready, all that's left is my willpower. 

Sorry for the long post
