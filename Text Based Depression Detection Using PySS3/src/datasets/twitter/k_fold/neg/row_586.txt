Im sorryIm sorry, mum and dad, that i am a worthless resource consuming uncompetitive unemployable slob who stays glued to a screen. I have tried, I really want to keep you happy but im unable to. I deserve all the comments you give me.

Im sorry, grandma, that i didnt call you everyday, i really cared despite me not calling, I wish my oblivious nature didnt make me not call you everyday.

Im sorry, cb yr sas asg pv my friends, that i was a depressing cynical uninteresting pessimist who ruined your everyday and dragged you down. I definitely deserved to be abandoned, any other person wouldnt have given me two days but im happy i got to have your company for as long as i had.

Im sorry, [octopusnado](https://www.reddit.com/u/octopusnado/) [JennyLynnP](https://www.reddit.com/u/JennyLynnP/) [littlesoggyfry](https://www.reddit.com/u/littlesoggyfry/) [crediblemayonnaise](https://www.reddit.com/u/crediblemayonnaise/) [calam\_n\_fish](https://www.reddit.com/u/calam_n_fish/) [sunset107](https://www.reddit.com/u/sunset107/) [mrsqueegyohmymuffins](https://www.reddit.com/u/mrsqueegyohmymuffins/) [Numaninteen97](https://www.reddit.com/u/Numaninteen97/) [TheCallofTheCrow](https://www.reddit.com/u/TheCallofTheCrow/) [elmoisaclown](https://www.reddit.com/u/elmoisaclown/) [happystrawberry401](https://www.reddit.com/u/happystrawberry401/) [bfrost21](https://www.reddit.com/u/bfrost21/) [wishee490](https://www.reddit.com/u/wishee490/) [dghnyldz](https://www.reddit.com/u/dghnyldz/) [heyjudeheyjude](https://www.reddit.com/u/heyjudeheyjude/) [delfie\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/delfie_/) [easy-111](https://www.reddit.com/u/easy-111/) and everyone else, that i acted like a degenerate without a soul, that i let my insecure self ruin all your lives because i thought my presence/absence didnt matter to any of you. Im truly sorry, that day I sold my soul, I ruined your lives and mine in the process. I deserve all the ignorance and disgust leveled at me.

Im sorry, gsn, that such an ugly pathetic shit like me fell in love with you dragging your worth down in the process. I shouldnt have but i couldnt help it.

Im sorry, [flawmyy](https://www.reddit.com/u/flawmyy/), for asking such a sick degenerate question in a stupid attempt to help

Im sorry, Oliver Thorn, that i wasted your efforts to help. Im just not worth saving, its my time to blast off

Im sorry, God, that I cannot live with my mistakes, I cannot live knowing the existence of people who do not want me anymore, I cannot be happy anymore and I cannot be a good human being

Im sorry, body, that i abuse you by sitting all day staring at a computer screen damaging my eyes my gut and my brain. I dont have the strength to deal with my conscience and need something to distract me from it

Im sorry, to everyone reading this, that im giving up. I cant live with myself anymore, my problems are too much for me to handle, I cant live knowing i made so many mistakes, I cant live knowing i ruined peoples lives, I cant live knowing people i love and value do not love and value me, I cant live consuming resources without contributing something of value to this world, I cant live when im dead inside. I cant live anymore but you can, you can change everything in your life, you can change. I cannot change things which i want changed but are beyond my control. I know this will seem very stereotypical but as a person who has suffered with the disease of a painful life I CAN UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL, I do I really do, but you can make it. So dont give up like i did, you can do it.

Goodbye
