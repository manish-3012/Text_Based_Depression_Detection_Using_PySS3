I've let everyone downI mean this, there's concrete proof of me being a shitty human being, a fucking parasite on everyone I've met. I just want to die. I've done enough damage as-is, I don't need to do more by continuing on in a shitty rampage and destroying what's rest of everyone's happiness. I just want it al to end, why is that so hard. Why can't I just get myself to do something so it all ends? I'm too scared to cut or even attempt anything, but I really want to just for the pain to end. This is a cry for help, I need it.
