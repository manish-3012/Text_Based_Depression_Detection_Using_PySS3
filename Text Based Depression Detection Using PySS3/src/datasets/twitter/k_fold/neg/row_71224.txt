Everything i touch turns into shit.So at this point in my life im 21 years old and it gets worse every day. Ive dealt with this for almost 8 years now, but each day, life just gets more shit. I have no contact to my dad since im 8 years old, i have no relation to my family (except my grandfather) cause they hate me and basically most of my friends abandoned me. I still live in the same place with my mum, her friend and their kid, but i don't interact with them. The only times they see me is when i go to make food.

Ive always tried to not be like my dad, but i straight happened exactly where he did and at this point i question every decision countless of times, just too end up being eaten up by it afterwards for weeks. 

I don't blame anyone but myself for this shit and i just cant help it. It was "fine" for 8 years, cause i told myself it would get better or i just kept going and kept going and kept going, but realizing today it just doesn't happen. I tried everything. I searched for a work and found it, i tried being a nice person to my family, i did sports regularly but every time i fix some broken shit i get slapped by my own decisions, past shit, people around me or something else.

I am so disappointed in myself at this point that i don't want  to find friends, or be in a relationship, and i cant even get a conversation going anymore cause i just don't know what to say, or what to do. The thing with people is: every time i talk to them i feel like they are watching down on me and it drives me mad cause i really tried to get my act together.
