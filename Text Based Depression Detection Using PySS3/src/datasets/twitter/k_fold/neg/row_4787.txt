Is 6 grams of lithium carbonate lethal?I know I posted here before, and I still don't feel any better, it's quite the paradox for me. I have everything and nothing at the same time. Unlike other people I've lost nothing of value materially or physically yet mentally I feel dead, nothing to cope with, guiltily for being depressed despite being privileged. I'm scared the only thing that helped me was writing, but I feel nothing anymore. I'm sorry. Sorry for bothering anyone, little me is nothing to be concerned with.
