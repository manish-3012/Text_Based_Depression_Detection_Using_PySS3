My death anxiety is everywhere I look and paradoxically it is making me contemplate suicideNothing makes me cope anymore.

Why bother living if everything about my life will anyways go into the flush of eternal nothingness? I can't even wrap my head around the idea of nothing. 

I am cursing at the universe for this. I wish there was a God or an afterlife but I cannot lie to myself and just believe what I want to believe.

I am so tempted of killing myself. If there is nothing, then nothing will have changed, whether I live happy until 100 or commit suicide at 27.

People try comforting me but I can only hear bullshit about "leave something for next generations" as if I'd give a fuck or "enjoy life while you can" but I fucking can't if death is beyond every corner.
