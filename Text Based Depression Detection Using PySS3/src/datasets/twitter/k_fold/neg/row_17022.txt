Hey guys, it might be over for me soon, could you help me see what the bright spots in life are?Hey, and sorry to bother you. I've been severely depressed for about 5 years now (I'm 18 now). I've been to the hospital a few times, but it hasn't had a permanent affect. I feel COMPLETELY worthless, and I'm a loser. Everyone hates me in college, I will never have any friends again, no matter how hard I try to get friends. It won't work out for me. I've never been with a girl, I think I might have an eating problem to top it all off. I've already tried about 4 times before, but they've never worked, but this time I might force myself through it. Not even my family loves me. The only thing I like in this world is my dog and video games. That's it. Sorry to bother you. I'll see how the rest of the day pans out, and if it still sucks, who knows. Thanks
