Gone and back againIt's been quite a while since I've posted here. I've made some improvements and have seen the light at the end of the tunnel, but it's still fading.

Turns out I had type 2 diabetes, probably caused by my weight and drinking. I lost over 60 pounds, and have managed normal blood sugar levels without medication for months. 

I even got a job. It's not what I want to do for the rest of my life, but it's a paycheck and another step towards independence.

Honestly, I hadn't thought about writing here in a long time, but darkness closes in once more. The rope calls to me once more.

I feel dead inside. Lonely. And I still feel like a failure, because who wants to be a cashier at 29 with a bachelor's degree in a highly sought field? Not to mention I still live with my parents. I haven't dated in over seven years and feel like I might as well be a kissless virgin at this point. Meds and therapy have helped, but they can only do so much.

I honestly feel like I crossed a threshold a long time ago and that suicide is inevitable. I'm seriously considering ending it tonight.
