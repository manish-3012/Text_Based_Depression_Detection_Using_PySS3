Tonight might be the nightLong story really short my entire life is shit, my only friend just said she's never talking to me again and changers are she won't, I do everything for her, she tried to commit and I literally saved her life, called the cops got her in the hospital etc... and yeah she's been there for me a couple times but she takes me for granted a lot, got into a fight tonight she asked to chill I said are you going to ditch me cuz lately she has been (yesterday and most days lately) and she flipped at me, I now have no one i have nothing, more is going on but yeah depressed for 8 years and I honestly had enough.... this sounds like a stupid reason but more is going on I can't say, this is just the last straw to do it
