No longer want to die but have been dealt a bad hand and don't know how long I have left. Kinda ironic this lifeI have been depressed for over 20 years, many attempts to take my own life, spent time in a mental hospital but through meds and therapy I beat the suicidal thoughts and got on top of my depression started living the best life I could, got married had kids them BAM i have terminal cancer that will take my life in 2-5 years.... and BAM the depression comes back and the suicidal thoughts. I have to laugh about it, I guess I wasn't meant to live afterall. Just needed to get that off my chest.
