What is something a woman can do but a man cannot, that doesn't involve sexuality?I was thinking about putting this on r/askwomen, but I was worried about breaking rules..

I'm a FtM transgender in the closet. I'm desperate to find out if there's SOMETHING this stupid body can do that won't just defile me even further. 

Please, is there something a woman's body can do that a man's cannot? That DOESN'T INVOLVE SEXUALITY(pregnancy, orgasms, flirting etc.), making dumb excuses to get out of situations("blame PMS"), or something that acknowledges their weakness(getting more help on the street)?

Does a woman who refuses to get pregnant even have a purpose in this world? It just causes so much unnecessary suffering...the only reason I could think of for why someone would go through things like female puberty and pregnancy is the love for babies. 

But what about those of us who don't have that love? Do they have a purpose? Is there something they can do that a man can't do just as well, or better? Out of all my research, I have yet to find a single thing...
