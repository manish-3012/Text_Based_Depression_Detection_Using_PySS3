Worried for friend, but also emotionally drained and out of ideasI have a friend at college. I think he's been in despair about his life (failing classes, not getting jobs, etc.) for a long time, and has been borderline suicidal a few times. I've talked to him and been supportive as best I could in the past, but it's been going on for so long that it's draining my own emotions and I feel like I'm burning out. Plus I have my own college life to attend to and am really busy, especially right now.

But I'm also worried because I don't think his support network is very strong. I'm one of his closest friends. He has other friends, but has also alienated quite a few people with unpopular opinions. He really dislikes his family.

I feel like he should get help from a trained psychologist or something, but he distrusts psychologists, especially the mental health resources at our college. I think he's heard and known too many bad interactions with them, probably the biggest of which was how they forcefully hospitalized and expelled one of his friends a few years back.

I don't know what to do.
