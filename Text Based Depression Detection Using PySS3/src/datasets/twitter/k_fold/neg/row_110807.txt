Went to the hospital; called the NSPH; Visited my Psych. Still feel emptySo on Sunday I was just overwhlemed by everything. Iâ€™m 26, Iâ€™m decently high on the corporate ladder, I technically have a support system but nothing is helping my heart and mind see that everything is okay. Iâ€™m aware enough to know I sound like a whiny bitch that is just throwing a tantrum for attention, however the rest of my just doesnâ€™t want to live anymore. On Sunday I called the national suicide hotline; I got the response that she was on the line with another caller and sheâ€™d call me back, literally nothing happened. I felt even more like it was a sign to just finish myself and I wasnâ€™t worth it. I went to the hospital, got asked the typical questions and then was sent on my way home and told to visit my psych the following day, which they werenâ€™t open because MLK day. 

I feel so uncomfortable in my own skin, Iâ€™m half Mexican/half white, gay, overweight because food makes me feel temporarily  happy and I gained 60 lbs over the past year and a half because of it.

Iâ€™m in East Tennessee so all 3 of those things feel like my case is even worse than it actually is. 

People have expressed how important I am to them, how much they love me and how much Iâ€™ve done for them in their life but I just feel nothing except for wanting to stop living. 

My brain wonâ€™t stop going back to the dark side of whatever the hell this is, life I guess. I just want a magic pill to stop thinking about how everyone is lying to me and they donâ€™t really care for me and that theyâ€™re just using me. My past keeps coming up again and again like an elevator that started at floor 1 and someone pressed every button to floor 99 and I canâ€™t un press them. 

If someone out there has felt this way; if you have advice; if you pulled through I want help to understand how you did or how to just trust that those people in my life are being honest and true to their word. 

I just want the pain and thoughts to stop. 

I want to make the world a better place, I want no one to feel the way because this feel is a terrible thing to shake off. 

I just want to be happy again.
