Last thoughts...I'm 20(female) and I've been suicidal since I was 12. I'm on antidepressants and anxiety medication yet I still think about it every second of everyday. I don't want to go through the messy and painful process of actually killing myself but I wish I could just cease to exist. Even though I have people who care about me it doesn't stop me from hating myself. I look in the mirror and I am disgusted. Not by my physical appearance but by my personality. I know I have a lot going for me but I can't shake this feeling. I'm planning on doing it this Christmas Eve (since I will be alone, I'm studying abroad) with my 20 anxiety pills and a bottle of vodka. I'm just scared of the physical pain it will cause if I survive. 

It's stupid to think that I'm alone in this but that's how I constantly feel. I can't go a minute without wishing I was the one who got hit by a car instead of a poor child.
