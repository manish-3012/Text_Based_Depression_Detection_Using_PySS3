Im my own biggest enemyI really have come to a point where I realize that I'm not cut out for this life and I don't bring anything positive towards those around me. It feels like I've been in a rut forever now and I can't see any light around me. I haven't been diagnosed for any mental health issues but everyday is worse than the last and I only have myself to blame for this mess. I have major trust issues and have isolated myself from everyone so I don't cause any pain for them. I treat my family like absolute shit, I have a fiery rage inside me that is burning me up. I often think about killing myself and how exactly I would carry it out but I'm too much of a coward to do it. I've never posted on here before so I'm not expecting anyone to read this but I have lost all hope and I'm really hoping to get hit by a car so I don't have to do it myself and upset those who were unlucky enough to ever come close to me. I wish I just had one person who understood my pain but that would mean I would have to enter the real world to find him/her. When I look back at my earlier years (now 20) I realize I put on a act and never really accepted that I was so alone and ever since 16 it's been getting worse and worse. Anxiety eats away at me everyday and a true feeling of emptiness swallows me whole. Sometimes it feels like the world would be a better place without me in it.
