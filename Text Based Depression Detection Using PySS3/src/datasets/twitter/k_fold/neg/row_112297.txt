I worry Iâ€™m in a toxic relationship and Iâ€™m so tired of trying to not deserve it...I know on some level Iâ€™m being hyperbolic, Iâ€™m emotional and confused and hurt-but these fights keep happening with my spouse and I donâ€™t know how to stop it! Itâ€™s like every few weeks I do or donâ€™t do something right and I get unloaded on; told things like it donâ€™t love them enough/rightâ€™ because Iâ€™m not acting proactively enough or having the right response-and I know thatâ€™s really vague but Iâ€™m scared to be too detailed. Iâ€™m just so tired of not being enough, no matter how hard I try. I just want it to stop!
