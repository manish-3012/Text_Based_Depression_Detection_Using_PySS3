Can someone with an open mind and big heart please just listen to me?Hello everyone. I think tonight will be the night that I end it all. Iâ€™ve been trying to be strong but i canâ€™t do this anymore. I made an absolutely idiotic mistake that is killing me. It has been ruining my life and mental health these last few months and I have no idea how I will get past this. Is there any kind, non-judgemental folks who can please listen to me and hear me out and maybe offer a word of advice? I want to die but I also just want to get this off my chest. Thank you all
