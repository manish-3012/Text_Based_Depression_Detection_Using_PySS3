I want to talk to someone...Happy New Year to anyone reading this. Hope you are doing well. Same canâ€™t be said about me.

I have issues going back to school days. Parents and siblings love me, but sometimes when I do â€œsillyâ€ things, like accidentally leaving the power for the computer on during a lightning storm, and gets blown up, I get called names. Just a few minutes ago, my mum called me a dumbass.

Iâ€™ve been seeking therapy for months, but not one is private or affordable, because of Covid.

I just want to talk about the problems in my life
