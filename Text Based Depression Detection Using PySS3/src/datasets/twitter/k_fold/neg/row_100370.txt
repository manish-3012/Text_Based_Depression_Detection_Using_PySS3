Made a noose tonightThis is the closest Iâ€™ve gotten to a suicide attempt in at least a year. I feel hopeless. I loathe myself and I cannot stand the idea of living with myself any longer. I tested the strength of the knot for a while and I feel confident it will work. My heart is pounding so I stepped away to allow myself to calm down. I want to do it. I really do. I worry about my family and maybe a few of my friends, but it does feel like it will be better in the long run for everyone. I need to quiet my head and be free from this. I feel tired.
