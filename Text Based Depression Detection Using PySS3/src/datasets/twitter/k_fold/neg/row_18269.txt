Someone please stop me before I do something stupid.I've been facing depression for 3 years. It gets worse and worse. Now I fear I might just kill myself.

To share a bit of light, I'll talk about myself. I hate my family, absolutely hate it here. I've more or less been the focus. Everyone here expects me to be great, yet they never really show me any respect. Insults, no one listening to what I say are common in my life, to the point where I rarely speak. I take my happy time by playing video games and browsing websites. Yep, I try to avoid the real world as much as possible. For every relaxing hour I get 3 very stressful ones. Being at school or at home always stresses me out. I've reached a point where half my body gets numb.I can't feel my limbs, my heart kinda goes unstable etc. My grades are going down because I can't think or remember anything, literally. My memory of most things go blank sometimes. At times, I can't breathe and lose consciousness in the middle of the class. I tried talking about it to my parents, but they don't believe it. 

Right now is probably the worst time. I'm most likely going to fail a couple of subjects, lose my scholarship and be forced to change courses. For the amount of stress and pressure I have, living doesn't feel worth it anymore. Everyone expects me to be great yet no one tries to help in any way. They'll blame my addiction to video games. To me, my addiction is just a side effect. If I wasn't addicted to video games, the stress may have made me end it sooner.
