I know I'm young but I already feel like there's nothing to look foward too.I barely turned 16 three months ago and my parents wanted me to get a job, so I did but I only lasted 2 weeks.  Now they're telling me that I'm a disappointment and that I should kill myself.

It's not the first time they've told me to kill myself but now I'm genuinely considering it.  I feel useless, and I'm not what they want.  I'm apparently the source of all their problems.

I'm tired of my mom hurting physically and mentally, I always have to bare it all cause I'm scared of getting the police called again.

So now I think I'm going to overdose on my mom's sleeping pills or hang myself.

I'm useless.
