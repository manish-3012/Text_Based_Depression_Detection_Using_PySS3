Happiness isn't for meI honestly feel like there's something that just doesn't click in my brain that can't be fixed. The meds were working for a bit but now it's all worse because for a moment I understood what happiness was, but now I'm even worse than before and I have nobody left in my life to talk to about these things. I'm giving myself one month, and if things aren't better by then I'm ending it. I used to be so afraid of everything, but I've lost that. I'm not really afraid of anything anymore, death seems more like a comfort than anything scary. I don't believe in heaven or hell necessarily, but the thought of an afterlife, or the unknown at all always stopped me. Anything has to be better than this.
