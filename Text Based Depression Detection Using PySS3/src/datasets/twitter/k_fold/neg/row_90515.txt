Please help meSo my ex-girlfiend and I went out for drinks on saturday night and we both got pretty drunk.

We fell down on her bed and I started to kiss her and she was falling asleep but she was definitely still awake. I touched her leg and when I realized she wasn't reciprocating I stopped immediately and felt horrible afterwards.

Now she's saying that I assaulted her because she was falling asleep when I absolutely did not force myself on her and when I realized she wasn't doing anything back I stopped and went home. 

I have severe mental health issues and I've been crying for 2 days over this because I was raped 4 months ago myself and I would never ever ever ever want to inflict that kind of pain on someone and I'm so upset that I might've. 

But all I did was kiss her and touch her leg and I don't know what to do. 

She's pretty mentally unstable too.

I tried to drown myself because of this.
