I've become a monsterIt seems I've finally come to realise that I've become a monster i thought i was originally preventing becoming one but really i became one a long time ago. I keep hurting the people i love saying things that i shouldn't and now trying to suppress my emotions. I've become something i feared of becoming and now that the realization has kicked in I'm not sure what to do I'm panicking
