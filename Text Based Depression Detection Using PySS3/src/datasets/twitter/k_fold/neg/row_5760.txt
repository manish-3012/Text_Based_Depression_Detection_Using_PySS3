I'm (19 F) feeling truly suicidal and I feel I have run out of options. Any advice?I've been depressed for as long as I can remember, but only recently it's gotten severe and I'm genuinely considering suicide. 

Background on me:

- I'm 19, female, and black.
- I'm in my 2nd year of college - I plan on graduating a year early. 
- My father sexually abused me for 7 years (5-12; took my virginity at 11)
- I've always had friends - never close friends. 
- Never close with any family members. 
- I'm introverted, but not shy. I know how to talk to people, I just don't. 
- I've dated quite a few *men* from age 18 to now (all white; this seems to be my preference) 
- I fell in love at 16 and that destroyed me in multiple ways (we dated for 2 years, then one day he didn't reply to my text messages - haven't heard from him in over a year - first person I opened up to)
- Major eating issue (I've lost and gained up to 40 pounds *multiple times* over the past 5 years; I eat too much or too little + exercise too much or not at all) (I'm one extreme or the other, I'm a master at losing and gaining weight)
- Seen 3 separate therapists (first 2 for depression, 3rd for eating problem - no help)
- I've called suicide prevention twice, nothing useful for me there.
- Made one suicide attempt at 15.

Recent stuff that has me down: 

- Not doing so well in school this semester.
- I feel behind and have anxiety about grad school, interships, jobs, future (paying off loans etc...) 
- My body issue is getting worse (I've barely eaten the past 3 days except this special laxative tea)
- I feel hated - more than usual. I feel uglier and fatter than usual. Sadder than usual. Invisible more than usual. 
- Not feeling connected to anyone (campus is full of immature guys, and SJWs)
- Starting to realize I have *no one* in my corner (no friends, family, professors, animals, guys) (been at college nearly 2 years and have made no solid friends; only thing that keeps me sane/feeling normal are the men I date)

I wouldn't call myself optimistic, but I always figured there was more for me in the future so I kept going. 

I've never wanted to give up this badly before, I'm finding it very difficult to see past this...

...but when I do, I can't help but think, "well you're going to die one day, why even stress yourself like this?"

Tl;Dr Lonely chick feeling suicidal, tried many remedies in the past, any advice?
