My father doesn't really understand my depressionIt bothers me. He thinks it is just a lack of confidence, despite being diagnosed with bipolar by three different doctors and diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. He thinks he knows more than I know myself. I cannot really share my depression with anyone. I feel like I'm inconveniencing others.
