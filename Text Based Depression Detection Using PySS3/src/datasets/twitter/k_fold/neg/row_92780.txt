I moved for my husbands job and left everything behind, and my will is slowly slipping away.I moved almost a month ago from the town I have spent my entire life in. I left behind all my family, the small number of friends I had, a career, possibilities. I left a dance studio I loved and that encouraged me. I knew the move would be difficult but I thought I'd be able to find a job, meet people, and continue dancing and be able to commit more time to my creative outlets. Instead, I can't find a job (even in retail and I have my bachelors), I never leave the house because I don't have a car at this new place (and even when I leave, I'm too shy), the dance studio here is sub-par. I just feel like I'll never be able to achieve my goals here and I feel so alone. I would love to move back or somewhere with more opportunities but my husband is bound here for at least 3 years. I cant really talk to anyone about it because I don't want them to worry. I feel everyday like I have no options that end well and that ending it would bring an end to the pain.  I haven't felt this way in a long time which is what worries me the most,  because I can feel this isn't just a flare up of my depression. It's serious. I just don't know what to do. Anyone else with similar experience able to say it gets better?
