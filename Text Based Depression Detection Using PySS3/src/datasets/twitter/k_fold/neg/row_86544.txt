I feel trapped in my own 500lb body, mind flooded with suicidal thoughts.I wonâ€™t do it because I canâ€™t leave my mom but I want to. So bad.   
Everyday I wake up and just wish my body would finally give up.   
At least if I die of natural causes itâ€™s not as terrible for those around you. They donâ€™t blame themselves.  

I want to have a normal life but when every day is pain and suffering whatâ€™s the point?   
I try to lose weight over and over and fail.   
Then I get mad and self sabotage, binge eating as a way to feel good but also punish myself for sucking.   

Every minute of my life I hurt.   
Every day I wonder if Iâ€™ll fit here, or there.   
Ever my day I worry Iâ€™ll break a chair or some other furniture.   
People stare and think poorly of you.   
The doctor says to exercise but going to work 5 days a week is hard enough. I can hardly walk from the office to my car before searing pain is running through my legs and back.     
How do I eat healthy when standing to cook is painful as my legs shake like Iâ€™m going to fall?     
Iâ€™m so deep into this addiction to food I feel like the only way out is death and I donâ€™t want to wait for it to come naturally.     
They say suicide is selfish, how about wanting someone to live their life depressed and in pain so you donâ€™t have to have guilt and sadness is selfish?   

I have no one to blame but myself. Every day I think about ending it all. I just want the misery to be over. I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined my life, even if I do lose weight there is so much irreversible damage. There is no point in carrying on. I just donâ€™t see it. 

I hate what Iâ€™ve done. I hate myself. I hate my body. And I hate the love that I have for food.
