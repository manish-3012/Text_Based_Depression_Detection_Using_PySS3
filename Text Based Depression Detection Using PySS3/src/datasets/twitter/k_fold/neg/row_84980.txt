I lost my jobI was recently laid off from my job after working there for about 3 years. Now I donâ€™t know what to do with my life. I donâ€™t feel like looking for another job because it wonâ€™t be the same. I feel like Iâ€™ll hate it.

I was comfortable at my old job. Part of me just wants to give up on life completely and try to take my life. Iâ€™ve tried before and I donâ€™t know if I could muster the strength to try again as much as I would like to.

I donâ€™t even know what kind of job to look for. I donâ€™t really feel passionate about anything. Iâ€™d rather stay home.

I feel lost. This sucks so much.
