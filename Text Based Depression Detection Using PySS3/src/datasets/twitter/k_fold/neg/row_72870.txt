I might have finally found the right time.I have to move soon, and I have got nowhere to go. Which means I'll have all my stuff packed (all my stuff fits in a suitcase and a backpack). I can just throw away/donate everything. I have no debts and no job. In two weeks I am free to end it all with minimal impact to anyone around me. I thinking I might go to some secluded place in a forest, call the cops before hand telling them I found a body so that no innocent hiker has to stumble upon it.
