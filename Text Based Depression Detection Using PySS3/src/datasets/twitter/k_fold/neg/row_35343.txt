â€˜M tired.Iâ€™m a teenager, sure, but Iâ€™m so. Tired. I put on a faÃ§ade to everybody around me, I try to laugh and be the funny one but the truth is that Iâ€™m always thinking about it in the back of my head. Iâ€™ve started seriously considering it. I feel trapped. 

Even this post seems to fall flat because I canâ€™t round up enough energy to give it more umph. Getting up for school is a struggle. I canâ€™t do work. All I do is sleep when I get home. 

I feel like Iâ€™d be doing everybody a favor to be gone. Again, Iâ€™m just so tired. I donâ€™t care about anything anymore. I only truly care about one single person and maybe thatâ€™s where my one reservation comes in. 

I hate myself. Not in that 2013 I-hate-myself-and-my-parents-give-me-attention but more like a....I wish nobody would ever look at me again because I am a menace to see, interact with, or talk to. I wish I could disappear for the sake of the people around me. 

Itâ€™s not that I think that things wonâ€™t get better, is that itâ€™s all too much effort. Iâ€™m too tired for all of it. And I donâ€™t want to try. I donâ€™t want to try and get better, I just want to let go.
