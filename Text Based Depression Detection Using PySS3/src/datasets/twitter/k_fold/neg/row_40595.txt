Fuck life. All I feel like is a big pile of wrong things. I want to not exist. I want to die. I should die.Iâ€™ve been struggling with my gender identity for so long, and then my mental health is shit. I donâ€™t care. Maybe Iâ€™ll just kill myself. But then I donâ€™t want to die because Iâ€™m actually afraid of death. Idk. Donâ€™t wanna be trans, donâ€™t wanna be cis- I feel like a fake fuck. Doesnâ€™t help that thereâ€™s stereotypes about trans people. Donâ€™t like this. I wish I never existed. I wish I could just stay a woman, or be born a man. I hate this. I hate this so much. Kill me please. I want this to be over. I donâ€™t want to be anything. Iâ€™m a fake piece of shit.
