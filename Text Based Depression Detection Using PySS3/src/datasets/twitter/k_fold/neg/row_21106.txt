My life is completely over and Iâ€™m alone nowMy dad keeps inviting my friends over to her high w them and itâ€™s fucking up everything for me. If I say how much that h u m I l I a t e s me it just gets used as a weapon and thrown back at me. I have no one. My dad has taken all my friends from me cause he canâ€™t go a couple days without getting high. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I have no one anymore. Iâ€™m alone. I have no reason to push on. Why was i born? Why couldnâ€™t I have a different life with different parents? The only way theyâ€™ll realize what they did to me is if Iâ€™m not here. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I wonâ€™t make it to the ends of summer 2020
