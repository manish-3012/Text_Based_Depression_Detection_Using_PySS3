something good nor bad happen todayi was so pent up in anger and sadness i got a towel and wrapped it around the curtains in my mother's room i told myslef  

I DONT GIVE A FUCK IF I DIE I HAD FUCK THIS SHIT while tieing to the curtain i jumped of the chair and hoped to the ground

 the instant i did that i fell to the floor with my hurt and the curtains broke. so as a 17 year i called i told my parents that broke accidentally as i was calling them it didnr pick i did it for 4 times until i said if they dont pick up ill kill myslef and it did pick up they believed the lie. you know straight after i attempted  suicide i was so sad i was still alive i put my head in my bed for 30 mins they why do i have to live on a world that doesn't expect people like me. I went outside and a bird landes on my head a ROBIN BIRD twiking non stop like its sibling died or something two more came anyway i believe  its a sign from somewhere
