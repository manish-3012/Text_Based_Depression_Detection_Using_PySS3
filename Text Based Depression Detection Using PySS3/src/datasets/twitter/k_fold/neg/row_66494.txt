Why not just do it?No matter what, I always come back to being suicidal. I just finished my masters degree and I'm working at a grocery store. The president of my country is clearly a white supremacist. I'm mixed race, I'm sure they want me dead anyway, why don't I just kill myself. What's the fucking point. Life never gets significantly better. It's like "Hey just hold on so that the rest of us can be okay, okay?" I fucking hate it here. I fucking hate this world. It's fucking over - there is no preventing the collapse of the environment, they don't want me here anyway, my mom just tells me to just pretend the world is fine. I don't see the point of being here. What is the fucking point?
