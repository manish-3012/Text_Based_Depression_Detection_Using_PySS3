Iâ€™m not getting better and whenever I start to then I get worse. I donâ€™t want to see how much worse it can get, I donâ€™t want to be remembered as that person. I need to end it now.Everyday I fall deeper and deeper and then I try to pull myself out and I fall back even further. I donâ€™t see the point, I canâ€™t even get through conversation without saying something stupid or Oversharing. Iâ€™m tired of being teased, even if itâ€™s all in good fun i just canâ€™t feel like I can get better and it always makes me feel worse. Yesterday the person I date said I could never understand how hard it is to be with me, he canâ€™t even spend a full day with me. Iâ€™m too intense and emotional. Iâ€™m gullible. Iâ€™m dragging my loving parents down with me. The man I care about doesnâ€™t deserve this either. I canâ€™t talk to anyone but they donâ€™t want me to die but they wonâ€™t talk to me because Iâ€™m too intense. It almost feels selfish, like they donâ€™t want me to die but they wonâ€™t talk to me either. I donâ€™t blame them even. It makes sense. I deserve to be alone. I want the quiet. Iâ€™m going to finish my drinks, go home, and find a way to end it. I think thereâ€™s something in the cabinet that will help me sleep forever. Itâ€™s time.
