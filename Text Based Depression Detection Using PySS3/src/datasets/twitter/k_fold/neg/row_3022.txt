I donâ€™t want help anymore.A little over a year ago I got out of an outpatient treatment center because of my depression and previous suicide attempt. It fucking sucked being trapped there. All these people telling you to â€œLook at the bright sideâ€, like I havenâ€™t tried that every day of my life. Before the outpatient, I was in the psych hospital, and it was no better. I hated all the bullshit therapy and being treated like Iâ€™m crazy. Iâ€™m not fucking crazy! Iâ€™m hurting, and I want the pain to end and they donâ€™t seem to understand that! After all the medication testing, they finally got a pill combo that stabilized me, aka made me numb to any emotion. Well like I said itâ€™s been a year since then and Iâ€™m fucking done with life again, and Iâ€™m not going to ask for help after the shit it got me in the last time. Iâ€™m just done. I feel like I was always a lost cause to begin with. I never felt like I would like past 20, and now I know itâ€™s not going to happen. Iâ€™m planning on committing suicide before the school year starts up again. Iâ€™m not going to go through the bad grades and getting treated like a dumbass because of them.  Iâ€™m not dumb, I just donâ€™t have the motivation.  Fuck the unnecessary stress. Fuck this. Fuck life.
