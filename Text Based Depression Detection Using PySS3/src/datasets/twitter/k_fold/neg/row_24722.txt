I need help for a friendI'm on my phone so sorry if this is clunky.

One of my closest friends has been suicidal for about 3 years, and about 5 hours ago she threatened to commit suicide. I'm unable to help besides texting because she's currently across the country for a sporting event. I panic and begin talking to my high school's counselor asking for help. The counselor told her mom and the coach that she's with. Her mom has never understood and now she might be removed from the competition because of these threats.

I feel like I did what's right but I also feel like I just ruined her life...

I don't know what to do, she hasn't texted me since I got the counselor. Please help
