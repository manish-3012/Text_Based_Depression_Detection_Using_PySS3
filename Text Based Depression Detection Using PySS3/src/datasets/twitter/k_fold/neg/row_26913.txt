I can't stop cryingWhenever I'm alone, all I do is cry. 

I don't know if I'm at risk for suicide. 

I've planned how I would do it and I've prepared to do it, but I don't feel like I'm going to. 

It's almost all precautionary, but there are moments where I'm 100% ready to set things in motion. I know if I was assessed in the hospital I would be placed on a psychiatric hold. 

Am I insane?
