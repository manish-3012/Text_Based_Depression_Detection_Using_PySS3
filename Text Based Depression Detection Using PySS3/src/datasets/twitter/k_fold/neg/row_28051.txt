This job of a life.I consider this life as a job, you walk into it every day knowing you have a goal, and that is to be successful and make something out of nothing. The shift starts from when you wake up and ends when you go to bed, if you're lucky. Most of the time you can't even go to bed because of all the challenges it has put you through, either you get stuck working or the brain won't stop thinking about the tasks you have for the future. You are you're own employer but everyone else is your boss. Lately, my bosses have manage to make me feel so useless and empty, my colleagues have deserted me. I am alone. Working for something that i don't even know what it is. There are no rewards, only more heartache and pain. There is no pay, only the $1 meal you can afford. So here it is, thank you for your never ending trials. The emptiness have consumed me. Consider this as my resignation letter. Thank you reddit for making me last this long.
