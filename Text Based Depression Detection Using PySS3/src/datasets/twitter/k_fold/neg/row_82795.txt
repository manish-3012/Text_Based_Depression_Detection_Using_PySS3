Inner Turmoil and ExhaustionIs there really any point to go on? Don't have the urge to continue fighting for nothing. 

It's a continues cycle that is impossible to break out of. Suicidal thoughts are running rampant up between my ears. And it's not long until i go insane.

I can feel that my time here at almost 22 is up, i'm sorry to everyone who will waste their time reading this.
