I feel even worse now.I posted on here last night saying goodbye to my loved ones, I turned off my phone and I slit my wrist only for it endlessly leak blood and have no effect on me. I feel crushed even more so now that death doesn't even want me. Now I crave a bullet in the brain, these urges are strong. I'm sitting in closet screaming and crying at 8 in the morning. Home alone, the loneliness is crippling.
