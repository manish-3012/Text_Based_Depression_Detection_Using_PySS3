This book helped me.Last year I was struggling with a form of OCD that came to fruition. Apparently, I had some seriously unresolved issues for my childhood which I never dealt with. 

About this book, and it really helped me start to overcome a lot of the trauma that I had never addressed. I'm hoping it can help a few people here too.
