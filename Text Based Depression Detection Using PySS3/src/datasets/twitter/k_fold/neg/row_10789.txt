I feel like every day i live is another moment i should be deadI cant do this anymore, i cant. I feel so hopeless and absolutely worthelss. Whats wrong with me. No one wants me. No one loves me. I shoudl just kill myself right. Things dont seem to be getting better. Every day im more and more depressed. I dont want to live anymore.
