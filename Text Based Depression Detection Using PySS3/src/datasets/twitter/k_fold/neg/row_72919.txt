I don't know what to doIm 19 and am a sophomore in college. I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 12 when my parents got divorced and my life has never been the same. I feel empty and my loneliness is eating at me. I try to do stuff with people but I just feel like like a husk in a room full of people. Ive never been romantically involved with anyone not due to my lack of trying, im just awful at it. I do a good job of hiding how I truly feel, and most people would consider me a happy guy. I feel lost in life and death sounds like a sweet release from this bullshit. I try and convince myself to stay in school but i fucking hate it. I try and convince myself that im really creative but I can't finish anything and i find myself laying in bed all the time listening to music. The only thing stopping me honestly is music its the only thing i can say i enjoy doing. I tried to start making music but I can't get myself to work on more music. I feel worthless and a burden on everyone. I hate myself.
