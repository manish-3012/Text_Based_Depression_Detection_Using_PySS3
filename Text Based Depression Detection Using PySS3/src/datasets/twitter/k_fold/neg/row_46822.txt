I'm making plans and preparations. Won't be long now.I realized recently that I've been holding out to see if things would get better, the way everyone always promised. Almost thirteen years has gone by, and it hasn't.

I used to just idly dream about killing myself, just long for being dead without conscious thought as to how to make that happen. I used to think that my pain being here was less important than the pain others world feel when I was gone. So I held on. 

Now I feel that my life is unbearable to me. My previous reasons against suicide don't mean much now that circumstances have changed,  now that the scales have tipped. I'm making plans now. And backup plans. AND writing notes, getting rid of my possessions. 

I've moved from being a depressed person with suicidal ideation into being a danger to myself.  I find I don't mind.
