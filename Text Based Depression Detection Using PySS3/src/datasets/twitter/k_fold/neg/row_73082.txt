Afraid to leave the house because of my looks, I want to die.Hello. I should start off that I'm a 16 year old junior in high school. I've suffered from depression and anxiety since about halfway through the 7th grade (I currently take Cymbalta), and I've just recently been diagnosed as having Body Dysmorphic Disorder. I've been having very severe acne for over a year now, and it's the biggest cause of my self loathing. Apart from the acne, I absolutely hate my crooked nose, my height (5'6"), my penis size, my hair, my eyes/eyebrows, my smile is fucking ugly (I avoid smiling whenever possible). I might just sound like a self-absorbed teenager, but it's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to even leave the house because of how I look. I have to force myself to go to school every day, where my "best friend" constantly berates me for my bad acne. I can't go out to dinner with my parents and my brother because I'm afraid of stares from strangers. I've been blowing off hanging out with my friends because I just don't want anybody to see me, even those who I'm close to.

 I've been feeling suicidal about this for some time now, around 6 months. I just don't know what to do anymore. The medicine I'm taking (Cymbalta) doesn't seem to help anymore, and I can't seem to find any confidence within me. I want to die. I would honestly rather be dead than have to deal with my hideous looks and disapproval from others.
