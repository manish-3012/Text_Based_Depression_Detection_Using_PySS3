17 and very confusedThis may seem like more of a random rant than anything else but I'm just really confused right now, I'm 17 and have had really bad depression for about 2 years now, aswell as having some other mild conditions. 

I'm feeling suicidal almost every day now and I feel like I can't stop myself, I've been getting help and started taking pills for depression and sleep recently, but they just make it worse. Usually losing my appetite, stomach pains, dizziness etc. 

And to make it all worse I can get pretty bad anxiety and aren't in any education/work since I dropped our a few months ago (I have no idea what I want to do) one day I'll feel perfectly fine and somewhat happy and the next I'll be terribly depressed, suicidal and feel like just giving up. 

Being really interested in Music and Psychology is all I have to distract myself from life. Does anyone have any advice for what to do? How you cope yourself? Or just anything in general
