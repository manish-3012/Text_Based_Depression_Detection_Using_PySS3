The Battle InsideI cut myself yesterday 

I talked myself out of the hospital 

Full of threatening and unfriendly females 

And the manipulative little girl inside me 

Put on a happy face 

And explained this was all 

A huge misunderstanding 

About my blood pressure being high 

Due to anxiety

I didnâ€™t like where I was put 

How I was treated 

How they looked at me 

I was having none of it 

They were 

Full of judgment 

Full of disdain 

Full of everything 

Someone with mental illness 

Despises 

Being treated differently 

Locked rooms 

Chairs, curtains, and security

But then again 

I guess there are no 

Softer gentler psych wards 

Treating it like an illness 

And not like a caged animal 

That needs to be tamed

So I smiled and nodded 

Answered all the questions 

Correctly and politely 

While thoughts of violence 

Swirled in my head 

Yet never came out of my mouth

And who would have thought 

Such a well put together 

Person

Could be so dark inside 

And yet 

Come across 

So well spoken 

Joke and laugh with the nurses 

â€œShe doesnâ€™t meet the criteriaâ€ 

I heard them say

â€œYes, yes I knowâ€ 

I respond 

â€œItâ€™s okay 

It was all a misunderstanding"

No one really knows

The meaning 

Of â€œperiodic suicidal ideationâ€

So they give me my papers 

And I walked out the doors 

Ubered my way home 

Took my Valium 

And sliced my leg 

Until the pain and the Valium kicked in 

And my brain shut the fuck up 

Until there was peaceful silence 

The warmth of blood 

Dripping down my leg 

And all the medication hit me at once

But the solace was so short-lived 

Not even 24 hours later

They are back 

With a vengeance 

Hurt yourself 

Hang yourself 

Die die die 

You donâ€™t deserve to live 

Your children deserve 

A way better mother than youâ€¦

Just donâ€™t die here 

Just donâ€™t traumatize them 

They deserve so much better 

Than you

No one Wants to deal with you 

Talk to you 

Return your calls or messages 

You pay people to listen to you 

You pay people to care about you 

Well, at least some of them

All those broken things 

You left behind 

You broke them 

Broken hearts 

Broken dreams 

A broken little girl

You could be so much stronger 

But you are not 

Everyone criticizes you 

Everyone talks about you

They all dislike you

And someday 

Someday 

I am going to win 

And you are going to die.
