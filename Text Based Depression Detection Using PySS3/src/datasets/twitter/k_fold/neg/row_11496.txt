The only thing keeping me alive is so patheticI was here, on this throwaway, 7 months ago, and here I am again. Life seems to get better for awhile, then worse again. I should be well-established in my career by now, but instead, I'm working at a temp job for entry wages and trying to find a real job, but no one will hire me. 

Every day I come home from work and get high and play games so I can forget for awhile how miserable I am. So I can forget that my life is shit. So I can forget that I can't even afford the extra few dollars to buy toiletries and things. So I can forget that I don't believe my boyfriend loves me anymore. 

The only thing keeping me from trying to end my life right now (and I did try once, a couple years ago, obviously it didn't take or I wouldn't be telling you lovely people this story) is probably the stupidest thing that has ever kept anyone from killing themselves. And I feel more pathetic for it, like I should just die for being this much of a loser.

I swear I'm not a troll. But the only thing keeping me alive today is the fact that, if I die, I will never know what happens to Jon Snow. 

And now I'm crying again because my life has come to this. I care more about a fictional character than about myself.
