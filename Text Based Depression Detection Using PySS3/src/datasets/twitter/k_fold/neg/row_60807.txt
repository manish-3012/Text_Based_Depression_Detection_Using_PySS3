Thinking of killing myself sometime todayI am so tired of this life man and this political/economical/social life is too much. I lost any drive for continuing school, donâ€™t have any friends anymore since graduating high school, grew out of video games. Had someone tell me to go on Reddit and find this place, but itâ€™s so gloomy and sad
