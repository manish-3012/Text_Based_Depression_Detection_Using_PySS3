I will never amount to anythingMy depression has caused me to ruin everything for me. My girlfriend that I was with for 2 fucking years. We were perfect, it was a perfectly balanced sexual, intellectual, and caring relationship. I could not foresee anything getting in the way of us. and then she lied to me, cheated on me and broke up with me, and I still want her. All that happened almost a year ago. I was over her for a while, but now, be me a senior in HS, I am feeling hopeless. She was all I really had that made me feel like I mattered. Now that she is gone I see how pointless my life really is. Even making varsity soccer and having a 4.0 GPA and strong aspiration for college, It won't mean anything. Nothing I do will ever truly mean anything to the human race. Nothing. I'm not gifted in any way. Im an ugly tall skinny fuck, and in my own grief I pushed people away. All these other girls that I had a chance with, Ashley, Kara, Savannah, every single one I pushed aside because I want my ex back. I know inside that my ex isn't good for me and she is just false happiness, but I can't seem to see anything else to live for. All my guy friends are not "real" friends. I know people have started to notice my depression. And my social awkwardness has branded me as a loser and a faggot. I'm not sure I will ever feel good about myself.
