Dying in VeniceI'm on a school trip to Venice, Italy. I think it would be a nice place to end it. I've sort of been half planning on it for a while. Tomorrow is our last day. I look up at all the towers and think about how if I jumped I'd finally make an impact on all the people who ignored me and don't care about me. 

The only thing keeping me alive is my girlfriend back home, and my cat. They wouldn't understand why I did it, and my girlfriend would be irreparably broken. Still can't shake the desire to end it though. Thought about reaching out to one of my classmates and telling her what I wanted to do, but she would probably just freak out, if she even cared at all. "Hey make sure I don't kill myself" is a heavy burden to put on someone anyway. 

I've actually had a good time here, even though I can't really connect with the other students. It's beautiful and lively and filled with culture. But back home is a just mundane and ugly. I have no friends and time and money are running out. I have no hope for a future. God I wish I could move here. I don't want to go back. I want to rest here.

Thanks for reading. Just wanted to put it down and get it out of me.
