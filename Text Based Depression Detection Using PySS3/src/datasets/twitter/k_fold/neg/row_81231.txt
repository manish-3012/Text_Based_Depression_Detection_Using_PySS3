I really just wish a drunk driver would hit me or something. It would be so much easier.I'm tired of going to the hospital and having everyone think I'm nuts.  Why can't the universe just kill me somehow?  It happens to people all the time.  Heck, I have high blood pressure.  I could die right now.  Why don't I?  Why can't I just die like so many people who don't want to?  Can't I trade with them, so we both get what we want, them getting to live and me getting to die?
