I've been thinking about doing something stupidI dont know how serious I am or how far I would take it but I've been thinking about hurting myself. I dont think I have the balls to actually do it but I'm starting to worry bc the thought is happening more &amp; more. I wake up putting myself down, looking at how bad things are in my life, how big of a loser I am, knowing that I lack the discipline to ever change it. I want to go back to drugs bc at least then I was chasing something, even if it was something I was never going to get. At least then my family will either have a reason not to talk to me like they dont now or at least they will some what show that they care.

I've been so depressed for so long that I dont want to do anything, I cant drag myself to even shower, let alone attempt to get a job. I dont feel good either bc I dont take care of myself physically. I just want it all to either get better or end and as I said, I know I lack the discipline to change it... just like a chickenshit that I am, I look for the easy way out... I just dont know what to do anymore.. I dont want to be put on antidepressants bc it's a false happiness.. I've tried them and they weirded me out. 

I just dont know anymore.
