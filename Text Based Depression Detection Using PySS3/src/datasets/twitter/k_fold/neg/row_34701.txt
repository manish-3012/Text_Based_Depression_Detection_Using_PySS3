The only thing stopping me from killing myself are my friendsWe've already lost one friend already due to medical issues, and they've told me that if they lose another friend then they wouldn't find a reason to live. They need to live, I know that they can become successful doctors, designers, lawyers, everything. I also know I can't be that, so why keep trying? they are my reason, I don't want to cause them pain.
