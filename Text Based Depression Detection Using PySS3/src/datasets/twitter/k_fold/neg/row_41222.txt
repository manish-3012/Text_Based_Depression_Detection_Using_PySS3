Why try to stay alive when Iâ€™m 100% hopeless?!Ik most people say no one is truly hopeless, but I am! I suck at academics, I dropped out from 2 universities already and about to do the same at the uni Iâ€™m in atm. My high school friends are graduating this year, and Iâ€™m still in year 2 and Iâ€™m not even interested in my current major which is Business. I studied Pharmacy and Engineering before and I just sucked at them and hated them. Same for Business, I just donâ€™t wanna try to even study anymore. I literally have zero motivation or will to do anything. Also, I canâ€™t get any job in the country Iâ€™m living in without having a degree. Actually idc anymore, I donâ€™t even want a job coz I suck at everything. Iâ€™m talentless and donâ€™t have any hobbies and I donâ€™t have any fucking passion to anything. Except porn maybe. Iâ€™m a 23 years old virgin guy whoâ€™ll die virgin coz Iâ€™m a fat fucking loser. The only reason thatâ€™s making me delay killing myself is my family. They love me and I love them, but ik Iâ€™m becoming a heavier burden on them everyday. I literally have no other reason to stay alive. I have zero passion to anything, I can never become independent and can never get into a relationship. Which is all I want from life. To get into a relationship. But Iâ€™ll never initiate a conversation with a girl because I fucking have how my body looks and ik that not starting a conversation wonâ€™t make things better but fuck it. Iâ€™m just waiting for the day my family starts hating me, coz all I do now is literally sit all day at home and do nothing. I wish I was not fat so I donâ€™t feel self-conscious about my body all the time so I could get out more but fuck it. Iâ€™ll just probably drop out of uni for the last time and just stay at home until my parents get sick of me, then Iâ€™m off to meet god!
