Cape HornCape Horn is a small vantage point along Hwy 14 that overlooks the Columbia River. During summer it is beautiful. At night the stars come through clear and for being such a small place, it's one of my favorites. Tonight, it's rainy, the roads are pooled with standing water, and there is a lot of low hanging fog. Visibility is low. I have been sitting here for maybe 20 minutes. I've seen one car pass by. A Sheriff's Deputy. Ironic. 

A month ago or so, my girlfriend of almost a year left me. Unbeknownst to me, she wasn't happy anymore. She hadn't been for a long while. I am not sensitive enough to her. I'm rude. I would call her names. I was a genuine piece of shit. But what's worst, I didn't even know I was doing it. Most of the time if crack jokes and whatnot not realizing that she was taking them to heart. She was a perfect girlfriend. She loved my kid. My kid loves her. She was good to me and did more than I ever could've asked her to. I have been in many relationships. I've been cheated on, lied to, treated like shit, used; you name it. This is the worst of them all. I had a nice planned with her. We had dreams together. She was my entire life. I knew her better than anyone ever had, and I let her in more than I'd ever let anybody. We were perfect for each other. But because I couldn't pull my head out of my ass, and she spent so much time trying to make it work and be happy on her own, she lost it. I had one moment of shit judgement that I regret every day that pushed her over the edge. She fell out of love with me after that. I'd do anything in the world to change it, and I've tried my hardest and promised her that it would change but unfortunately it's just too late.

A month later, she's moving on. She has found someone else that is making her happy the way I should've. They aren't together and she swears to me that she just wants to be single and be happy by herself, and I can respect that. But I can see where it's going. They do things that we used to do. She is happy around him. I don't know him, don't know what he looks like, or anything about him. What I do know is that he will never love her the way I do. He will never care about her the way I do, he will never want to give her the world or worry that she's okay... She will just get hurt, and I can't do anything about it because I blew my chance. 

I know that it's pathetic to be like this over a girlfriend, but I promise that she was much more to me than that. She was my first real love. 15 years of relationships and I had found my one. My twin flame. 

Back to now, I've had 3 trucks, 4 cars, and 1 semi pass by. My pistol has been sitting in my lap since I parked here. It's probably been about 45 minutes by now. I know I have things to live for, but everything seems meaningless now knowing that I've lost her. I do not enjoy any of my hobbies. She is on my mind all the time. I think about her all day and dream about her all night. When I see my little girl, her face lights up and the first thing she asks is where her stepmomma is. I've gone through a lot in my life, but this is the hardest thing by a long fucking shot and I'm off the deep end. She is the only thing that's ever been able to quiet my demons and put my soul at ease. And she knows this. Even now she is texting me. She has no idea that I came out here with a partial intention to blow my brains out. I figured I'd see how I feel when I got here and go from that. 

I have plenty of friends and family to talk to about this, but no matter what I do I always feel alone. I am lost. My purpose has been stolen from me and I can't carry on anymore. When I wake up every day, my first thought is anger, because I didn't die in my sleep. Call me selfish. Call me pathetic. But honestly I wish I had the fucking balls to pull the trigger. 

If you love someone, you never fucking let go.
