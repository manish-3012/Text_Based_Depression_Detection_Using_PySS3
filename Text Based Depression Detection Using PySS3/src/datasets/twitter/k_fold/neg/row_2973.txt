dont know where to turntitle says it all. i feel awful, closer and closer to suicide every day. i feel like if i say my feelings to someone, i can start to get better, but i dont know where to turn. hence why im posting here. 

i have no real relationships, my family doesnt care about me, and the only thing keeping me here is my job. im not even 18 and i feel like im drowning in negativity and self-hatred. 

i thought i was happy. but im not, and itâ€™s my fault. ive secluded myself so people only use me to get substances or give them physical company because theyre SOâ€™s are far away. no one wants me past that, though. 

i have no inspiration to do anything anymore. painting, being bubbly and nice, continuing on my recovery... even my job, which i love more than anything, gives me so much anxiety. 

i ruined tonight for my family. we were gonna have sâ€™mores and a good time, but my younger brother made me mad, we argued, and i drove to a park nearby to calm down. my mom didnt know where i went, neither did her girlfriend, or my brother. i was gone for an hour and a half. no one called or texted to ask where i was or if i was ok. 

i didnt leave because i wanted to get those worried calls and texts, but after sitting at that park for an hour and a half i was like... why havent i gotten them?! does no one care!? and i realized that no one cares. at all. when i got home, no one even said anything to me. i have â€œfriendsâ€ that use me, a family that doesnt care, and my whole optimistic nihilism philosophy is hard when i dont seem to be enjoyed by people im around. 

i dont have a plan to kill myself. i really dont even know if this sub is for this kinda stuff, i just searched â€œsuicideâ€ for a place to put my thoughts. I JUST HAVE AN OVERWHELMING FEEING OF DOOM AND ANXIETY, A DIMINISHING FEELING OF BEING SECURE IN MYSELF AND MY RELATIONSHIPS, AND LESS AND LESS SPIRIT TO CONTINUE ON WITH MY LIFE. and i just needed somewhere to talk without being judged by people i know or sent to a mental hospital. i dont need replies or votes or anything. just to say it. thanks for reading this if you do.
