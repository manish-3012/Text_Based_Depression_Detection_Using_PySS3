Life scares me. My long and boring story.Apologies in advance if there was somewhere better for this or anything.

Today was a tough day. For a long time I have felt very different from everyone else, everyone just seems to get it. The world scares me and I made too many mistakes in my life by giving into my fear. I feel like I am 5 years behind where I should be. I am almost 23 and I haven't had a real job because when I was in school and I should've been bagging groceries or working at mcdonalds I was petrified of people so I didn't try. Now when I do try I have nothing to back me up.

Growing up I was a very gifted kid, I thought it might be my thing. I was kinda fat, wasn't good with people, I felt like being good at school was all I had. As the years went on everyone else caught up, I wasn't trying as hard, I got scared and I gave up. By the time I finished high school I was being plagued by the question "what do you what to be". I didn't know. I still don't know. I could never imagine a future with me in it. I envied those who dreamed of being doctors or pilots or garbage men. Anything! I was just lost.

At the time I thought "follow your heart" philosophy and thought that since I kind of enjoyed languages, I should pursue them somehow. In retrospect I should have gone for something more safe like accounting. At the time I thought I'd rather struggle than do something I hated.

After 3 years doing a useless degree with very mediocre marks I graduated with nothing. After highschool I knew that the next step was university, after university it was all back on me, and I had no idea. That was 2 years ago and I still haven't moved on. 

I would have periods of enthusiams where I would apply for anything and everything. Most of the time I would not hear back at all, occasionally I would get an interview, out awkward myself and never hear back. So the periods of dejection and giving up would happen for a few weeks, and the cycle continued.

In that time my parents got divorced and living with my mother has become a real burden. I am making life really difficult for her because she has to rent a house she can't afford. Occasionally I get one day type jobs that keep things going but theres no stability.

I've watched my friends become too busy for me. They have their own lives and I am wasting away. I saw the "loser" of my group of friends at the supermarket and he has become successful. I know its terrible admitting it but I used to feel better than him, now I am the new him.

So this brings us to today. My mum and dad ambush me and say how hard I make it for them. How much they worry about me. They stay awake at night worried I will end up on the streets. My dad pretty much asked me if I was on drugs (I'm not) or molested as a kid (I wasn't). That's how bad I seem to them.

I've never gotten to the point of seriously contemplating suicide. Early on I would fantasize about how everyone would react when I was gone. Then it would become thinking about how I do it, but never actually considering it. Lately I've been noticing a trend. When I cross the street, part of me hopes a car will come speeding down the road and knock me down. I have the sudden urge to jerk the steering wheel into a wall when I'm driving. It's getting more and more pervasive into my mind and that concerns me afterwards.

So that's me. Lonely, unmotivated, no future, unskilled, (practically) uneducated with things getting harder every week.

I'm scared. Everything scares me and I just feel like I haven't got what it takes to live in this world, and I'm scared for the future.

I'm sorry for the word vomit. Its too hard to talk to anyone I know, I feel like noone understands, everyone has their own problems that make me feel guilty. Writing a block here got my head a bit clearer and my stomach less knotty for now until it comes back.
