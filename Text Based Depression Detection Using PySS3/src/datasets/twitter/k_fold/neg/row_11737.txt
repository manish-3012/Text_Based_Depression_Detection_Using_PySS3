I'm probably going to kill myself in a couple of weeksSo I've recently quit doing drugs and i have never been more depressed i can't get out of bed unless I'm forced to and right now i either bearly eat or eat to much, I'm constantly trying to drown myself cause right now it feels like every bone in my body is aching for no reason at all and it's not helping that most of the people around me call my by the wrong pronouns or my deadname when they know everytime i hear it hurts me.
