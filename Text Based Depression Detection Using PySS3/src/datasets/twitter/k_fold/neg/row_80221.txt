Telling loved ones ahead of timeI'm fairly certain I'm going to kill myself this year. The details don't matter much, but I am still concerned about the pain this will cause my family.

I'm thinking of doing something that may be kind of crazy - I want to try and calmly sit my close family down and tell them that I'm going to kill myself in the near future. I feel like this might help to avoid the feelings of shock and disbelief that seem to come along with this sort of thing. Of course, I'm not naive in thinking this will make things super easy for them, but if I can alleviate a little bit of their suffering, I think it would be worthwhile.

I'm open to hearing anyone's thoughts on this idea, or if you have had similar plans. Thanks.
