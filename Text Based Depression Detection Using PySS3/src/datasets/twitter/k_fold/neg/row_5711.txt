I can't do this anymore.I honestly wont be surprised if this gets ignored like my post on r/
depression, but I'm 16 years old going on 17 on December 10th. I still haven't had my first kiss or even my first real girlfriend. I have had 2 girlfriends in the past, but I was used so the girls could "get some experiance" and "get over my ex." Those are the actual words they saod to me. I constantly feel alone and unloved. I just feel like I will never be happy. I'm in a partial program, but I just don't see the point in it. I can't take being alone, chewed up and spit out, and stuck inside my own brain only to rot to a heartless cunt. Our lives are nothing but time bombs waiting to go off, why not set mine off a little early?
