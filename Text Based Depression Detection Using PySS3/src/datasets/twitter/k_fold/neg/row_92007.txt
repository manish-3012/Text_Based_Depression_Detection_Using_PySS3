A little bit of help would be appreciatedI imagine killing myself, writing my last words... I want to die.

I got into a fight with my parents, especially my mom, because I'm so confused over my identity. I FUCKING DON'T KNOW WHO I AM. AM I A GIRL, AM I A BOY? I DON'T KNOW JUST LEAVE ME ALONE LET ME FIGURE IT OUT STOP TRYING TO FORCE ME INTO DOING SOMETHING I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH. IT MAKES ME WANNA KILL MYSELF EVEN MORE.

I'm so confused. All I ask from her is to stop bringing it up. I'll be going to uni and she just makes it so worse than it will be. I don't think I'll get beaten up by strangers just because I like to dress in a certain way, and if people make fun of me, fuck them, I'm used to it.

I know I shouldn't be thinking about suicide, but it makes me feel so much worse when all I hear is be like this, don't be like that because you're a disgrace to our family. What would x think?! FUCK X FUCK U FUCK ME FUCK IT
