I dropped out of school this week.My friends are talking about colleges. I said I didn't expect to live to 25 because I recently dropped out of school and didn't really know how to explain it to anyone. They casted me away. I never had more than these 4 friends, and we were all strange, but we were strange together. I feel like I'm dead weight to the world, and aside from my extremely low self esteem and chronic reoccurring nightmares I no longer could talk to an instructor without going home and dwelling on it alone for hours. So yes I'm a failure in life, never going to be able to make enough money to have my own place or make a mark on the world. I'm working to keep myself an alive failure, even if my existence is insubstantial and a finantial and physical nuisance to my family. What's the point of living surrounded by people who will look down on you for your lacking education and finantial ability? What's the point of leeching off my family until the pass away and I am truely alone, only to end it then. I was 12 years old when I made a big scar on my left arm, and ever since my life has only gone downhill. Whats my purpose when I can't make friends, ever have a relationship, or have a reasonable conversation with a stranger? What's my purpose when I can't do as much as read a book without the overwhelming dread of never being happy. Is it weird that I sincerely hope there is a hell so I can burn in it, and am comforted by the thought that no one cares about me?
