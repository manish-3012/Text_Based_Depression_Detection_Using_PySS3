I have a plan but I'm afraid to fail.did anyone here went through this? how is it like to fail an attempt? I don't think I can handle the consequences in case I don't succeed. I came close to it many times but always chicken out due to not enough planning and the high risk of failing. I've made a good research this time and it seems like it'd probably go as planned. but what if it doesn't? 

I'm not sure this kind of content is aloud, so just in case, I'm sorry for any trouble I might cause. 
Thanks.
