From bad to worse, I just want it to end.Covid caused my (19M) mom (55) to lose her job as a teacher, dad has never recovered from a spinal operation 7 years ago and hasn't had a job since. 

Been begging the landlords to let us extend our tenancy each month while they harass us to move out for richer tenants.

My mom's been going everywhere and asking everyone she knows for favors but nobody helps. We barely haven enough money for 10 days of food, 
All of our loans and mortgages are piling up to absurd levels and today our electricity and gas was cut, so we ate cold leftovers in the dark and went to sleep. 

I am in enrolled in college to be a paramedic but since my tuition hasn't been paid they may kick me out despite my pleas for leniency. 

Currently, in bed, feeling a weight on my chest growing and I can't really feel anything anymore. Like it's all a dream. 

Just want it all to end.
