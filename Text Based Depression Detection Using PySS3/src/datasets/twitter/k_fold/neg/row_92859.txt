This Is Where I Leave Them ThenI will kill myself in time.
I sought help and it didn't help me. I have been through ten agonizing years while receiving help from anywhere and everywhere and anyone. I'm still suffering even after all the help I have received.
Does it mean then that I can't be helped?
Everyone says that if you feel like dying you should seek help.
I sought help and nothing has changed.
I'm going nowhere.
My pain is here to stay.
So what is even the point anymore?
What is the point of living a life without pleasure?
That's what I've been staying alive for, waiting for pleasure, and I've come to realize it will never come. Not for me.
I want to stop all human contact and lie in the dirt in the middle of nowhere and wait for my body to waste away.
Sure my family will fall apart, and sure my mother will lose another child to suicide, but it is my fate.
And I refuse to stay alive simply for the comfort of other people. Call it selfish as you may, but I will not.
