i'm in paini went through suicide attempt, self harm, nearly a heart attack, I live in coonstant fear and anxiety and fear for literal years. I had professional help, didn't make a change. I had meds, didn't work. I had help from my close one, didn't help either. I just feel like im loosing my sanity. I burst into rage again, after a "calm" year, hurting myself in the process, almost breaking my phone, and multiple things in house. I can't hold it anymore, it's just a matter of time when my heart breaks again, or I'll do it faster myself. I don't know what made me like this, but after pretending most of my life, living in pain, daydreaming about death everyday, i don't know if its even worth it anymore
