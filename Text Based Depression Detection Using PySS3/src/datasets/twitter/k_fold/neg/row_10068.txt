Got laid off and ready to wrap things upThe thought of dying and leaving all of this bullshit behind makes me happy. The only thing that would make me happier is having a date in mind when i plan to end this life. That would be like a giant weight off my shoulders. 

I'm currently contemplating how i want to go about it. Its a process but i'm thinking cyanide or gun. Those two are the quickest ways to go as far as i know. Guillotine would be ideal but i dunno where the fuck to get one of those or how to make one. 

Im just done with life y'all. I have no will to try anymore. I've worked hard, i've paid my dues, never asked for a handout, and life just continues to fuck me over. 

Best case scenario if i stick around is i get old, live for years in pain, and then die, alone. I dont see any point in continuing to work my ass off and trying to be a good slave if thats what i have to look forward to. I'm fucking done. 

As soon as i decide how i'm gonna do this shit i'm marking the date down on my calendar. Killing whatever time and money i have left doing what i wanna do, and saying toodles to you poodles. No note, no nothing. Fuck the world.
