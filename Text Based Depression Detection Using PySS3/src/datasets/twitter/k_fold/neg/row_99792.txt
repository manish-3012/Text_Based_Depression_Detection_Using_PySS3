All I want to do is cut20F. 

For a lot of reasons, I'm no longer happy and while and healed like I had been for a while. Basically, I tried too hard to help someone and they just used it to make me the villain and no one really agreed with her I don't think, but it still worked somehow. 

I don't think anyone cares at all. 

I thought I had friends, the good kind, the kind that you've been through hell with. But I can't find them now. 

Everyone always tells you to "reach out" and to ask for help. Hell, I told people that. It's not that simple. I *am* reaching out. I *am* asking for help. No one is answering. 

I didn't even post in subs like this when it started because I thought my best friend and roommate still creeped around on my reddit account and would see and be worried, but now I don't think anyone sees what I post and I don't think anyone would do something if they did see. 

I have razors in my jewelry box and the only thing in the world I want to do is cut. I haven't in almost two years but all I want to do is cut. 

I don't know if I'm suicidal again yet. It's been *years*. But I think im getting there. 

I hope when my roommate gets home he'll sit and keep me company here in the living room for a while, but he'll probably just go talk to his boyfriend and then they'll go to bed. 

I don't blame my friends for abandoning me. I just don't know what to do. 

What do I do?

I just want to fall apart but there's no one to put me together. 

I thought I had people. I don't. 

If I go to my room I think I'm going to cut again. 

Please fucking help me.
