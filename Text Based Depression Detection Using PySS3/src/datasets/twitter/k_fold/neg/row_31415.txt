Is there any real reason to keep going?I really don't know why I'm still here. There's absolutely no reason for me to still be here. Suicide is literally the only and best solution to my problems. And I've got zero reasons to keep going, yet I, for some reason, am still desperately searching for one. So, is there anything, non-personal then, to keep going for?
