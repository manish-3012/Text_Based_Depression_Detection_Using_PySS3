my aunt and uncle kicked me out of their house because iâ€™m suicidal.so a bit of a backstory (not too much but enough to understand the situation)  iâ€™m 17. iâ€™ve been hospitalized multiple times for suicidal thoughts and iâ€™ve been on over a dozen different medications to try and suppress these thoughts. a few months ago i got taken off medication to get a baseline on my mental health. i had no choice but to move in with my uncle and aunt (as my parents were not financially or mentally well enough to care for me anymore) and i stayed with my them for 3 months. i assumed they knew about my mental health issues, as at first i was diagnosed with manic depressive disorder and then bipolar depressive disorder a while ago and they were notified, my uncle even made medication suggestions as bipolar disorder runs in our family, and my uncle left me notes when i was in the mental hospital. i think it was only common sense to assume they knew what they were taking in. even a few weeks after i moved in with them, i told them i want to go back on medication because i was starting to feel depressed again. they blew me off and told me i donâ€™t need it.

recently iâ€™ve been very depressed. extremely suicidal and unmotivated. it didnâ€™t help when my uncle began to criticize me for it, insulting me and yelling at me to the point where i broke into tears. sunday night i cut myself. deeper and more than i have before. i used it as punishment. 

the next day i went to therapy, and i told my therapist iâ€™ve been feeling depressed. she dug a little, and got me to tell her how i hurt myself and where. she called my uncle, and when i got home from therapy, my uncle and aunt immediately dragged me into a private room and tore into me. 

they rarely even give me a chance to talk. when they did, they screamed â€œdo you understand?!â€ and it made me feel horrible. they said things like â€œwe canâ€™t have this kind of liability on our hands.â€ and â€œwe canâ€™t have someone like you around our childrenâ€ and â€œi was never like this when i was a teenager. youâ€™re faking it for attentionâ€ and many other things i tried to block out. they told me to pack my things, because i had to leave. they watched me like a hawk for the next half an hour while i packed, even staring at me with numb eyes as i had a mental breakdown and fell onto the floor weeping. so, not even two hours after i got home from therapy, my stuff was in the car and they were driving me to my grandmothers house. 

i donâ€™t think i can ever trust them again. i donâ€™t think i can ever look them in the eyes again. i trusted them to help me, and i feel so betrayed, hurt, and i feel like an object to take care of instead of a human being who just needs some compassion. if anything, going through that made me even more suicidal than i already was. i just feel so worthless.
