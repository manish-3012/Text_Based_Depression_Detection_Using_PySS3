Still here but looking for an exitLong story, sorry. I'm 45m, divorced, full custody of my 14yo twin daughters and I'm a complete mess.  As my throwaway name says, I totally, completely suck at life.  Growing up I had a lot of advantages and still managed to fuck everything up.  Nearly flunked out of college for smoking too much weed, then had a bit of a cocaine problem in my 20's. I made a lot of money when I was younger but blew through all of it (pun intended).  I stopped doing coke when I turned 30 and weed a couple years ago but I still have a few beers with coworkers every week, nothing excessive though. Substance abuse is not my problem anymore, hasn't been for a while. My problems are financial and emotional.

I let my ex walk all over me, financially, in the divorce two years ago (my kids are from previous relationship).  It put a severe strain on me, I'm accruing more debt every month.  Credit cards are maxed out and I'm living paycheck to paycheck, dodging collections calls.  I know that without any help this month something serious is going to happen.  My kids are a total mess, both are in therapy for major depression and anxiety and I feel like that's all my fault...like I somehow infected them with my negativity and depression.  One was admitted to a clinical psych facility for a week last year for cutting and suicidal ideation.  The other has debilitating panic attacks. They're both on psych meds and they each have a physical handicap since birth - one has birth defect of her left hand and the other has cp.  Several times a month I have to pick one of them up from school because they're cutting or having a panic attack or making a suicide plan.  It's overwhelming.  I break down crying or have a minor panic attack whenever I have a moment to myself.  In the past I prided myself for being their rock, always the consistent one to take care of everything, but that's not me anymore...that guy is long gone.  I'm a shell of that person now but I'm good at faking it so nobody has a clue.  My kids just think I'm a mean asshole, they don't know how fucking depressed I am.  It pains me that I can't even provide simple things for them because I can't afford it.

I hate myself every single day, intensely.  The stress of all the debt I accrued is unbearable.  I hate everything about myself and everything in my life except my kids and my job - work is the only thing that can occupy my day and keep my obsessive thoughts at bay. But my kids hate me, my parents and my brother would be severely disappointed in me if they knew the truth about how poorly I've managed things lately.  I lied to my parents about the terms of my divorce and so much more.  So many lies. There have always been high expectations on me. My dad left a long shadow. I have nobody I can talk to about any of this and I can't shut my damn brain up. I constantly beat myself up all the time. I'm tired and I want to get off this ride.  I've tried meditation, I've tried therapy too but they just want to put me on meds and one even suggested I should spend a week or two in a behavioral facility lol.  With what money? Who's going to watch my kids while I do that? I wouldn't have a job by the time I got out and things would just be worse.

One of my friends committed suicide last summer and ever since then I've been unable to do anything but the basics.  I don't open my bills, I don't return calls, I've just been letting everything pile up higher and higher.  The weight is immense.  I don't see a future for myself that isn't full of pain and misery and loneliness.  I'm going to end up losing my home, my kids, and ultimately all the upheaval will cost me my job.  My girls would definitely be better off without me.  They could live with their mom in California, which they've both told me would be much preferable than living with me anyway. My girls are leaving next Saturday to visit their mom for a month and it feels like the perfect time.  I've written a couple apology letters to the few people that would care.  I'm scared and anxious but also kind of excited at the prospect that my misery will finally be over through one simple act.

I don't know why I wrote all of this and I kinda feel like I should delete it
