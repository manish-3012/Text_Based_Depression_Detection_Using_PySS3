I suck at driving and my drivers instructor is impatient &amp; disrespectful about it.I just started to take driving lessons with a drivers instruc1tor through an agency that's called "assistive driving services" so they are suppose to be patient and understanding. He is judgemental, has a loud voice, and is impatient. He says things like "this is not rock science or even calculus, I showed you this yesterday, I wasted 3 hours with you yesterday, you don't have good cordination, and you never played basketball did you?" I have bad habit of looking down on the pedals when I push them or not looking in the direction that I am turning because he is sitting in the passenger seat and don't like looking at him. I hate myself so much and am probably of little worth to my drivers instructor. I want to learn how to drive and be able to get my license so I can move and become independent. 

Am I really that stupid for sucking at driving? I would rather just kill myself than going through so much to get my drivers license. I know it's normal to suck at driving at first but I can't stand him yelling at me and he acts like I should know certain things right away.
