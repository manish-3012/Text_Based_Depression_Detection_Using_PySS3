I might kill myself because of this pandemic Iâ€™m going insane.
I feel as though this well never be over. I predict that this wonâ€™t end until 2022. Our country has it the worse and is full if selfish idiots who canâ€™t do as much as wear a mask. I hate this. And Iâ€™m having trouble at school because of how difficult it is to learn online. Iâ€™m more used to writing things down not typing on a computer. Writing things down and seeing the notes in person is my way to learn. But now thatâ€™s gone forever Iâ€™m doing terribly at school. I hate it I hate it I hate it. Iâ€™m very obsessed with school as well. I always want to do my best but now thatâ€™s impossible. Another thing as a result of the pandemic is I canâ€™t see my bf or friends. They make me happy. Texting them or calling them isnâ€™t the same. I want to see them in the flesh. But no, thatâ€™s impossible. I hate this. Please kill me.
