I have a meeting with my RA today... what do I say? (x-post from /r/depression)So here's the brief story. Last night I was feeling unnaturally suicidal. I got as far as pills lined up on my desk. It wouldn't have taken much for me to start taking them. The first is always the hardest. I messaged a friend but she never responded. Still hasn't.


Anyways, before I did something stupid I forced myself out of my apartment and down the hall to my Resident Adviser's room. I knocked, 100 percent prepared for when she opened the door to tell her to call the police on me, because if I went back to my room I was going to swallow a lot of pills.


Well, her apartmentmate answered, and she wasn't there. Shit. So I went for a walk in the rain to calm myself down instead of calling the cops on myself which maybe I should have done. After a long while I manged to go back to my apartment and put away the pills and get a decent nights sleep. Before I went to bed though I messaged my RA on Facebook saying that I tried to reach her earlier and would like to set up a meeting for today.


Question is now...what do I say to her? Do I tell her the whole truth about last night, the fact that I was going to have her call the cops, suicidal thoughts and all, etc? I'm not sure. I feel she'll have to report it to her boss which I don't mind. I'm just not sure how much she can really do for me.


Thanks for reading.
