Desperate to dieI'm alone almost all the time.
I can't stand to be around people anymore.
I barely leave the house.
I can't control my emotions.
I can't control my addictions.
I've been delusional my whole life.
I've never had a real job.
I'm almost 40.

I tried to volunteer for a three years.
Stress caused recurring psychosis.
Hospitalized. Treated like an animal.
Came home clean and desperate to live.
Couldn't deal with people.
Antipsychotics helped but not enough.
Couldn't keep from screaming.
Family moved out.
Been alone here for months.
See mom for a few min a day.
All I do is read and chain smoke.
Afraid to exercise because it can trigger me.
Can't volunteer anymore.
Isolation is agony.
Desperate to die.
