i miss my momi havenâ€™t been home in over two years. i want to go the beach at lake michigan at sunrise. i want to hike the appalachian trail. i want to get fluent in spanish and keep practicing the guitar. i want to go back to school and get a job i actually like and buy a house and a car. i want to date again and make friends and go to concerts and travel. i want to wake up to my cat everyday and i really donâ€™t want to leave him. thereâ€™s so many things iâ€™ll never do and iâ€™m so sad but i canâ€™t wait anymore. iâ€™m so so tired. i hate my job and i donâ€™t want to work. thereâ€™s no other job iâ€™m qualified for that would be any better. money is so fucking dumb im so over it i just canâ€™t handle working and living this monotonous life i hate myself so much
