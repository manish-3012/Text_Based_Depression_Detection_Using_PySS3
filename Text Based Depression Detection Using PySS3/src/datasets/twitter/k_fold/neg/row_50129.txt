I can't do this anymore.I'm scared. Scared because after years of depression I'm actually going to kill myself instead of just considering it. Every single day has been a battle to not commit suicide and I'm about to lose that battle. Everything is wrong. Every aspect of my life represents failure. I quit school almost a year ago because of my anxiety and depression. I quit my best friend about 3 months ago for no reason. Just completely ignored her until she quit trying to contact me. My parents hate me and consistently say I'm a failure and a disappointment. But...I found this girl. This wonderful amazing woman who made me happy. We love each other. But I lied to her about something in my past and she can't look past it. I begged and begged but nothing. I can't live on anymore. My heart hurts too much. I'm seeking peace from the pain now.
