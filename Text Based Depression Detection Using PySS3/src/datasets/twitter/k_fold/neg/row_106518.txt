I feel like I'm in so much pain that I'm being pushed to the edgeI just finished my freshman year of college and it was so terrible... no friends no matter how much I tried, and I was so lonely that I almost committed suicide during second semester. My twin sister (who I've always felt inferior to) had an amazing first year at college and she's been having her college friends over to our house and it's all been shoved in my face that she has all these friends and I don't. She also goes to a prestigious university that I didn't get into. When we went to pick her up from college I saw her saying goodbye to all her friends and it made me so angry that no matter how hard I tried to make friends like that I couldn't. I started feeling suicidal then and took my mom outside and told her I was feeling suicidal again (which is by no means new for me). 
I'm home for the summer and taking community college classes and working two jobs to keep myself busy. I'm spending time doing things I enjoy like reading and running half marathons, and cooking and having people over for dinner and seeing friends and people from home... but I feel like none of it is even worth it. I'm so alone and everything just makes me feel alone at the end of the day. Nothing I'm doing now is even worth it in the long run.
I've spent some time with my boyfriend of 3.5 years (we did long distance this first year and it went alright). I don't think he loves me anymore and I think he's going to break up with me. We had a bad fight tonight in which I was basically an asshole to him even though all I was trying to do was speak my feelings and be open. It all just came out so badly and he's in a bad time in his life and has been dealing with family crises and all I did was be a bitch to him. I feel like he and everyone else and the rest of my family would be so much better without me. 
The shameful truth is that I could see myself committing suicide if he were to leave me and I don't even want to think about that right now. I don't think he's talking to me anymore tonight and I've been feeling really sick ever since our argument began (after I realized that me trying to speak my feelings really came across as me attacking him). I just took my daily antidepressant with some tea but I feel like I'm going to just puke it up. I wish I could get drunk and be able to go to sleep and not even think about any of this but the nightmare will resume again once I wake up tomorrow and face the consequences of what I did. My life is going to be a nightmare. I don't feel like I can live in any of this pain anymore and I feel like it's only going to get worse.
I know if I kill myself it will cause pain to my immediate family, because they really do love me and I don't even want to think about what it will do to them. But I don't feel like I can do any of this anymore and I just want to escape all of this pain. I'm not going to do anything tonight but I'm really strongly considering it. I almost want to check myself into the hospital tomorrow just to be stabilized or put on stronger medications, or even just feel like I'm in good hands. I know my family will get angry at me and judge me but I don't even think any of them understand it. None of them understand me, even though they love me. 
I just want to die peacefully so I don't have to live like this anymore, and I don't think my life is ever going to get any better. I'm laying on my couch feeling like I'm going to throw up and I can't stop crying, and for some reason I'm listening to Blackbird by The Beatles on repeat.

I'm sorry this turned into such a long wall of text, I think I just wanted to talk. I think I need to either get help or take action but I don't want to be conscious right now. I'm not going to hurt myself tonight or immediately though.
