Always dreamt of being a father. Just got told Iâ€™m infertileThe last nail in the coffin really. My life is really shit, failed college twice, losing friends, dad died last Christmas, constant anxiety and verbal abuse from mum. My only motivation in life was the chance, though unlikely, of having children and now Iâ€™m told that i am unable to have kids of my own. Whats the point? Eventually pass college with a miracle and work a wage slave job for years. I donâ€™t know whats stopping me from just jumping in the river. Fuck me
