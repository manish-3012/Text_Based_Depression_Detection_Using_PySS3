â€œPlayingâ€ with deathFor a while now Iâ€™ve been suicidal, or thoughts have become increasingly overwhelming, and at one point I went to hospital for an overdose attempt. Recently, Iâ€™ve noticed I walk into roads with thoughts like â€œIâ€™m going to cross this road without stopping, just looking ahead, and if I get run over then hopefully that ends it all and if I donâ€™t then Im somewhat â€˜luckyâ€™â€. My therapist told me this mindset was a little like playing Russian roulette. Am I selfish for playing with death? Suicide and an end to pain is something I long for, and in a way itâ€™d be a method for me to have control over one thing in my life, since Iâ€™m selfless in every other respect and try to do things for other, or with others in mind. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m going to end things soon or not.

At the same time, part of me knows there are things to live for but I just canâ€™t help wanting to cut my life short. Iâ€™m exhausted of the whole therapist thing, Iâ€™ve seen over 6-7, pretty much lost count. Been prescribed Lexapro, Prozac, Seroquel, and at this point, more medication seems pointless. If professional after professional tries, and still cannot help me, whoâ€™s to say anyone else will? I donâ€™t see change happening in my life anytime soon, all I can do is sit here and watch everything go by, while I suffer, and try to fix other peoples problems instead of my own.
