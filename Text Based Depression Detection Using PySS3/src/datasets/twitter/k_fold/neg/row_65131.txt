I cant tell if Iâ€™m suicidalI donâ€™t have any plans to commit suicide because my anxiety is too awful. I donâ€™t necessarily feel depressed (except Iâ€™ve suffered from it greatly &amp; I can easily slip back into it if something triggers me. Yet, I still feel like when something upsets me I resort back to this idea that I donâ€™t belong here and I just would rather be dead. Also, a lot of people find it concerning that I view those whoâ€™ve died from suicide as brave. I just think that they were able to do what Iâ€™ve always wanted to do but couldnâ€™t (even when Iâ€™m not actively thinking about suicide). I know thatâ€™s fucked up but at the same time I just think If they felt they needed to leave then I am happy they are in a better place. And I just hate when people tell you itâ€™ll get better because suicidal people know that but they obviously didnâ€™t have what was in them to get better. But yeah, I really canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m suicidal and I donâ€™t throw it around because Iâ€™m unsure and itâ€™s pretty personal anyways.
