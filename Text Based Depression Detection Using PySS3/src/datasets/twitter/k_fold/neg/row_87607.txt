Iâ€™m readyI just moved to a small town in North Carolina and Iâ€™m fucking done. In my last town I was out to everyone but my family. (Iâ€™m a lesbian) in this one I canâ€™t even think about coming out to anyone. I lived in a beautiful area of San Fransisco with pride parades and acceptance. Now I live in a place where they have â€œgod hates fagsâ€ posters plastered on buildings downtown. I have a full bottle of adult strength advil beside me. Iâ€™m 14 and 73 pounds. Iâ€™m ready to die. Just wanted someone to know why.
