I'd take instant peaceful death over 1 billion dollars, a beautiful girlfriend that loves me unconditionally, caring friends and the next 100 things that everyone dreams of.First off, we lost dad in a medical accident, which devastated my mom, who I love and I'm thankful for what she's done for me, and my death would be a fatal blow to her, so I can't end it until she dies. Second, I'm a fucking coward so I'll never be able to actually pull it off. So here I am, daydreaming about peaceful death, which is all I want. But someday I will die for sure and thinking about it makes me calm a little bit. Until the day the flame of life goes off, we all suffer, but fortunately it won't last forever. In short, fuck my life. Just needed to vent and sorry for the shit post.
