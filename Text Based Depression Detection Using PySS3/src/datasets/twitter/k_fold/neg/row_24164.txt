A mod at body acceptance has been bullying me for my body type and my sex. I'm doneThis was supposed to be a place I was accepted.  Instead a mod banned me for hating my own genitals and body type and sent me a ton of hate for explaining that I'm intersex. I just don't think my only clothing options should be very few online options or clothing made for drag queens. It hit me a lot harder than the crap I deal with in person. I thought it was a body acceptance.  But its only for one body type. I've never told people I'm intersex and posted about the body acceptance mods harassment and how I needed to talk with someone to better understand.  I got downvoted.  So.  My body is a freak. I am a freak.  I don't deserve to be here. 8m not asking for a watch. It's already done.  But it'll take a few days to find me.  Its better this way. I just had to tell someone because I honestly have no one that knows this about me.
