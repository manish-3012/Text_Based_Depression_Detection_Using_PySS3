I don't wanna fail!High school is rough af, I always said I'd be able to fight through it... but I can't. I have a 2.7gpa and I'm failing trigonometry. With this is it even worth saying I'll live a nice life. I've been struggling with depression for a while and that's fucked me over. I promised myself if I fail this math test I took today I'm going to try and pass out from the Percocet I have left over from surgery and let myself just pass out into the lake so I drown. Should I leave a note to my family, should I say where I went or should i disappear like the little shit I am and hope no one finds me
