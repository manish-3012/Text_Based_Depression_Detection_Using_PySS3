The hotline didnâ€™t help much.Itâ€™s been 9 years since my attempt. 9 years of planning, procrastinating, and doing the best I can to justify waiting another day. 9 years of people telling me how it gets better. 

Iâ€™ve had enough, I think. Iâ€™m absolutely trapped in a situation that is completely detrimental to whatâ€™s left of my mental health. Iâ€™m far from â€œhomeâ€ with no way to get back, and nowhere to go back to. I have nothing, and I canâ€™t trust anyone. I tried to call the helpline tonight &amp; while I appreciate having someone to talk to about things, the resources provided arenâ€™t at all what I was looking for. They were just doing their job, though. I wasnâ€™t expecting a miracle. I donâ€™t know what I was expecting. 

I donâ€™t know what else to do.
