The future is bleakI honestly don't see what I have to live for. I'm 16 years old, I'm ugly, I'm awkward, I'm extremely shy and rejection sensitive. The chance of my getting married is next to zero. all my peers take it as a given. I can't be happy without that, don't try to tell me that "there's more to life than relationships". That's true, but it's like saying there's more to a car than the wheels. A car without wheels is a car not worth having, and a lonely life is a life not worth living. I want to kill myself whenever I see a pretty girl, on the street, in a store. I just think about how nobody like her will ever want me. Why should I live through sixty more years of this misery.
