Hello. I think I'm going to hurt myself.I was here awhile ago talking about how I wanted to hurt myself. It didn't escalate too far. This time it's getting more real.

I've actually found a decent knife and I'm actively looking for a knife sharpener and like a lighter to kill the bacteria.

I don't think anybody browses the subreddit this late at night but hopefully someone is out there and can talk me out of this.

EDIT: On a side note, I really do think I'm going to hurt myself but I don't know what the best way to disinfect my knife is. I don't want my cuts to get infected.
