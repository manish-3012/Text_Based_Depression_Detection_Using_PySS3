I don't want to kill myself, but I won't mind if I die. That doesn't mean I'm suicidal, right?I've been having some trouble with sadness, and generally don't caring, and I usually just ignore it. But now I'm thinking that if a car smashed into me, and killed me, I wouldn't really mind. Everywhere I've read, it says the suicidal thoughts are if you plan your suicide. Since I'm not technically doing that, I'm not suicidal right? It's important for me to know, if I'm ever going to tell anyone.
