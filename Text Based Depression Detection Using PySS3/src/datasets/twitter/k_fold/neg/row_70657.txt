I'd like to know what friendship is.I don't know where or how to beginning these words. It's a foreign topic, for the least to me, what it means to have someone in your life. I suppose people or certain people are drawn to each other. What I am about to say I don't say because pity is in my mind. I come from circumstances where I was severely isolated, and in that isolation along what can happen there, you can forget what it is like to be someone. I say it because it's the only thing there is in my story. No fancy things, no joys, just survival. I'd like to know what can be out there, or at least getting to say that I tried to make a difference in my life. Know someone, share our struggles, learn from each other, just being there in the moment. This is a take on hope, no more or less, to know a another side to life.
