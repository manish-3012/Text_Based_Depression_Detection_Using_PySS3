suicide just has become a real option22 years old in 2 months i'll turn 23. I have just flunked college for the th time. And i'm clueless wat to do next. i haven't told anyone and it makes me feel so fucking trapped. They always tell me "i will make it" or "with or without a college degree you will find your way" "you are smart". I don't know why people expect so much from me.  why do they think i'm or will ever be compotent at life. I never let out these emotions because i'm afraid of social repocusions. ironicley enough the social aspect of my life already is a joke, so what could make it worse?
Today i blurted out twice that jokingley should i just end it? i always spin it around so they know i don't mean it, thats the thing they really don't expect me to. But deep down i know that suicide has just become a viable solution. The past few days i have kept thinking about it, i never seemed like a real thing.
My friends i have none that trueley know how feel like because i don't want to be that deppressing person, because some have their own issues or big things happening.
This week i have been programming alot keeping contact to minimum to avoid being suspicious. i ignored my bills. only smoking and drinking coffee. barley eat i've been sleeping alot.
And even if i would find a shitty job i don't think i would keep myself afloat for long. if not today then maby tomorrow if not tomorrow then the day after. and even after writing this i feel so melodramatic imagine i would actually tell someone i know.
