Iâ€™m uncertainFor the past few weeks, my depression has been one of the main things I think about. I often feel lonely, detached, and, of course, suicidal. Iâ€™ve tried to reach out to friends and family for advice but they seemed to just brush it off. I donâ€™t think they understood how serious I was and if they did, I think they just didnâ€™t know how to respond. After I reached out to them, I tried using a suicide hotline but I felt as if I was just talking to myself. I donâ€™t really see a point to anything at the moment. When I seriously begin to think about suicide as an option though, I get scared, not about the afterlife or the consequences of my death, but about the possibility of failure. I donâ€™t really know what I want/need, I suppose it just helps to put my thoughts somewhere else.
