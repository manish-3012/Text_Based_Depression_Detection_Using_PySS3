Feeling insaneBoyfriend makes me feel crazy. Idk if Iâ€™m being irrational or if he is but he always makes me feel like I am. Not sure if the truth anymore but I feel like Iâ€™m in the right most of the time.

This confusion is too much. Idk if im crazy or with someone mentally and emotionally abusive. 

I want to kill myself. Even if Iâ€™m not crazy I still find myself in relationships like this time after time. I feel like no one truly loves me and everyone just walks all over me.

And if I am crazy then all the more reason to kill myself.

Thereâ€™s a constant dreadful feeling of loneliness every second of every day. I just want love and I just want to be treated gently with care. Why canâ€™t I have that ever. I just want someone to understand.

I think about dying so often. Living is so painful for me and always has been. I dream of the day Iâ€™ll finally have the courage to off myself. 

My head hurts from crying. 

We couldnâ€™t even resolve the fight we just had. Whenever that happens I get suicidal because, idk. I love him and I donâ€™t understand why itâ€™s like this. I donâ€™t understand if itâ€™s me or him. He makes me feel like itâ€™s me.

Last time I ran off saying I was going to kill myself he said he canâ€™t deal with it again. So basically if I feel suicidal again heâ€™s going to end it with me. So I canâ€™t even go to him when Iâ€™m feeling this way. I just have to cry alone and hope I fall asleep without hurting myself.

All of the times Iâ€™ve gotten upset to the point of telling him I was going to kill myself just a simple hug or an I love you wouldâ€™ve helped calm me down. I know itâ€™s not good to rely on people but I just do. 


Some people are the only thing keeping me here. Iâ€™m sorry, thatâ€™s not healthy, but itâ€™s true.

I wish someone loved me enough to understand. To stay by me and hold me when Iâ€™m feeling this way. I miss my ex. He would hold me and make me lay down with him and talk me through it. 

I just want to die. I want to go out somewhere in a forest and shoot myself in the head. I want to slit my wrists and just bleed out in my bed high out of my mind so I am at least a bit relaxed when going. I just want to be rid of this pain. I want to be freed of this pain so, so, badly and Iâ€™ve wanted to for so many fucking years. For more than half my life. 

Maybe then people would care. Maybe theyâ€™d finally realize how much pain I was in. But then again itâ€™s not their fault. Theyâ€™re normal. Theyâ€™ve had normal lives. They couldnâ€™t understand if they tried.

I feel horrible for my mom. I donâ€™t want to leave her but I feel there is no other way out. How do I go about this? How do I write notes, how do I get them delivered? How do I make others aware of my death without having to identify my body? What is the most â€œcourteousâ€ (lol) way to kill yourself? I really want to do this. But I want to do it right. 

Iâ€™ve wanted to for so long. Maybe itâ€™s finally time. Maybe I should just get it over with to prevent more suffering. I donâ€™t want to stop myself to only wish I did 10 years later. I feel things will never get better. My brain is a mess and so is my life. I canâ€™t do it anymore.
