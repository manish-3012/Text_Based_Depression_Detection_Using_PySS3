All thats left is hopeI dont know how long ive been depressed, and i dont necessarily want anyone to feel bad for me, there are tons of others who are way worse off than me, yet i still feel it. I feel a desire to let everything go. I dont get joy out of anything anymore. Nothing is fun, i dont really care for anyone, and i dont look forward to anything. I can be happy at times, but the feeling fades as soon as i leave whatever environment i was in. What i see a lot of people say is "someone out there cares". But why should that matter if i dont even care. It doesnt make a difference to me whether or not there is someone out there. Yes, im lonely, and i probably need someone to be with or something, but my situation just doesnt allow for that. All that keeps me going is hope. Hope that something will change, and i will find meaning in life. But until then, i guess im just stuck in this circle of depression.
