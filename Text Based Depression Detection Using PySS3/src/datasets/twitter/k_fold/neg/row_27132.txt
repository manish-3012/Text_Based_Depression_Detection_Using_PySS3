Thinking of trying electro convulsive therapyI've been living in extreme distress for over two years now. Before this bad period I had recovered from 15 years of mdd and cptsd and was living a beautiful and free life but then relspsed due to an extreme trauma and abuse thats has lasted many years. 
Its now been the worst two years of my life and think that I'm all out of other treatment options. 
Had anyone here tried that yet? If not it seems like a great option especially when nothing else has worked or you don't have more time to try 1 million different meds. I'm dying to feel purpose, hope, wonder, and beauty again...
