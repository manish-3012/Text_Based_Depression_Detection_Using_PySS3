I deserve itToday, my best friends parents told me I can never see him again. I was threatened by a patient at a clinic I go to, they told me to get medical care somewhere else if I dont want to start shit. My grandma told me, in tears, about how she wants to be a rock star before she dies. Im in a math class to try to finish up the last half of my GED and im already falling behind. All of my friends are in other states except for my best friend that I cant see now. Meeting him I felt like I was finally getting good karma in my life after all of the shit thats beem thrown at me. But hisnparents think im too much of a loser and a freak. I cant handle this. I was already hanging on by a thread and i just want it to stop.
