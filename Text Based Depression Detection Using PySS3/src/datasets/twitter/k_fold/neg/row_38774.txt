So, my girlfriend attempted to kill herself tonight.It's 1:30 in the morning where I live now. A few hours ago, I went for a shower. When I was done, I found my girlfriend crying with an empty carton of pills next to her on the bed. I immediately called an ambulance. She's in ICU now. I knew she had such thoughts, I begged her to see a therapist or something. I knew she already attempted it last summer, before we met, also with pills.

Fuck, I don't know what to do. She's gonna survive without any lasting damages and all, but this is so fucking up. 

She told me she hast anxiety issues recently. She told me she was always thinking about death and that everyone around her is gonna die at some point that this makes here extremely sad. I knew she was depressed. I just don't know where to go from here.

I'm not blaming her, I don't want to hurt her, but how the hell am I supposed to react? I can't cope with it right now.
