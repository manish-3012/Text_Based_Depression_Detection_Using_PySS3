I don't want to this anymore.- BPD/Persistent Depressive Syndrome. 
- 20+ years of unstable relationships and friendships in which I'm left with one good friend across the ocean and anyone else probs wishes me well, but can't be bothered to say it or anything else for that matter. I have a hard time making friends and becoming close to people, mainly because I don't find people who are interested in wanting to be friends or just that connection/chemistry. In terms of any social circle, I am legit alone, clearly for good reason. 
- 20+ years of suicidal ideation and recently more intense attempts.
- The firm belief that it will always be this way.
- I don't want it to be this way. It's always been this way. The ruins that follow my life are evidence of the sort, also revealing how messed up of a person I am.
- I can't do my job effectively anymore... Or could I even do that? 
- Reaching out is incredibly hard and I justify reasons for not doing so. This was hard to do.
- I can't just be around for other people, my family, my job, when I'm unhappy with how my life is and how it will be. I can't just be around for their sake.

I can't do this anymore.
