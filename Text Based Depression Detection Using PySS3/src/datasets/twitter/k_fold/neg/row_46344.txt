Day One Of Posting An Encouraging or Relatable Poem once a week here until I get better*If I can stop one heart from breaking,*  
*I shall not live in vain;*  
*If I can ease one life the aching,*  
*Or cool one pain,*  
*Or help one fainting robin*  
*Unto his nest again,*  
*I shall not live in vain.*

**- Emily Dickinson**

(PS: not suicidal yet, just shit, yet afraid I will be someday, afraid that once I reach a quite old age it will be my only option. Stay strong folks.)
