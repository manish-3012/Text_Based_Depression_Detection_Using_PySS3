Whatâ€™s your â€œif only. . . â€œ? As in, if only you were x, you wouldnâ€™t be suicidalIf only I had a cute face and hot body like all the guys on Tik Tok :( 

I know it sounds vain and silly but having a pretty face would make the biggest difference in the world to me. Being uglyâ€™s made me have low self-esteem, self-loathing issues, feeling of worthlessness, and a ton of other things that make me not want to live. If only I was attractive, then everything might be different. . .
