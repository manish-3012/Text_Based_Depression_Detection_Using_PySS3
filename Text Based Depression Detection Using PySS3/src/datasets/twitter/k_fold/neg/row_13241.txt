What to do next...I'm 19 years old, I just graduated high school in the spring. I have struggled with depression on and off since 2010. But since spring of 2016 my life has been in a downward spiral. August 2016 I moved out of my parents house, two days before the start of my senior year of high school. I spent all of that school year commuting 1hr plus to school all the while working full time to pay for somewhere I could live. My grades suffered and when the time to apply to colleges came around I was left with one place that would take me, and it was the school I least wanted to attend. I sucked it up the rest of the school year and enrolled in summer courses at said college, but I never attended a single class. I just took advantage of the free counseling for students. The psychologist there diagnosed me with borderline personality and major depressive disorder. I came clean about the diagnosis to my parents, and asked for their help. I deferred my fall admission to the winter to take some time off and get right, but just this morning my parents with two police officers at their sides kicked me out based on fear that I was going to be violent. I have little money left because I spent it to enroll in summer classes, no job, no car, and no place to go. I tried to hang myself earlier today but I couldn't bring myself to fully commit.
