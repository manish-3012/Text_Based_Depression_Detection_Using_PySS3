Afraid exboyfriend will kill himselfMy boyfriend and I were together for seven years. We broke up six months ago, but we've remained in touch far more than we should be for being ex's. He has no family, really only has a couple friends, and I know this breakup is hitting him very hard. He is 32 years old, and he makes a lot of comments saying he has nothing left now with me and my family out of his life. His mom died when he was 5 and his dad was pretty much never a dad to him. He ran away when he was 18. My family became his family and now with this breakup, I know he thinks he has no future and he really doesn't have much of a support system.

He has never made any kind of comments of wanting to kill himself, but he's not that kind of person. If he ever decided he would end it, he would not tell a single soul. I know he's in an extremely dark place, and even though we're not together anymore, I want good things for him. I want him to get through this and come out happier on the other side. I don't know what to do in this situation. I am extremely afraid he will kill himself.
