How do I not think about suicide?I thought everything was going well for a while but lately I've kept getting these thoughts and while I'm obviously not going to act on them I'm afraid that they will only intensify. I'm afraid of them and dont know what to do about it. I never ever in my life acted upon my suicidal thoughts but I just dont want to mentally be in that place anymore, especially when things have been going so great both mentally and generally in the past few months.
