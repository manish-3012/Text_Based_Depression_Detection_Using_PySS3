college trouble.so what happened this week it just came all crashing down. I was accepted to my current schools education program conditonally(they want me to take another class and disclose the staff that i am on medication for my adhd and my past preformance). Then, my brother gets into this school(the one I am at). I was accepted at one back home and want to go there because I wouldn't have the problems i am having here. Friday night and Sat, mom and brother both gain up on me to sta here. I don't want to stay here. I don't care. But the only thing is they wont send little brother if i am not there. They keep telling me it will be better with him. No it wont be. It wont be nothing will change. And what if i don't get into the third part of my program. What the fuck then? I have been crying all weekend and I am tired of it. People don't get it. I have told them that I do not want to be here. I told them how unhappy I am. but they don't care. They are only thinking about him. I dont know what to do. In my mind the thoughts have been racing "no one will even know if you were gone, it would be days before they found you".  I want it to stop. I want the responsibility of myself and him to stop. I want it to stop.
