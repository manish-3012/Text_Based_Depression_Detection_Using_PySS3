A poemI'm posting this in a vain attempt for somebody that I know to find this and ask me what's wrong. But it won't happen so whatever. I'm sorry it doesn't rhyme.

People always say 

â€œJust a little while longer!â€

â€œJust hang in there!â€

All of these â€œjustsâ€ thrown around

Like itâ€™s no big deal at all

Like I could do it at all

Like if it would make a difference at all.

Activism is just another form of shame to me.

It makes me feel like my feelings arenâ€™t valid.

Like theyâ€™re not even real.

Like they could be just brushed aside like dust in the cold wind.

So I bury them.

Deep.

Deep.

Deep.

Down.

In the back of my mind.

Until they come up.

Up.

Up.

And thatâ€™s when all hell breaks loose. 

I donâ€™t want my emotions to be used

To make somebody else feel like a hero

Just for making a quick google search

And spewing out what it told them to say.

â€œGentlemen, we stopped depression.â€
