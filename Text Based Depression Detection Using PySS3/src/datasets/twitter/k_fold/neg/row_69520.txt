Life is 10 times harder when you are actively trying to be happy.If trying to improve socially, and professionally wasn't hard enought, I have to do it without any motivation. With little to no joy coming from it. All while thinking about dying.

Whenever I ask people reasons for me not to do it, I am baffled that many of them have never thought about it. Most never have an answer. And if they have, it is something along the lines of "it gets better" or "you would regret it". Til this day i have yet to find a better reason to live than to commit.

I don't have that many friends, but I treasure those that are still with me. I fell bad that I'm not able to be as good to them as they are for me.

I remenber an old friend saying how she liked me and all, and that I am a nice person. That was kinda brutal. I can't see it. It hurts, because I can't see it. I barely talk with her nowadays. Another friendship that I let decay.

I just don't really know how to be there. If someone asks me for help, or to talk, I will try my best to be there for them. I say I'm there for them, but how can I show myself available? I fell like I would only make things worse. I have made things worse for many people. Unintentionally of course, but still have. 

Kinda went on a tangent there, but at the end of the day most of it comes back to me not knowing how to live happily. Every day being a struggle to even get up.
