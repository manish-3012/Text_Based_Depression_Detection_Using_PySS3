I'm doing everything "right" but I'm just not happy.Ex broke up with me a couple of months ago which was the final push over the edge to a suicide attempt after a year and a half bout of severe depression. Since then I should be proud and feel accomplished over what I've done; I've got a new job, I've started at the gym and I'm on new anti-depressants but honestly, none of it means anything. I sometimes manage to make myself feel like I'm happy for a while but any time I'm alone with my thoughts I constantly ruminate on everything. I don't want to work everyday for some shitty paycheque at a job I don't actually enjoy so I can continue to idolize not being here. Whenever I seem to take steps forward to improving I feel like I get knocked back by something else and I'm just so tired of it. I wish I'd actually been successful the first time so I didn't have to really think about how my Mum would've been affected by my suicide, because now I just don't have the guts to do it. Guess I'll just go to sleep and wake up to face this neverending grind again tomorrow.
