I'm going to commit suicide in a few hoursI wasn't supposed to live in the first place, if you don't know how to raise a child then don't fucking get children, this world is only for fucking stupid people doing stupid useless shit. They should allow people to euthanize themselves so they don't have te put themselves through this piece of shit of a useless live.

Edit: I was never so close to death. I got disturbed right before I was about to do it. I've just had a very bad day (got really upset because of something stupid). I've been depressed for like 7 months or so but I am doing better now.
