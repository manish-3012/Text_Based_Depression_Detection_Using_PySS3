I'm scared of my own suicide thoughts, I dont want to die. It's like two personalities.This might sound stupid, but I have had suicide thoughts for a few years. It's been on and off and it's only thoughts, never attempts. I did better recently. I always knew I will never kill myself. I'm a smart person and can control myself in difficult situations.

But then 2 days ago, some miss understanding happen between me and my girlfriend. Without going into details, we quarreled a bit and her phone was off mid quarrel. I was in very bad mood that day as well, so bad timing of the quarrel. My previous girlfriend broke up with me and shut off the phone, leaving me sleepless the whole night. This might be why I was overreacting this time.

So my girlfriend didnt break up with me, and it was all just a miss understanding and her phone went legit off due to low battery maybe, but I legit thought she was gone. This feeling I couldn't take. I didn't sleep the entire night, and around 7 am in the morning, I got some breathing attack. I couldn't breath and was panicking. This breathing lasted for hours. Now the suicide thoughts became reality for the first time. I remember how unclear I was thinking. Everything logical didn't exist in my mind. I legit was about to kill myself. I could see me jumping off a cliff and feel the feeling and thoughts while doing it, and the worse thing, it felt RIGHT.

I am better now and all good. The problem is, I am so scared this might happen again. Because it seams like it doesn't matter how clear your mind is, once the suicide thought takes over, it's done. Whatever you appreciate in life and whatever knowledge you have, is just completely ignored when the thought came.

Is there any tips out there how to prevent this from happening or how to think clear when suicide thoughts come this intense? Clearly my previously knowledge wasn't good enough.
