I think I will kill myself next weekI am in my final year of college and I did not do so well in college this semester. I struggled a lot with depression and suicidal thoughts this semester and I could not completely focus on my classes. I failed two classes and I have to take them both again next semester, I feel really awful and guilty that I keep wasting my parents money. 

Now, I have to take an extra semester to graduate and I donâ€™t know how to tell them. I feel like killing myself is the best option because then they donâ€™t have to spend any more money and they donâ€™t have to feel bad that their son is a useless moron. My parents do have to right to get angry at me but I wish they could understand why I did not do so well. I have my last final tomorrow and I am just really tired and donâ€™t know what to do.
