please helpim 18 turning 19 in a few months and in the past ive struggled heavily with depression and anxiety. im in college now and my school anxiety is much different bc in college youre on your own. i dont want to go to school but i paid for it and also i feel like im just a failure to my parents if i dont finish. now i am getting to my point, everyday i wake up and feel like im just going through the motions to stay alive. i never look forward to doing anything and feeling like i lost hope and am falling back into my cycle of depression where i isolate myself and become even more depressed. at this moment i dont feel depressed but i do not want to live, i see no value in my life.  back when i was heavily depressed ive thought committing and those feelings are coming back. ive seeked help through professionals and see no change in myself. the only way i get through it without thinking about it is joking around and smoking weed. when i dont i feel the same as the past and no longer wish to live. My struggle is that i do not have the courage to do it bc i think about all the people i will affect with my decision. I dont want my family and friends to end up feeling the same as i do but also they wouldnt want me feeling like this. i came here to write this to get suggestions from people who are experiencing similar things. my question is how do you build this courage or what is my alternative? i see no value in keeping on. i just want to be happy
