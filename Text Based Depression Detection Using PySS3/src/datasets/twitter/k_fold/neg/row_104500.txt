Is suicide my only choice if antidepressants donâ€™t work?Basically I have whatâ€™s called severe treatment-resistant depression. Antidepressants donâ€™t work for me. For the past couple of years, not a single week has gone by without me thinking about ending it all. I canâ€™t live like this for the rest of my life. Iâ€™m only 20. I even have tried things like taking up a new hobby, meditating, exercising. Doesnâ€™t work.
