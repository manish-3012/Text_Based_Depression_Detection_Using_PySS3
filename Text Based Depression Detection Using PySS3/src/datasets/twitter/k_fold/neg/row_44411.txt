Why canâ€™t I just have the courage to follow through?Iâ€™ve been done with life for about the past four years. Nothing goes right, even on the smallest scale. Iâ€™ll spare you the details. 

I just want to know how I can stop pussying around and just fucking do it already. Why canâ€™t I just fucking be done with it. I just want the pain to end. Iâ€™m so fucking sick of waking up every day, knowing itâ€™s going to be shit, knowing Iâ€™m going to go to sleep worse off, whether it be in a material or emotion fashion, than I was when I woke up.

I wish I had a fucking gun, god damn. It would be so much easier pulling the trigger than any other method available to me. I donâ€™t care if thereâ€™s a risk I wonâ€™t succeed. I donâ€™t care if my family finds me, I just want the pain to be over.

Itâ€™s gotten to the point that I have seriously considered doing something major to cut ties with those who are close to me just so I can fucking follow through without hesitation.
 
Thereâ€™s no getting better for me. The issues I have cost too much money, time or both.
