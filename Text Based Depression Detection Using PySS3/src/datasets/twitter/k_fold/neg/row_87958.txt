Finally got husband to admit I'm the problemI know he resents me, and has for a long time, but he won't fucking admit it. I've seen the messages tho. I know. Last night I told him I missed doing a hobby, and when he asked why I didn't do it anymore, I told him it's because I know it keeps him from doing one of his hobbies. It took him a bit but he finally admitted that yes, my hobby is the problem. 

I'm so tired of being in the way all the time. I'm in the way of his happiness and his fulfillment. I wish he would at least admit it to me, maybe that would help me feel a little more human. But I don't deserve to be an informed partner in our relationship, since I'm a shit person and all.

It's okay tho. I've finally got a plan set up, and I've got most of the loose ends tied up. Just gotta wait for the right moment to get it over with.
