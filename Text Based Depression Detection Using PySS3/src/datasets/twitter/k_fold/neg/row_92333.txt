Hate my job and career choice, and despite wanting to write, I can't bring myself to do it since it'll suck anyway.I just don't have the mental fortitude or skills both to withstand what obstacles lie in life or to do what I want. I have no ambitions or deep desires. All I ever wanted was to live in peace, but I know I'll be stuck in this place forever, and the desire to end this pain is constant. It's so constant that I can't bring myself to stop it since it's a part of me, an affirmation of myself. I don't know how much longer I'm going to survive.
