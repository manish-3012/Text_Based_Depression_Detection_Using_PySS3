Do you ever want to commit suicide not because of the pain this life bring, but because you feel the need to start over?A few years back I was raped by my dad who adopted me. It completely messed me up and now have to live with trauma it brought me. I canâ€™t barely make any connections with people anymore and feel as if Iâ€™m losing my empathy. Iâ€™m a strong believer in reincarnation, and I think that maybe if I were to off myself now I could just start over. I usually always believe that everybody can get better, but now that Iâ€™ve been attempting to better myself Iâ€™ve realized how near impossible it is. I canâ€™t live in this body anymore. I feel like itâ€™s infected with my rapistâ€™s touch. I think if I donâ€™t kill myself eventually Iâ€™m just going to cut all my skin off and shave my hair just to get away from body. Iâ€™m feeling more hopeless everyday and Iâ€™m not sure who to talk to about it. My closest friend isnâ€™t that great at talking about serious stuff and I donâ€™t feel that comfortable talking about this stuff with anybody else. Does anybody know how to get rid of these emption, I really want to live and better myself, but my mind keeps cursing me with these thoughts and I know one day that I wonâ€™t have enough self control to not listen to them.
