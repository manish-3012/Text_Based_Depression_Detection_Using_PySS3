Neck really hurtsWarning: i was having a breakdown yesterday and I tried to TEST hanging to avoid future mistakes.

I have had a terrible headache since yesterday and back pain and a pinch on my neck, I might have damaged something internally, but probably nothing serious I guess.

Thatâ€™s what I get for flirting with death I guess.
