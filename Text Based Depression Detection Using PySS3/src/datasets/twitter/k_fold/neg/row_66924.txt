Sister is worrying me about a poem she wroteMy sister is 11 years old in 5th grade and she wrote a very disturbing  poem. The poem was about her basically being neglected even though her friends and family love her. The most frightening part about the poem was her saying that she cant see the light but when she looks up to the sky she sees it and wants to climb the ladder up to it. I'm not sure if she is going through o mode swing, a phase, or just planning to suicide. I really need help because me and my parents don't know what to do even though we talked to her and she said she is fine, but we arnt sure if she is telling the truth or not
