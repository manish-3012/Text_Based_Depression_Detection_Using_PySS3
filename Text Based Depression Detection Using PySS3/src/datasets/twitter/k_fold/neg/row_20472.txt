exhaustedi donâ€™t know what else to do at this point. Ever since I was a little kid Iâ€™ve struggled with depressionâ€” way sooner than the average depressed teen. Every since elementary school, Iâ€™ve been having thoughts about wanting to go.

When I was a teenager it was anger. I wanted to die to spite all the people who hurt me so terribly. I was hurting so deeply that I wanted to make everyone else regret what they had done to me. I wanted to make them all suffer for the rest of their lives knowing that my death lay firmly on their shoulders. 

Now, Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™m exhausted. I used to have hope that one day, things would get better and I would make it through. Now, Iâ€™m stuck, alone after a relationship that ended rottenly. Found out he never even really loved me to begin with, was telling our friends I was doing things that I swear, I wasnâ€™t doing. Told everyone I cheated, when I donâ€™t even think thereâ€™s anyone else whoâ€™d like me enough to cheat *with* me. Now a whole bunch of our friends wonâ€™t talk to me either, and I feel so isolated. 

I just want to be loved. I want to be loved, and it doesnâ€™t have to be romantic, but I want to be loved. I want to be able to be broken and be enough at the same time. I want to lay with someone, have them wipe off my face and tell me Iâ€™m doing alrightâ€” but I donâ€™t want it to be strained or awkward or uncomfortable. I just want to be allowed to exist, wretched as I am, and have someone else okay with that. 

I feel like Iâ€™m suffocating. I try to call the hotlines and stuff, but they always leave me feeling more miserable and desperate than before. Emptier. Pathetic. I canâ€™t go to my friendsâ€” they donâ€™t deserve the weight of my struggle on their consciousness. I want to bring them love and happiness. I donâ€™t want them to have to struggle with carrying me through my low. 

My spirals keep getting worse, and keep lasting so much longer. I just want to be loved. I just want to get help. Iâ€™ve tried therapy so many times, but I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m doing wrong. I try to be honest and open. I listen close, I do my best to take the adviceâ€” but when I tell my psychiatrist that I donâ€™t think my meds are working because Iâ€™m experiencing severe side effects (intense suicidal thoughts, insomnia, loss of libido, physical aches and pains), he just waves it off and tells me theyâ€™re doing fine. I donâ€™t have a lot of money, and Iâ€™m trying so hard not to be a burden, but I feel like itâ€™s all I do. 

God Iâ€™m so lonely, and Iâ€™m so tired. I... logically, I donâ€™t want to die, but death sounds so soothing. Just ceasing to exist, being allowed to finally rest. Itâ€™s been ten years of fighting to find my will to live, and no matter what I do I get knocked back on my ass. Iâ€™ve never even fucking used reddit before today, but. I heard about this thread and was desperate enough to make one. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m looking for anymore. Really, Iâ€™m just looking for peace and quiet. Somewhere dark to just spend the rest of eternity, where I canâ€™t be hurt anymore, and I canâ€™t hurt anyone else.
