5 years leftMade the decision to tough it out until im 30. Im 25 right now, no friends and no family, surrounded by people that only care when they can get something out of it. I drown myself in work because if im too busy working I dont have time to think about the pain.. If it doesn't get better in the next 5 years, figure it's time to take it into my own hands to make change.
