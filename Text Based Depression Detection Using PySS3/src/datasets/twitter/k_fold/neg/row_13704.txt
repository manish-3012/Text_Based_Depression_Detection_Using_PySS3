I don't know how I screwed my life up this bad. Every year for the past decade I've told myself that I will fix this and that and things will get better. Every year over the past decade nothing gets better. It's just get worse. I'll reflect on what I've lost and try to figure out a better way of doing things and somehow I end up with less than I did before. Things are so bad I can't afford to go see my Dad's grave and I can't fix my Mom's gravestone where it was vandalized. Even if I could afford to fix her gravestone I couldn't get there. 

I told myself last year I would have a better job. A job where I could afford heath insurance and get all my health problems fixed. I also told myself the year before that. 

I can't make it work. I don't have to social skills to work a better job. Half the job interviews I get, I can't get a ride there. There's no future for me. My own mental inadequacies have put the nail in the coffin. 

Luckily I have no family left. There's no one that loves me and no one I have any profound effect on. This morning I was told repeatedly that I'm easily replaceable. 

Before I become a drain on society and start causing people more problems than I already do. I think I'm going to kill myself. ]

I've lost interest in being around others anyway. Possessions mean nothing to me and I'm bored of reading. I don't have the mental toolkit to build a better future for myself. 

I look forward to my thought process ending. I look forward to being in the state I was in before I was born.
