StillHello everyone. A couple of weeks ago I wrote a post titled "Another name on the suicide list." I survived as you can read. 

I took some pills, but the next morning my parents called the ambulance because I was not waking up. It was weird because we don't have communication and they were always really horrible to me.

I really still hate my life but I don't feel like trying to kill myself again. At least for now
