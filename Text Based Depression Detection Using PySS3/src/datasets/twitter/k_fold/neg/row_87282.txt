Too embarrassed to talk to anyone about thisNot going to lie, I am drunk, I am high. I am contemplating swallowing pills I have saved for this occasion, or an occasion in the near future. I have not breathed a word of this to anyone but my therapist and group councilors, both out of embarrassment and efficiency (if someone knew then presumably they would stand in my way). I am afraid that if I call my 'councilor' on monday and tell him how I feel he will think that I'm just trying to get attention, or won't believe me at all. If that happened it would probably put me over the edge. The only reason that I am writing this is because I told 'councilor' that I would call a crisis line if it came to this and I am too chicken to do that too....

I'm not even sure what I want out of this, I've read many of these and am pretty sure I've heard it all...
