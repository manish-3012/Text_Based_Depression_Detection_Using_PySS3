Sometimes I feel really suicidalI was diagnosed with ADHD half a year ago but I feel like it is too late to get things straight. I have been taking medication but I think we need many years to catch up so I think I will suffer after graduation.

Besides that I have no friends. I think quite a number of people in my major are avoiding me and being short with me. Maybe I depended on the acquaintances for help too many times and missed too many classes and had to WhatsApp them asking if there are schedule changes and they don't like how I have the management skills of a 12 year old.

I feel like we will be forever inferior to neurotypicals and that we will never be accepted by society and it makes me want to die. As some people have said, they aren't exactly supportive of us having kids as we are just passing it on to the second generation and causing them to suffer for a lifetime.
