Suicide and baby harming threatsMy cousin got married to this guy who is a total waste of space - just drinks the entire day, doesn't work and physically/verbally abuses her to mooch money of her brother. They tried and failed getting pregnant hence adopted a baby. Their financial condition is pathetic and I think even my cousin has lost it. She's been staying with her parents now for the past few months, and on every disagreement threatens us saying she'd kill the baby, then herself if we disagreed with her/ didn't accept her unfair and unreasonable demands. I saw her the other day having an argument with her husband and then later taking it out on the baby by slapping him for no reason. The baby just turned 1. I'm a teenager and not allowed to give my opinion but I'm really scared about the baby. What should I do?!
