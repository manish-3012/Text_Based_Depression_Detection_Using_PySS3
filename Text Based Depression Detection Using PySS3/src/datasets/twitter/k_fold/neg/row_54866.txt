i dont know.For awile now, about 8~10 years i have been going through a cycle of depresion. For like a year and a half i would be fine. Then for a random amount of time, the shortest being a few days and the longest now hs been a few weeks, i would be compleatly deprest for no reasn at all. It been geting worse over the years. This time around i am think of ending the cycle for good (killing myself). I dont know why. Its not the first time i have had this thought eather. The last cycle i has the same thoughts, i never acted on them but they where there. The serios problem this time is i nearly did it. Twice now, once i nearl snaped my neck with my own hands, the second time i almost stabed a major artery in my arm with a coligraphy pen. Worst part this time, is tat i am egging my self on. Calling my self a wimp,pussy,pathetic for not doing it. What do i do? For the firs time in my life i am genually scared. Help me please. I dont want to die.
