21, no job, no studiesNo will to do anything, overweight, serious health problems, parent died and other one is really old aged, got almost no friends, days pass by and I do nothing with my life. I do nothing beside sleeping and playing videogames, I'm not looking for a job and I lost my interest in everything, nothing even excites me. I feel too much physical pain to exercise. I'm not interested in relationships of any kind and just wondering what the hell I am doing on this earth, I did not ask to be born, and I'm just an useless member of the society. I'm too coward to even consider killing myself but wonder if I could at least be useful by doing so, maybe donating my organs or something like that
