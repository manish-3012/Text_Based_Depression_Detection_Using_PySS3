life is HELL and women are TERRIBLE ive started associating them with painever since i was in elementary school i would like somebody, have a crush on them, and get REJECTED

growing up this kept on happening

I am almost 23 and have nothing to show for life, dropped out of college three times, fucking losing my shit the last three years, self harming, mental hospitals four or so times last year

nothing ever helped, about to start wellbutrin but last time it did nothing. i feel unable to work because my emotions fuck with me, no one to talk to except parents over the phone, the house i live in in shitty utah feels like a prison.

I just dont find many reasons to live i dont enjoy anything

i cant seem to stop watching porn either i feel sick. i dont want to be alive
