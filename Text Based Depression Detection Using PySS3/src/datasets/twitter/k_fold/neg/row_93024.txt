I do not know what I am doing anymore.*I have been suffering from depression since I was 12, that was when I had my first suicidal thought, pushed through it, at the age of 16, my world turned upside down again, again made an attempt to overcome it,  I did, except the fact I never told anyone about my struggles and isolated myself and ran away from my college. I got addicted to animes and kpop, I do not know if it was a distraction of sorts, it just made me happy and I kept it really close to me and never shared or spoke about it. This year was fine and I was overcoming my past and becoming  a better person,  but the pandemic hit and I lost everything, I went into severe depression, got myself a therapist, did self harm, tried to kill myself and have lost interest in animes/kpop, I cannot even watch a min of it or listen to songs, cannot pick myself up from my bed, lost appetite, lost a lot of weight considering I am already skinny, I cannot look at my self harm scars and feel like cutting my arm off. My friends do not understand shit about how I feel and make it worse for me, I cannot step inside college anymore because everyone scares me and I cry all the time and get emotional now. Everyone tells me therapy and healing is a slow process and I will become better, but I am tired. I tried fixing my sleep and diet, but still get suicidal thoughts, I am supposed to inform someone if I be that way but I cannot bring myself up to say it because I feel suicidal every second. I am better off dead, I cannot do this anymore.. I feel being unproductive and useless and it is better if I die than live like this because I am just going to waste money and be a snob.. I already searched about how to suicide but I do not have the courage to go through with it, hopefully I will by the end of this week.*
