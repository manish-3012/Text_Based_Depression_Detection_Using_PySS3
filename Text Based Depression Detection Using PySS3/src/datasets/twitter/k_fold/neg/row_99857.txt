Soft Tissue DecompositionIâ€™m not anorexic.  Not even close.  

I really wish people would stop accusing me of that.  But, I let them think what they want.  In fact, I encourage confusion.  Iâ€™ve surrounded myself with so many half-truths and disinformation: Iâ€™m sick, Iâ€™ve GERD/IBS, I just like counting calories because Iâ€™m fond of data, that I almost believe those things myself.

Itâ€™s all part of the plan, and itâ€™s done a number on my body.  And for anyone who doesnâ€™t think Iâ€™m capable of even this much, Iâ€™ve worked on it for a very long time; years and years.  And it hurts.  God it hurtsâ€”every day more than the last one.  It hurts to lie in bed because my bones protrude, Iâ€™m so cold, and the excess stomach acid burns me from the inside.  But, even if itâ€™s hard, I know I can do it because Iâ€™ve come this far.  My body never finished growing.  I have the shape of a child, and probably the mind of one too.  Iâ€™m selfish, spoiled, completely dependent, virginal and asexual.  The only things that might give away my age are the scars from years of self-mutilation.  You could probably count them like tree rings.

Iâ€™ve gone from 100 to 75 pounds since I was a teenager, and now Iâ€™m in my mid-twenties.
This isnâ€™t about looks.  Not even close, because I stopped giving a damn about what I look like before I even grew up.  Iâ€™m under no impression that the visible ribcage and veins arenâ€™t hideous.  It isnâ€™t even about control, because Iâ€™d rather have someone else do the deciding for me.

Itâ€™s about being a coward.  I couldnâ€™t kill myself quickly, so instead I have to do it slowly.  Almost imperceptibly.  Not because I donâ€™t want anyone to noticeâ€”my life is solitary enough where that doesnâ€™t matterâ€”but because I couldnâ€™t kill myself the right way back then.

So, Iâ€™m just taking it slow instead, hoping that one day my body will just stop.  Fade into nothing.  I donâ€™t mind if it takes a while longer.  Iâ€™m patient, and Iâ€™ve got all the time in the world.  Even if I lose this round, I still win, because everyone dies.

In the end, I always get what I want, and Iâ€™ve never wanted anything more than this.
