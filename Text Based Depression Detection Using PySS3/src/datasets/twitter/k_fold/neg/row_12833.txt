My PTSD has won, I can't physically nor mentally take it anymore.Last year was an absolute shit show for me. My best friend died and I found out my other friend attempted to sexually assault me all within the first 3 days of 2019. I have since lost all my friends and I don't get to graduate early anymore. The police officer I gave all my evidence to filed my report wrong on purpose cause he's only 17 (I'm 16). Don't give me the "get a lawyer blah blah", I want to but my parent's don't want to put in the work or money. It's not like I'm quiet about this too, I've been very vocal about my declining sanity. I can't take these fucking flashbacks either, I'm still stuck in 2019 where I had to fight for my own fucking safety. 

Do you understand how hard it is to "move on"? I actually can't move on, I can't. It's actually fucking impossible. I've been put on antidepressants but they have never done shit. I can't see my psychiatrist for months and my parents don't care enough to get me a therapist. 

I found my sleep meds and took like 6, I'm usually meant to take .5 or 1. I didn't want to take all cause I'm planning on doing this tomorrow and don't want to be caught too early, I'll grab more though. I'll probably blaze before I do it so it's more peaceful. But anyway, I don't know why I'm posting this.
