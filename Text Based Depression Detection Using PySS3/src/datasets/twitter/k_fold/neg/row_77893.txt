I don't care that people care about me, I don't care that it might get better in the future, I am miserableI want to die so so bad. Literally nothing anyone has ever said has changed that. Why do I have to feel like shit all the god damn time. I am lying in bed and my head feels like it's being weight down by a brick. I think I will hang myself but I am not sure how. Or find a cliff to jump off of, there's been one I've been thinking about but it's quite far away. I feel bad doing it now because my parents are on holiday and I don't want to spoil it. So I might wait until they get back at least so they had a nice time before I go. They get back Saturday so I suppose I'll do it Sunday, gives me time to prepare and I also won't have to sit any more exams. Wish me luck :)
