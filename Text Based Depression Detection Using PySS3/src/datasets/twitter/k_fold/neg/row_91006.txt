If anyone cares about you, _____ you.If anyone would care if you died, _____ you.
If anyone would stop you if you tried to kill yourself, ___ you.
If anyone would notice if you disappeared, ___ you. 

I just was reading a random thing, and it was talking about how they wanted to make it clear that there's nothing worthwhile about suicide. FUCK YOU it's the ONLY thing worthwhile to me. 

I spent ~$80 US to take a cab home today because I knew if I tried to go in the train, I would jump in front of it. 

If I died, no one would even know. All of my friends are online, and none of them ever text me first. They never come looking for me. When I text them, it's just a bother to them. No one would even notice if I stopped contacting them, they'd just be relieved. 

Everyone wants to get rid of me. No one wants me around.
