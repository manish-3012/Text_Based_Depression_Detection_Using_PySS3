It doesnt get better, it wont be okaypeople say this shit, i hear it everyday but its fucking bullshit,, it doesnt get better, its been getting worse and worse everyday for the past like 4 years.
Im about to finish highschool, i didnt expect myself to get this far in life. Time is going way too fast. It almost feels wrong that i'm still alive, i can't imagine myself growing old and doing adult stuff. I dont know what to study later in life. Everyone seems to have their life together, nobody else seems scared of growing up. I feel kind of pressured to kill myself soon, i just know i wont be successful in life,, I stopped caring in school since i always thought i'd be dead soon so there would be no point in putting effort into school. I'm waiting for a sign, then i'll do it.
