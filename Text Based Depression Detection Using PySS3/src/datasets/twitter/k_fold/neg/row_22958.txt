This year has sucked beyond belief. I thought it was getting better but I feel like I have no way to be happy.Just a summary of my year:
- My mother died. Lots and lots of issues there. 

- I'm working a job that drains all my energy and then some.

-I'm on the 6th year of a 4 years college course and looking forward to two more if I get off my ass to do something.

-I feels like I suck as a human being in general. I'm a terrible friend, terrible daughter, granddaughter, sister, niece, you name it, I suck.

-I have all sorts of psychological problems: anxiety, panic attacks, ptsd, bpd.

I can't. I just can't manage all of this. I was just kidding myself that it got better.
