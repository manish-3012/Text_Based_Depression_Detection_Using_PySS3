Suicide, Intrusive Thoughts and ImpulsivityLately, I have been having more vivid intrusive thoughts about suicide. â€œHow fast should I drive before hitting this tree so it could potentially kill me.â€ â€œHow tall is this building where it could end me.â€ However, I do not actually feel depressed or sad. Yet, when I think about suicide, it seems like an easy process and I could be completely okay with not existing. 

I have a decent life, decent job, and college soon to come to an end. Iâ€™m financially okay and all around a decent person. But these thoughts are so numerous that I feel as though it has become normal for me. When I was younger, around freshman in high-school, I got angry and impulsively popped about 8 pills. Of course it was a learning experience for me but my intention at the moment was not to kill myself but act out from being angry. I am not an angry person and I rarely get angry. When I do get angry, I become impulsive. 

Iâ€™m afraid that one day, when I do get angry that I will eventually hurt myself or end myself because of how vivid these intrusive thoughts are. Itâ€™s strange though, because I do not get angry often and usually takes a lot to get me upset. Sometimes Iâ€™m able to control the anger but I feel as though that impulsive behavior that rarely occurs will put me in the grave.
