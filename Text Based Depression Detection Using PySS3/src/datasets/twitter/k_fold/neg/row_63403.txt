The best mistake I ever made was LSD.Hear me out. 

If you donâ€™t know anything about the substance, you may come to the conclusion I fried my brain. Even if you know a bit about it, maybe youâ€™ll still come to that conclusion. 

Mixing it, and my major depressive disorder was a risk I willingly took. No one forced me, no one tried to pressure me into it. I never rushed into it. 

It was the best time I had. Forever. Will ever have. 

Iâ€™m not addicted. I still have a lot, yet Iâ€™ve not touched it. I donâ€™t feel like I need to do more. 

The afterglow was fantastic, but there was this seed planted in me. Itâ€™s starting to grow and fruit now, and it will kill me. 

I cannot bear going to work now. I cannot bear being witness to the destruction and molestation of this world. All over money. 

I work retail. I lie about lies upon lies, to sell you a lie, that you even lie to yourself about without knowing. Everything is so fake and disgenuous. I have a good rapport in my town for being kind, helpful and what not through my job, but we all know itâ€™s a crock of shit. 

What are my options? Go to another meat house of lies? Go and study and waste away in a classroom, so I can be a bigger liar, and earn more money? I donâ€™t want it I donâ€™t want it I donâ€™t want it. I DONT WANT IT. 

I want to just have true freedom. I had 6 months off work and felt genuinely fantastic. Always sober, keeping my own schedule, keeping my house well maintained and myself healthy. Plenty of time for friends and family. 

Now Iâ€™m back at work. Itâ€™s over. Im back to the entrapment of the soul that is the day to day. 


I will die soon. I fear not death, but the process itself. 

I cannot be helped. Therapists, psychologists, doctors and all have turned me away after a while. I donâ€™t want to be involved in a system that earns the government revenue, thus there is no reason for them to help me. 

How sad.
