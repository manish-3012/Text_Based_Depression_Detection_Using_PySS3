Is this a good suicide letter?This is it where it ends. After careful contemplation I realized that it only gets worse. The truth is I wasn't cut out for this world, and now it's time to end my life. Unlike some people when I say something like this I mean it. I don't want anyone's pity. Pity is reserved for those who suffer and would've thrived under my circumstances. No one honestly should care, but the few of you who do should realize that this is what will make me happy. I have a rope around my neck as I type this. And for the first time in a long time, I feel good. We all die at some point, you will join me. I'm not going to live to see myself die slowly and more painfully. I'm just putting myself out of my own misery. I will never be the man I wanted to be. I see that there is no place left on this Earth for a person like me. I don't want to live as loser any longer. I'd like to thank anyone I've had the fortune to be close with, thank you.
