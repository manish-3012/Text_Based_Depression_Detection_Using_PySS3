What do i doMy boyfriend is depressed and suicidal. Before we got together he planned his attempt but was stopped by his family. We're moving into our own place this week and he said that's he's going to hang himself after we get there.
He goes through a cycle a lot. Depressed, tries to think of ways that he could get better then suicidal thoughts before we go to sleep. 
I don't know what to do for not only his mental health but mine too. The thought of him dying just sends me into debilitating anxiety attacks.
