I want to kill myself because I have facial paulsyI cut my own face a year ago because i hated the way I look. I hit a nerve or muscle, and now my mobility and symmetry is fucked. 

People say it's not much but they talk shit. I can't live with it. My face is constantly uncomfortable and I can't smile or squint or express emotion properly. The skin burns and droops, I look creepy as soon as I try to make a face. 

Doctors can't fix these kinds of things, ive googled endlessly. I don't want this new me. I have found a proper source where you can buy euthanasia drugs online and im on the brink of purchase.

I just want to go back but I can't. The good days are over.
