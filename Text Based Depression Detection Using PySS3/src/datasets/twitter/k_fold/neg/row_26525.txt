Suicide seems inevitable to me.It will be a ways off honestly. I posted a couple days ago about how I would like to finish Game of Thrones. (Maybe life can hopefully get better by then. I doubt it). The year I have had has not let up at all on kicking me down. This isnâ€™t just a matter of perspective. I have tried to have a good outlook even as life kept shoving itâ€™s disgusting lemons down my throat. Eventually I just started to believe that it will never get better. The people who have hurt me seem completely oblivious which is their right I suppose. But some of them outright confronted me with things they didnâ€™t need to and it sent me on this spiral. After one thing happened last month I donâ€™t know if I truly care if things get better. They need to get better in a particular way or I just donâ€™t think I can make it through life. Iâ€™m 24 and if I feel this much pain right now I donâ€™t want to even imagine the kind of pain I could feel by the time Iâ€™m 50. I was reminded of the Doctor Who episode Vincent and the Doctor and its portrayal of mental health. That episode moved me back in times when I felt mentally stable but now thinking about it I can relate very much to how Vincent was portrayed and the take away at the end when he is still dead when the doctor returns to the present. The Doctor muses that â€œGood things donâ€™t always soften the bad...â€ I feel like that is the state I am in now. Even the best things that happen to me now just feel like nothing compared to the pain of all the bad that this year in particular has brought me. Thank you for reading if you have read this far. Just needed to get some thoughts out...
