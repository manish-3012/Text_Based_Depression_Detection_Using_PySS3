My body is breaking down, and I might never be able to get a job. Horrified at the prospect of being cared for or becoming homelessIm a 26 y old uni student. I have always been quite weak. On average I spent around 3 weeks being sick as a kid per year. Lately I have developed a condition where I constantly need to pee, and I feel irritation and pain 24 h. I am also tired, nauseous, aching somewhere nonstop. I am not drinking, not taking drugs, not smoking, so I have no idea whats going on. I lost the ability to do student jobs because of my health, and right now am am scared that I wont ever be able to work. I dont have money for private doctors, and state funded ones dont give a crap "its just anxiety" I feel my lifen is falling to pieces and I will either end up handicapped being taken care of, or I will just die on the street. I want to live, but I decided to write here, as it seemed like a good place to take this off my chest.
