Don't see the point in livingI don't even know what to put here. I screwed up again. Like usual. I think I'm just really good at that. Right now I want to die more than anything. I'm thinking about taking an overdose and just ending it all. That sounds amazing. I'm so depressed and keep cutting myself. It's all pointless. I don't want to live. I never have. I have no friends or family so it's not like anyone would even miss me. I should just do it.
