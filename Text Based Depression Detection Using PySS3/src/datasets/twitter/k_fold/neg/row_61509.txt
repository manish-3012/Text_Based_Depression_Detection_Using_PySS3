When I close my eyes I can feel the rope around my neckI'am actually not suicial, well, I thought.

I have good and bad days; Good days when I get some of my shit done; Bad days when I lay in my bed and don't want to go up or continue.

The thing is: I'm living. And I actually thogut I'd like to go on living but everytime I close my eyes I can feel the rope around my neck. When I lay down to sleep my first thought/image is about someone shooting me in the head.

I don't know how I should feel about this. My sight was something like pro living, but it seems to, well, slide away? Fade? I don't know. What should I do? I was in depression therapy and my parents know about my "suicidal thoughts".  I don't know what I'm supposed to do to save what I think I am.
