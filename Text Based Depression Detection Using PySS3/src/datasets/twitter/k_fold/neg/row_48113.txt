Quantum suicide - a permeant reason to keep going?Ive had my ups and downs but a single thought has persisted; quantum suicide. I feel im fairly grounded in rationality but the constant idea i cant escape by killing myself bothers me. I dont fear death but i have a bordering irational fear of living trapped in a nonfunctional body. To the extent i cant hear ONE without a panic attack. If the many worlds theory is true then no matter how well planned out a way to kill myself COULD be it would never end my life as i experiance it. 


Im not sure how many others feel like i do but even if i didnt want to die it keeps me from trying at my worst. Lets be clear this isnt a call for help its an acceptance that suicide isnt the answer no matter, id just like to find and help others that realize we are trapped here till our existance reaches a 0.0 probability. We might as well join and help each other keep sanity since that is the one thing not guarantied.
