I'll never have friends.Ive been friendless for years. I have no social skills, ill never be able to get a real friend, let alone have a significant other. I see all my old friend with people better than me, being happy.   But I cant do that, and I dont think ill ever be able to. Whats the point of life if youre never gonna be able to share thing with other people?
