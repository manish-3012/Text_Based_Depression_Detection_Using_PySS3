Not sure of a titleSo I was cruising r/watchpeopledie like I do sometimes and in one of the comment sections someone posted a link to a chart made up about suicide methods and how quick/painful they are. I saved it and looked at them, I've always had a particular method of how I want to go with the odd impulse methods in hard times. To see it in numbers just makes you think.
