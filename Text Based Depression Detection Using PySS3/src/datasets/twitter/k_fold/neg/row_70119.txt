I don't know what my options are. I don't think I want to die, but this life is not worth it.This is just not working. I'm 26, have been depressed for years now, and always tried to work and think my way through it. Suicide has come up in my mind before, but I've always been convinced that there was some option that I haven't tried.

I'm not so convinced anymore. I have no family to go to where I can be myself, I have a personality that hurts other people, and I haven't been able to change my personality for all the years that I've tried. It seems to be in the best interest of everyone that I just disappear. Even the friends that still do care about me - if I keep going on, they'll just get estranged by my lack of communication and maybe wonder what has happened to me as a side thought, years from now.

My main emotion during adolescence was hatred of myself for what i am (parents told me being gay was horrible and gays should die, said they'd rather have one of their kids die than have them leave their religion. a few years later, i came out as gay and told them i don't believe in god) - after that, hatred towards my parents for making me feel that way. I'm tired now. It's exhausting.

What if it gets to this point? Is there any other direction to go?
