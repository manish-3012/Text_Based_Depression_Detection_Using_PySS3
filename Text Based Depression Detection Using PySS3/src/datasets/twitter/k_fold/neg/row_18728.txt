The Worst Feelings EverI have the worst feelings in the world feeling like shit, looking like shit, and treated like shit. I hate the fact that the one person I love and cherish on this earth, who means the world to me. Hates me with all their heart because I'm ugly. I despise it when it he flirts all the girls and calls them beautiful, and that he loves them and even randomly dances salsa with one of them he constantly makes me feel bad about being a bad, ugly, dancer and always calls me out and embarrasses me and makes sure everyone is there to hear it. It makes so jealous that those girls are only using him as an object and their jester rather than me who actually loves them, for so much more than his "soft head" and dancing.  I even buy him small gifts such as candy, he threw at me today and made a scene to embarrass me and today he got pissed at me because I supposedly got him in "trouble" which isn't true for shit. And he gets himself for trouble for "talking" to other girls and he doesn't get mad at them he lied to me on purpose saying he loved me then he said "it was just not to hurt your feelings" and I know it's meaningless because he also tells other girls as a joke he always compliments their hair, their head,  and how they are so beautiful and he tells everyone I'm so ugly and stupid and im also pissed at the girls who knew I liked him and are all over him touching his head and shit and moaning on him, and hugging him. Which pisses me the fuck off.  Who could blame them they are sexy with their big boobs and big asses while I have glasses and braces and a flat ass I'm so ugly I even have small boobs which makes me feel self conscious I feel as though I can't do anything right (Posting again I want to kill myself I swear)
