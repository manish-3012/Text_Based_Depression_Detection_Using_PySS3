Need to ventSo Iâ€™ll be real blunt because i need to get this off my chest. 
I cheated on my wife with a woman. They are acquaintances. 
Now, itâ€™s come out and only a few people know. I may have ended up throwing my entire life away because of one stupid action. My job. My marriage. My future. Wife doesnâ€™t know yet. And honestly, have thought about ending it all. I need help. Help me see past this.
