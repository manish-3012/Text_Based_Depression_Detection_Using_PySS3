I was very close to ending things yesterdayIt was finally the right time to do it . I've been pondering it for 6 months or so . Called suicide hotlines like crazy to the point where some workers recognised my voice after a while . 

I was a horrible person in my teenage years . I had a drinking problem and now that I'm sober I can see clearly all the damage I've caused . I was such a fucked up person. Some of it I can't even blame on drinking it was just my character and disgusting brain . I don't know why I acted the way that I did . 

Anyways it was late and when I thought of ending things for the first time I didn't feel fear or tension in my stomach I felt at peace . It was almost spiritual and mediative like I finally accepted that it was okay to go now . 

For the first time in months I felt relief from the daily hell that I live in  . Not yoga before bed relief not saying good things about yourself relief not talking to a friend relief . Pure calm and stillness .


I tried to hang myself with a guitar cable but that didn't work . I didn't know it was so hard I just assumed you choked yourself and you fell asleep.

I walked to a bridge to finish the job but it was cold and I didn't want to feel the pain of hitting the ground . I called the suicide hotline and the woman sounded so terrified and scared that I didn't have it in me to put her through me dying on the phone .

I walked home and now I'm here again . Another day in pure agony that will not stop unless I self medicate or end my life . 

Someone please for the love of God help me .
