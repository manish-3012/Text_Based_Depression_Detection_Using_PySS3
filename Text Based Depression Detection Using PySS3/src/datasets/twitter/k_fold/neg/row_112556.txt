I have joined your fightA friend of mine, a brother of my niche, took his life right after his birthday.  He gave me my first beer at college.  No matter how hard it seems, more people than you know are willing to help you through it.  Never give in.  You, and those that love you, are stronger than everything you think makes this selfless action the right choice.

RIP you generous son of a bitch
