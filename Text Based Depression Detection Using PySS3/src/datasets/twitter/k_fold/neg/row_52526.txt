I can't see why notIt's just my spouse and I and we're just waiting for a divorce as he's much happier when I'm not around. I  have no friends, he has no friends, I work a night job where I'm literally the only person in the office. I'm as miserable at 32 as I was at 11 when I first started to notice how morbid my thinking was, it's been a parade of therapists and meds for 19 years and not one can say I'm not just an unhappy person. Other than not putting in my 2 week notice I can't justify any part of this line of thinking as selfish. Am I missing something? 

*edit* Thursday March 16th will be my last day at work
