I need adviceSo I have been suicidal for about three months now. I'm usually good at faking it and hiding my feelings. But, lately I have been the worst I have ever been. I went to school on Tuesday and I couldn't fake anything. I must have looked pretty empty and broken because EVERYONE I know asked me if I was ok. One of my good friends kept asking me what was wrong and of course I didn't say, " I want to kill myself and that's all I think about" I told him nothing. As the day progressed I started to feel worse because everyone made me feel so horrible about not being able to look normal anymore. Anyway, this friend kept trying to ask me and I can tell he really cares. Today was even worse and I really want to commit, but he is still trying to figure it out. I don't know if I should just tell him or not. The last friend I told, it completely ruined our friendship and I really care about him and don't want to lose him. I keep telling myself he's different but I know how these things work. I convince myself something and then I am completely disappointed. I have trained myself to not open up to people or let them past a certain wall of mine because I always get hurt. I need help, should I tell him or not? Opinions?
