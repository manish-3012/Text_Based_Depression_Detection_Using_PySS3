seattle suicide tomorrowHey guys. I was staying with family in Seattle while i went back to school for an online software degree. I had to move out to make room for their new baby. Tommorrow I will have run out of money and will have no place to live so ive decided to rent a uhaul and pipe the exhaust to enclosed area in back to end myself rather than be homeless. It feels like a waste because i have 10+ years in software and can do all the latest cloud stuff and i am physically fit so i can do labor jobs and i am in the middle of the job application process after applying for 100s of jobs. Even if i get a job today where do i sleep at night until my first paycheck comes? Its depressing and im not sure what to do so anyway thats my plan.
