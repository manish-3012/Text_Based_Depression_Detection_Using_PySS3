I don't want to die I just continue to make choices that are unhealthy.My family has a history of suicide. My grandfather and sister that I know of.. I don't want to die but each day I make unhealthy choices.  I suffer from alcoholism since the age of 13. I was molested by an older sibling as a kid. I forgave him because I know he was messed up too. I got pregnant at 14 and my kiddo just turned 18. He is great but I have failed him in lots of aspects. 

I somehow was able to create a decent career and income out the chaos so that at least isn't factoring in. Most days I wake up riddled with anxiety and self hate. I can't seem to forgive myself for past mistakes and am a constant embarrassment to myself. If I dont get up and go to work there is very minimal I want to do. I am addicted to my phone. I cant break put of my self imposed self hate cage. I have a decent house but don't show it the respect I should. Sure the pills have provided temporary fixes in the past but I don't want to relay on it. My problem is I have numbed myself for so long idk how it is to feel normal.  It's like I live through one shitty scenario after the next.  

Death doesn't scare me and the only reason I feel I am still here is for my kids. I cant intentionally take my life and leave them. But here I am everyday just a shell of a miserable human who struggles to find happiness.  I know my purpose is to provide and that does make me happy. But nothing else brings any type of joy. Not nature, not shopping,  not creating. And it might have to do with my addiction to my phone. 

Just want to say to anyone else who struggles you aren't alone. And knowing others experience my same pain is comforting as messed up as that is. One of the ways I got through being a teen parent was telling myself I wasn't alone. I wasn't the first or last to go through it.
