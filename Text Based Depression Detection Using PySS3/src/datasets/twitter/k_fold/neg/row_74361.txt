Nobody gives a shit. Why should i?It's been a while SW. It has. It got better, but now i don't know where to go. I just want it to stop. I'm now a complete social reject. I have 1 friend. Its sad that I've let it get this far. My only interaction with the world is Reddit and my single friend. So i sit here once again. At the same place I've been for 3 years now. Heading towards 20 still alone, no love, no care. I have yet to see what affects this medication overdose will do. But i hope for the worse. Goodbye. This time i hope it comes to a close. Love you all. Bye
