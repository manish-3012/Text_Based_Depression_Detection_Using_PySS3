Update on meSo Iâ€™m basically just ranting here but I did go to the doctor as one dude suggested and Iâ€™m doing fine I had a really bad panic attack the other day and now Iâ€™m void of emotions. I really donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m happy or upset or angry. I was is a good mood earlier but i couldnâ€™t tell if it was a manic episode. I still have tons of thoughts of suicide and been planing out how Iâ€™m going to do it I just donâ€™t know if itâ€™s gonna be soon
