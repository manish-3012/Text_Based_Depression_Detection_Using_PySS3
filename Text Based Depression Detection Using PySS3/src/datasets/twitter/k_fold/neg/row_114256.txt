My life isn't going to get any better than this, funny thing is.. I am miserable right now.I am 19 years old and I go to a pretty well respected university. I am lonely, anxious and unhappy. I know exactly where I want to go after I graduate the next two years or so, but I know I will not make it. My GPA is shit and I am stupid, even worse I have to compete with pre-med assholes. No one gives a shit about you here, or that's what it feels like. I already owe around 10K. My family lives a reasonable distance from here and they are in no shape to financially support me. I pity my family. My dad is unemployed and my mom goes to the food bank pretty often. I pity myself, I am a self loathing pathetic piece of shit. No one deserves to deal with me, I am boring and sad. I have been screwing up lately in my classes, I have no motivation anymore. I keep fooling myself into thinking people do care about me. Sometimes I look for the smallest shred of kindness even within the most mundane of situations. But, most of the times I read far into the bad of things. It's mothers day, I care about my mom too much. In this horrible mess of a world, she is the sweetest person I will ever know. She will never turn against me. It irritates me that if I were to hurt myself, she will be the one who will suffer the most. Life is unfair. It is cruel and irrational. I could keep going, but I have a paper to write. I am tired of being happy just to please everyone else, it is exhausting and frustrating. When I was a kid, others used to ask me why I smile so much. I don't fuckn know, jesus christ. Well, now I am tired of being happy. Because I am not. The last thing I want to do is bother or hurt anyone else, I already do a lot of that. So I will stop here.

I'd be lying if I said this rambling did not help, I feel a little better knowing someone out here knows now.
