my husband wants to kill himselfMy husband told me that he wanted to kill himself. Heâ€™s discussed it with his parents, who think weâ€™re getting him back in the right frame of mind.

He has withdrawn from me so much in the last few months, and I donâ€™t know how to get him completely back. 

Itâ€™s devastating. I donâ€™t want the holidays to end, as he mentioned he had thought about doing it afterwards. I canâ€™t concentrate at work, I worry about being away from the house. Iâ€™ve gone over and over plans in my head that I think will work to get him to stay. And not just force him to stay, but make him want to fight to stay with me. 

I want everyone on here to know you are wanted and loved by someone, whether you know it or not. Whether you accept it or not. I wish nothing more than to take away the pain that pushes you to this point. I canâ€™t imagine what youâ€™re going through.
