Lost In My Own Conscience. My Mind Has Become a Prison.I'm so incredulously torn between right and wrong that my own thoughts have begun to eat me alive. I thought for so long about how weak I would seem if I had told anyone about my true mindset. I'm a well respected figure at my school, and people depend on me. People look up to me and even come to me for advice. I can't show that I've lost hope because doing so will cause others to do the same. But I'm dying soon anyway. I refuse to die a coward's death. For weeks, I've been picking fights with strangers in alleys downtown. One of these men will kill me eventually. But even if they don't, I'll die soon anyway. My imminent death is inescapable.
