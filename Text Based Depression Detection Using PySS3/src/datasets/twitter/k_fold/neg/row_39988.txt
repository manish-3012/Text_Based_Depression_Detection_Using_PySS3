suicidal after 5+ years since attemptI am 5+ years clear of my last suicide attempt and serious suicidal ideation, but recently the thoughts have returned extremely heavily.  I have gone through stages in my life just as anyone else does (childhood, middle school, high school, college), and I keep telling myself through each state that it's going to get "better", but it doesn't get better.  Things change, but it's never better or worse.  I'm not one to fall into binary definitions of life.  I know my life holds value and I know there is no "good" or "bad", only the way in which we interpret experiences.  I just experience so much suffering and sadness, and I'm tired of trying to make the best of every situation.  I genuinely just want this life to be over.  I don't want to suffer anymore.
