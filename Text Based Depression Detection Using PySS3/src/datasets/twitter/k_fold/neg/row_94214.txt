My girlfriend is supportive but being honest just embarrasses me.I've been honest about my suicidal thoughts and she understands. I hate putting that on her, I hate that she knows now. I don't want her to treat me differently, or feel bad for me. I told her intending to vent and now just feel like an attention seeker and feel shame
