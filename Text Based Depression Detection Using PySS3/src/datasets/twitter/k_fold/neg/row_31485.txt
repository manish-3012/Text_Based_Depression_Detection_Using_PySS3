I wish I died in DecemberI donâ€™t know what the fuck is wrong with me, I lost it and stabbed myself in December and I truly wish indidnt ask for help after I did it, I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m carrying on, everyone is telling me to do it for myself but I donâ€™t want it for myself, I never did, it doesnâ€™t make a difference to me because Iâ€™m still me doing ducking nothing at the end of the day. Itâ€™s been like this for so long, 6 years itâ€™s been like this and I really do not have the strength to just keep going along with this bullshit. I canâ€™t think of a reason to do anything, Iâ€™m so fucking  sick of feeling like this 24/7, Iâ€™m so fucking sick of just carrying on listening to people say it will get better, it never ever gets better. I do the same shit everyday, my mind is so fucked up and I canâ€™t even get over my own thoughts sometimes, itâ€™s getting less sad and just more crazy, I donâ€™t know what to feel, I donâ€™t want to carry on Iâ€™m only here because of people that made me, I am so fucking tired and done. No one wants to accept the fact your fucked up, it makes no difference to them, â€œhelpâ€ never worked and itâ€™s hard believing it will ever . I know im fucked up, but at least I know who I am. Thatâ€™s all I have, thatâ€™s all I will ever have, this fucking bull shit everyday, after what Iâ€™ve done I deserve to die, itâ€™s all I want, all I fucking want, why am I such a fucking pussy. I know deep down Iâ€™m a beautiful person inside so why do I do so much terrible shit, I donâ€™t even make sense, Iâ€™m happy if I just ceased to exist, I will feel nothing, never again
