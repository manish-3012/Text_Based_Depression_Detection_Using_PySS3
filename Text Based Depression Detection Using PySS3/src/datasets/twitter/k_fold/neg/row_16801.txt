I want to do itI am angry with myself. I have done bad bad things in my life and I don't deserve to be alive but I don't want to hurt my family. I don't want to leave my pets but I feel I have to. I have things to look forward to but I know that that will be over too and then I will be right back here. I am so weak, so tired, and so useless. I have been through this so many times but I can't die. 
I am sorry for wasting your time.
