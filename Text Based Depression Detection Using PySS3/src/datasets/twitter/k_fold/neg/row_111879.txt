I think the universe is telling me I should do it.Everytime I try to get help, something bad happens. I was going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow, but the weather changed for the worse. I'm seeing a counselor, but he basically told me I'm a loser. My friends just plain avoid me now. Maybe it really is just for the better.
