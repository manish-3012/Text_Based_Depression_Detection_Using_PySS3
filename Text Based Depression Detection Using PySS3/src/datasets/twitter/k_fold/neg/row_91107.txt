Was suggested hanging myself, doesn't sound so bad.My only parent (my mother) just told me to hang myself. Long story so I won't go into it. 

Honestly, doesn't sound like a bad idea. I have a lump in my throat right now, I've never felt like this before. 
I think I've gone through enough shit and failed in the end.
