Is it really worth it in the end?21F here. I have to say it is hard pushing through the days when you feel like you have nothing to live for (besides failure and great amount of student loan/medical debt!). I have been depressed for years, even on medication for two of them. Therapy seems to just dull the pain of depression. I work in the medical field so I have watched a number of kids and even adults attempt suicide. It almost makes me think "If I were to do it, I would know exactly what to do" but then when I actually think about doing it, I just can't.  

 It is also hard hearing someone you love and thought actually loved you back say "I just want to be with someone who enjoys life and is happy to be alive." Will I ever be happy to be alive? Will I ever really enjoy life? Another thing I got is "It is hard being with someone who is always so negative and upset all the time." To really think of it, I don't know if i'd want to be with me either. It is so fucking tiring waking up every day and dealing with that same weight on my shoulders, the black cloud hanging over my head. I wish I could die without having to kill myself. I just want to feel actually loved and not like a burden to everyone. Why is life like this?
