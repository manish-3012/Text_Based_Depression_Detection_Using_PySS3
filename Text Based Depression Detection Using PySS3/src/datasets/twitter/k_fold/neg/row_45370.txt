When the person you truly love throws you awayI spent the last 3 years of my life with someone who truly brought the best out of me and made me truly happy! And despite the problems we went through, where she cheated on me and it made me an angry person, we got through that and we had been so happy together and she told me she wanted to spend her life with me and I let her into my heart, mind and soul and I would have given anything for her. But then she leaves me over text one day and is on dating sites after not even a week.

Now I feel so hurt and in so much mental pain because of this, knowing I will never be with that person who lets me be my self and be so comfortable around her, I will never have that true love again, I had been in relationships before and when I met her she showed me how bad they were and how nobody would ever match up to her again, I don't want to spend my life mourning over her as it will be hell, I just can't go on without her.
