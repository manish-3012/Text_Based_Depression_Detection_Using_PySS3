Just donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m supposed to keep doing thisItâ€™s just an ongoing thing, but tonight itâ€™s really bad. I just kind of always want to die.. I wasnâ€™t really supposed to make it to 20, I wasnâ€™t supposed to graduate high school and then I graduated college. I keep finding reasons to convince myself I want to stay living but I donâ€™t. I have a partner and I live by my family again, and my almost 15 yo sister is at my house all the time and now. 

Two weeks ago I had another bad day, moment, freak out whatever. I had a call center job that gave me a lot of anxiety and I took one call my first day out of training (where I had taken calls about 50% of the days) and I had a bad panic attack, took the day off, and then my mom came over. I was going to try to stay at my job but my mom was nagging that I was going to quit because I was being too negative and I told her I wasnâ€™t going to and I didnâ€™t think I was that mad. When I get mad though I hurt myself, and I slam my head into walls. This time it was a corner and my mom witnessed/pulled me away when blood started pouring and my sister and partner came and cleaned me up and calmed me down. It wasnâ€™t too bad and I just have a tiny cut/scar and most of the swelling is gone. 

Since then I havenâ€™t felt okay. I left my job the next morning even though my partner has been between jobs since we moved so we have no income and no savings even though heâ€™s starting work next week and Iâ€™ve got interviews back to back. I havenâ€™t had money to get new clothes and I just keep dropping in sizes. It used to be intentional but I have stomach problems and I discovered Iâ€™m lactose intolerant last year so eating is harder for me now. Sometimes it sounds like Iâ€™m complaining when things â€œarenâ€™t that badâ€. But itâ€™s not that, whatever to my IBS and whatever to food. Nothing pleases me anymore, I donâ€™t desire anything. Food doesnâ€™t satisfy me, I donâ€™t really drink, wxxd helps but Iâ€™m losing interest in it. Tv and movies make me dissociate and and feel icky, Jenna marbles left youtube, I wonâ€™t do theme parks with covid, I upset my friends a month ago and theyâ€™re too toxic to kiss up to again, I hate using my phone but sometimes Iâ€™ll play tap tap games to waste the day. Every night I just wish that I could pass away and not have to deal with another day but I keep waking up. 

I donâ€™t want anything for myself, I just wish I could die without it hurting the people I care about most. I wish I could live without wanting to die so bad. I wish I could want to want anything. I canâ€™t afford therapy and my mom doesnâ€™t think it worked/works, same for meds. I wonâ€™t be on my own insurance until I start another job. The call center temp to hire insurance didnâ€™t cover therapy. This isnâ€™t the first time I hit my head against a wall, this isnâ€™t the first time my sisters had to pick up the pieces, my partner is used to me like this now, my dad is mad at me but in the â€œI just want to helpâ€ way, my mom has seen this for years now. Iâ€™m tired of making them watch this. Iâ€™m tired of scaring people. I spend all day just trying to treat them as nice as possible to make up for feeling like a monster. Iâ€™m tired of being a monster. My partner is sick today and is sleeping and canâ€™t stay up like I need him to, my sister and her friend are in the other room. I have debated on waking my sister up, but I donâ€™t know if I need to or if I should. 

I just canâ€™t keep living like this. Iâ€™m at my end. Iâ€™m scared to ruin everyoneâ€™s life by killing myself, but it feels like Iâ€™m in hell no matter what we do that day. I donâ€™t know how often I feel this bad, but itâ€™s been a long time this time, and itâ€™s been off and on since I was, 13, 11, younger? Iâ€™m 20 now and Iâ€™ve graduated college and high school and I should have this figured out by now. I just donâ€™t know how much longer I can live through this. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m in danger tonight, but I just donâ€™t think thereâ€™s anything that can make this better.
