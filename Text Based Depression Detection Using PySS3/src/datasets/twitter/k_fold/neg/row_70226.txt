im sick of thinking about what my suicide will do to the ones i love.My son died in my arms 14 years ago, and honestly it never ever gets easier, my life has got exponentially worst in every way. soon my parents will die, il never be able to afford a house despite working every day of my life. Im so lonely. i have alot of family who love me but at the end of the day i am alone and cant keep existing just so i dont hurt them. I want to move on and see my little boy again. My opinion hasnt changed in 14 years, i want to do it as pain free and quickly as possible, unfortunately i live in england so cant use a gun. What options do it have? Serious answers only please
