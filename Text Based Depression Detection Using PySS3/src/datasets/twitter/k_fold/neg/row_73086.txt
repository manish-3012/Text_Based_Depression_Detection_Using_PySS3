Itâ€™s not a matter of â€œthings will get betterâ€. Sometimes life just fucking sucks for some people.I hate being told â€œthings will get betterâ€. How do you know that? You donâ€™t even know me, are you a psychic? Can you read the future? Yes some people have been saved but not everyone can be saved. Some people canâ€™t be saved.

I donâ€™t want to live for other people. Iâ€™m suffering everyday and Iâ€™d rather be dead, because the pain of being alive is too much. I just want out. 

Life isnâ€™t definitely that pretty if 800k people kill themselves/or attempt to, annually.  Some people are just destined to die by their own hands. Suicide has existed since the beginning of history. Even â€œthe great onesâ€ those scientists and â€œwalking brainsâ€ have killed themselves.

Suicide happens when the thought of being alive becomes unbearable. Being alive hurts you, in all ways. Physically and mentally. That much that Iâ€™d rather not exist to not be obliged to live with my definitely not bearable reality.

Whatâ€™s the point of being alive if youâ€™re emotional state is sadness, is it worth living when youâ€™re crying all the time, why should I live if thatâ€™s how I feel due to the rejection and neglect of those who â€œdonâ€™t want me to die and will bawl their eyes out and bring me flowers at my funeralâ€? Oh thatâ€™s right, I should live for other people. Fuck out of my face. If my purpose in life is to not make you feel â€œbadâ€ about it, and make you shred two or three tears out of your eyes for less than 3 mins, they I definitely donâ€™t want to be alive.
