I've felt this way since a childHello all, I'm 23m
And as far as I can remember I've never wanted to be here.
My childhood was full of domestic violence and drug abuse.
And I've never felt truly loved or cared for
But I'm a coward
When I was 9 I would go to the kitchen everynight and hold a blade to my wrist
Crying because I couldn't cut myself.
Crying because I want to die
Over the years as growing to an adult I have experienced nothing but turmoil and shame 
I try to be a good person and am never foul to another soul
And recently I aquired something real in my life 
And I love her so much
But things quickly changed 
She's stuck on her abusive ex

The thing is I've never felt this way about anyone 
I've always had to force myself to love people 
But with her it's different
I didn't have to force anything 
I got to be me with her
Told her more about myself than I've ever told anyone 

But I don't have her anymore 

And I think I'm ready to get this life over with 

It's not just the heartbreak 
I've numbed that
This goes deeper 
And this is the only thing that feels right.
I don't know when I'll finally reach the ultimate peace 
But I plan to runaway soon 
Probably hop trains and live as a junkie for abit. 
They always said I'm just like my father so I'm going to be that before I die.

I really don't know why I've written this out 
And I don't really think I can change this 

Thanks for reading.
