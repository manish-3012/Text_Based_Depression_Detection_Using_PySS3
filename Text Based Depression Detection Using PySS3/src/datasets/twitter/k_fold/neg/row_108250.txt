I've been hearing "Don't do it, just don't give up, it gets better" for nearly ten years....and it's only gotten worse.I've hated my life for as long as I can remember. My earliest memory is of sitting in my crib pushing my face in my pillow so my mom wouldn't hear my crying because she and her boyfriend were screaming. I remember putting my hands over my ears so I wouldn't hear him hitting her and thinking *stop please stop* and I eventually cried myself to sleep.

I've tried to kill myself twice in the past (at 13 and 18), and for the past two years have thought about it at least every day. I should probably go talk to someone but A) I'm too nervous B) my family would tell me to just grow up and C) I have no money/insurance/transportation anyway, even if I wasn't scared of everything. I can recognize that I don't want to die, I just want to get out of this situation, but being dead sounds like an acceptable alternative. I'm sick of being unable to function because I'm afraid of everything. I'm sick of having to live up to peoples' expectations or be considered a burden. I'm sick of living with the man who raped me and having to pretend that it didn't happen. I'm sick of being told that I'm wasting my time in school because my major is crap. I'm sick of not being able to live the way I want to. I've tried so many things to make it better - I've tried letting things go to avoid fighting, I've tried fighting to stick up for myself, I've taken a step back, I've taken the plunge, I've moved to start over, I've gone back to start at the root of the problem. I've forced myself through a job I didn't want in order to make other people happy (and had to quit three weeks later after I broke down crying in front of everyone).

It's just never enough. You get over what seems like a mountain and everyone acts like it was an anthill, and then it's time for something even bigger. I hate it here so, so much. I don't want to be here but I have nowhere to go. I can't even save up any money because I'm too scared to get my driving license, let alone an actual job. Sometimes I have to skip classes because I get too nervous. I'm just mooching off of everyone wherever I go.

I don't know. I look around me and I honestly don't know a single person who is content with their life. My grandmother retches all night long because of the cancer and comes home in tears from her shitty job. My mother lost custody of her youngest children and is lucky to see them once a month - she too works under stress all day before collapsing at home. My best friend went through 6 years of college and McDonald's won't even hire him. He openly tells me that he has been thinking about killing himself every day too. Another friend lost her baby and is stuck with a fiancee she hates - and she was hospitalized a few months ago for attempting suicide. Her mother is so poor that they are lucky to eat once a day and only have toilet paper if they can steal it from a public restroom. Everyone hates their life but can't change it. I don't want to go through another fifty years of this. The small happiness in life is not worth all the bullshit that you have to put up with.

I've tried ranting about it and I don't even want to talk about it anymore. The other day my best friend and I were at a hotel on the 10th floor on the balcony and we both (independently) considered jumping. It would be so quick. Just one fall and everything, all the good but all the bad as well, would be over. I don't know. I'm probably too scared to do that. I wish someone would just kill me so I wouldn't have to.
