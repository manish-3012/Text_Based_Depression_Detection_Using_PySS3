Broke up, lost the love of my life, Feel like giving up.Please give advise.

Hey everyone. I'm going through a very rough break up and I feel like my world is falling apart, I know it sounds cliche. I have been having random thoughts of hurting myself, and I definitely have the means to do so. I'm not sure I'm capable of going through with it but the pain is still very real. I have so much to say but I will summarize it as best as I can so that readers get some reasonable insight.

EDIT: I Deleted story of my life, and left the TLDR since i realize it was too long.

TL:DR Been depressed since childhood, always lonely and an outsider. I found the love of my life, and learn what it means to be happy. Sadly that only lasted 2 years,the following two years things started going out of control. We began to fight a lot, sex was happening less frequently and my depression and procrastination led to a lot of broken promises(things will get better, I'll get help,etc.) She broke up with me because lack of sex caused by my ED and trouble communicating. All i want to do is beg her to give me another chance, Even though I've been doing that for the past year an a half. I realize that I shouldn't have to beg someone to be with me, but I do want to be the person that she loves, and change for the better, It's just taken too long for me to do something about it.

I feel like shit, I don't know if I can move on. I will never meet anyone that I am as comfortable with as I was with my EX. I will always love her and regret all the pathetic excuses that I've made in the past. I hate that i procrastinated so much and didn't try harder. I realize that looking to the stars and hoping doesn't do shit. I want to give up. I feel like nothing is worth living for anymore. Someone please help.
