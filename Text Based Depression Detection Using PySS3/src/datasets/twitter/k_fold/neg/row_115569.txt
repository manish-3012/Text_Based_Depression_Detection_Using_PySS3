Hoping to enjoy my last few months.Hey everyone.

I'm 17 years old and have been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a child and have done therapy with no positive results. I'm planning to end my life on my 18th birthday in 4 months. My parents know that I've been suicidal and have taken me to appointments and have been a great support system for me, but I've made my decision and my decision is final. If you have any suggestions for me to enjoy my last few months on earth, I would really appreciate it if you told me.

Thank you for taking the time to read this. It means a lot.
