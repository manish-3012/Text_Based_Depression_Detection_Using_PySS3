I failed at being a son/personMy parents don't have a son anymore. They never actually quite did. I always caused trouble. I made them worry and cause trouble almost literally since I was born. Everything from medical problems over beating up kids in Kindergarten to conflicts with my parents. I could never handle basic situations like a normal person.

Now they're just disappointed in me. They know about drugs, I suck at school, I can't even talk more than a few words. There is not a single positive aspect they could tell about me. I can't change anything about all this fucking shit.

Just why do I have to exist when I have no purpose to exist? Not even my friends have any benefit from me since I can't bring myself to talk or do anything significant.

Edit: A big, big thank you for everyone who took time for me, it really means a lot to me. God bless you all, I'm glad all of you exist!
