Planning on killing myself soonProbably pop some pills or jump off the nearby cliff by the beach. I've struggled for years, called a survivor. I can't survive if it means living in pain every day. I wish I could apologize to everyone who I'll end up hurting because of me dying but I can't and honestly at this point part of me doesn't even care what happens, once I'm dead I won't think or feel or really need to worry about that anyway which I know is selfish but I'm terrible anyway so people should have stopped expecting things from me a long time ago.
