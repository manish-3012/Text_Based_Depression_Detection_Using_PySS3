I need helpWhen i was a young girl, i got sexually assaulted by 3 different man. My dad, my grandpa and what i called a brother. Lately, i've been trying to make everyone happy but myself. i always try to make everyone around me happy. i am tired of not having my own opinions, because i always do and say what i think my parents want to heard. i am afraid to be my own person. i am 17 years old. Today i decided that it was time for me to share how i was feeling to my adoptive parents, they took my phone away which is not a big deal and they got mad at me. that is what is making me sad, that i cannot even talk to my own family. i feel so freaking lonely. i am too afraid to commit suicide because i truly love people, but i am just not happy with who i am with them and i dont feel like myself. I will be turning 18 years old in May, and i am hoping to move out.
