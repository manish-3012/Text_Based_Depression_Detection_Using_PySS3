I did it.I took the pills, all of them, I'll be dead within a few hours. Sources vary. No one will find me before then so it's fine but damn if it doesn't hurt. And my heart is beating like a drum and I'm starting to get really tired.

I keep hoping none of this is real, that the past 15 years of my life didn't really happen. My parents alcohol addiction and their emotional abuse, my brother sexually assaulting me, my teachers blaming me for things others did. 99% of people see a fucking troublemaker who fucks everthing up and 1% sees me as a victim, of a lot of trauma. Honestly the truth is probably somewhere between the two but who knows. No one, and no one ever will.
