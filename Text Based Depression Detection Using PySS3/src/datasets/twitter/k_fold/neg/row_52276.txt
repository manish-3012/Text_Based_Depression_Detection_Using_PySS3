Some Family Problemnever be good with my family.  My father is a bad person, I never had a proper relationship with my mother, I never knew him until 9 years of age.  my sisters always criticized me.  My brother was just beside me (not always).  everything happened thanks to them.  I hate them.  I wish I had gone to the "nursery" when I left my father.  Now I said "fuck it" to all of them and when I get 18 I will leave.
