After causing so much pain to my family, the only honorable thing to do is to die tonightMy mother, father, sister, brother, and grandmothers--I have brought great shame to my family. There's no going back from this damage that I have inflicted upon them. I have a very detailed plan of ending my life tonight because I have no grit to face life after what I have done. Basically, old habits die hard and I deserve this.

When I was in high school, I was a decent student. Had a lot of college-level classes, decent GPA, volunteering experience. On paper, I looked good. But inside, I was dead. I spent many hours hiding in my room. Spending so many hours reading fanfiction and wasting my life away. I had acquired bad habits such as getting terrible sleep and was overweight as a result from lack of exercise and poor eating habits.   I blamed it on the fact that I went to three high schools in different states. I couldn't make friends and I was broken in that regard. It ended up where I was doing the majority of my schoolwork at school, despite taking college-level courses and succeeding. I was underachieving despite this. Anything useful or noteworthy that I have done, was because my parents pushed me into it.

It started when I was accepted in a great college and my major was in Engineering. I never wanted to do Engineering, but my parents would finance my bills if I were to attend this college with that particular major. Intending to have good grades and find myself. My Grandmother was happy to finance me $10,000 for my college education. I had a scholarship and student loans. Things were going to be good and I had a shining future in a top college with one of the hardest degrees the college offered.

Or so I thought.

I stopped going to classes. Stopped doing the homework. Stop studying. I would go days without eating, getting proper sleep, and sometimes, even showering. I would go outside and walk at 2am in the college campus. I could not recognize myself and couldn't believe that my actions were destroying me. I felt dead inside. My grades that semester were F, D, C, B, B. I ended up having a subpar GPA of 1.2.

So when my parents learned of my grades, they decided to refinance for my Spring Semester. I thought I could fight the darkness. But I ended up withdrawing from all of my courses, because the habits happened again, my parents recognized this because I wasn't returning their phone calls. They even called the cops on me, and I had the miserable moment of being escorted by the police to the University Counselling Services. They diagnosed me with Major Depressive Disorder. Ended up going to a few counselling sessions but it didn't help.

Then, I lived with my parents and worked as a cashier in a grocery store for the summer. My parents insisted that I attend the college again for the fall. I felt afraid because of how I failed before and didn't want them to spend more money on me. My mother even milked my Grandmother for more money. 

Same patterns as in the first semester, except I didn't even show up for the finals. I got a part time job and quit. I used most of the money to fuel take-out while never leaving the dorm for a whole month. My GPA now: 0.93 and 4 F's with 1 C. I basically pissed away the money.

I'm wondering why my parents didn't disown me. Why my mother is hunting to send me again when I have already failed so many times before and I'm $10,000 in debt from student loans. And so much more money at a deficit from my Parents and Grandmother.

My first instinct is to get two low-paying jobs, working 10 hr shifts in hope that I can repay back the money. But it isn't about the money. It's about the pain I have caused my family and for being the epitome of a failure when I had everything provided for me. I just had to fight--except when it came to it, I ran. Just like I always do. Retreat, mope, retreat, and eat away the patience and resources of my family.

My father called me a wean, and stated he wants to disown me. Am I so surprised? Look at what I have done. The destruction to them. I am a monster.

It's too late for me, I believe. I pissed away the money and the resources and have given my family a bad name. I am a monster.

So I plan to end it tonight because I am a monster and this world needs less leaches. At least I can recognize that I am one. And am I going to change my ways? I wish that was the case. But after 3 failed attempts, I am out. I really don't want to die, but what choice do I have? I am unable to do well academically, and keep going into old patterns of failure. I am not fit for the opportunities that my life has to offer. I am not fit for my family.

 So I must die for I am scum. I cannot trust myself to change my ways.
