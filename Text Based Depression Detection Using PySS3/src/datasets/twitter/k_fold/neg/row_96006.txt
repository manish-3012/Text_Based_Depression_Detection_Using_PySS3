Every night I want to kill myself.Two years ago the girl I liked started ignoring me completely, that itself isn't much of a problem but then one of my closest friends suddenly became my enemy and she brought a lot of people against me.. I became depressed and suicidal the next few months..

Last year I thought I had gotten over all this depression, but recently I realize that not a lot of people want to talk with me and I feel like everyone hates me and doesn't want to be my friend. And now my girl best friend whom I like seems like she doesn't want to talk to me anymore so now I feel so lonely. Every night I want to kill myself, just go to the kitchen and grab a knife and stab myself right in the heart, every night it gets stronger and stronger and now its unbearable. My best friend was the only one I could share with and now she doesn't seem like she wants to talk to me so it's best to end my life now..
