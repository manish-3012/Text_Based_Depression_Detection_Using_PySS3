I'm so sorry Mom.Hi all
I have frequented this sub for some time and have constantly felt uplifted by all the positive messages of hope and encouragement by posters here.  This post will more than likely get buried, but since I did not have anyone else I could share this message with, I thought it might be nice if I could leave this somewhere it could be seen.

Unfortunately, my time to leave has finally come and within a few hours it will finally be complete.  While the process is already in motion, I am going to drive to a secluded area so that I may not be found immediately.  At 29, life has simply become too hard for me to burden anymore.  I'm struggling to finish my undergraduate degree which should have been completed years ago, and my constant uphill battle with loneliness and depression have both mentally and physically defeated me.  I have no skills, and feel as though as I am a burden to myself and everyone around me.  I'm sorry I could not be stronger than most of the people here, but I feel as though this is the best action currently for me to take.  The last few months have made me realize that I am not good enough for anyone, or myself.  Take care, and thanks to all who provide such amazing support here.
