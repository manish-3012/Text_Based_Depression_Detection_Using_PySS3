I just want it to stop, pleaseI Just want to die! God! I'm just so f\*\*ckin sick of living! What's the point? honestly? I have an emotionally abusive ex girlfriend, a boyfriend who's only interested in sex and nudes, depression and sever anxiety. So many things have got me to this point - The only reason I'm still breathing right now is because *I* don't want to hurt my Family and friends. What is the point of living? I'm being 1oo% serious right now, Someone tell me why I should live - cause I only see one reason and I'm not sure that it's good enough anymore. I'm not skinny, I'm not pretty, I'm not smart, I'm not confident and I have no real skills. The only reason by boyfriend talks to me is so that he can get his rocks off! Not that I've let him. I'm not even sure that I want to be with him anymore - but I *Can't* break up with him... I've already ended it twice in the past, then we got back together - if I do it again people are gonna call me a "sl\*t" or a "wh\*re" again. like I know that my life could be way worse, but you know what?! I'm done!  I should have just died when I was two from my leukemia. If my two year old self had known how sh\*tty life would get then I would have just ended it somehow.
