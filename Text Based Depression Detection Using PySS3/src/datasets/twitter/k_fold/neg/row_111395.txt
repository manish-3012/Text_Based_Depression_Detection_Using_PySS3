I've never felt worseI'm sitting in college alone right now and my eyes feel so heavy and want to burst out crying but i don't think i can anymore.

I've had a bad childhood but back when i was younger i had a few friends that i stook with for years of school, when college came around i talked less and less and my life got worse and worse.

Someone came into my life and made it the best I've ever felt for 2 years. Those 2 years sadly came to an end a few days ago. I always thought people who were heart broken were overreacting about how much it hurt but fuck i understand it all now. People around me are all so happy and im just tired of it all. I'm trying to hold all this shit in and put on a fake face, but its the hardest shit ever. 

I was depressed before my relationship and it felt so magical like it all went away when i was in it.  Now im not in it I feel worse about myself. I want to eat so much but at the same time i dont want to eat at all, ive never tried suicide because ive never wanted to hurt my mother. fuck im so close to crying now. 

I'm contemplating on not sending this mess because i dont want people to think im doing it for attention, i just want someone to talk to who understands the feelings, i understand i probably wont get any responses because im one of many people who are going through these suicidal thoughts and i cant imagine how people who have been through worse than me are feeling. 

I guess im just at my lowest point in life now but people who keep saying it will get better said that last time and its just getting worse.

My ex has blocked me everywhere and i cant get my mind off of her. i feel like shes the only person who can save me.

If i ever do kill myself and anyone who knows me sees this, then please dont blame yourself because i know thats what id do. just knoe i love you and im watching over you. im sorry for being a lazy disappointment.
