17 year old terribly bored with life, Thinking about suicide constantly for weeksI'm so god damn bored with life. I have no friends, wake up everyday and do the same old routine, have shit grades. Also have been suffering from intrusive thoughts for about 5 months now, so that doesn't help with these suicidal thoughts. I'm a very awkward and shy person, even with my parents/family, so I don't really know how I would tell them anything about this. I've posted on several comments sections on Youtube about my intrusive thoughts and have gotten 0 responses. I don't know if I should mention it to a doctor. There are days where they don't bother me too much but they're still there. Then there are days where they're unbearable and I'm almost convinced I'm going to actually do one of these things. Which I know I will NEVER do. At least not the ones that have to do woth violence and drugs. The suicide thoughts only came up about a month ago, whatever that's worth. Also is it normal to tell myself that going to a doctor about intrusive thoughts would be "overreacting" or "dramatic"? I'm stressed out most days because of them and get headaches because all these thoughts overlap over one another. At times I've felt I was a borderline schizophrenic.
