I can't bear this anymore..I don't exist to her anymore, after everything I gave, with what little I had I spent all my time with her, I sacrificed friends and family for her because we were long distance, I worked hard and saved up to finish school for her, after almost 4 years together her repayment after we had our ups and downs was meet a guy in less then a month and get engaged 2 months later in Hawaii because he was well off.. I gave her my heart, I had my problems sure, we even broke up for a day because I was tired of the distance, but I didn't really want it so we got back together and tried to work on things, she didn't work she didn't go to school, I tried to convince her to go to school because she was an excellent cook! But she was too scared didn't want to end up in debt, wanted someone to take care of her. I wasn't enough, now I don't exist, I don't think she ever truly loved me, and knowing that is breaking me, I am starting to really hate my human life, we are greedy and hateful people and I am one of them. I have no hope for this race and if it were up to me I hope we are all wiped off the face of existence because of what we are.. Can you change my mind? Because I'm on the precipice of death and I want the pain to end..
