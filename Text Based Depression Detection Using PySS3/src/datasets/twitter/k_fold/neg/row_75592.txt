I want to kill myself but...but..."the meds just need time to work", I have an interview in the morning and I don't want to be an inconvenience by not showing up, my boyfriend suffers from depression and I don't want give him any reason to not get better, then I'd never get to see my niece again and I love her to pieces, I don't want to hurt anyone, some small part of me thinks things can get better some time down the road, I don't have the balls, I haven't cleaned out my desk at work yet and I wouldn't want to burden someone with that task, I have an appointment with a new therapist in the morning, I don't want anyone to find me, I don't want to leave my brother as he is struggling with his own depression, I don't know if things are better on the other side...

Please, if anyone is out there...I don't know what else to do. I don't see this getting better. I have called everyone and I feel so alone. I don't know what to do. I don't know how I can be such a functional fuck up! I know I should be better, I just don't know how to be.

So, there you have it.
