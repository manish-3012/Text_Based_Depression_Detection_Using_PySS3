Why is my life pain?I feel like the whole world is out to get me. Everything in my life is just a build up to disaster.

The good things that happen are just taunts. They raise my hopes just to dash them

Nobody loves me. Am I so hideous? Disgusting? I don't feel ugly. I don't feel evil. Yet nobody gives a fuck. They just walk out on me when I need them most.

Fuck everyone. I hate them. I NEED them. Why can't they see that? Is it so hard to just be mt friend?

I can't fucking stand this. I hate this. I want to die. I hate my life. I have to get out of this fucking prison cell but there's no way. Every attempt at running just brings me back to the start. I'm just a hamster in a wheel.

I'm so unhappy. I can't remember what happiness feels like.

I hate evey second that I live. I want the sky to fall on me.

Just love me, someone. Someone give me back what I give. Please. 

Am I a monster in a world of men?
