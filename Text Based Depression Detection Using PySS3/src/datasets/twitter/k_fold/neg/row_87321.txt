Update?I havenâ€™t done it yet but I want to so bad. Iâ€™m tired of feeling less than worthy. I feel trapped in a relationship because of loneliness. My job doesnâ€™t feel like it is going to go anywhere. 

I know Iâ€™m being emotionally abused, but I donâ€™t feel any worth that I would find another. 

My friends have all forgotten about me. I reach out but they ghost me. Even after being close for years. 

Iâ€™m tired of life. Iâ€™m tired of struggling.
