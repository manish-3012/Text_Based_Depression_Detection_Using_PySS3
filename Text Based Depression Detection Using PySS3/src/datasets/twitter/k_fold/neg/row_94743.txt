I wish I could just leave and never come backI hate that I dont fit the all American mold. you know vibrant social life in high school and college, have the ability to just sit and focus for 8 hours a day, naturally make friends with out trying, be into football, etc. 

I have a hard time focusing at work and am afraid of losing my job for doing so. if that happens I will definitely end things. talk with God so that way he understands that I'm not happy on this earth. 

it just seems impossible for me to get that American dream everyone talks about and people either give preachy lectures or make fun of me for attempted and not just "living in the moment" like they do because you know things "happen when you least expect it." God how I wish that applied to me.
