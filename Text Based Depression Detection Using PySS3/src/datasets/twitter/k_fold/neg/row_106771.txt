I honestly don't know what to do anymore. So this passed year I've had thoughts of killing myself and thoughts of my self hatred come back it was getting to the point where I thought about suicide everyday things got a little worse but a little better day by day I had ups and downs more downs than ups usually but I was managing then my girlfriend of two years broke up with me she was really the only thing keeping me together the person who I could talk to after that things went down hill it's gotten to the point where I wake up thinking about killing myself and fall asleep thinking about it I honestly don't know what's stopping me from grabbing my gun and just ending it I'm trying to stay strong cause I'm like "I've made it this long I can do it" but that's wearing thin I've lost all ambition for the things I loved to do like mtg and politics and history but now most days when I'm not working I don't want to do anything but stay in bed and smoke cigarettes and when I get the energy to try and be social my friends have started ignoring me which makes sense I am annoying and useless but I don't know how long I can go anymore this is honestly my last option I have no where else to go .
