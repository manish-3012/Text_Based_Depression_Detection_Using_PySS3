very depressed without my dogour dog of 11 yrs got put to sleep yesterday. I've dealt with terrible depression since 2013.. in 2013, my mom died from an overdose. I was also getting bullied and outcasted in school. during those lonely years, I got close to my dog and he was the only one who really kept me together. he would lay in my room all day and all night and he would wait for me to come home from work. when I would get home from work, he would get so damn happy; now that he's gone, my life is so empty and lonely. everything is so empty and lonely now. I don't know how to explain it. I would look forward to seeing him everyday and now there's nothing. I don't feel unconditionally loved or protected anymore. I'm just empty. I've been sleeping a lot due to the fact that I don't really want to be alive anymore. I'm very alone without my dog. I'm not  going to act on any of my thoughts, but I don't want to live anymore. I just want to sleep.
