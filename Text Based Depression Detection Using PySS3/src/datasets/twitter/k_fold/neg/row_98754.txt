Being a girl does not make it easier to connect with people. I'm always objectified and abused this stigma needs to stop[This.](https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/f44ijz/rant_dating_as_a_woman_is_not_easier_finding_love/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)

I've moved country for manipulators who then just threatened to take my life in a foreign country. I've been raped and hit more times than I can count. I'm objectified on a daily basis. I have a dissosiative disorder that induces amnesia uncontrollably making me that much more vulnerable to shit and unable to work more than part time. I fantasize about dying a majority of the day. My existence is to be a slave. No one thinks about how I feel because it doesn't matter. I hope to have the courage to jump out my four story window soon
