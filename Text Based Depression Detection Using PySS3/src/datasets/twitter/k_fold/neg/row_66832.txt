I've got no other way out.This year has been a hard year for me. I'm so caught up in tech school work, my other school work, and my job that I've been completely stressed out. My grades are dropping. I get 1 day off a week. God, I'm so tired. It doesn't help that my boyfriend is at college for most of the time a few hours away. It's like problems and hardships build up over time. It's something after another. It's this assignment, then this anxiety over an event, then you're lonely. Now it's a fucking broken condom. Why? Why tf do i suck so bad at life? I have no idea what to do or where to go from here. I'm too young to deal with this. 

I feel like I ruin lives of everyone around me. My mom and dad's, my ex-friends, my bfs, my family's. I'm so sorry.
