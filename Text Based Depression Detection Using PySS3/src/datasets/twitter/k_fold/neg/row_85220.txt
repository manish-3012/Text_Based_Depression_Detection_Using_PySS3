Rock bottom.. time to get back up?This is it, I officially felt the worst about life today than Iâ€™ve ever felt. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for the better part of a year, depressed and extremely anxious for the better part of a decade. 

A little background info, Iâ€™m male and 22 years old.

About a year ago, I had to move back in with my mother as I was looking for another place to live with my old roommates. Those plans fell through and Iâ€™m still here. I have hit a new level of depression since, and usually hermit away in my room and play video games. My mother knew I felt a little bad sometimes, but didnâ€™t know today the extent of my depression.

My car broke down on the way home from work about a month ago, and instead of getting it towed and fixing it, I just left it there. I wanted to fix it, but I kept telling myself I was going to commit suicide and end it before I would have to deal with it. I loved to tell myself â€œTHIS is a sign, you wanted to kill yourself? Hereâ€™s your ticket to wither away and dieâ€ 

It all sounds strange... I know. I have trouble explaining it to myself, even more trouble explaining it to my mother. I finally broke down to her today; she basically interrogated me on why I lock myself away and why I havenâ€™t been proactively looking for somewhere else to live. I confessed that Iâ€™ve been extremely miserable. I told her about the nights I spend fantasizing ways to kill myself so no one would be too devastated. I told her I lied to her about where my car was( told her I got it towed to a shop), and that it was most likely impounded (it is). 

I was forgiven for lying, and I really shouldnâ€™t have been. She is my mom though and thankfully she is giving me another chance. I know what I was doing was selfish and unexplainable. I promise I have a good heart.

Tomorrow, Iâ€™m going to get my car back. And tomorrow, Iâ€™m going to schedule an appt with my old therapist. Today was the most Iâ€™ve ever wanted to die, and Iâ€™m tired of feeling like that, and I want to give life all Iâ€™ve got.
