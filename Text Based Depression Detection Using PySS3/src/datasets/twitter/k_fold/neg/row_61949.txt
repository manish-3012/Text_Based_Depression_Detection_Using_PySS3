Why is the easy way out so hard?I am finished trying to fight.  Everyone says that suicide is a permanent fix to a temporary problem...well, my temporary problem is going on 10 months now and it has a lifetime of implications.  I do not want to hurt anymore.  I am so tired of finding happiness for a few short days only to have that happiness smashed into a thousand pieces.  I hate the idea of letting someone get the best of me or being responsible for my actions but were it not for her I would not be in this place.
