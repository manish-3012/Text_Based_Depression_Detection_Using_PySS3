Did I take too much?Iâ€™m not too sure which subreddit this would have fit in so my apologies if Iâ€™ve chosen the wrong one. 

I took 2 Zopiclone 7.5mg pills and had a few shots of vodka while I was high on zopiclone. I feel like this isnâ€™t a dangerous dose but Iâ€™m not exactly too sure and itâ€™s making me panic. Thoughts ? Will I be okay?
