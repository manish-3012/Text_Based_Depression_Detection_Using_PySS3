I want to just cut my wrists and be done.I am drunk. and I am tired, tired of feeling this way. I need help but I can't seem to find it. The people I consider my friends are going to get worn down by me since I am only going to get worse and worse. Drinking is not a big problem for me but I just am tired of being myself. I don't know what to do anymore I am done. I am so tired. I don't think I can keep going anymore. I just want it to stop. The voices the noise, the screaming in my head just won't stop. I don't know what to do. It feeels like no one will listen and those that might I feel like I will just burden them I can't get out of this mindeset and I am just so tired. I have been drinking because it hurts to cut and I just can't stand it anymore. I have been able to hide the hurt for so long and so few know. I just can't hide anymore. Why should I stay alive even in this drunken state?
What is the point?
why should I not just bleed out on my floor?
I have just been crying for hours listening to avantasia and nothing feels good anymore. 

I don't know what to do anymore.
please someone help me
