19only thing stopping me is the thought of my dog missing me, I want a reason to live but can't find one. On the path to failing my 2nd year of uni. I don't want to disappoint my parents. I just want to escape and end it. The thought of working so hard just to die one day and be forgotten doesn't make sense to me. I am so insignificant, so small. I'm tired of everything. Moving all my life made it hard to keep friends, uni doesn't force social interaction like high school does so it's hard to make close friends I like to hangout with and can trust. I wish I had the motivation to change. I found out today that there are not many painless ways of dying, my best bet is a gunshot to the temple. Idk if I'm fortunate or not that I don't have access to a gun yet. I have an idea of what I want to become but don't think it's possible to get there/don't know how to get there entirely. I hate uni, I hate my courses, I hate studying, I want to drop out. Uni is quiet and depressing where I go. Asked Mom about at least a year off and her reaction wasnt good. Writing this out does feel good though. I don't really care how sad my family will be after I'm gone or how hurt they will be but just the thought of my dog waiting for me or looking for me in the house breaks my heart. I think if he dies somehow that'll break me too. We are a middle class family but my parents have given me everything I ever needed to succeed but I am a failure.
