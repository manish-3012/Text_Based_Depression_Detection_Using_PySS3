Why am I still hereI feel like Iâ€™m so alone. I know I have people around me that care about me, very deeply. I feel as if I canâ€™t ralelate to anyone around me, that I canâ€™t work my way into a permanent place in anyoneâ€™s life. Any progress that Iâ€™ve made matters to no one but myself, and my impact so insignificant I would only be remembered for how I left, and not what I had accomplished while I was here.
