does it really matter if you make it look like an accidenti've been thinking about doing it on and off for years, several methods, i've written at least 10 different drafts of notes, etc.  i used to obsess over making it look like an accident, but lately i've wondered what the point is - people are going to be sad either way, is it better if they never find out the truth?  should i just do something that expresses a very serious amount of intention, like make a rube goldberg machine to electrocute me and film it youtuber style?
