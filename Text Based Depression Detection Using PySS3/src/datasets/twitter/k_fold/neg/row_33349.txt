My first post here.My goal posts are a sham. I'm 22, graduated(barely) HS 3 years ago and have failed to get a job that stuck, have been living off of my parents and siblings since. 

I'm not clinical,  so not sure I'm allowed here, but hey, I've also never gone and got tested or treatment. 

My earliest thoughts of suicide were at 13, then 16, then near constant after mid way into sophomore year. 

I've never cut or really done much other than debate, but it's getting harder to care or try. 

I'm thinking of getting my Stimulas check, giving it to my step-brother, and spending a night out, party, so everything I want to, then kill myself. That's the current goal post. The last one was to see the release of Doom Eternal, a game I won't ever own or play and I wasn't even able to hold interest in online for more than a day. Before that was castlevania season 3. I don't remember what it was before that...taxes maybe. Wait to hear back from a job. I don't know.

I just....dont..want to. I am selfish and cruel and hate everything about me when I care, so I learned to restrain that and now I'm apathetic and can't remember how to care, and everytime I start to I start to see signs of that old bully me. 

I feel like a failure and am embarrassed to talk to anyone about any of this outloud, but then I'm livid with myself when I can't just throw myself off this bridge or into this highway. I feel like I'm trapped in limbo...

Can someone please fix this shithole, I know I want a easy life and can't dedicate myself to the world enough to fix myself, so please, if it's so wrong to hate myself and wanna die, tell me how to fix these feelings and pain..

I just wanna die man..
