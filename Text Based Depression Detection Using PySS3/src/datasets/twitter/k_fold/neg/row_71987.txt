I think I'm going to blow my brains out at my thanksgiving dinnerI've decided that I have nothing to live for. Something came up that's about to make my life a lot worse than it already is. I hated my life and attempted suicide before this happened. I hated my life and was always miserable, just wanting to die. Now I'm going to be homeless in a couple of weeks on top of that. I have no intention of hanging around to be that miserable. So when my parents have their thanksgiving, I think I'll blow my brains out all over their dinner. At least I can give them a fuck you while I die.
