Can't Sleep. Nausea due to Anxiety. Why are you awake?I'm having this horrible nausea, almost throw-upy feeling due to anxiety and so, I'm unable to sleep. I was very suicidal today due to me being super stressed out about my life. I'm anxious because I've lost a volunteer opportunity and my car got hit and ran and now I have to see if I can fix the dent. Not only that, I have to focus on university. I am in just in so much physical and emotional pain that I wish I could go into a deep sleep forever, and I just wouldn't have to deal with life anymore. I really wish I didn't fuck up so much all the time. I have such a wonderful boyfriend who is keeping me level but at the same time I just really want to leave the world. I am really tired.
