Itâ€™s been six years since I got diagnosed with depression and I feel like giving upHello, Iâ€™m just so lost and donâ€™t know who to turn to and this is one place Iâ€™ve never tried so I thought Iâ€™d post here just in case.

I feel like such a burden to the people around me and I just wonder if choosing to keep living is even the right thing to do. Iâ€™ve been struggling along for a long time. Over and over Iâ€™ve tried to do the right thing and keep going â€“ reach out to friends, call hotlines, see a doctor, go to a mental health safety house, go to A&amp;E... the list goes on and on, but I always find myself back at rock bottom one way or another. This year when I tried to get help for my mental health problems again, the nurse who I saw got angry with me while I was having a breakdown and accused me of trying to emotionally blackmail her when I mentioned needing help because I was suicidal. I left in tears and a stranger on the street had to give me a hug and talk to me for a while.

Iâ€™ve mostly been kept going by a group of supportive friends but recently there was drama in the friend group and Iâ€™ve found myself drifting away from everyone. Itâ€™s like the last little light in my life has gone out. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m carrying on any more. I only have one friend left who I can turn to but after needing her support over and over again, I feel like Iâ€™m just bringing her down and holding her back.

All this time I felt like it was my duty to keep going, keep trying. Iâ€™ve asked for help over and over, pushed through for the sake of the people who care about me. But I feel like everyone would be better off without me. I just bring people down time and time again and I canâ€™t even bring myself to ask for help any more.

I donâ€™t know what I need to hear but if anyone has any kind words I would really appreciate it. I feel so alone right now and itâ€™s so hard to keep going.
