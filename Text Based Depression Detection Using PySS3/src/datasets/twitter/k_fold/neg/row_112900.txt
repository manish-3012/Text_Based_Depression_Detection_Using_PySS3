Proof of my passage on reddit postHey everyone,

So I got Crohn disease, amongst other physical and mental issues. Due to the severity of the Coronavirus on immunocompromised people, I decided that as soon as I show Virus symptoms, I would end my life. I have been through too much, and never came stronger or happier in the end, and I dont want to go through this horrible battle, or die like this. So I will probably end my life alone in my apartment. I do not intent to get the virus though, I am smart despite my ADHD, so I am self isolating since 2 months. I do not have any friends, but I loved reddit, so I decided to put these messages throughout my social networks, in case someone see them !  


Good luck to everyone, stay safe !
