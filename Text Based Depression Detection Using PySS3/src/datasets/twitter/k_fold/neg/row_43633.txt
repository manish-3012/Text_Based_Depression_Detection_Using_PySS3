I can feel myself drifting awayFor the longest time I thought ending your own life was a selfish spur of the moment irrational decision. I just donâ€™t know what went wrong. What did I do wrong? I feel like a was cared for as a younger child. I am still a child but I donâ€™t feel like it. I matured too fast for my own good and Iâ€™m now stuck. I used to cry so much over all of the shit I have to deal with on my own, it just doesnâ€™t happen anymore. Everything is faded and fuzzy like a dream. Its the pinnacle of head empty no thoughts. Itâ€™s a constant dream I cannot escape, I think itâ€™s time to go. After wallowing on the shower floor like a bad movie Iâ€™ve made up my mind. I plan to hang myself in the door with my favorite belt tomorrow.
