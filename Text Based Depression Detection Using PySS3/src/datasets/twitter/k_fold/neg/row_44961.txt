I've come to accept deathI really feel so invaluable to society. My ADD has made me feel like I can't ever get anything right. It keeps me from succeeding. It keeps me from fostering relationships. It keeps me from making my parents proud of me. I am a failure to them, to my friends and to myself. I just have accepted the fate that if I were to every do anything to myself, I wouldn't even feel sad. I'd feel at peace. I'd feel like I'm getting away from this constant pain I've felt my entire life. I'm never good enough, no matter how hard I try. With nothing. I contribute nothing. I push everyone away. I just want to die in my sleep more than anything.
