I just have so many thoughtsItâ€™s been a little while since Iâ€™ve felt anything like this, but tonight, my head was spinning and I felt like I couldnâ€™t breathe and I just wanted everything to stop. Iâ€™ve been wanting to go to therapy for a decade, but Iâ€™m still under my parentâ€™s insurance (Iâ€™m in my 20s) and I donâ€™t want to risk them seeing, and I donâ€™t have the means to pay anything out of pocket. I genuinely almost got up and drove to the nearest hospital tonight, but I just started working in the ED there (today was my second day), so I donâ€™t want my new coworkers to think Iâ€™m crazy either. Iâ€™m stuck in this limbo with wanting things to end and wanting to get better and I donâ€™t know which way is pulling me harder.
