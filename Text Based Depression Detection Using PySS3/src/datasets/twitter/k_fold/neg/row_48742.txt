TiredI just need to vent, I think but I'll take any advice if helpful. 


Ive lived a life of just  ... ever occurring trauma. I first received my diagnosis when I was 11. I've gotten therapy and ive tried medication and I've been working on me...but thats not really done much. I think about suicide daily. Every day many times a day. And honestly, the only thing that keeps me from following through? I don't want it to hurt or take too long or not work. I don't want to traumatize whoever finds me. IDK what comes after. I was raised religious (Christian/baptist- very fire and brimstone type shit) and I don't wanna hop from the frying pan into the fire so to speak...Ridiculous, right? And then on top of that what if it didn't work? Like what if all i succeed in doing is making my life infinitely more difficult because I couldn't just...tough it out? Then what? Try again? Do the same thing im doing right now but from a worse starting point? But ultimately, I feel guilt for just thinking it. So guilty that i don't because who am I to cause such pain to anyone else? But..for all the pain I've worked through and all the good I've done...or tried to do my entire life has hurt and the very people I dont want to hurt hurt me so who gives a fuck? Like why should I care if they hurt? And I just  can't figure out why I  am still trying to stay alive. For what? What's the point? For the people that put this burden on my shoulders? I wish there was a hard reset..or magic. I  don't want to die but I'm tired of living in pain.
