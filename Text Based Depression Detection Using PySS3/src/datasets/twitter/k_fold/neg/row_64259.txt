suicide is best optioni am a junior in high school. iâ€™ve struggled with suicide every school year, therefore needing to go on independent study and fall behind in a couple classes. ive seen my boyfriend get recruited by multiple colleges and planning his good future, as well as friends who think itâ€™s funny iâ€™ve fallen behind. this makes me think about the future i never thought about before, and making me realize i donâ€™t really have one. i have so many classes to take senior year itâ€™s barely manageable. i will inevitably at this point go to a state school alone and need to break up with my boyfriend, and have no leg up in competition for jobs. i know i am a burden to everyone already; i have made so many people scared and worried over the years, plus them needing to accommodate me just because i want to kill myself. plus, if iâ€™ve been suicidal for 5 years, how will i ever make it through college? i feel bad, but i know they will all be happy without me. for example, my boyfriend wonâ€™t be held back by me and can go to any college he wants, and date my friend whoâ€™d be perfect for him. he could be happy without having to worry about me. at this point i feel i just need to kill myself and get it over with.
