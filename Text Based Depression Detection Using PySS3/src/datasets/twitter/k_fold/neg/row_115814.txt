I want to die, but I'm afraid it'll kill someoneExactly what it says on the can. The couple people I'm close with also have serious issues with depression/anxiety/self-harm/EDs, including my dad, and I'm terrified that if I do anything at all it'll trigger someone else, but I also can't reach out to them because how could you heap more problems onto someone struggling that much?? But I honestly can't stand myself now, and I really want to hurt myself.
