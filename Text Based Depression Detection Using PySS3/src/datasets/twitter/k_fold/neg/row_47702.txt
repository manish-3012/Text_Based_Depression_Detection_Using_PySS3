I don't knowHi, 

Before anything I just wanted to say thank you for reading this far. I don't really tell people how I feel or what I'm thinking ... honestly, I don't wouldn't even know how to do that. I recently made the mistake (December 2019) of resigning from my job. I wasn't well, I was hearing voices, I wasn't eating, I wasn't sleeping and had a few mild suicide attempts. I felt worthless. 

After resigning I spent some time reflecting and just trying to get better. I was able to laugh again. My appetite got better. There was a slight bit of pressure from family to jump back into the workforce so I applied for a few places that seemed to tickle my interest and received no response. So I shrugged and saw that maybe I need to improve my skillset and travel distance, so I taken up driving lessons. 

I studied for my theory immediately but since this Corona thing, it's like my life which was already on hold is now just frozen. I just can't progress. After the fallout and the increase in superstore workers, I applied to literally all in range (that's like 10 different businesses) all of which I got one interview and nothing even came from that. 

A lot of me feels like I may have overvalued my employ-ability that even in desperate times I got turned down. I feel like I'm fucked. I don't understand how I'm meant to be optimistic about things. I hate the sense of uncertainty. I sometimes wonder if there's really such a thing as happiness and how scarce is it meant to be? I wonder where I went wrong in my life? Maybe if I knew that I could at least learn a valuable lesson from my experience. 

The truth is I'm not sure what life after quarantine brings after this really ... I just really feel like disappearing.
