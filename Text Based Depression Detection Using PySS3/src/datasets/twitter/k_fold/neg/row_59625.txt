this is as depressing as shitI appreciate the support here, i just, i know its gonna happen in a week or so. I just ordered pizza hut for christ sakes, stuffed crust, way beyond cry for help status. Next weekend gonna see my family for the last time and try to trick someone to keep my dog, the dog is more popular than me anyway. Damn. it is soul crushing to get rid of yourself in the best way, trying to throw a bunch of shit out, it's embarrassing to imagine my family have to clean out my apartment. I guess they will have to deal with my retirement plan and debts. I say family but really it'll be one of the 2 or 3 not-dead already people that draws the short straw.

I feel for the folks on here wanting to off yourself in the middle of some white hot emotion, really do, but I really hope some of you young assholes do some thought experiments about all the shitty logistics, it's like moving cross country but you can't tell anyone. And the lonely ones, I feel for you so much, there is so much untapped potential of cool folks that get stuck in their head and feel hopeless, I understand that thought process so much. 

I feel like the morbid asshole version of james bond right now. I hope some other folks will read this in the middle of some emotional tornado and think 'fuck that IS a pain in the ass, I am better than that'. I wish I had played my hand different, god damn I wish life would've worked, talking to people is so hard right now. The fucked up thing is going through all this makes part of me want to live, but I still feel the whole of me just can't take my lapses in judgement hurting another soul, I don't feel like I can break that chain, and therapy and meds have just not helped and I'm sick of trying to fix something that is broken.
