It SucksI just survived my 7th Suicide attempt. I just can not take it anymore. It took me a lot of energy but i finally slit my wrist and bled out for an hour or two, but was saved. Before this, I tired to end myself twice on the same day, last year october.

This is just too much, I am such a big failure that I can't even succed in a fucking suicide attempt, despite trying 7 times. I just fucking do not want to live anymore. I Do not deserve to live
