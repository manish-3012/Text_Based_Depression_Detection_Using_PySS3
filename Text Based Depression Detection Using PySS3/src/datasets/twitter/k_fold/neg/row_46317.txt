Every day I think of itEach day the same. Drone out the monotony with more distractions or substances- anything will do.

Drink some more, smoke something or swallow a pill. Eat some more to get the dopamine my empty brain craves. Start another hobby perhaps, and like all the others loose interest and forget it, just to make way for something new. 

Life is grand, man. Got the house. Got the perfect wife and kids- who more lately seem to be showing the signs and symptoms of my toxic and grumpy ways. Got the job and toys too...but still no happiness. 

Will happiness ever come? I gave up the last of my hope long ago. The real question is how long until I hit another "bottom"; before I realize I am ruining my marriage and children; before I feel that familiar feeling of hopelessness.

I am trapped to this life of failing those who I love and love me. I am trapped to a life that leaves me unfulfilled. I am trapped to watch myself sabotage it all.

Sweet dreams. Sweet day dreams. I long for it. I cry for the end. End my suffering and all the suffering I create. Ease the wounds I have caused on others. Ease the world of my short comings. Raise my children above me.

I am here. I am empty. I am broken. I am alone.
