I am so tired of trying.Everything just hurts. My mom saw something a friend tagged me in on Facebook and lost her shit. This isn't a new thing, but I'm so exhausted. I'm so tired of dealing with this over and over. Every year nothing changes. What's the point in living when no matter how hard I try, everything is pain anyway? I think I would be happier dead. Everything was a mistake.
