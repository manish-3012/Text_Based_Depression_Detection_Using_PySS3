I'm not made for this worldAnd I'm not saying that in a narcissistic sense like I'm better than everyone. I just logically cannot coincide with the world and especially with the so-called "life" that is contrived for us. As I grew older, there's been steps I've been presented to by family and friends. The steps of responsibility and what to accomplish in life.

I was born simple-minded so the idea of taxes, having to pay bills, caring about social and work status, means nothing to me. Money, means nothing to me. So in society's eyes, I'd be seen as a lazy slacker who deserves to be homeless shaking a cup for change at a street corner.

When all honestly, I'm just not equipped with the tools to properly fit in. I see the weight of the world on everyone. I just wish everything was simplified again and I can see that with my simple vision. I wish on days that everyone wasn't so stressed about making ends meet or so.

So what of my direction? I honestly see nothing of it in my future. If I can't properly figure a way to get "comfortable" with these things. Then I've got no purpose. Yet again, my comfort is being able to live freely and wish it upon my fellow man to do so too.

I just heavily disagree with what life is pitched as. This so cannot be what life is all about. The only things remotely holding me back is who I've picked up over the years as friends. Otherwise, I've been longing to be elsewhere that's not this world.

I've contemplated suicide and killing myself at the age of 50, fearing of growing old, frail and weak. Succumbing to the decaying forms of life eventually.

But then I'm even contemplating doing it at 30 and I'm 27 going 28 this year. Especially since I don't foresee anything ahead that'll keep me wanting to live. Especially if I can't be as responsible as everyone makes it seem. What would I have to show? I can't even do a tax form because I believe it's such a trash system. I don't even make enough anyway for a good return so it's even more pointless.

30 is the number apparently. I don't want this life anymore.
