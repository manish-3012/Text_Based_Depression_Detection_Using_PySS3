I'm not afraidIt's happening again and I can't stop it. I feel death weighing on me. It feels like the whole world. I never even got to see how big it really is. I hope you really meant it when you said you were in it for the long haul. For someone else, whoever that is. You broke me in the most fast and perfectly executed way. You acted like you were just on a contract deal, some kind of favor for someone else. My body was never mine. It's for somebody else. I wanted the baby more than I want to live. I'm sorry. I need to see my baby. I know that what we had was so real to me and it might not be real to you and well I just pray it doesn't Happen too late. In my dreams I see Prague.   I see Italy, I see every place I've ever wanted to go. I don't need a body to weigh me down with the grief of the whole world. I don't need a beautiful female body just to be used and cast aside like nothing. I don't need to be hit and screamed at and abused my whole life only to grow old and watch my soul slip from my hands. No it will not slip from my hands because like I said I'd rather die. You will not have my soul. I'll shoot myself right here. I'm not afraid like you are.
