Suicide makes me feel safe and contentFor me the idea that I can kill myself gives me that sensation of warmth and security. The same way I felt as a little kid tucked into bed. It feels like a blanket wrapped around me protecting me from any pain or danger. Salvation in the knowledge that I can return home, to my real home of non-existentance.
