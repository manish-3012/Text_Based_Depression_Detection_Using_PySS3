I don't even know...I don't know why I am posting here. Not even sure if this is the right place. I probably won't kill myself, as 1. I don't want to leave  my elderly cat alone, but I know he's the only one who would care if I was alive or not, and 2. I'm too much of a coward. In fact, I feel that it would be better for everyone around me if I were dead, but I just can't go through with it. I am too selfish. I have had depression as long as I can remember, and am in my late twenties. I'm honestly surprised I've made it this long. I have no excuses for how I feel, only that I'm a waste. I've pushed away the few friends I had, and try to keep my mask on when I work, but I've been failing. Anytime I get a chance to think, all I can think is how much I fail, how much of a terrible person I am. It seems everything I do or try ends up in failure.
