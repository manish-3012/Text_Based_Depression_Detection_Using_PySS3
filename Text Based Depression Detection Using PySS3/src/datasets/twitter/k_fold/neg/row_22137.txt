Alone, Depressed, No ControlEverything in my life is awful and I just want the pain of existing to stop. No matter what everyone thinks I'm stupid, no one cares about me, every one is too busy to put up with me. So I want to end it all so I can stop bothering everyone.

Nothing helps, I'm poor I can't afford help, I'm not religious and don't believe any of it basically, I'm sick of people telling me "it gets better" because it totally doesn't. I've tried getting friends or girls to like me but they all give up on me because I'm an uninteresting piece of shit. 

I want to die so bad. There's no place for me in this world. I'm afraid of suicide, but I almost hate living more. Nothing good has happened to me within months.
