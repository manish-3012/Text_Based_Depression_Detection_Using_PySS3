I think Iâ€™m close to being ready to kill myselfI think I might be close to killing myself

Chronically depressed since I was 4 years old.

I have only had 0.1% positive experiences in my life, which allows me to round it to nothing. I am not worth anything to anyone, doesnâ€™t matter how â€œconfidentâ€ or whatever the fuck stupid ideas people think help. I will always be unlikable, ugly, and boring to people. Nothing will ever change that, no matter how much I change myself, because in the end, thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll ever be. Iâ€™ve spent my entire life literally finding different ways to make myself more valuable to myself or others. Different perspectives, different mantras, different friends, different circles, different countries, you fucking name it.

I. AM. SO. FUCKING. DONE.

I really believe I am not meant to be alive and that death will for sure be ten times better than waking up everyday knowing that no one will give two fucks not only about me, but also not about my art, my work, my opinion, my life experience, my kindness, my willingness to help, my willingness to love, and more. Itâ€™s just nothing. It seems like everything I fucking do in life is just not enough for anyone. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m always somehow WRONG, but Iâ€™m the only one being penalized for it.

Do I have things to be thankful for? Yes. Does that take away my fucking mental cancer???? FUCK NO IT DOES NOT. Do those things make people love me more? NO IT DOESNâ€™T. Do those things help me love myself? NO BECAUSE I DONâ€™T EVEN KNOW WHAT LOVING ME LOOKS LIKE.... I DONâ€™T KNOW HER.

Anyway, I really have no proof that I am worth it but a lot of proof that I am not and that people will really throw me in the trash. THEREâ€™S JUST SOMETHING ABOUT ME THAT I DONâ€™T KNOW WHY MAKES PEOPLE NOT GIVE A SINGLE SHIT.

LIKE FUCK I HAVE NEVER EVEN BEEN HIT ON BY ANYONE IN FUCKING YEARS, Iâ€™VE ONLY BEEN SEXUALIZED, ABUSED, USED AND THROWN TO THE SIDE.

This makes no fucking sense to me and guess what? It never fucking will because this world is just not for me nor my mind.

I canâ€™t even trust my brain or anything I think either because MAYBE Iâ€™M JUST FUCKING INSANE AND Iâ€™M THE ONLY ONE WHO CANâ€™T FUCKING SEE IT.

SO SOMEONE PLEASE JUST FUCKING KILL MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!! I CANâ€™T TAKE THIS MISERABLE FEELING ANY LONGER NOTHING HAS WORKED!!!!!
