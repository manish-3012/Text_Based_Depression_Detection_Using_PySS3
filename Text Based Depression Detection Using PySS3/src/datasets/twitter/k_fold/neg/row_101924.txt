Very soonVery soon I will try to kill myself. I want to escape from my reality of waking up every day being flooded with anxiety and intrusive thoughts that persist throughout the day. I am so sick of this, I can't be happy on my own and I've tried therapy and so many different kinds of medicine. Over the years I feel like I lost the good part of me that people liked and wanted to be friends with now nobody wants anything to do with me. I am a freak, I have gone completely crazy. Sometimes the thoughts are so ridiculous, grotesque or violent that I laugh and other times I get triggered and start to panic.

I've never had a relationship and I never will. I don't want to subject anyone else to being with me. I'm absolutely loony and paranoid so who knows how long that relationship would last. I'm ashamed of my own sexuality, it's bad that I like men or women and I feel left out and inadequate whenever I think about having sex. My self esteem is so low. I don't want to struggle with these things anymore so I'm going to end it. My few friends know how I feel vaguely, but I really do want to kill myself and I can't express that to them or they will argue with me. I think about driving into a light pole or a big tree on the road often. I won't escape unless I do this.
