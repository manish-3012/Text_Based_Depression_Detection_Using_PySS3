What next?The only thing getting me by is me convincing myself I need to be here for Christmas 

I don't want to be here for Christmas, but I tell myself I'm needed for Christmas 

But after that, then what? New years? If I survive that I have nothing close enough to be needed for

I don't want to be here
I have given up so many times
I'm fed up of this
