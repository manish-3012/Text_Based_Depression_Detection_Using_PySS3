No meaning in my lifeIm fucking exhausted, and im fucked. I was always a very bright talkitive person, and seemed to be pretty popular in school. Due to events and alot of isolation, i have developed some serious anxiety and depression. Ive always been one to look at the bright side of things and have always kept pushing, but no more. Due to the anxiety i currently sweat and smell like complete shit, so bad i can walk into a room and the entire room whips there head in my direction immediately, ive lost 20 lbs muscle from inactivity, my facial features have melted i look ugly as shit, my voice is all fucking wack and wierd from not using it enough, i breath all heavily and unevenly, my brain is fucked and I believed permanently fucked from all the isolation. I swallow and chew extremely loud and nastily i suspect from loss of facial and throat muscle. Im so anxious in social settings i cant do anything but sit there with my head in my hands cant think or focus. I have absolutely nothing to be proud of, or happy about. I have 6 months before i graduate and i dont think ill make it. Why tf do i want to be alive when i cant get any fucking relief anywhere, i used to have everything, now i have nothing. Abso fucking lutley nothing, and font try to tell me i do cuz u know its a lie. I dont have what i want or need to achieve anything i want or need in this life. I wanted a hot chick as a wife, who tf wants a stinky ass anxious ass loud chewing swallowing breathing motherfucker?? Noone. I always enjoyed being with friends above all other things, but its the same thing. I cant go out in public, and if I graduate like this i wont make it because i cant even function in a classroom. I can feel it coming, and it really is the best for me. Im not even sure why im posting this, i know nothing anyone says will help, but ig this is my last shred of hope. Im fucking done
