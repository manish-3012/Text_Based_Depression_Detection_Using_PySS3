I just keep losing and losing...I've lost so many friendships ever since I started being depressed...

Yesterday, a classmate told me that I always stress out people with my nervousness, and that I don't understand the real meaning of a burnout...

God... What's the point of living if I can't connect with people? Have I become so toxic and annoying that I've made almost everyone I used to know go away?
