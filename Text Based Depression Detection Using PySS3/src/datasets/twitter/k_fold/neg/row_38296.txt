Out with the old in with the new but Iâ€™m still here even though I should be gone.Well here we go boys, a new year is just around the corner; another year to massively disappoint and push away the ones I love. What a fucking year, 2018 could suck my dick. A year where I pushed everything in sight away, and once I was finally realizing my mistakes and trying to correct myself with people who cared about me; I fucking left to the middle of nowhere to start my own personal downward spiral again. Thankfully one of yâ€™all the only good things that happened this year is that I got a good enough man that doesnâ€™t notice that Iâ€™m disgusting and horrible. And even then Iâ€™m probably just an over emotional sack of shit with boobs attached to it to him. And to be frank, I deserve that, I deserve worse. Iâ€™m a constant disappointment, I canâ€™t hold a single conversation, Iâ€™m so detached from the world that I canâ€™t understand simple concepts (surprise surprise pastelpisces most people donâ€™t want to kill themselves on a daily!!! And nobody wants to hear your depressing shit most of the time if ever!!!) , Iâ€™m constantly rude and nihilistic, and I push everyone away to protect myself. Go ahead bitch, protect yourself by trying to starve yourself of social interaction!!! Thatâ€™s worked out before hasnâ€™t it!!!  But hey at least 2019 is here, maybe I could fix myself, or do what I always do and try my best to ignore the problem and become a burden on others. But I canâ€™t accomplish that, I canâ€™t accomplish anything, everyone I know either hates me or is going to hate me soon. I can feel it like how a deer can smell fear, theyâ€™ll hate me and leave me alone like I deserve. If they know whatâ€™s good for them theyâ€™d leave me to rot and die in 2019. Bottoms up to any unfortunate souls reading this and reflecting on how bad youâ€™ve been this year and how bad youâ€™ll be next year. Iâ€™d join you in the drink but Iâ€™m not even old enough to drown my sorrows in copious amounts of alcohol. Hereâ€™s to 2019 another year of being a depressed and disgusting human being, maybe Iâ€™ll actually punch my own ticket next year.
