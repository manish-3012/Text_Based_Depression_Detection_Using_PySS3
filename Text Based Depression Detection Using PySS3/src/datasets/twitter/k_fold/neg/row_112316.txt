My girlfriend is suicidalMy girlfriend and I were taking a nap and I woke up to her crying. She started talking about being really stressed out. Then she started talking about how much she wanted to kill herself. 

She then started to get up to go across her room to grab a knife. I held her down and just sort of hugged her while she kept talking about wanting to kill herself. She eventually stopped crying and seemed to calm down.

I'm supposed to go home now, and she is insisting that I do. I told her I don't want to leave until I know she is okay for sure.

What do I do?
