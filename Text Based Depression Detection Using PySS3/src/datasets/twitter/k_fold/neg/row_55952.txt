I'm doing everything wrong.This is not a long story. I'm a female, 24 years old and I've come nowhere in my life, no education or work whatsoever. I've tried suicide twice. The last time (August 2017) people found out, my best friend, her family etc. because the people at the hospital needed to call someone and I don't have a real family. Fast forward to now. I ruin every relationship I've ever had. Even the one with my best friend, since 14 years back and her family, that has always seen me as one of their own. And I know why, I do it so at the moment where I actually do kill myself they won't be too sad because I was a horrible person. They won't feel as bad if they think I was a horrible person. I realize this is my last cry for help, otherwise I wouldn't be here. I'm just so done with everything about living. I've felt this since I was a child. Can I please just not be here anymore? I can't take it. Please.
