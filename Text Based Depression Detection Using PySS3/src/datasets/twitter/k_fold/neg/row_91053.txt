I'm going to go out into the woods tonight and end my transgender mind with an AKMI'm going to tell my girlfriend that I realized I'm transgender and I'll spend a nice last moment with her so she can have a peaceful last memory with me.  I'm fucking crying like a pathetic loser at how much she'll miss me and how I'll never see her again.  She is the only person I ever loved because I hate my family.  Once I've spent a nice long time with her, I'll leave and go out into the woods to spare myself a lifetime of misery.

I'll tell her in a few minutes when I can compose myself, and we'll have a nice long snuggle on the couch and I'll tell her how much I love her.  I can't believe I'm going out like this!  It's not fucking fair!
