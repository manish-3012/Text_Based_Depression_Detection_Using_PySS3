Nothing HereI can't listen to music without hearing a band i'm not in. I can't watch films without seeing parts i can't play. I can't read a book without seeing all the words i'd never think to use. I can't look at myself in the mirror without hearing when i said i'd die before i let this happen.

Everywhere i turn is another reminder of my farcical failure of a life. Everyone i speak to, talks to hatred, envy, desperation or apathy. I don't want to exist, i don't want to survive, i want to live but that's apparently too much to ask...so i don't anymore.

All i ask is for a swift end and a forgettable memory.
