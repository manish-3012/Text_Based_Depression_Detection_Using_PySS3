It's even harder when you want to liveBut life keeps kicking you. I remember being happy and carefree. I had a good year in 2018. 2019 is mopping the floor with me. But if u want to die badly that is bad enough but I really want to live I just can't get stabilized from my problems and it's twice as hard. I don't want to die young but the pain is so bad. I want to be happy and not live in fear but my emotions won't allow this. I also fear death that and not wanting to hurt family and friends I'm here but so far it isn't getting better for me, and I'm terrified.
