How to fight anxiety before committing suicide?I'm not here to explain my suicide method, so I'm not breaking any single rule.

&amp;#x200B;

I've strongly decided to do this, and I feel panic and anxiety. I'm well aware that it's a normal human reaction to the fear of death, but, again, I'm not here to ask for help, just maybe some meds will do the job.

I've tried increase Ziprasidone and Fluvoxamine, but it didn't help against the panic.
