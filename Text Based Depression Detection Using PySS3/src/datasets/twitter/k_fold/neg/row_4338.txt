Can't stop thinking about it.When I was a kid I remember hearing about someone that took his own life and I remember thinking why would anyone ever do that, i found it the most absurd thing. But the thing is i've been feeling like shit for many years now, a couple of years ago it was the first time that i thought about suicide and since then ive been thinking about it more and more and its to the point now that its almost the only thing i think about, i just feel lonely every single moment,doesnt matter how many people are in the room or friends i have, i cry every day i cry as im writing this. I would never take my life because for some reason i find some importance in my reality, but i just feel like shit. Idk why im writing this
