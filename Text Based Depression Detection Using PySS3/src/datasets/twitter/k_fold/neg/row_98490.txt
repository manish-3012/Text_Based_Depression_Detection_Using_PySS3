To muchI feel like Iâ€™m drowning in nothin. Iâ€™m having my first panic attack in a month and itâ€™s a long one, been going on an hour now... I just canâ€™t handle this shit anymore, I donâ€™t have a reason to panic yet I am, life isnâ€™t fair Iâ€™m rambling. I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m done. Good night. I hope your doing better.
