Welcome to my mind where suicide is one of my favorite topicsI never discuss these thoughts with people I know because they make it into something they perceive. AND you know most people perceive it as a bad thing. I don't think it's good or bad. I think it may be necessary. Am I the only one who has noticed that suicude rates are going up all over the country? Am I the only one thinking about why? Some of us are struggling to pay our bills abd keep our part-time jobs. Some of us just wanna do drugs and sleep. There's something off about this next generation...we might as well be a degeneration. We honestly don't give a fuck about anything. How the hell are we going to survive through most of the shit our parents or grand parents did? We're not built to continue. It's like we were born into the age of catastrophe.
