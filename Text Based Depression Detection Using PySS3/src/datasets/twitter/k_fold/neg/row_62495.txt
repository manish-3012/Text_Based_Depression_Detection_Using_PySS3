Its not that big of a dealI'm considering suicide because I am an absolute failure at life, failed academically, failed socially, failed everything. There's nothing in my life worth salvaging. I think about my family a lot, what it would put them through, and that blocks me from doing it, committing to it. But what harm is it to them really? They will be depressed for a little while and then get over it. My mother is the one I'm worried about the most, she is very weak mentally and wouldn't be able to get over it. But at the same time she has religion, and I think that'd give her strength. I hope so at least. I've considered writing in my suicide note that I asked for forgiveness for what I'm about to do, and I'm not a religious person, but if asking for forgiveness helps my mother deal with it, then I'd definitely do it. My brother and sister would be depressed for a little while but I see them getting through it, they are strong. My dad would be angry at me and rightfully so, but I don't think he'd have a hard time getting over it. I've thought a lot about losing out on happy experiences and all that, but the way I see it, it's better that someone who is happy and fulfilled in life gets to experience those things instead, and I know that those people are out there experiencing those things, so its not so bad. Someone gets to do it, it just won't be me. I have a noose made and a place I want to go to do it, but I don't think its long enough and I'm afraid I'll botch it. There's also a shotgun in the house that I can use, but it'll be really hard to get access to it, since my dad has hidden the key ever since my first attempt. I'm terrified that my family will blame everything and anything and end up getting frustrated and angry at the whole thing, but it's entirely my own fault. I'm entirely to blame. I want them to blame me but not hate me. And I guess thats all I can do.
