Everyone hates meI dont know why no one likes me, No one wants to see me, No one wants to talk to me, No one wants to be my friend. I try everything, All the apps, All the "Go outside and just make friends" hasnt worked for me. Am i that much of a fuck up? I moved to trying on reddit and yes, Ive talked to people but they all leave, Like everyone else in my life. They all start just ghosting me and not respond but reading my messages. I just want a couple real friends, To call each other, Talk about our says or hop on xbox and game together and talk. I dont get why im suck a fuck up at everything. I on the edge, Especially with us on a stay at home order. I have no one at all, And i want to end it all.
