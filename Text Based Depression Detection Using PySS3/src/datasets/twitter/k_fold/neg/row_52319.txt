I need someone to talk too.To start off my grandparents have been a 2nd home and mostly rasied me since I was little. They have always been a 2nd home and I love them dearly. My mom I love a lot but not as open too and rarely do. My grandma and mom got in a big fight about my uncle starting a fist fight in my house during a party and haven't talked for the past 2 years. I still see them and my grandma just got cancer. My mom tried calling and they still won't speak.

My dad is a asshole. He even tells me my little brother is his favorite we constantly fight. He barley buys any groceries and when he gets mad like last moth he accused me of not paying car insurance, he grabbed me and held a fist to me demanding money. Which he already got..

Next is my girlfriend we just started seeing eachother and while we were making out see texted me the next day saying I was going a bit fast for her. So last night while making out I thought it would be ok to group over the shirt and not go under this time. She told me last night that she was uncomfortable and didnt know if she could trust me again. I feel terrible about myself for making her feel that way and don't want to lose her.

I work a shitty job that makes me work late nights with no breaks. I usually have to pick food for me and my brother. I hate it. It's stressful I feel like they don't like me there and afraid if I do something wrong all the time.

It's tough to put on a fake smile through it all. I can't stand it anymore. I just want it all to stop. I feel terrible and just want it all to end. I just want a normal 16 year old life. I don't want to feel uncomfortable in my own home. I Feel awful I made my girlfriend feel that way. Now she said we probably won't end up being together after today. And I not have anyone to talk to about this. I just want it to stop
