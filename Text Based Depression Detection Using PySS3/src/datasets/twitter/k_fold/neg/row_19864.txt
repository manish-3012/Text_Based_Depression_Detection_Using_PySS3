The misery and agonyIs too much to handle. To those of you Who actually have families and friends and loved ones. Why the fuck are you on here? Why arenâ€™t you enjoying life. Some of us are a John Doe. A Jane Doe. Have absolutely no family. No loved ones.  No one who gives two fucks.  We know nothing but complete isolation and misery. You think you know pain?  Try dealing with this â€œlifeâ€ truly and completely alone.  The only reason I havenâ€™t gone to the next dimension is the fear of a botch. Ending up disabled. In a mental ward. Etc. if I had a surefire 100% way out. I would have done it by now.
