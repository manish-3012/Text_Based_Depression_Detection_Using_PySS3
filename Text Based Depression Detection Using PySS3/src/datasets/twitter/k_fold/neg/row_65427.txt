I'm obsessed with time and the only way I can escape it is by death.The days keep flashing by me at a rate that doesn't even seem real.
2012 was terrifyingly short.  Life, I'm learning, is terrifyingly short.
Soon enough I'll be old and full of regrets.
There's no escaping it...
...unless I die young.

I can't stop thinking about time.  There's no way around it.  Its all my mind goes back to.  Its ruining everything about life for me.  Its killing all possible optimism.  There is so much I CAN care about, but all I can think about is how utterly temporary it all is.  Sure, that should make it more meaningful then, right?

No, it scares the ever-loving shit out of me.

I don't know how much longer I can battle this mental insanity.  I'm too poor to get help and its too ingrained in my psyche to be overcome.  I will never overcome it.

I'm terrified of death...but maybe its the ultimate escape.  I'm great at escaping.
