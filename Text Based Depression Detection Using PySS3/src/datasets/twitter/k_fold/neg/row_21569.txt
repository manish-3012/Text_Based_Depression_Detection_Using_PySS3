Everywhere I go I don't fit in or I'm asked to leaveEvery time someone accepts one part of me there's something else that makes them leave. I feel like a broken tool that nobody wants around now that I'm not useful anymore. My own mother has called my life meaningless. I don't know what to write to not be dangerous to anyone who reads it. I'm the one who's a failure in so many ways that I refuse to pick one thing for "what's your biggest regret"-threads.
