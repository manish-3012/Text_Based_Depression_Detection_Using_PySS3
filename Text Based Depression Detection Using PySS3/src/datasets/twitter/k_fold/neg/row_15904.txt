I don't know how much longer I can do thisThis is my first post, so I hope this is the right subreddit. I won't give my age, but I am on the younger side. Since 2013, the passing of someone dear, I've been chronically depressed. To cut the b.s., I've struggled with an ED (Eating Disorder) for the past five years. This predates the depression. This year has not been easy for me, but I won't get into that as it sidetracks from the main point of this: I keep thinking how nothing will change if I die. 
    Today I went outside and looked at our small pool. As I stood there, I couldn't stop the thought of jumping in from entering my mind.  I didn't jump in, but I stared for a long time. I'm not sure what to do. I feel like I'm at the end of my rope here, and it's very stressful. I'm scared to tell anyone because I know I'll be put away somewhere. That thought kind of scares me. I just need some encouraging words to get me through tonight. 
Thank you.
