Tell me if I'm just being dramatic?So I'm sixteen and in my senior years of high school. I've had some mental health issues for about a year or two. So earlier this evening I messaged my best friend telling her about how I'm struggling at school.
She told me that I just need to try harder and if I really care about passing I would ignore the voices in my head and ignore how bad I feel and just get it done. She also said that everyone else has the same problems as me and that I'm just using excuses and iding behind fake problems. 
The whole point of this conversation was me trying my best to explain why I can't just try harder, that's something I really struggle to do. And like I don't know if I'm just lazy and being super dramatic or if there's an actual problem that we just haven't diagnosed yet and I have a legitimate reason to be failing half my classes.
I kind of feel really annoying now and like everyone would be better off if I were dead. 
I think that my friends mostly just pity me and they don't actually like me that much. I'm kinda super embarresed now and seriously considering killing myself.
I don't know what to do
