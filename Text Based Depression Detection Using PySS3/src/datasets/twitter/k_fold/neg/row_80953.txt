I NEED TO CHANGE and Iâ€™m asking for ADVICE :(Hi, Iâ€™m 20(F)  when I was younger I always felt left out of everything. I got bullied by my sister and other family members growing up I was also bullied in school because of my weight. Me and my mom has never been on good terms because she would never seem to understand me and when I try to communicate with her everythingâ€™s always my fault. She had me put away in behavioral health once and they only diagnosed me with Social Anxiety but my dad said he was the same way in his younger days. Me and my momâ€™s conversations always end really bad. Recently Iâ€™ve met a really amazing guy whoâ€™s here for me and supports me. Iâ€™ve decided to move out and travel and to kind of explore life. I was thinking  that while Iâ€™m taking time away from my family that I should change myself and also figure out what I want in life and to figure out what I want to accomplish. The issue is that I know Iâ€™m not perfect and I make mistakes that I have to learn from. My mom feels that I have an issue with her and I donâ€™t deep down in my heart I really love her and my family. Recently I did something unnecessary and I admit I was wrong. A lot of people have called me crazy including her. Sometimes she thinks the world should revolve around her and that things should always go her way. I feel that my relationship with my mom will never get better. Every little thing I do is wrong to her. Everything I try to do is not enough. Iâ€™m really trying here but I feel like the devil will not leave me alone. My mom called me narcissistic and I know thatâ€™s not true. I do nothing a narcissists to. Maybe she donâ€™t know the true meaning of it. Am I crazy for wanting to move out and travel with my boyfriend? Maybe itâ€™s what I need. Maybe itâ€™ll give everyone a break and time to think. Iâ€™m not suicidal I just need someone to talk to. Maybe itâ€™s something Iâ€™m not seeing. If I donâ€™t make a change now I will keep going through this.
