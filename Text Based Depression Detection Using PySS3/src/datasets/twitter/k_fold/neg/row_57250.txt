I'm just too torn and I don't know what do doI'm not even sure if this is the right sub but basically I've had suicidal thoughts for 3 years now and it's been horrible and I've never properly talked about it in depth about it to anyone but there's this one girl who's almost like the only real person I've met and my best friend pretty much I told her how sure I am about what I want to happen and she was really upset and I know if obvious for people that are used to having people care but I didn't know she would fully cry and it's making my unsure about my issues like I'm almost forgetting them ever time I'm thinking about trying to not make her upset but at the same time I still feel my own stuff I'm still worried my life will turn out the way I don't want it to like I've gone through so much and I've wanted my life to end through all of it do strongly and I just don't know what to say to get or feel I want to keep proving to her how bad it's been and how much worse it will get but her being upset make me feel bad plus I'm scared she'll call suicide hotlines or whatever and I dont want that
