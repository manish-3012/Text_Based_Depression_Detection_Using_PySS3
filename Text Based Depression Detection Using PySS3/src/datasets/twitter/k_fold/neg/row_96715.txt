I have no where else to turnSo I've been a lurker on Reddit for along time but I signed up because I want to feel like I have someone to talk to. I don't usually do this I usually keep my problems to myself or my wife but that's no longer an option. I've been married for 11 years and I have one son (6yrs). I have No family or friends other than my wife but my marriage has fallen apart suddenly. I either stay in the home and be a pariah or I'm homeless. My little three person family is the only reason I have to live. My dad and mom were drug addicts my mom deserted me and my dad was in and out of jail my whole life til he died long ago. My grandmother raised me but she died too. I feel like everyone has deserted me. I don't even have the choice of killing myself because I can't stand the thought of my son maybe needing me one day. I'm stuck with no choices. I am very introverted and have No luck making friends. It seems suicide would be easier
