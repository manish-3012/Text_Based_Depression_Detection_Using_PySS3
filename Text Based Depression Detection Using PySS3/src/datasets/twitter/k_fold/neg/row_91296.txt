Family member just tried to kill himself. Need advice.He is in his late teens and we are going to visit him in the hospital today.  He attempted suicide yesterday.  He is going to be under observation for two weeks.

All I can think about is what he must be thinking.  I am trying to think of a good gift to help him pass the time in the hospital.

Any ideas?  What's allowed etc?

Thanks in advance.
