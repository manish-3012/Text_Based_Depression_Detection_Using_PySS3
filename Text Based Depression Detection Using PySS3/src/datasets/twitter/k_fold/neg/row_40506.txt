Tired and in this weird fugue stateI'm tired of trying to be what I'm not, which is "worth it" to anyone.  Best I've ever been able to approximate is disposable cash machine.  I'm worth it to my mom (what's left of her) so I'm going to wait that one out, I really can't take her perceived future from her like that.  I can think of one other person in this world that might consider me worth it but I doubt it, one of the kids that I helped might.  Maybe.  Doubtful at this point.  I'm tired of being a mule and a means to an end for people that don't think, and just toxic and barely tolerated by those who do think.  To the point they'd rather be in a relationship with what I'm positive is a narcissistic bipolar meth addict, I've seen enough of them in my day to recognize one at 300 yards.  No... that's not even accurate.  If there was literally no one but me they'd choose no one.  If the option was death or me they'd choose death.  This is just one in a long line of attempts that make me realize my options are people that use me or nothing.  I choose nothing.  And I'd go for blind hedonism at this point, it's the usual cycle when I come to this realization (yet again... and again... and again), but I wonder how long that will last before I just realize what I'm doing.  Not long, this time, I rather suspect.
