I Don't what else to do.I've been having problems with my family lately and none of my friends seem to be around. My gf left me because I said some inapproppiate comments trying to make a joke. I'm just making my mom suffer because she is the only one who I can look for to try and help. I feel like I'm causing pain all around me and don't know how to stop. I really feel terrible about myself and don't want to continue hurting people. This morning I asked my mom to forgive me for all the pain I caused her because of not being able to be fine even after treatment. I don't want to make anyone else suffer, I don't want to keep suffering. I don't know what else to do.
