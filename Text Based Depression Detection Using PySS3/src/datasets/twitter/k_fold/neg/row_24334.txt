Its real this time. I feel it.Ive been suicidal for as long as i can remember. Overdosing here and there. No one gives a fuck about me. The other attempts were impuksive  this has been stewing for a few days. I reached out and no one gave a fuck. I dont post on reddit much im new but i thought id try my luck and reach out one last time. 
Im alone with my thoughts and i feel it so stromg im a bit scared
