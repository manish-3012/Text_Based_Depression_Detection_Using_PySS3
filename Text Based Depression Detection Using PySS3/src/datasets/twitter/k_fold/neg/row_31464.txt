Harm is the only way out of this prisonI need help.

I made the unfortunate mistake of studying abroad my senior year. "Mistake? Studying abroad is the coolest thing you can do!" you say. No, it was a mistake. I have struggled with other mental health issues in the past. Somehow, I was still cleared to go.

I have very strong urges to go back, to finish my schooling and prepare for uni in a place I know my credits will count. Instead, I've been met with a range of generic responses like "it gets better, you need to just give it some time" to "suck it up, this is a great opportunity not many people get to do"

Yes, those may be right. That's how things go for most people. Not me. My parents are unsupportive of my choice to leave. They always tell me the usual. The officials in the program back home won't let me go any further with this. You need to obtain consent from everyone before a ticket can be booked. The program boxes you in, unable to escape. I don't understand why it can't be your choice.

I have seriously considered "what if I got poisoned" or "what if I got hurt in a car crash" or "how can I almost die but not" as ways of getting out. I know that if I turn to illegal substances I will get kicked out, and I've considered that. I am willing to try any way to leave, even if it includes self-harm. I have upset my girlfriend tremendously over this. She understands I have issues, but she isn't here to help. I am about ready to book my own plane ticket. I'm so sick and tired of everyone telling me to get it together and enjoy my time here. It is crushing me because I know that's not what I want.
