This sounds absolutely disgusting and selfish and terrible- I want to kill myself so that my friends will finally care about meI'm so sick of being looked over, stepped on, ignored, and lied to. I feel like the only way my friends would actually care about me for once is if I killed myself. Then everyone would be my best friend. 


I know this is such an awful thing to say- but I had to say it somewhere. 


I'm sorry.
