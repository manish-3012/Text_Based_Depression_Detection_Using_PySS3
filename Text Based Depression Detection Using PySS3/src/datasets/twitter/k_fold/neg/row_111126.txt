just something to get off of my chesti think everyone hates me. i hate myself, for that matter. i think i am a burden to others, and i think everyone hates me (including my parents, as i am still in high school). i hold a steak knife up to my throat practically every night. i cry myself to sleep thinking of missed opportunities.
