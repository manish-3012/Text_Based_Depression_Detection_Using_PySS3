Not sure what i'm writing for.What do you do when you've tried everything, and absolutely none of it has worked. I guess the obvious answer is to keep trying, but when does it get to the point that continuing to do so is just stupid, poking a gaping wound, just causing more pain without it healing.

What is the difference between reaching out and attention seeking. I guess I ask that, because I feel like, when I talk, i'm merely doing the latter. Maybe it's just the loneliness speaking, but every time I reach out, it pushes someone away. Maybe i'm just reaching out too much, I can't expect others to care, so my desperation just to be talking to someone shows.

I don't even know why i'm posting, I feel ready to die, so I guess this is the right place to discuss that. I'm out of ways to express it, and people to express it to, liars who told me they wanted to be there for me, and then decided they weren't interested any more. It makes it... almost impossible for me to trust again, but I know if I don't try, then it's just over. Before anyone mentions it, i've tried councelling, therapy, the works, and it's useless, to the point I know I get upset at the suggestion.

I'm tired, and not too coherent right now. Just need to say something, try something before I give in to it tonight. Sorry.
