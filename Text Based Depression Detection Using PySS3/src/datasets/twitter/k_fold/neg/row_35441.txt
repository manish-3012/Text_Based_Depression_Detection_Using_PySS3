Finally giving up.Ive been consistently depressed since 7th grade and I'm now a senior in highschool. I'm fucking done fighting for to be generally happy for longer than a day. I have come to hate every fucking thing about this world. My dream was to be able to go to MIT or Cal tech but I've only manage to acquire a shitty 2.1 GPA during my time in highschool. All I ever like to do is think but when it comes down to it I can't apply myself and now I'm going to pay for with a killed opportunity to learn what I wanted to and do what I want to do. I've never had a girlfriend and I've come to realize the one I want doesn't exist. There's nothing I can find to be happy about anymore because of this fucking universe. I'm a fighter but 5 years of going through this shit when this is supposed to be the best time of my life I've come to see that I'll never be satisfied with me or life and I would rather be dead then given drugs to accept it and disturb the only thing I have left. I've decided on this weekend.
