i donâ€™t wanna try anymore. i want to give up.if you are feeling discouraged or unmotivated right now- just know i feel you. i understand. iâ€™m here for you. you are NOT alone. we can get through this together, come talk to me if you need someone to give you advice, to be there for you, or to simply just listen! some ways i cope when iâ€™m feeling down is i like to listen to lofi (a type of chillhop music), read lofi comment sections to feel better, read a book, take deep breathes, think about what my future could be if i kept pushing, fulfilling my dreams, and think about the little things in life to look forward to!! you got this.
