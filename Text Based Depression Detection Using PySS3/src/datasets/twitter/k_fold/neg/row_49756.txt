I need help, so I'm not pushed over the edge!I have put up a front with everyone I know. Even after I tell a number of family/friends some of my problems, I still block them out. I always act like I'm happy and okay. I even told them that I act like I'm happy, but they still think that I genuinely am happy.

My instinct is to act happy and put other's needs before my own. It took me a long time to accept that I do this. So I also don't want to hurt them by telling them. I don't want to bring them down. They have their own issues.

Should I talk to some of them about this again? Really make them understand that it's bad?

But the problem is that I have almost no energy, and I am hardly getting through the day as it is without having the pressure of opening up.

While I'm going through this (I would assume is undiagnosed depression), it's hard to trust myself. For example, I tell myself that I'm dramatic and stupid for thinking I have a mental illness even though I'm going through years with obvious depression symptoms.

So I don't know if I should open up about this. Especially with the risk of rejection that just might push me off the edge (which I've been pretty close to recently).

**I suppose I just need an outside opinion because it is getting really bad and I just don't know what to do anymore.**
