I'm so tiredTired of feeling like I want to die everyday. Tired of wanting the day to be over, before it even started 
Tired of fearing the only person that brings me the slightest amount of happiness is going to leave me at any given moment
So tired of being sad
Tired of being lonely
Tired of being tired
