I'm sick of this.I'm alone. I have nothing. I have no motivation to do anything. I was never loved and people treat me like shit. I was bullied in middle school. Ignored in high school. Heck,I'm ignored even online.People make fun of me. Usually when I talk to someone I get ignored so why the fuck should I even bother. It's not the first time when I am completely alone in my life. I just wish that the person who was my best friend to come back, but I know that's impossible. So here I am, suffering. Sometimes I think it is my destiny to be alone and suffer. My mind is so foggy because of depression. I only want love and care but I receive pain and suffering. Because of all this suffering I became another person. A worse person. I don't know what qualities and strengths I have anymore. Everyone belongs to someone,have friends,are loved etc. Here I am, not belonging anywhere,alone,never loved.I feel like trash. I hate my parents so much because they always manage somehow to make me feel like shit. I came to the point where I no longer can deal with this depression and loneliness. Where I no longer can keep everything to myself and suffer alone. I tried to kill myself yesterday. I just can't deal with this anymore. At this point I am sure I will end up doing suicide. In a few days,weeks,months,years, I am just sure I will do it. I have no reason to live.

I only asked for a good friend, some love and care. Is that too much to ask for?
