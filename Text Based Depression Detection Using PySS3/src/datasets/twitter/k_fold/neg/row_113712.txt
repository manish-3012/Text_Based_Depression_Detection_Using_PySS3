Is there a way for me to help this suicidal person?There is someone I know who is severely suicidal. I know this person from reddit, we have been talking for a few months but we are not that close because of our age gap. Most of our conversations are him giving me life advice or me listening to his problems. Sometimes we talk about our music taste, recommend each other our favourite songs/animes, maybe I draw something for him etc etc... He has gone through so much shit in his life, he tried to kill himself multiple times already. Especially these times are really really hard for him to survive through, and I read a comment about him deciding to kill himself. I don't really play a role in his life, we live in different countries and I know no one connected to him. I don't want to invade his privacy even though i kind of did by lurking through his comments, and I can't seem to find a way to help him. He started to go to a doctor a few days ago, I kind of helped him through that but I'm not sure if that's going to help. I don't want to disrespect his decision and tell him what to do with his life, but if there is a way of me helping him in any way i won't hesitate. This sub seems like one of the few places where you can talk about suicide openly so I wanted to ask this question here. Thank you.
