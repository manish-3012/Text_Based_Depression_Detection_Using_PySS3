Thinking about itI'm a 40 y/o guy. I'm ugly, i don't have any friends nor a girl friend. My parents are also dead. I live alone, all i have is my work and the gym where i go to pass time then its back to work. 

Seriously life has no point for me. Why continue on living if i dont have anything to live for. What do i have? Hope? Even if i want things to change i cant. I cant influence other people to like me, either they do or they dont.

I'm desperate i really dont know what to do. I'm this guy btw

Sad to see there are more people in the same boat as i am.
