Just... Sick of everythingAt 19, I have reached the point that I have no one who genuinely cares about how I feel and my life has hit a dead end.

Whenever I face a problem I keep telling myself that no one will listen, because they won't.

I have repeatedly stepped out of my door with the intent to end my own life, but something has just held me back. I don't understand.
