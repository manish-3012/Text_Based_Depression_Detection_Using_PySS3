After a long tear filled talk with my wife...My wife says she's stressed because of me. I'm too crazy for her. When I was in the hospital she didn't drink, now that I'm out she does. 

She says she needs to talk to other people because she can't talk to me. And she doesn't like talking to women. She needs to talk to guys. 

She doesn't want me to tell her my problems because she isn't a professional and she can't solve them. 

She doesn't think this can last another three years because everyone has their breaking point. She's got hers a few times with me already. 

She can't take much more and I'm going to lose her. This breaks my heart because I can't fix my mental problems. The dogs don't work and I don't know how to fix the problems any other way. The ect didn't work and we actually think it made me worse. 

I'm going to lose her, and if that happens I will die. Not even a question, I will lay down and die. I will lose the will to live and that would be it. 

I have to figure out how to get better. I have to figure out how to trust again. I have to figure out how to have faith in our love. 

I don't know how I'm going to do it. And if I can't, I die. Simple as that. I don't have years to figure this out either. I don't have much time, or I will lose her. 

She wondered if she was being too helpful. If she was being to easy on me. If she was allowing me to be this crazy. 

She said I'm not the man she married. I changed for the worst, and every year is getting even worse. 

I don't know how to change. I don't know if I'm capable. I feel like I can't win here. I'm going to fail and that's it. It'll be over. 

I almost feel like I shouldn't even try of I'm already counting on myself failing. I feel as if I should just let myself die next week by actively doing it. Clean out the garage, pull my car in, and just leave it running. It's simple and easy. 

And I can't tell her these things because she can't handle them anymore. She can't handle me being in a mental ward again this year (would be the third time this year). 

I've been in hospitals for the past year and a half or so for various surgeries and mental issues. I qualified for disability recently and am waiting for my first check. But that's barely enough to help support my family. 

My ex wife bought my kids a dog about a year ago. My current wife predicted that we would have the dog eventually because my ex wife actually Hates dogs and has bought and gotten rid of 2 already. So this time I stepped in and said we would take the dog. After checking with my wife of course. But it's still more stress for her. 

Her job is stressing her out also. And I can't change that. She's not going to quit because she likes the company, but they are piling work on her and she's having a hard time with that. 

I try to help out at home by doing the dishes and cleaning and all those things. But I guess it isn't enough to make me "normal" or something. 

When I first heard I had mental problems I knew they would ruin me. And probably eventually kill me. I think I was right. 

I just wrote all this and realize it probably won't make that much sense to people. I'm sorry, it more stream of consciousness  kind of stuff. Just spilling my thoughts or onto a screen. Trying to make sense of it all. 

But I fear is too late. I'm going to die soon. I'm going to miss my parents, my kids, my dogs, and of course my wife. I love her so much but I'm hurting her by being alive. I never wanted to do that. I don't want to hurt her anymore. I don't want to be in pain anymore either. I'm afraid I'm giving up because it feels like the right choice. 

Death feels like the right option to me. And the fact that it doesn't scare me to die, doesn't feel right. A sane person wants to live, while I feel like I need to die. Not want, need.
