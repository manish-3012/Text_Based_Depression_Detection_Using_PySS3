I'm thinking about it more and more.I have nobody to blame but myself for the situation I'm in. The pain is becoming too much. I don't want to think anymore, I don't want to do anything anymore. I'm sick of the constant expectations to perform, all the pressure, all the stress. I need a long break, from life as a whole.

I have walked across that bridge every day for 5 months now. It's the only way to get to class. Only recently did I start thinking about diving. It would be liberating. Who am I kidding, the fall probably isn't high enough to end it, and some tryhard student would probably try to stop me. I don't even know if I have the strength to do it. But every time I cross the bridge, the river calls to me. Maybe one day, I'll answer the call. Who knows?
