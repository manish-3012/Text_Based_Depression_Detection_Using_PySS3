I've realized that no matter the situation of other people, I'm not able to socialize with anyone.Only two people have been able to make me talk and interact regularly, but life happened and they aren't in my life anymore. The last one I lost has broken me way past the point of no return. It's been more than six months and I still get panic attacks about his goodbye.

The worst part is that maybe there is still someone out there that would be able to make me open up, but I'm scared of trying again because I can't deal with another goodbye.

I'm so lonely and nobody, no matter how good intentioned, can help me. I just want to scream for help, cry with someone else and I don't know. I feel like an outcast among outcasts.

What should I even live for, with nothing I'm good at and no human contact?

I'm not able to socialise and it hurts so much.

I can't deal with this anymore. I just can't. I tried meds, professional help. Nothing works. I'm so tired...
