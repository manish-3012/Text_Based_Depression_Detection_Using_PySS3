I need to stop wanting to die and do itmy parents are divorced, last week me and my father went to a big activity for the whole week but he was relaying on me getting my driving license to get there. I didnt get it, my mother offered the transport if he paid gas. at the end of the week he had to pay but gave 60$. the total gas price was higher, like 100$ but he argued and didnt give more.

he has to pay a pension because my little sister is still minor but since he changed job and had no salary for 2 months, he isnt legally obliged to pay those 2 months of pension.

My mother didnt know, she needed that money (its alot). when my father got out of the car, she began crying and throwing a big tantrum.
it was hard to watch...

Then my mother says she cleaned my room while I was away (which never happen, I am 19). Mind you she found stuff she shouldnt have. She broke alot of my stuff, I cant even use my computer anymore. Also alot of thing went missing and says she dont know what I am talking about, things like headphones and my keyboard...

It made me so angry, but at this point it doesn't matter anymore, we wont be able to buy food for a month because she didnt get the money, I cant use my computer to try and not think about killing myself all the time, I cant listen to music to feel better, my parents are going to fight so much and living with my mother is going to be hell for a while.

tomorrow I start college, but I think I wont attend any classes to sabotage myself and having more reason to kill myself because apparently I am too scared of dying even if I wish it so, soo much
