nobody can help me.i just got discharged from the hospital. I was there for 3 weeks after being arrested for standing on a bridge. I was honest with the psychiatrist about my feelings and I tried to complete the workbooks/worksheets as fully as possible even though I thought they were pointless.   


But they weren't able to do anything for me. I still feel sad and I'm still thinking about suicide. All I have gotten out of being hospitalized are ongoing weekly appointments with a counsellor. I'm not optimistic about it. My life has no meaning and there is no point to being alive. I don't know what I'm hoping for by posting this.
