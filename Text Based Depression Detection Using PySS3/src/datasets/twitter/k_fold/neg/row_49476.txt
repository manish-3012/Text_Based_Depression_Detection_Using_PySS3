Still Considering SuicideSo I'm sitting here, starting to get drunk, and wondering why I haven't killed myself already.  Let me go through the list, and I'm sure you've seen plenty of other posts just like this.

-I feel like there's no time left to really turn my life around.
-Terribly overweight.
-Little to no experience with the opposite sex.
-Very few friends left.
-Work a job I hate and rarely get out.
-Don't know what I'm doing.  And furthermore, don't really know what I want to do.

I'm just lost.  I'm lost and I don't think I have a way out.  Sorry to put this here.  It's pretty useless, just kind of helps to write it all down.  Thanks for reading.
