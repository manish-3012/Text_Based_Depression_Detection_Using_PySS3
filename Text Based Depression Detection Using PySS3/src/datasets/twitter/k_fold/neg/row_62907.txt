Why won't it get better?Nearly 30 years old, no job, no family, no friends. It's like I'm drowning in a sea of people who only care about themselves, when I've never even felt what it was like to be loved, or acknowledged. Any relationship I've been in has ended with them cheating on me, and social anxiety makes it hard to find friends, let alone ones that are trustworthy. I can't see it getting any better, if the change comes from me, or from the world, I don't know...
