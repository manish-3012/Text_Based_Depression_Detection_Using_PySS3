I think I'm done for...I've had Major Depressive Disorder for 8 years, Anxiety for 3, and Psychosis for 2. I'm only 14... My girlfriend of a year and a half also has a similar situation and I'm constantly afraid that she'll end her own life. I've been a cutter for 3 years-ish. I've been smoking weed and drinking since I was 11. I've done everything I've can to try to help myself and I've been to so many therapists throughout the years. Around 3 months ago I was put in an impatient hospital after a suicide attempt. I was discharged but I got no better. I've tried to end my own life so many times and I feel completely alone in the world. I now have a massive bottle of assorted pills open next to me. I need help.
