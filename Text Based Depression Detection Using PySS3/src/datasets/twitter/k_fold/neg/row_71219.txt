I wish the physical part of dying was easy.I'm 19 years old, I don't have any friends besides one. All I do is go to work and school. My fee time is spent on video games because I have nothing better to do. I really hate how suicide is looked as bad. Yes the counter argument is that suicide is selfish, but it doesn't hurt anyone physically. I've tried standing on the cliff of where I want to die, but I pussy out. At this rate it's just until I get enough balls to do the jump that everything will be better. I just wish suicide pills are legal.
