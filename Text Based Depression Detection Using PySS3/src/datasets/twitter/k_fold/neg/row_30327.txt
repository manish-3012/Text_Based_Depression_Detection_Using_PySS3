Got out of a situation that was pushing me to suicide , am still suicidalI still take great comfort in owning an item I know I can just end my life with whenever I do desire and from what I hear somewhat painlessly. I was suicidal before I perceived my ambition to pursue mathematics was going to be crushed and still am after Iâ€™ve been given more time to sit my exams. There are many reasons but the main one is I canâ€™t get over feeling like a terrible person. 

Iâ€™ve made mistakes and people have forgiven me for them and Iâ€™ve spent sleepless nights crying over these mistakes and have made efforts to never make them again but the constant guilt and shame makes me an extremely depressive person. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist for bipolar 2 but I know this isnâ€™t my disorder talking. 

I canâ€™t find peace in anything I do let alone a feeling of satisfaction or content, the best I can do is what most people would consider rumination or moping because I am perpetually self hating and depressed. I know I make the people I love and who show me love low when theyâ€™re around me because this is somewhat contagious. I know the world would be a better place without me and it breaks my heart to say this because the initial period of suffering me killing myself would cause to my parents and girlfriend would break them forever and have a rippling effect that would last the rest of their lives. 

So is it better to live like a zombie, trying to be as numb as possible outwardly so as to minimise the risk of infecting people with my melancholy? As much as I hate myself it seems more pathetic an existence than just going out on my own terms when Iâ€™ve realised this much.
