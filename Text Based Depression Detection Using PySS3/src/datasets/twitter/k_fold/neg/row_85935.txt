Suicide is the ultimate choice.It's the big one because it determines the choices you get to make for the remainder of your time here on this lovely planet.  In a coin-flip choice, you will notice in the moment where the coin is in the air which option you wanted in the first place.  With suicide you do not get this opportunity.  That only means the answer is innate. 

You may feel insignificant, worthless, or even broken, but you are not.  Regardless of your choices, past, present, or future, you will have made an impact.  The connection isn't always the people you immediately think of as important, either.  Those who are impacted by your life are forever changed in a way that would not be possible without you.  

So I plead to you, those so confused in emotion or twisted logic, if your time in this strange existence is of no value to you, give it away.  Give yourself to others.  Don't take yourself away from the rest of us.  
We want you around.
