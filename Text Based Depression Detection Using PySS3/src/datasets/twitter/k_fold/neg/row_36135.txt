first day at college is not going well.hi reddit. I usually dont do stuff like this but Im seriously not feeling well. I had my first day of college classes today and my pre calculus teacher assigned us about 400 problems to complete by the end of the week. its been one day and ive done only about 50 of them in 6 hours. i have pretty severe depression and i dont think im going to be able to handle this. what should i do? anyone else have something like this that worked out for them.
