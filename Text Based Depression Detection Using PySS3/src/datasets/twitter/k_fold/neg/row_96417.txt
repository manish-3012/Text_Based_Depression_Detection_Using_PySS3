I want to live but my chronic pain is stopping me from livingIâ€™ve come to realize that I have to live with severe chronic pain for the rest of my life because of my nose surgery. I have talked to plenty of surgeons and they have no idea why Iâ€™m experiencing such pain. I donâ€™t think I can ever forgive myself for being so stubborn and stupid. I experience extreme pain and stiffness in my nose and head 24/7. I feel suicidal 24/7. 

I do not want to die and there is so much I want to do and achieve. There are so many places that I want to travel. I have not seen my friends or family for over a year. I am a recluse and I hate it but the pain is unbearable. Prescriptions and painkillers donâ€™t work. How do you overcome suicidal thoughts? Is there still meaning in my life?
