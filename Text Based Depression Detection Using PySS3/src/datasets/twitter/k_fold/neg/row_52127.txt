How to fix not being motivatedI didnâ€™t know the appropriate subreddit to post this on so I came here for help. But this is like an endless cycle for me. Iâ€™ll have a great idea like making a YouTube channel or music and my mind talks to me saying things I canâ€™t do that or i wonâ€™t get far with it bc I donâ€™t know what kind of content I want to put on my channel or what kind of music to make. I get depressed and wonâ€™t have motivation to do anything. Iâ€™ve tried meditation, prayer, just about anything to practice self love but I feel as if it doesnâ€™t help or nothing or no one can help me and then I start thinking about suicide. I want to climb out of this pit Iâ€™m in but I feel like I canâ€™t.
