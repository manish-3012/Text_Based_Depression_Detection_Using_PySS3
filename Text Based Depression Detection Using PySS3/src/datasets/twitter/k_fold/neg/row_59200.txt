My life got so much better, yet I am closer to suicide than ever.Title says it all, doesn't it? Honestly, I don't even know where to begin with explaining the shit going on. 

I'm finally 18. 

I have a decent job with the best colleagues EVER. 

I'm going to school again next year (although I don't have the foggiest where and if I'm gonna like what I chose). 

I will be leaving this goddamn house and thus my goddamn parents.

I got rid of my boyfriend and yes, that makes me happier than ever.

Yet still, every time I walk out of the doors from my job I think "It's time. Let's pick the right method." 

One of my colleagues who I almost see as the sister I never had (although I have two sisters) knows about my *past* of depression/suicidal behavior/selfharm/everything. I want to talk to her. A couple of times I was on the verge of telling her about how I feel recently, but every time it ended up getting so busy that we couldn't talk. 
She works untill 2 PM today. I want to go there at 2 and ask her if she has time. No idea what I want to achieve by talking to her, maybe just someone who knows and who might be there to tell me what to do. The reason I haven't yet is my fear of refusal. What if she doesn't have time? Or she thinks it's stupid I tell her? I have no idea. 

Woo-fucking-hoo. That was my rant. Might as well just.. die. :)
