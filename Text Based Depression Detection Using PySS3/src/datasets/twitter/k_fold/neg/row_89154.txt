This is just stupid at this point.Ups and downs, same pattern of happiness and self worth and then a crash of anger and depression.

Itâ€™s getting so boring and tiring. Just keep on getting kicked when Iâ€™m already down.

Life just wants to see me fail and suffer.

The worst thing that couldâ€™ve happened to me did. Itâ€™s my greatest fear that came true today and Iâ€™m scared.

Iâ€™m all alone and in the dark. It feels like no one is really on my side. Itâ€™s not fair. Nothing is fucking fair.

Why canâ€™t life be kind enough and just stop trying to murder me when Iâ€™m already fucking dead I just donâ€™t fucking get it anymore. 

why me.
