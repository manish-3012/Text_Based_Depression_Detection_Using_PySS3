A long gibberish of a naive scumContains elements of abuse.
I had to write it down somewhere, I'm sorry for posting this trash on your board.

1. When I was 5 year old, older kids who were taking care of me were sexually abusing me. My mother laughed it off. 
2. When I was 13 years old I noted in my diary "only God can save me." Planned to kill myself after I take sacraments at age of 18. I endured constant mental and physical abuse. 
3. Parents forbade me to seek medical help, because I lived in a small town and this would be a disgrace to the whole family. My morning prayer always said "Please let me die today." Unfortunately once when I got hit by a car I didn't die. 
4. When I hit age of 18 I could finally seek help on my own. I received meds and I rediscovered the world. That feeling was amazing.
5. When I was 20 my (now ex) boyfriend raped me. One of the kids from the point number 1 stalked me for over a year and tried to break into my room. Father laughed it off. I was stupid enough to tell my mother about everything - she commanded me to get back to my ex or else I would need to leave the house. After some weeks of her maniacally laughing at me and telling everybody that I got raped, I left.  
6. I've met my new boyfriend. I offered him the rest of my trust and my ugly heart. He offered his own in exchange. 
7. All my bosses were really toxic. I spent my days on stabbing my hand with a pen to blood to  endure the mental abuse they served me. I needed money.
8. My boyfriend sudenly says he loves me but he needs some space. He consulted it all with his mom beforehand. I feel left out, abandonned. 

Please someone kill me already. I'm such a failure that cutting, drowning, hanging and stabbing my wrists with a screwdriver is not effective. Useless, air-consuming, crying potato.
