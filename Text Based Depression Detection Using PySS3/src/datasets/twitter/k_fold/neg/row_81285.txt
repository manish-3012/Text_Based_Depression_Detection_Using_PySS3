Found out tonight my fiancee isn't in love with me anymoreI get it. I have a chronic pain condition which makes me unable to work. My family is fucking nuts but since I couldn't live with them anymore, because my Dad tried to beat me up, I moved in with my fiancee.

Since then I've been in and out of the hospital for suicidal intent but I'm finally doing better.  I even called my crazy abusive mother right before my fiancee opened up.

My love and I have been together since highschool 5 years ago.  We dated and got engaged in college which she graduated from and I had to drop out of because I was too sick to attend, which is how I ended back up at my parents. 

Sorry for the rambling.

I'm losing the only thing I care about in my life.
