Life is not made for everyoneI feel relieved to know that suicide is a way out. I'm elated. The more I think about suicide, tbe easier, and more acceptable, to complete it becomes. I have seriously contemplated suicide in the past with a few "aborted attempts." Maybe they were half-hearted. I just know that I will be ready to end it soon. 

There doesn't need to be a reason. I once wished I was more mentally ill, I wished I was more depressed, more volatile, more  beaten down. Truth is, this life is not made for everyone. I'm fine with being a queer, unaccomplished, lazy human being - but that is not what society needs right now. It's for the better that I am gone.
