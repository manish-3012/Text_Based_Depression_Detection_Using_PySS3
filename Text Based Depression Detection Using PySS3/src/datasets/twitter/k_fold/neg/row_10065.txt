I just want attentionI do, because I've lacked it my entire life. I've never had any close friends, any lover or even anyone compliment me. The only attention I ever received was negative and even that's better than none at all. And why should I receive any attention anyway. I'm a disgusting, pathetic creature. Envious, wrathful, sloth-like, gluttonous, greedy, vain, lustful pig. Why am I even alive? I just suck out all the joy from everyone's lives. No one wants me around. I'm a burden to everyone I meet. No one can help me, because I just push them away or hurt them. If I were to use one word to describe my life it would be 'wretched'. Everyone hates me. I know they do. At school, people make fun of me and laugh about me behind my back. It's like I'm that disgusting creature in the corner that everyone shuns and mocks. Imagine. If I'd been born attractive I could be in such a better place now. But no. I'm hideous in every aspect. Fuck you, God. I'm tired of putting in the effort, just to end up below those who do nothing, below those who are just lucky. I give up. I want to die. Somebody kill me. Please. I can't live on, I want someone to break into my house and shoot me in the head. It's my only consolation, the idea of me dying soon. And I want it now.
