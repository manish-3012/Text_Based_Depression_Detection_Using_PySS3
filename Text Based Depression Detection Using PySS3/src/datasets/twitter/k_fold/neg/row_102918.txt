MONDAY, OCTOBER 12, 2020Monday is the day Iâ€™m planning on finally killing myself. Every day of my life I have to deal with all sorts of psychological pain, yet I canâ€™t talk to anyone about it because they either wouldnâ€™t understand, or they just wouldnâ€™t care. I canâ€™t even find a healthy or even an unhealthy way to cope. Self-harming isnâ€™t even enjoyable anymore and I rarely ever have access to drugs (and the ones Iâ€™ve tried just made me feel like shit, OF COURSE), so every day I just sit there and cry like a pathetic piece of shit. As for the healthier ways, they all take actual skill or motivation that I donâ€™t have. I canâ€™t even talk to my â€œfriendsâ€ (online and irl) about my problems because theyâ€™d just think Iâ€™m crazy. Same goes for my family members. My birthday is only 2 days after I plan on committing suicide, but I honestly donâ€™t care at this point. Iâ€™m done with everything.
