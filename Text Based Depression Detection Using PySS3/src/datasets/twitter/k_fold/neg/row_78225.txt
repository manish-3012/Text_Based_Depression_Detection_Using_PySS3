19 years dealing with depressionI've been on the edge for so long I don't remember what it's like to be happy. I'm in the middle of nowhere. No jobs anywhere near me. The only crazy fling I had has my car. No money and no food. For all intents and purposes I've been single 10 of the last 11 years. No real friends. I'm surrounded by narrow minded people. Really no options. I've called in favors and no one even tries to give me help
