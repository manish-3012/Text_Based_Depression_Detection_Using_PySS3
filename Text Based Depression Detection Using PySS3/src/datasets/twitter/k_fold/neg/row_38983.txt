was gonna kill myself in the morning but i remembered it's my partner's birthday tomorrowgo ahead and give me your "yay i'm so glad ur still gonna be here~" bullshit

it's worthless and it hasn't helped me for my entire 22 years of a completely fucked up life full of abuse and rape and abandonment

not that any of you will ever get it through your heads but some lives just can't be saved
