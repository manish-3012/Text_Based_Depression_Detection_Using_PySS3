Killing myself at work tomorrowNot the first time Iâ€™m trying but i have things lined up this time. Iâ€™m fucking done. I have BPD, MDD, and Anxiety. Meds make me feel so empty and Iâ€™m still anxious and apparently dumb. I screwed up at work and am having a meeting about my employment tomorrow. Iâ€™ve worked here for a year, showed up minutes after I tried to kill myself but still got yelled at for being late, and worked full time hours while in school, but now Iâ€™m being fucked over. I havenâ€™t taken my Prozac prescription for a week and it wore off so Iâ€™m going to kill myself in front of my fuck ass manager. Itâ€™s all planned out and Iâ€™m finally gonna be free :)
