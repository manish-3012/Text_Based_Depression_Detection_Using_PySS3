New year, same crapWhat the fuck is wrong with me:

1. Spend a shit-ton of money on education;
2. Never feel motivated enough to work on school stuff;
3. Know that I **need** to have good grades so I can finish my B.A. degree;
4. Parents counting on me;
5. Don't even try since the beginning;
6. Gets first grade evaluation;
7. Gets one of the lowest on the class;
8. Feel like absolute shit, but know it's going to keep happening;

I was positive for 2019, but looks like it's going to be the same, or even worse...
