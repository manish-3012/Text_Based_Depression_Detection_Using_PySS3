I absolutely despise the corona virus. It took away everything I was staying alive for.I fucking hate the Corona virus. It took away my robotics and my girlfriend. 

My team was at the starting of the robotics season when the government cancelled any events over 250 people. We just finished our first regional and then it was cancelled and I was fucking devastated. This was my first and last year that I was able to be in this robotics group (since it only goes up to grade 12) and I wanted it to be better than this. I didn't want it to end this way. Then the government starts up social distancing which I understand why they need to but now I only get to ever talk with my girlfriend once a week since her mother is a controlling bitch which my gf would agree with. All of this accumulated has made me feel terribly depressed. It feels like everything was ripped away from me in a split instant and I can't do anything about it. I just feel like I won't be able to go on suffering like this until they find a vaccine. I feel hopeless and like there nothing left to live for. Thank you for taking the time to read this rant.
