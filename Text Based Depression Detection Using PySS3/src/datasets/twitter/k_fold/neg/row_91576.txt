I want to hear from some fellow suicidal people on alcoholism. I'm pretty sure I'm an alcoholic.I kind of use it as a coping mechanism. I drink a lot of nights. I don't get hammered or blacked out drunk or anything, I just drink until I don't feel like it anymore, which is usually around 5 drinks depending on the night I guess. The thing about my drinking, is, I know it's wrong, and my closest friends don't like it, but they won't ever speak up about it. But what they don't know is why I drink. I use it to stop feeling the way I do when I'm sober at night. I've been sober the last three nights, and it was the worst three night stretch I've had in a long time. I was extremely suicidal last night; I went for a drive, because that usually calms me down but it didn't feel right, and I started to have think about driving as fast as I could into a tree or something. So I turned back and went home. I tried to talk to my friend about it, the only friend who knows I'm suicidal, but that didn't go so well. Now we're not on great terms, once again. She hates that I drink for the reasons I do, but she won't ever help me even though I've asked numerous times. I know it's a bad habit and I've tried quitting once before, but I barely lasted one night. These last few nights (where I was just too lazy to go buy more alcohol) have made me scared to quit drinking because I know what'll happen if I do without a reliable alternate coping method. There are people I want to talk to, a couple I consider close friends, some not as much, but I like them a lot and trust them. I just don't feel like it would be right. To talk about my alcohol use would mean bringing up my suicidal past and tendencies, things I've only ever talked about with one friend, who I trust more than anyone. I'm also not in great contact with these people. We're all apart since university is done for the summer, so it's not easy. I don't know what I expect from this post, but maybe I'll feel better getting some of these things off my chest to someone other than my unhelpful friend.
