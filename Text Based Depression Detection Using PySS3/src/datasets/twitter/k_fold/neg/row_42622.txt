Shattered in 3 months.A little less than 3 months ago, the love of my life killed herself. I've been in and out of doctors offices, and had to move back in with my unsupportive parents. Within these 3 months, my parents have completely turned their backs on me, and my brother hasn't spoken too me, and I've broken my foot. Now I've been kicked out of the house, and am living in my car, not able to walk. I thought it couldn't get worse after her death, but I was wrong. I want to join her, so I can be with her again, and feel something other than numb.
