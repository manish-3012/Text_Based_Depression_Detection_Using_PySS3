I've just tried to commit suicideSo, I've already made a post about some reasons that I wanted to end it all, but idk what happened today, I was like kind off happy browsing through Reddit and then, just from nowhere I started thinking in commiting suicide, I'm not sure why but I was just invaded but that feeling, a feeling in which your only desire is to end it all, and I tried to hang myself in a door with a "corbata" (I forgot how it's called in English, I think tie?) I put it under my chin and decided to listen some music, then I decided to leave myself drop, and hang from the tie, I felt a lot of pressure in my head and for like 2 seconds my vision was extremely blurry, after that I think that I felt unconscious and I can't remember almost anything, I'm not sure if it's my imagination or an actual memory in which I was thinking and singing the song in my mind, I was completely relaxed. After that I don't know how or why but I recovered consciousness, so I just jumped or something like that for let the blood flow to my brain again, I felt so scared on thinking how close I was to die and how lucky I was for recovering consciousness, I untied the tie from the door and now I have a red mark on the front part of my neck, I felt so stupid after that, I don't know why but I felt like "why I tried this?" I think that I'm ok and no serious damage was caused, but I'm just shocked in thinking how close I was to die, and no one realized that; even after untying myself from the door I couldn't get off the tie from me because the knot was too tight and I had to go out of my room for a knife to cut it off, no one realized that I was in shock, trembling, I have a pretty big mark on my neck, I was hyperventilating. No one cared about that.

But for now I just want to continue alive, even though I hate this world, and this life I have the hope that this will be better someday and even if not, I only have one life and I have to enjoy it, do whatever I want but enjoy it, and I feel so stupid after thinking all of that, my only life (a very improbable thing, that I, specifically I was born); I almost lost it, it was just an impulse but idk how to feel rn
