Iâ€™m gonna lose it.Man, Iâ€™ve been in recovery from self harm for well over 6 months but I can feel a relapse coming. My whole body wants to explode. I went for a drive. Not much help. I want to scream. I cry. Iâ€™m numb. Then mire crying. I swear I feel a breakdown coming; I nor my family can afford a breakdown. Especially financially. Then my roommate somehow made my feeling so depressed about her? (Hence the drive) I can keep going without something happening. I work at 8, itâ€™s 3:15. All I can think about is hacking up my thigh with a razor blade. Or jumping into the Mississippi. Anything to just stop feeling like my brain is going to turn into one of those cartoon computers that overloads, catches on fire, and explodes. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep it together.
