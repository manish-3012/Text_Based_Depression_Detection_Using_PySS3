Not suicidal but stillI feel like shit most of the time even if im living an ok life. Theres just this voice that keeps on repeating all the bad shit in this world and about me in my head. Im always anxious at social event and have a very basic social life where my friends leave me on seen if i just ask them a question. Our groupchat is dead and they all moved to another one without putting me in it and i feel like unwanted garbage. Most night i end up depressed and thinking about how i keep fucking up. I completly changed my life from last year and lost a lot of weight and got buff thanks to lifting but no amounts of weights can fix this endless hole in me. I just look at how some people get texts from a loved one and laugh or kiss in public and immediatly think to myself about how ill never get to experience that. I just feel hopeless. And I did talk to my parents about it but all they did was say its just some phase and just cheer up but you cant. You cant just cheer up. Thank you to whoever read this. I just wanted to rant.
