I'm thinking about ending my life.I do not know what to do anymore . I think I'm at the end of it . 

I'm in so much pain . So much anguish . I dont really know where to go anymore . As I type this I'm in my office, just crying.  Is life really worth living for me ? For the past 10 years I've helped the homeless , went through many peoples suicidal tendieces and helped so many . But I dont see anyone there for me . No one to help me in my time of need. I think I really am considering it.
