Living the sacred scary lifehi um.. im crying writing this text idk who i even should talk to.. im not anti social but Its just sometimes i feel like a burden and i just want to make everyone nights happy.. Im writing this text at 2 am lmao ironic.. And idk if yall will ever get to read it but yea.. Im a syrian kid who lives in saudi arabia.. And i used to live an amazing life and things were going good for us untill at some point taxes for non-citizins became a thing... And that fucked our whole family up.. and i think im going back to syria where is literally people dying lmao  so there is that and like.. i did commit suicide twice when i was in middle school bc of stupid religion Lol.. my parents both are homophobic and im lgbtq so there is that too.. Idk But have yall feel that just as soon as you were born life was meant to give up on u? like how is fair to see other people live happily and carefree when you get to go through all of this just for a 000.01 amount of moments that are happy.. and at this point the happy became not worth lol.. Sounds cliche but i was thinking if life gave up on us why cant we give up on life back.. personally i tried.. like i just want a good way and i want to do it so badly.. the thoughts never stop they keep following me.. even if i wanna do better they keep following me on each low.. I wrote alot chile.. anyways so
