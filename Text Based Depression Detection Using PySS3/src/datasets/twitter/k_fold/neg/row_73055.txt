Iâ€™m so tired I want to dieIâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to make any meaningful relationships. Iâ€™m tired of going to work so I can make shit money and get nowhere. Iâ€™m tired of hurting all over. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to sleep. Iâ€™m tired of my shitty bed that I canâ€™t replace because I donâ€™t make enough money to fucking live. Iâ€™m tired of being here and I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.
