All jobs make me suicidalI feel like no matter what kind of work I do the intense despair and dread and emptiness will always be present when Iâ€™m working. I have no interests and I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life. Thereâ€™s just nowhere to go in this world where my life wonâ€™t be torture. All work fucking sucks no matter what it is thatâ€™s why itâ€™s called work, and sadly this shit is required to live. Fuck I wish I didnâ€™t have to deal with this garbage.
