I am getting much worse. I need help, but I don't know what to do.I posted here a few weeks ago, and it helped me at the time. But recently, I have noticed that things are getting much worse for me. It's very difficult for me to keep things to myself. I'm worried that this will start affecting my everyday life again.

I am a 17 year old guy. Long story short, I was born with a birth defect which has caused me a lot of shame, anger, depression, anxiety, etc., really for as long as I can remember. It's not something that other people know about or can tell, but it's something that affects my quality of life. I still need several surgeries, but they are not covered at all by my family's insurance, and I don't know when I would be able to afford them on my own.

I have been struggling with severe depression that seems to come in phases for almost 10 years, since I was 8. I first attempted suicide when I was 9 years old. For the first time in almost 5 years, I'm having suicidal thoughts. I was miserable, and I truly wanted to die. I am scared that I'm regressing like this.

I just feel so tired of living. I will never be able to completely fix my birth defect. It will always be with me, and that's something that fills me with sadness and bitterness. Because of it, I don't know if I can ever be in a relationship. Some people with my condition never are. I can never be a father. It is very difficult to have to try to cope with my infertility. I don't think that many people my age have to do this.

I don't know what to do. I know that I need help, but I feel very guilty and uncomfortable talking to my parents about how I'm feeling. I know that my family loves me and cares about me, but I feel so guilty when I think about all the shit I've put them through and all the money I've cost them. Talking to my mom isn't helpful and actually worsens things, so I just keep things to myself. But I know that I need help, and I am scared. I don't know what to do.

I just feel like my existence is utterly pointless. I truly feel that I am a a waste of space. I already feel like I am regressing horribly, and I'm worried that things will get worse. I don't want to be like this anymore. What do I do?
