I don't want this anymore.I don't want to be the person I am, I can't deal with this. My parents think I'm okay now, everyone thinks I'm okay. But I'm not, I want to leave this place. I want to kill myself or just walk out that door because maybe being free wont make me feel this way anymore. I'm a worthless human, and I have always felt this way. But I'm too afraid to ask for help, I don't want people to think I am faking or my problems aren't real. Its 2:34am. Is there any reason I shouldn't kill myself?
