No friends. Mean person. 25 y/o burnoutI'm widely disliked. Memetically. People in my city share Facebook posts making jokes about how disliked I am. People in online communities ban me. People at my work find me unnerving. I think I have some strange mix of sociopathy and Asperger's. People seem unhappier for my presence. I understand you probably find this very pitious, but it's more pragmatic. I'm cruel and vindictive and narcissistic. There's no happiness in my life that isn't drug-induced and I'm about to crest two months sober. I actively make other people unhappy with my presence. Why shouldn't I? When people say there's no good reason to commit suicide, that seems more like an aphorism than a statement of fact. People genuinely don't like me. I don't like people, most of the time. The people I do like, won't acknowledge our friendship in front of others. I have no friends. None. I have no-one. I think I have brain damage that makes me the way I am.

In all honesty, why should I stay alive?
