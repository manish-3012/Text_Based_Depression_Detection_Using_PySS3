What's the point?I'm 23 years old. I'm a guy with bipolar disorder. I am in the middle of the worst depressed state of my life. I miss my ex-girlfriend so much that my heart hurts to keep beating. I feel like I'm playing a video-game with no objective. I feel like the saddest man in the world. I haven't talked to her in almost 3 years. I have become a recluse. I lost all of my friends. I don't go outside. I gained weight. I miss her every day.
