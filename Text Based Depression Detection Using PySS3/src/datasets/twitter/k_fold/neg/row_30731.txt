In the eye of the hurricane right nowIt's strange to be able to put this into words, but I can see what's happening this time.  I'm right in the calm center of it, with shit-thoughts whipping all around me and half-assed plans of ending my life on the horizon.  I am insane at this moment, but you'd never know it looking at me, having coffee and chatting, getting an email or seeing my photo.  Insane.
