Nobody would care if I was gone, and thatâ€™s what hurts the mostIâ€™ve endured an ex committing suicide this past November, and many other deaths prior to his. 
People I know, people I consider acquaintances. 
When the news got out about their life not being existent the world paused for many and so many people opened up about how hurt they were. 

But if that were me - I was the one who took my life?
Nobody would care. I would not have left the same kind of impact as the others Iâ€™ve seen, I wouldnâ€™t have people there like them. 

I feel so fucking useless. I just want to take my life in the most peaceful way. I have nobody who cares.
