genuine question:sorry if this breaks any rules - I'm new and my mobile isn't loading the sidebar.


 anyway I'm 21 y/o female and I'm extremely in debt to two different payday loan places because my paycheck add much smaller than expected (they punched in my hours wrong on the schedule. making me only be able to ha e a max of 3 days a week..) 


I'm terrified and deeply upset and anxious over this. I have clinical depression and GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I'm trying to get clean from heroin and I'm genuinely curious: is it even worth it ? like, will things really get better? cause ever since I've been trying to kick everything around me has gone to shit. I hate my life and myself. today's mantra has been "don't kill yourself. just make it one more hour. one more minute."
