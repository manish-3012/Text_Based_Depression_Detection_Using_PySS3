Think I'm about to get fired from a job that's made me contemplate suicide for yearsI got an email in my inbox at the end of the day today from my manager, which mentioned "a list of things you need to improve if you wish to remain a member of this team." Shortly after, I found out that a coworker I thought I was on amicable terms with has been complaining about me to my manager, and that I'm now viewed as someone with an attitude problem... The email closed by telling me I should strongly consider whether this job is something I wish to keep, and that I had a few days before a meeting where I would be discussing 'next steps'.

The truth is, I've been applying to other jobs for the last two years, and haven't even been able to land an interview anywhere. I hate this job enough that most days after work I spend time wishing I had the recklessness to walk off the roof of the building, and now I'm terrified that when I go in tomorrow I'm not going to be able to stop myself.

I feel completely blindsided, and betrayed by someone I considered a friend. The email included phrases like "as we've told you before in performance reviews...", when in those same reviews I felt like I was being told I'd made significant improvements in my work relationships. Right now I'm supporting my brother through school and letting him live with me, and I don't know what's going to happen if I lose my job -- I won't have the money to support him, let alone myself, and the next nearest family members are over four hours away.

I've spent most of the evening applying to every job that's even remotely a fit for my skills, but I can't stem this rising panic that my life is about to be ruined and I really just want it all to stop.
