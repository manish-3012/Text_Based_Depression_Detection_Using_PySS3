Contemplating, but I what do I tell people?I'm lucky, I may be here in my dark bathroom crying my eyes out; but I have friends and people in my life who love me. 

I don't want to be just a sad news story, but I despise who I am and my reasons to live shorten by the day. I want to kill myself, and have had depression diagnosed for three years. No one knows, or has a grasp of what I think and feel.

What do I tell those I love? Has anyone with experience in confiding with someone have an answer? I want to communicate, if I do this I want those who love me to have closure.
