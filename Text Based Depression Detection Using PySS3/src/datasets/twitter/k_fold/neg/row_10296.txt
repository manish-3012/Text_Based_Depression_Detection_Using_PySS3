Small things that make u even feel worser to leave this sick worldToday i went grocery shopping for my mom, i wasnt not in the mood but she couldnt go so i had to go. I was just wearing a hoodie with a legging, just basic and all covered up. I got catcalled by 2 men, i felt so not comfy and miserable about myself but i ignored it and walked forward. Not 30 mins later again i got catcalled again, this time by teenagers. Maybe yall wont understand but i dont like attention and i didnt wear anything to seek attention for. Like i said i was already not in the mood, have so many things on my mind and i needed to cry because of a stupid catcalling. Now i am here in my bed, and thinkinf about everything whats going on my life its so hard for me. Im fuckin exhausted. I just wanna stay home and fuckin die. 

Why dont men understand that catcalling is not done? Why do yall need to say stuff about a women her bodyparts? And why arent others helping? People always enjoying to watch others, or they just laugh.
