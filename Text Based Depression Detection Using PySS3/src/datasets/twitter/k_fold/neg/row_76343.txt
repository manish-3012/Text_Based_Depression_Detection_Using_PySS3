i am invisible in a cruel chaotic worldin a world that doesn't stop moving, i am invisible. the constant screaming anxiety that pits in my stomach and the depression that's slowly killing me continue to grow. i am invisible.

nobody sees my hurt. i am a stepping stone to be used and thrown away. i am a rusted cog that doesn't fit in the scheme of the factory. i am lonely. i am invisible.

i just want to be seen. i want company and no pill crammed down my throat can fix that; my demons name is lonely, and it's my only friend.

does a tree that falls in a forest with no one to hear it even make a sound?
