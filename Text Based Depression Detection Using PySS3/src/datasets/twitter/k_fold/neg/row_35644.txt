I'm feeling more suicidal than usualI don't know if I need to just get this all out and forget I ever though about it but I think I've reached the peak point where killing my self seems to be the best option, there's a few things that have lead me up to this so bear with me, Ever since I left secondary school and everyone stopped talking to me I've had what seems like very bad social anxiety, I've always been really shy and going from school to a sixth form to being an apprentice has been very hard socially for me, I've always managed to make friends eventually but meeting new people is very hard and feeling like people don't just tolerate that i'm there is quiet hard.

A few weeks ago I moved to a new work location with a new team and again I feel very uncomfortable and this isn't a we're all in the same boat and we're all new I'm the only new one and I can't see my self fitting in when I'm too "shy" to try talk to people without feeling like shit, I find it very hard to get to a stage where I can at least try to fit in with a new crowd and it leaves me drained and depressed when I finally get time to myself and I really don't know if I can do it again mentally if that makes sense, obviously if I was alive I eventually, hopefully would.

 I've also got a very strained home life, the relationship with my mum is going downhill and everything I do is wrong in her eyes making me not want to speak to her to avoid the constant insults and lies which makes her angry...it's a big circle of how many times my mum can beat my down and play the victim at the same time (a rare talent) and it's not like I can just leave, my dad's already screwed me over constantly throughout my life and I don't have anywhere else to go or money to get anywhere.

I've had suicidal thoughts for round about 8 years and I've never talked about it until now, i'm 21 now and I really can't see a future anymore, I don't know if I can do any of this again and still keep a shred of happiness at the end off it all. I've stopped enjoying a lot of things, I've not got a lot of energy and just feel shit about myself constantly. In a perfect world I wouldn't kill myself and all my lifes problems would be sorted out when I woke up but realistically that's not going to happen thus the suicide comes into effect.

I don't really want to speak to helplines, I don't know if that's a "shyness" thing but typing is easier as it kind of feels safer in a way so please don't ram helplines down my throat

I really don't know if I just wanted to get this off my chest or if I really want help with this but at the moment I feel fully prepared to kill myself knowing that at least I won't have to wake up tomorrow and feel all this again, Maybe i'm just being dramatic but I can;t be bothered doing this anymore
