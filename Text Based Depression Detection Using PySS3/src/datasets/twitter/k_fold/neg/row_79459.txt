Not sure what else to do.My mental health background: I am overall unhappy. I'm in my late 20s. I've been depressed, anxious, and suicidal since I was a child (suicidal thoughts set in before I was ten). I have severe PTSD and panic disorder caused by family abuse. I've been in therapy and taken different medications. I went to college, spent a few years in my career, was miserable, quit, and can't find any job I really do like. It left me with a lot of debt and I also have medical debt from a suicide attempt that didn't work. For now I'm just working what pays my bills. I have chronic pain and major nervous system problems (I don't want to be too specific for my own privacy since it's a more rare disease). I have medical debts from this and I am in constant pain and have to stay home due to my illness frequently. I spend most of my time miserable even though I try my hardest to reflect on positive thoughts just because of all the stuff I have gone through/am going through. I spent a lot of my childhood getting through things by telling myself things could only get better but it looks like they haven't and won't. Nothing really interests me and I don't really have any kind of goals I care about. I've tried doing new things, going new places, building relationships, having a gym membership. I'm just unhappy with the world we live in and the life I have lived/am living. Sometimes I feel like this world must be hell and I am being punished for something. 

I wanted to share some of the reasons I am unhappy and contemplate suicide frequently. I'm hoping someone reads this and has some  advice that might help me. Thank you for reading.
