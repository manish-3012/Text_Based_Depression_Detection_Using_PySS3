I hardly care anymoreLately I've just stopped caring about so many things I used to care a lot about. Even though I've always hated my career choices, I've still put a lot into it. Lately I've been showing up late, not giving a shit what people say anymore. I have to get there at 4am and the shifts are seriously 16-17 hours long and I just, don't give a shit anymore. If I lose this job Idk how I'll be able to pay for anything in my life anymore: and I still don't even care. I should be asleep already, but I hardly care. I've started drinking almost every single day. I picked up smoking again. I've been spending so much of my money lately. I usually budget with strict rules and regulations. I've just been buying whatever the fuck I want.

I've been getting intense night terrors.

I either don't sleep at all or I sleep way too much. 

If I don't take my anxiety medicines, I get sickening intrusive thoughts that spiral themselves into excruciating panic attacks. 

I don't want this anymore. 

I'm transgender, and all of the attention we've gotten this past week because of the stupid president had re-exposed me to a ton of trans-phobia and hatred that I almost forgot existed because I've been enjoying my own little world without all of that stuff. 

My parents are ashamed of me.

I'm ashamed of myself.

I don't see a good future anymore. The older I'm becoming, the less of that youthful hope remains. 

I just don't really care anymore, and I'm pretty much just tired and beat down. I don't want to go to work tomorrow for 17 hours straight on 4 hours of sleep again. I can't do it anymore
