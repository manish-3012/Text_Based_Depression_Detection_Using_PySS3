I hate having good dreamsEver since i went broke and cant smoke weed i started dreaming again. (when i sleep high i have no dreams)
So, every fucking day i see dreams of me hanging out with old friends and people i've pushed out of my life, sometimes i dream im just chilling and talking with a girl i still havent gotten over all those years, usually getting high and laughing and having a good time.
And then i wake up, and i realise all this shit is long gone, i have no friends to chill out with, the girl i used to like has vanished for the past 4 years, i have literally no one to talk to face2face, only one old friend who has moved on with his life and now we only talk through social media.
I DONT WANT TO SEE ANY MORE GOOD DREAMS 
But i literally never have nightmares, i cant even remember the last time i had a bad dream.
Fuck this shit the only thing left to satisfy me was sleep but thats ruined too cause i go to sleep knowing i will wake up pissed off and miserable the next day looking for my friends.
