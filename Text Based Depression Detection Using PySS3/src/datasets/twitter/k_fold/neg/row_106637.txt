All is lostI want to make this post to educate people on the over looked signs of suicide. (because everyone has overlooked them or ignored mine)


My wife is having an affair and has decided to rip our family apart.


I've made so many references and detailed jokes about how I will kill myself... (hanging from a rafter or the tall bridge near where we live)

And everyone laughs and says "yeah right" or even my best friend said "I'd prefer if you didn't".


I've been battling this for months now... I've made my decision... my wife will be going on holiday with her lover on the 8th for three days and this is when I will do it.


No one knows.... no one paid attention my pleas for help..


What kills me is leaving behind my 23 month old and 10 year old daughter.

I read my wifes diary and i found out she has been influencing our daughter to call him "daddy" and "pappa"....


Which to me simply reinforces the fact that i am not needed and am temporary (as i have always been).


I am not posting this for sympathy - I am posting this so people underatand the little comments that you may think are a funny joke... are actually a request or cry for help. 


My "finis vitae" will be around the 8th to the 10th.


I'll make sure the kids are safe at home at night; and before I do I will notify friends / neighbors.



Please... do not ignore the signs.. because by the time you realize them it maybe too late.


My time has passed.


Love and forgiveness to all.
