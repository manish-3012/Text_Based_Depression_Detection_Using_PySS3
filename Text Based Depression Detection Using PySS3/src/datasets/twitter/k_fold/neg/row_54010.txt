I'm DoneIt's not that I want to kill myself but I would welcome death, I have 0 friends, no job, homeless and recently split from my fiancÃ© and found out my 2 year old isn't biologically mine. I'm moving around a lot at the minute to different family houses but I just don't know what to do. I miss my son so much and my home and fiancÃ© but now I'm left with absolutely nothing and I just don't see the point anymore. All I ever wanted was a friend to spend my life with. Everyone has groups of friends but all I want is one person I could be friends with to talk to and I can't find anyone anywhere. I have looked at ways I can go but I'm to scared. Not of dying but the pain and the fact that one day I might be able to have a life again and if I kill myself Ill miss out but tbh I don't see any other way out of the hole I'm in, if you have read this thankyou cause I really don't expect anyone to or understand what I'm going through but if you do and can text me or have any advise please do because I'm so lonely right now and I don't want to die but i cant keep going on like this any longer.
