I'm pretty sure I'm spiraling towards itI've been depressed and had ideation for so long it's not even scary anymore. I don't want to be me and I can't change myself. I'm such fucked up person. I don't belong anywhere man. I've tried- and am done. I've climbed to the top of the pyramid of self actualization and realized I should jump.
