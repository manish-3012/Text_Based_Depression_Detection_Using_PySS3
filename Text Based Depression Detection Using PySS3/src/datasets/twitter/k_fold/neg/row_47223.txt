Should I get help?About 2 years ago I came out as gay but before that I suffered from really bad depression and considered suicide. Since I've come out I've been generally happy but my situation hasn't really changed. Thankfully in less than a year I will be in college and away from my ultra religious environment. However recently I've been starting to be depressed again. I can last until college where then I may actually be able to be happy for the first time in my life. I just wanted to know if it would be beneficial to see a professional and what the benefits of that would be.
