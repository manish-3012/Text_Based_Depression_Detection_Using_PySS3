Last night I begged for death, this morning I woke up crying because I was still alive...It was really unfortunate to see that my prayers did not work. I was supposed to go to school at 8 in the morning but didnâ€™t because I was crying that I wasnâ€™t dead. I was so crushed that I had to continue dragging myself along in a reality I want no part of. All I was doing this morning was thinking about how to write my suicide note I was in no state for college. Should I write a suicide note not? What will be less painful for my family?
