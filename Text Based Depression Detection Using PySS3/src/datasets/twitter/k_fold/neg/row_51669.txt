Going to be homeless or dead by tomorrow.I'm leaving my house tomorrow, either in a bag or voluntarily. I have no friends, no ambition, I'm suicidal depressed, and have been since the 5th grade,  and my relationship with my parents and family is so bad I wouldn't be surprised if they kicked me out themselves, sometimes this week. Wouldn't be the first time. I've spent half of my life waiting for things to get better and they haven't, they've only gotten worse, and I honestly don't have the desire or drive to make it better, and almost nobody (definitely not my family) has ever offered me a lick of help.

I have no money (not even enough for a bus), no food, no phone, and like I said, no friends. I've also accidentally left an obvious mark on my neck. I know this might be a lot to burden you guys with, and god knows how full this subreddit is, but if there's someone out there that could make my possibly (probably?) short life a bit better I'd be if nothing else, thankful.
