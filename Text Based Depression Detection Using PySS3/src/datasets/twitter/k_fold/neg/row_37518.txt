A-levels and college making me suicidalI hate going in to get given more and more  work when I'm struggling to cope. I hate that the teachers just tell me to "manage my time better". I have no motivation to work anymore. I have pressure to do well and get a part-time job. I feel worse when i see people with worse issues cause i feel like i should be greatful for my privileges. I feel like people i know don't want to know me. I get frequent urges to cut myself when I even think about going. What do i do? It's pushing me towards the edge...
