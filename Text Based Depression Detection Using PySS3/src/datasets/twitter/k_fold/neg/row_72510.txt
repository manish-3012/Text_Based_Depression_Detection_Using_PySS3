I'm usually the one helping people, now I'm seriously considering jumping off the roof of my apt buildingIn a past life (i.e. a year + ago), I was a therapist. Until my own depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues got in the way. All my life I thought the only way to turn my pain into something useful would be to help others, to approach them from a point of empathy and understanding to help them feel less alone in whatever they were going through. 

But I had to quit being a therapist, largely because I stopped believing there is any hope for me. I've been mentally ill since childhood and while people tell me I have gifts to offer the world, I can't rise over the barrier my mind sets out for me. I'm constantly arguing the voice in my head that tells me I'm alone, I'll never be satisfied in life, I'm one of those people who can't ever recover, I've been sick for too long...and on and on, coupled with name calling and emotional outbursts that I cannot control.

I have felt like killing myself for years, came very close last year and wound up first in the ER then on an inpatient ward. I'd rather die than go there again...I came out worse from that hellhole than I was when I went in and it took a lot of effort to rebuild what little I had before my attempt. I've been working on myself non-stop for a year and three months, I've made major changes to my life that I thought would help me move forward, and I STILL feel depressed, hopeless, eternally lonely. I've already reached out to my major support tonight and I don't want to bother them anymore. I don't want to bother anyone anymore. Please, I'm not looking for advice, just people to talk to so I can distract myself from this ridiculous google search of  how tall of a building I'd need to jump off to die instantly. I'm so sick of this, and so scared of myself. If someone could help, I'd be so grateful.
