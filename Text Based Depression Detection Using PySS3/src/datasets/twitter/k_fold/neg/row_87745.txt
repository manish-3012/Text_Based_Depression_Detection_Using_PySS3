I want to dieI simply can't keep on living this shitty life and continue being in pain. Because that's what life is about: suffering and pain. I'm worthless, unwanted and most of the time alone. I had several breakdowns yesterday. I'm so fucking broken. I'm tired of being alone. I'm probably gonna do it soon.
