Just a message. Sorry if it may be a little long.Iâ€™ve been on one wild ride this year. I mean so many emotions and so many things to go through. Itâ€™s a lot to take in. I know a lot of people are on edge and a lot of people are going through so much but I just wanted to say this. I still have faith that things get better. As someone with lots of anxiety issues, I felt like I couldnâ€™t take it anymore. All I saw was negativity and people hating me for my religion and other stuff. Someone even told me to kms. Stuff hurts. Almost did too. But I couldnâ€™t do that to my family, nor my younger sister either. So many restless nights of nothing but pain. With all the negativity around the internet, idek if people are acting like people anymore. We should be positive about each other and try to build each other, not the other way around, especially in the conditions that weâ€™re faced with. Yes Iâ€™m a Christian, but why does that matter? Why does it make you upset? It only makes me feel worse, what happened to respecting each otherâ€™s beliefs? In fact believing in a God actually helps me feel at peace, as a way to cope or to keep making me go on. I know things may seem gloomy but our best bet is to keep on trying. Do something that will benefit you and help you, make you feel happier. Anything, a therapist, a family member, a friend. Iâ€™m obviously still depressed but I tell myself this because I wonâ€™t let people push me to the point of suicide, even if I feel like nothing. We should try and help each other, and always focus on the positives. I just felt like saying this because I felt like some people needed it. Or maybe because I feel like Iâ€™m on the verge of suicide and I just want support. Iâ€™m just so tired of negativity. It doesnâ€™t help me. 

Sorry that this may seem long but please keep yourself safe.
