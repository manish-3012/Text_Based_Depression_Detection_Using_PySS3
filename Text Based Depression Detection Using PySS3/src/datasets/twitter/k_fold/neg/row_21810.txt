Is this rock bottom yet? (x-post from r/stopdrinking)Welp, badge reset. Again. Got drunk last night, for no real reason. Blacked out, did some drugs, threatened my grandmother's life (yes...my grandmother), woke up late (and still very drunk) for work, lost said job due to lateness, got kicked out of my house (due to said threatening), and now I'm here...

I don't really see the point in continuing. I mean, I've made a such beautiful mess of things. I think things are beyond repair at this point.
