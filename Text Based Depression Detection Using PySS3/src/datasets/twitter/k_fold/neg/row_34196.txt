â€œPerfectâ€ life but still want to dieI read a lot of posts on here that say â€œI have nothing to live for,â€ â€œno one cares about me,â€ â€œI have no one...â€ etc... and people describe tragic and horrible circumstances and not having any skills or hobbies and all of that draws them towards suicide. 

Iâ€™m stuck because objectively speaking, looking from the outside in, my life is seemingly perfect and going great, yet I STILL restrict, binge, purge, cut, and want to die. I have SO much going for me, and I know it. I have 2 great jobs, a 4.0 GPA in college, Iâ€™m financially stable, have a supportive family and friends, and people care about me. I know my intelligence and skills and I know how beautiful life can be. And I know that I can graduate college and go on to do great and meaningful things.

So someone tell me why the fuck I keep self destructing and why I canâ€™t get better. Iâ€™ve been fighting anorexia, depression, and now recently diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, for 7 years, and I can never seem to be okay with my life, no matter how fucking great it is. Iâ€™m laying in my bed and I just want to OD or jump off of a building. I want to purge or restrict or drink myself to death. And I have no idea why. And Iâ€™m nearing to the end of being able to deal with this. Iâ€™m absolutely exhausted of fighting. Clearly I canâ€™t win in this battle. And I just want out...
