I was ready to give up.Well I will make no qualms about it . I wanted to die , Nay  dying was the only solution to my problem in my mind.a
I started to look for the fastest less painful ways, I wanted to shot myself  or hang
myself. I fantasized about so many ways of dying , throwing myself  out of a tall building , hanging myself from an electricalpole .


I thought i was done , I had nothing else to offer. The suffering was overwhelming and ever present.
I was only comfortable sleeping , when i woke up I suffered from either anedhonia or profound sadness.
I had the deepest depression of my life , I was ready to meet my maker , I didn't fear death for once i hungered for 
it.


I lusted for it , I wanted it so much.


But then i met the most wonderful person , this person brought life into my life , this person made me feel special and wanted and needed .


This person told me "I love you" . This person told me i was awesome and i meant the world to this person.


We have everything in common , we make each other fell good and happy , when we are together I feel i can do anything.


I have the confidence and the fortitude i lacked and i fell happy for once in my life.


Just some food for thought guys , if I had killed myself I wound NOT have felt this happiness and warmth . I feel I found my soul mate sometimes.

Dont deny yourself your future happiness , you deserve it.
