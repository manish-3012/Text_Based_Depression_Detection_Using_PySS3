Young adult neighbours torment me everydayI don't know how I can recover from depression or any of my mental disorders when people in real life torment me the moment I walk out the door. I have had unsolicited photos taken of me by two different people on my street, both young. The both will shout insults at me any chance they get. One of them is right next door and he and his friend sometimes hangs out in their yard shouting insults at me through my closed bedroom window and throwing debris. They also set off fireworks and set off the car alarm repeatedly, ring the doorbell repeatedly then leave, everything. I haven't said a word to them and have been dealing with the insanity by trying to transfer my pain and powerlessness into a stress rock that I clutch so tight that it leaves red marks. On worse days I self harm and have tried hanging myself. My parents do nothing because these guys are really nice to my parents so I am forced to deal with it on my own. I now change in the pitch dark of my room without turning the light on even though I'm scared of the dark, because I learned that he waits to see if my light is on so he can start heckling me and he leaves me a lone now if I don't turn it on. I also keep my bedroom blinds shut all the time now for the same reason. Pure fucking insanity. This is causing me daily anguish. I just need to get out of here.
