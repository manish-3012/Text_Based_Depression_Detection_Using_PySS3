This is a call for help. PleaseMy family have been controlling me like a puppet. 3 strings arms legs and mind. Iâ€™m going insane Iâ€™m depressed I have intense anxiety suicidal thoughts. I canâ€™t go to therapy or any place to help. Iâ€™ve pointed a knife at myself but refused to end it. Iâ€™ve been seconds away from leaping from a table with a rope hanging from my neck. Iâ€™ve developed schizophrenia. Iâ€™ve been seeing physical embodiments of my emotions. Fear being a fleshy blob of everything Iâ€™m scared of. Sadness being a small blue person curled up crying. Anger being a red demon like figure. They donâ€™t appear often. Mostly when Iâ€™m trying to sleep. Please I need someone. Someone just to talk to.
