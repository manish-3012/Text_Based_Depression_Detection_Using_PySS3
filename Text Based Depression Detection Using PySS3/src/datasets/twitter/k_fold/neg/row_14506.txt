Tabula Rasa (Blank Slate)I wanted to keep this short - long posts are effort.

So I'm a 20 year old, living in London. Nothing terrible has happened in my life (sexual assualt/loss of a loved one etc), and people often perceive me as enthusiastic and fun. That's all the backstory there needs to be.

I think a lot. I always have. I've thought about a lot of things but mostly about life, its existence, its creation, its purpose. From all the thinking I've done, I gain nothing from living another day.

When you die, you cease to exist, you don't think, you don't feel, you're just gone.
So if I ended my life, I wouldn't feel regret, I wouldn't feel sad for my family, I wouldn't feel anything.
All the memories you've amassed, would all be gone. When we die, we are all reset to zero.

You spend a lifetime building memories, and it all equates to nothing.

So, I put it to you, what is a reason that anyone should want to live another day?
