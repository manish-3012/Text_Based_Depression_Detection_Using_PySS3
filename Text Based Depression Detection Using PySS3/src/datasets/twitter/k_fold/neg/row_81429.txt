I won't get betterI've been so selfish and causing so much pain to my partner. He's said it many times before - I've broken him. I've chipped away his love for me. The only reason to why he's still with me is that I might kill myself if he leaves.
I don't mean it as a threat, but I honestly don't know what I'll do if even the most kind and patient person I know gives up on me.
I've always said I'll change but I'm just always the same. I've started therapy but there's so much crap behind my bad habits and all. He says I don't care about him and I never listen. But in my head and heart I always have. I can't tell how I feel anymore. If I really do care about him why am I still like this? If I really love him enough surely I'll be better already.
The conclusion is that even if I'm not aware of it, I'm selfish and don't care about anyone else, my feelings matter more than theirs. I don't even realise what I'm doing, how am I going to fix it? I can't get better and I probably won't because I'm so selfish.
I don't even know if I care anymore, I don't know how I feel. I don't think I can do this I just want to give up
