I'm totally broken.I don't even know what to say anymore. I'm done. I'm broken and there's no hope for me to get fixed. I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember, since I was just a kid. I've been so depressed lately as I always forget my pills and I've been turning to self-harm methods quite frequently lately and I know it sounds silly because I'm so young and have so much good stuff going for me but I can take this anymore. Every single day is a living hell for me, getting out of bed and going to school and then work is torture. I was finally having a good day today, I got a new dog, I visited my mom, I was genuinely feeling happy and then I get onto reddit to a message telling my that I'm an attention whore and I'm fishing for compliments by posting in /r/selfharmpics and that I should kill myself. Hopefully I will. I don't want to be here.
