Itâ€™s my birthday, I expected nothing and Iâ€™m still disappointedPeople who said theyâ€™d call didnâ€™t or had reasons not to. 

My housemate didnâ€™t know and has had people over all day, maybe I shouldâ€™ve told him but I was hoping heâ€™d check Facebook and see at least, but I canâ€™t expect everyone to do that. My cats like him more than me, I feel ducking terrible. 

I try my best to be a good cat mum but maybe Iâ€™m not, maybe Iâ€™m to tired or maybe Iâ€™m letting work take over my life. But I love them and play and feed them and call them and pet them.

 Apart from family (3) I had two other messages. I donâ€™t know why I expected more. I donâ€™t know if I even thought if anyone else. I just wanted someone, even if we didnâ€™t talk. Just anyone else. Someone to say something. Someone to say they care. I 

have seroquil, naltrexone, valdoxan, Panadol, can I combine these and overdose? Or feel something else, anything.
