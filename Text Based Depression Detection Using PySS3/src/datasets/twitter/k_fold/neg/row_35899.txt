VanishHi there.

I'm not 100% sure why I'm here.  I'm 22 f.  I recently got off anti-anxiety medication, which I know can fuck with your moods but I didn't think it would be this bad.  For the past month, I've been depressed.  Mostly watching Netflix.  I cry a lot.  I didn't really have any work (I'm in school/my job is at a school), just sat around.  Started work/school again about two weeks ago, which has been okay while it's been happening.  Problem is, it can't distract me all the time.  My boyfriend is supportive, but recently, especially because of the depression, I've been feeling more and more pathetic.  He doesn't really want to sleep with me anymore.  Yesterday I asked him if he wanted to sleep with other people and he said he, fantasizes about it sometimes, but he never would because he loves me or some shit. So that hasn't been helping.  Besides my relationship possibly being on the decline, I feel so detached from my job and work unless I'm there.  I used to love my job.  Sometimes I'll have moments when I remember why.  Now I just want to vanish.  I'm seeing a counselor but I mostly just want to vanish.

Edit: Sorry I just thought of more stuff.  I don't think it's ever going to get better, you know?  I mean, sure I have moments where it's really fine and I feel good and I'm like, "wow it feels so nice to be happy," but most of the time, I'm not.  I can't handle this if this is what the rest of my life is going to look like...Why is it so difficult for some people?  What's wrong with me?  So many of my friends have such a good time, and I'm constantly facing changing emotions and desperation and detachedness and helplessness.
