My decision might be 95% nowWell...I am pretty sure that I have made the right decision.  I am around 95% sure that leaving this world is the best thing for me.  I am not able to deal with this mental anguish.  Maybe I am weak. Idk - but I don't know what to do.  I plan to use the Carbon Monoxide poisoning method.  I dont want to disfigure myself for my family's sake.  There is just nothing left for me.  I have nothing and no one.  I have no where to turn :(
