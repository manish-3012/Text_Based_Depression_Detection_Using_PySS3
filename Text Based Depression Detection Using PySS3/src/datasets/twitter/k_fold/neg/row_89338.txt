I've ruined my life, might lose my job and don't see a way back.My post history says a lot about the state of things for me at the moment, and it's since been compounded when I was arrested on Monday, without knowing if i'm charged with anything for 6 weeks. I thought the saga was over, but apparently not.

It's left me feeling hopeless. I might lost my job, and all my future plans could be ruined.

I don't think i'm a bad person, but bad luck is following me around to the point where I think i'm better of not existing.

I'm supposed to see a psychiatrist next week after I told my doctor how i'm feeling, and i've been signed off work all week but I can't carry on like this. I have totally ruined everything and I am ashamed.
