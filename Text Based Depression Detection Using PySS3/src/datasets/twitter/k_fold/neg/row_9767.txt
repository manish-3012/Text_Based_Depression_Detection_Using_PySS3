feeling closer and closer to ending itIâ€™ve tried to kill myself in the past. I felt better for a long time but recently Iâ€™ve felt itâ€™s inescapable. Iâ€™ve recently been to A&amp;E for suicidal thoughts and was told that the fact I think about how much it will hurt my family is a preventative sign. They sent me away with some advice about putting lavender under my pillow (as if 7 years of multiple therapies and medication can be topped by putting flowers under my pillow). 

Well now Iâ€™m starting to no longer worry about my family as much. It feels bad to say, but I canâ€™t live with the pain my anxiety is causing me every day any more. Iâ€™m tired of waking up and feeling my chest be crushed by the weight of it. Iâ€™m tired of being a burden to my family and my partner. I know it will hurt them, but I am hurting so much. I am in therapy again. I am medicated. And itâ€™s still not enough. I donâ€™t think I will ever escape this. 

I know Iâ€™m loved, but I canâ€™t escape this pain no matter how hard I try. Iâ€™m sorry this post is so messy. Iâ€™m just feeling closer and closer to actually going through with it. Iâ€™m sorry.
