I just want to end whatever this is.I've always thought I wanna die but I think it's more like I want to escape these thoughts and feelings. And even if I want to die so bad, I can't because of the burden I might cause. Therefore, the day I do try to committ suicide is probably the day I'm free from whatever this is or the burden I'll cause, and I probably wouldn't continue it. Or if I've gotten to that blank state of mind again, then that's another story.
