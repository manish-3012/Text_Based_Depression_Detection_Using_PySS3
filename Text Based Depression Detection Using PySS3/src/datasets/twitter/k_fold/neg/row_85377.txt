I'm really scared for my sister. We think she's psychotic. Can somebody give me advice? CRISISI'm 20, my little sister is 16. For the last few months my sister has been getting increasingly violent and acting strange. She had been saying everyone ELSE is acting weird, when in fact, it was her who was. She says that something strange is going on but she doesn't know what. 

Now for the last few days, she's been continuously having conversations with herself(Which we now know is her hearing voices), and pays no attention to what is going on in the real world. She is complaining of nausea(And has been for months) and says she feels like she is in a dream. She will space out anywhere from 1-2 minutes and not respond to anyone.

Earlier today me and my mom took her to the emergency room(She has a loooong history at the hospital, she is so obviously mentally ill. But unfortunately due to some events that took place, she was known as an attention seeker, but I can tell you she ISN'T. They just didn't know what else to call her behavior). But anyway, today the doctor spent less then 10 minutes talking to her and decided she was fine to leave. No medical tests, no mental stability test, nothing. All after she ADMITTED she was hearing voices, felt like she was an alien, and wanted to "get out of this hell" by killing herself. I'm not surprised because i've heard horror stories about Canadian mental health care.

My family feels so helpless right now. She's in her room crying and theres nothing we can do. I know that once we were at the hospital, she felt safer. We thought for sure she was going to be put in an adolescent facility. She currently doesn't have a diagnosis, but we think she may be depressed/psychotic. What can we do now?
