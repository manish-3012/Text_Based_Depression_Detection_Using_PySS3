Need help. Please.I'm tired of people telling me that there is hope or that things get better. For me, there's no hope. I've spent the last 10 years of my life, entirely dedicated to trying to find help, and it doesn't exist. Really, the only thing that I truly want, is to not exist anymore. It's the only way that I can not be trapped in this absolute hell.

I really, need help figuring out how I can achieve my goal. I have 400 dollars to my name right now. Anyone that is experienced or knows of the best possible way I can kill myself with this amount of money. I would be so appreciative. I can't keep living in this hell.
