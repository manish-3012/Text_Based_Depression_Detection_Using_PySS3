Canâ€™t take it anymore but Iâ€™m a freaking cowardHey everyone out there, excuse already if everything Iâ€™m gonna write now will be some pathetic shit. I guess Iâ€™m kinda drunk and Iâ€™m really sorry for being such a disappointment. I really hate my life and I want nothing more than ending it. But every time I start to seriously consider suicide Iâ€™m to much of a coward to push through this. My GP tried to admit me to a psych ward some weeks ago but even there they donâ€™t want me because I wonâ€˜t kill myself anyway. I donâ€™t know how many times I regretted not having killed myself anyway. So I donâ€™t even see a reason why I shouldnâ€™t do it. I hate my life, Iâ€™m a total embarrassment and disappoint every one. Obviously I m even disappointing at killing myself. I donâ€™t even feel alive anymore, more like caught somewhere between life and death. Looking back at the last years I really regret not having killed myself as long as I was young and dumb enough to not overthink it too much. Life is just so not worth it. Again, Iâ€™m really sorry for being drunk and posting this shit on here. And no need to worry about me, as I said, Iâ€™m even to useless to kill myself. So thanks for coming to my TED talk I guess.
