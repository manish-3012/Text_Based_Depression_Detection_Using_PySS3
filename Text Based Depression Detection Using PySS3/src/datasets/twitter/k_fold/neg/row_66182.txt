Gun or Train?I have two realistic options. I own a gun, and live relatively close to a train track. 

Loneliness, anxiety, depression, and loathing have driven me to hate my life. I feel like nobody loves, or even likes me. Those who "do" are forced to by societal things like being stuck with me in their family or school. 

Soon, I'll be out of high school and into college, and even more alone. I'm about to lose the people I've known for years in a couple of weeks. I'm really afraid that it'll throw me over the edge. 

Nobody would expect it. I'm a very happy, funny, but quiet person. Honor roll grades, strong opinions, and interests, plenty of hobbies too. I've tried so hard to improve. I just can't get people to like me how I want them to.

I've never had a boyfriend or girlfriend, and I'm already 18. This embarrasses me and is mostly why I hate myself and my existence. It's embarrassing. Shameful. Everyone hates me. 

A gun would be messy and ugly, and a train would be all that and the guilt of the conductor. 

I'm thinking of using a gun if I can ever get the guts to off myself. 

I don't have them right now. Maybe that's a blessing in disguise, but when I'm alone on nights like tonight, so fucking embarrassed by my pathetic existence - I really wish I could shoot my head off.

The sudden end of suffering. The permanent solution to the problem. 

I'm too patient to wait for "my college friends". I'm too patient to wait for "luck", or for "people to find me". Everyone else has someone at my age. I'm tired of being the odd person out. Maybe it's time that I leave the game once and for all.
