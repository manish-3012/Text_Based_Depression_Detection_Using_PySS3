I can't be any different than thisI don't know how to be any different than the way I feel. I almost killed myself on the 19th and felt I had reasons to stay. I've tried to do so much to just feel different as a person, but I can't. I'm so stupid. I don't know why I thought I could be any different from who I was in my past. Im just exhausted. I've made so many changes and this month has been nothing but a reminder that I can't make up for my past, that there is so much bad from my past that just hasn't caught up yet. I'm done tonight. I'm too tired.
