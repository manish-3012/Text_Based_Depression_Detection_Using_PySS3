Depressed, suicidal, pregnantI have always struggled w depression, self harm, I've tried attempting but it's been years. I got into a manipulative relationship and because of my own stupidity I stayed for 3 years. I always thought he would eventually change but isn't. He screams at me and then apologizes and says it won't happen again, he recently started having sex w me while I'm asleep and I told him to stop and he said he would and then did it again. Now I'm pregnant and I want this baby more than anything but I can't help but feel like I want to kill myself. I don't want to harm the baby and I don't plan on attempting but I started to cut again after a couple of years. I feel hopeless and I want help but I'm not sure what to do...I want to go to the mental hospital but then I wouldnt be able to work or pay for bills.
