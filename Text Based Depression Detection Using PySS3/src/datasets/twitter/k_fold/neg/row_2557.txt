I think I might hang myself later.My dad and I got in a fight over a candle...he didn't like the smell of it (it's just cinnamon) and told me not to light it anymore, because I would fall asleep and burn the house down. ðŸ¤·â€â™‚ï¸ despite me never laying in bed when I light it. I watch tv or browse the internet,  so the candle is always in site. I light it because it makes my room smell better. It smells humid or musty,  since it's all hardwood floors. I told him I wouldn't fall asleep, while it was lite and we got to arguing.  He said I was useless and that I just mooch off of him. He called me lazy because I sleep in. I told him that I haven't been the same after I lost my job. He just blamed me anyways for sleeping in. He complained about how i haven't found a job yet and that i suck all his money away. He also told me to get over feeling sad.

So i guess I'll get over being sad by hanging myself.  I am planning to hang myself in my closet with a belt. I may leave a note to him saying I'm not going to be wasting his money anymore. I'll do it later in the night, so if he comes in later (until he goes to bed) he won't find me in the process of it. Hopefully,  I'll be dead soon, that way I'm not wasting his money.
