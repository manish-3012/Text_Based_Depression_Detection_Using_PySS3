Suicide is the answer.I'm tired of life. Some people are given decent ones, or at least opportunities to have a decent one; I however am not one of those people. I never had a family or friends. One person has said they loved me, they eventually took it back; that was 10 years ago. 
I'm attractive enough to have been with women, but none of them wanted to stay for more than a night.  I'm losing that attractiveness with age. If women don't want you when you're somewhat attractive they're not going to want you when you're unattractive.

I'm balding, extremely short, and stupid.  These are things you can't improve, things you can't work on, you're just given them. My prime has passed and it was uneventful. Life somehow gets steadily getting worse no matter what I do. I'm not going to settle on anything this shit life has to offer me.
