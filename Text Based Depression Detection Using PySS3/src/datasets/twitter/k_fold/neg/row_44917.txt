Have I no worthI am a woman in my 50s. I have raised 5 kids. I find myself with no job and no home. I have been looking for work for over a year and have nothing. I lost my home. My kids won't help me. Well one has let me stay with her a month and wants me out.  I can't even stay at my father's because if his partner. I am wondering if I hÃ ve any worth? Should I just end it all? I've tried finding homeless shelters I've asked for help.  Am I that useless? Is there any place left for me on this planet? I must have been a horrible mother if my own kids don't want me.
