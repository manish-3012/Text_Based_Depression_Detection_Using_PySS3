Iâ€™m angry I donâ€™t understand what life isI donâ€™t know what life is. I donâ€™t understand what consciousness is. I feel like that either makes me stupid or smart enough to end it. Before this I was able to understand what nothing was. But right now nothing makes sense. I live in a world as a woman but I donâ€™t know what being a woman means. I know what it means for me personally I guess, but everyone else seems to have an idea of what itâ€™s supposed to mean. I donâ€™t agree with it. I donâ€™t feel comfortable or happy. I hate the way life looks- the prognosis for me. My friends arenâ€™t friends and call me dramatic for having attempted to take my own life twice. First time was 5 years ago but the mental torment hasnâ€™t ended. Iâ€™m just so done with fighting and then being punished for fighting because Iâ€™m a woman. Iâ€™m done fighting because Iâ€™m gay. You act like everyone is all liberal but theyâ€™re not, even in california. Iâ€™m just ready to die before I fail. Iâ€™d rather not watch myself fail any more. I donâ€™t understand what any of this is. I donâ€™t understand the world
