I just wish asking for help in the real world was easyI wish that getting help in the real world was easier. I'm constantly told to just go see a doctor and ask for pills that will ease my anxiety, but the one time I did? They told me to see a psychiatrist. Something I can't afford. Now, I can't even get the words out when I see a doctor to ask for help. I can't afford therapy. 

What little family I have it rarely speak to, and I don't really have any friends. You would expect a 22 year old girl who works in marketing to have plenty, but I've been alone my entire life. A few acquaintances here and there, but that's it. 

I really do want to get better but I'm destroying my life myself. I eat badly, my drinking is getting worse and I'm suffering at work. I try to set aside my loneliness by going on tinder dates and sleeping with guys I don't like, then by getting drunk and practically begging someone to be with me. Every time I think something is going to work with a guy it just doesn't and I go back to square one. 

I just sat in my bathtub for hours crying and drinking holding a knife in my hand and I couldn't even kill myself. It feels like I'm so bad at everything I can't even kill myself. I've survived so much and I'm tired of just surviving. I really hate my life and just need someone to talk to


I'm sorry you had to real all of that. I just don't know what to do right now
