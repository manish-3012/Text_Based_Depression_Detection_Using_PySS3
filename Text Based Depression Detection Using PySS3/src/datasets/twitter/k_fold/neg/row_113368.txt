Difficult day.I understand that experience is neither good or bad. I understand that I need to go through hard times for growth. If I am honest, i dont feel like I am growing or becoming a better person, it just feels like the universe is telling me that I don't belong here.

I keep picturing all the different ways I could commit my suicide. I hate it but I can't stop. I feel like a stranger in my own body, nothing feels real anymore. All I know is time is passing and each day I am closer to the end. I find this comforting.
