Doing decent but there's still an undercurrentSo I made a post recently about basically being forced to be around my abusive ex that stalked me for a while and be subjected to his continuing harassing behaviors. 
I was struggling quite a bit then and had a plan I kept putting off and finally reached a point where I forgot about all of that and my mental state was doing better. 
I went to church Sunday and did not encounter the dude but I think the anxiety of possibly seeing him made my mental state take a little dive. It's hard to explain but it's not like I'm actively suicidal but theres an undercurrent of desiring death [presumably because I feel so trapped in the situation I feel theres no other way out...I know there is but it seems like that's the quickest way tbh]. I saw some people had described it as "casually suicidal." I'm still doing reckless things, for example I had the worst migraine a few days ago (so bad I was repeatedly blacking out) and took 8 painkiller pills. Granted, they weren't strong and it was two different types, four of each pill, one was a regular dose (an herb, feverfew, so less potent than a mainstream painkiller) and the other maybe just over a regular dose but nothing dangerous. 
Little things like that, being reckless and the undercurrent since Sunday. My mother pointed out that I've been majorly distancing from my therapist (didnt tell her what she said to me recently) and it seems like people are still tired of my drawn out waves of suicidal tendencies.
