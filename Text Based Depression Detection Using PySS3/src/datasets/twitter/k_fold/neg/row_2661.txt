"Tell Someone About Your Fellings"That's the thing... 

If you tell others how you feel, they think you want to draw attention and they are like "Eww".

Excuse me? Who needs your attention? And does it matter? Oh, you care about me? Thank you but it doesn't change anything. What will you say? "Don't worry, bro." or "Everything will be ok." or "Grow up, man" or "Everybody has thier own problems." FUCK OFF PLEASE

Being alive is already painful. I have to eat, sleep... FFF... I'm just exhausted. Is it okay? I have no energy to do something. Just leave people like me alone.

I JUST HATE TELLING SOMEONE HOW I FEEL. 

Nonsense!
