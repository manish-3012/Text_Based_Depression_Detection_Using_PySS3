People that say suicide isn't the only option don't know what it's like to feel dead inside.I am numb. My only sibling died in January the day before my birthday, I'm not even hurting I just feel completely numb and completely filled with rage. Going through the motions as everyone is supposed to when someone dies. The only reason I am still here is for my mum but I am starting to feel as though that isn't enough anymore. I tried to reach out to people and tell them how I feel so I can get help but I'm always dismissed and end up telling them to not worry. I get pushed around at work and at home and can't do anything without anyone telling me how i should be feeling and I was even told I would be a monster if I didn't feel anything. But I feel nothing and I am done. I am so close to just going away forever. Not that anyone would care anyway
