just want this to endiâ€™m so so so so so tired of feeling this way. i want to stop having these suicidal thoughts so badly but i canâ€™t. part of me wants to just fucking end it all right now, part of me wants to get better. but how am i supposed to get better when life keeps shitting on me? if there was a god they wouldnâ€™t let me suffer like this. this is all bullshit
