iâ€™ve settled on a date.iâ€™ve been considering this for a few weeks, and iâ€™ve decided. i hope iâ€™ll grow a pair and do it beforehand, but the latest iâ€™ll be alive is my nineteenth birthday. 8/22. im choosing not to give the year. iâ€™ve read enough peopleâ€™s stories to know that things most likely wonâ€™t improve for people like me. i mean fuck, itâ€™s already been two years of constantly feeling like shit. before itâ€™d go up and down, not anymore.  itâ€™s been one misfortune after another. iâ€™ve made a promise to myself, if i donâ€™t have the strength to do it before, i will do it that day. and then iâ€™ll finally be free.
