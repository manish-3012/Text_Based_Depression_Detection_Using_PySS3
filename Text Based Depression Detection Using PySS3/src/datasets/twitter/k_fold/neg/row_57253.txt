why don't suicidal people join the police/swat?i don't mean any offense whatsoever but im wondering if someone is thinking their life is meaningless, why not join the force? this way they are putting their life on the line to help others, if they die, so be it, if they live, they helped people?

Rather than people who are too scared to join the force as they care about their own lives?

im just wondering about this. if you have any thoughts of your own please do let me know
