I'm about to be expelled from school for not going againThey expelled me in 8th grade cause I was fuckin miserable and I just hated it. I was then expelled in 9th grade for the same reasons, and it didn't help that my brother started calling me "drop out". I have skipped a total of 22 days of school and I know I'm about to be expelled. it is 4:13 as I'm writing this and my brother will wake up soon. I feel like there is nothing for me anymore, I've made my mom cry multiple times, my brother hates me, my grandma hates me I just don't see a point anymore. Maybe when I'm dead i'll stop being a burden, but thing is I'm too much of a pussy to do it. Which is fucking hilarious because I could never do anything right, now I can't even kill myself
