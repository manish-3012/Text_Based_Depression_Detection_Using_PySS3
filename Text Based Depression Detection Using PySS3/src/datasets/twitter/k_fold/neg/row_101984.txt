Approaching 22 years since my uncle diedAs I was growing up all my relatives told me I looked like him. My mother was never the same when he died. Part of her shrunk. My sisters told me she wasnâ€™t fully sane for a year or two. As I got older I got more curious. Looking for photos and asking about him even watching old videos of him. I felt something. I could relate to him so much. I felt like he was me. Corner of the room. Cracking the sly joke. Then when I got to 18 my mother finally told me more. Showed me his note he left to my grand parents. His writing totally connected with him. Everything he said. I could feel on a different level. 

I never met him but I canâ€™t help but think weâ€™d be very close. I wish I could of met him. Iâ€™ve been in dark places and thought about suicide. Thinking about him and looking at photos and stories of him makes me feel better. I feel like I need to live for him. He looked like the nicest person ever. Deep blue eyes and gentle. Iâ€™m finding it tough because I just miss the guy even though Iâ€™ve never met him. Not sure how itâ€™s possible.

You help me through the day. 



No tears, no fears
Remember there's always tomorrow
So what if we have to part
We'll be together again
