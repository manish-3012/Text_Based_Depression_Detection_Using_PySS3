where is the line?i (19f) have been struggling a lot lately. im in therapy and whatnot but lately i feel like ive been feeling a lot more suicidal than usual. i was wondering- what exactly is considered a â€œplan?â€ and how do you go about that with a therapist? what would make her have me involuntarily committed?? im trying to avoid these things if possible but i also want to be prepared if thats where this is going. i feel like i have a plan but it isnt really a plan its â€œat some point im going to impulsively kill myself.â€ if that makes any sense (probably not). also, if i were to call a suicide prevention hotline (not likely but just wondering) what should i avoid saying to skip the blue light special? id like to avoid cops all together if possible, but thats another topic. 

TLDR; where is the line in the sand when it comes to having a suicide plan?
