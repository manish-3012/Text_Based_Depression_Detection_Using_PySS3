i fucked up. i want it to stopoh my fucking god, every fucking night, i swear to fuck. i cheated on my girlfriend. she took me back - should be happy, right? yeah. no. lost one of my best friends over something stupid. i have no one to talk to about this because the word 'cheat' makes you a scumbag automatically. and you know what? it does! i kissed another girl because i spent 2 fucking hours away from my girlfriend. and now i have to talk to my family and her family like everythings all peachy while i know she questions every single day why i wasn't strong enough to just say no. 

i don't want to be here anymore. i keep having dreams where i do it again. my head is so fucked up. i love her so much but i know her self esteem is destroyed now and by staying with me she's just playing her. but if she leaves i genuinely think i'll have to kill myself right away. fuck this. every outcome is the same. its just a matter of when i should do it

im going on holiday with her in a week. its supposed to be the best experience of my life but i can't even sleep anymore because of what i've done. i can't tell anyone she hasn't already told out of fear of losing friends. fuck. why am i such a pathetic loser? shes everything i've ever wanted and shes been nothing but lovely. fuck me. shes the reason why i stopped wanting to kill myself and now i'm back to ruining everything good in my life. i self harmed for the first time in 6 years because of this. 

i know there's no sympathy for me but i could really use some support. anything. just tell me i deserve to live for just until i come back from holiday. sorry for the profanity i just want it to end and i dont know who else to yell at
