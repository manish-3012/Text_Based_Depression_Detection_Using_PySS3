Tempting as the days passIâ€™ve given up. I just canâ€™t keep going, medically my body is destroyed and getting worse I feel like each day I get closer to death my stomach issues are getting worse. The pain isnâ€™t even the worst, itâ€™s that other have to sacrifice so much just to help me weather itâ€™s time or helping with medical bills. Iâ€™m going back to school and all I feel is pressure. My sperm donor is having his 4th custody battle for his 5th and 6th children my youngest siblings. I have a shitty car that barely runs I have no hope for the future of my life. This political climate is hurting as people profile me for my skin even though I am not a POC (Iâ€™ve always had people assume my race) and itâ€™s getting worse I feel disconnection between my fiancÃ©e and I. Iâ€™ve been slowly starving myself eating less each week. I feel so weak I feel as if no one around me wants to listen or help improve how I feel they all just let it go in one ear out the other or make me feel like a burden. I just really need a friend right now
