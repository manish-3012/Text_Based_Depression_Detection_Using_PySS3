Idk a rantSorry for the way itâ€™s written I dropped out in 9th grade but thanks if you can get past it. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m 18 I donâ€™t leave the house. I think I have ocd and Iâ€™m depressed,everyday since I can remember committing suicide or dying has always been on my mind. I donâ€™t know what I can and canâ€™t say. I just feel like I need someone to talk to. Everyone in my house has their own life to worry about. I just feel like leaving with a gun and finding a nice spot alone.
