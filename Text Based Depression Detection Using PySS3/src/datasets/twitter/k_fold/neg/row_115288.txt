Gov just suspended my welfare because I've been depressed too long.Just got a letter from the gov regarding my welfare payments that they are suspended. After 6 months, being depressed and suicidal apparently isn't a valid reason for not looking for work.
I've applied for 100 jobs over the past few months and didn't get 1 interview at all.
No money for me.

Does society actually want me to die? Because this is how you make people want to kill themselves. I've no hope left.
