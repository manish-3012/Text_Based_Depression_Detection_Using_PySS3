Hi, i just want some thoughtsI'm 19 and receive both talk therapy and medication, I consider myself very smart and kind perhaps too smart and kind. Sometimes when I start to get suicidal I'll write what's going on in my life. I hope no one minds but I would like to post bits of what I write today and get advice. I would prefer not to die, but I'm not motivated much as you may see below 

    "So right now 11/21/17 11:13pm I've decided to write my thoughts and daily life. My week is somewhat simple, from Monday to Thursday I have class currently switching between 2 on one day and one on the next. From Friday to Sunday I work at Genesis. When it comes to school I'm very board and unmotivated and with work I have fun and the work isn't hard but ik I would enjoy the store more if I was a customer. My life could be plenty worse off, I could be poor, homeless, etc. This doesn't stop how I feel though. A Lot of the time I feel like crying or am sad but I can't cry, instead I end up acting strange. I'm not hating life nor am I enjoying it, I'm simply content. I don't currently have a goal in life which makes it hard to focus on college. There's no job in life that I want nor a future I dream of. I have no aspirations, how is someone like that supposed to be motivated. Let me analyse some common goals people have. Having there dream career; I don't have one at the top of my head, if I look at my hobbies which are mtg and reading/watching fantasy I come up with being a game designer or writer. Im sure I have most of the knowledge needed for both of these things but would I want to. I've designed one game before and it was some fun but I never felt like persueing it that far. When it comes to writing, I'm just ok and I hate dealing with many of englishes rules. Its free by nature so why give it chains. So everyday I meet the expectations of those around me simply to live because I don't want to hurt those around me. I mean logically I would rather come to be motivated strongly to something, for it to drive me to wake up. For something so great I wanted to dedicate myself to it. I find the idea of simply staying alive to just live rediculous. My current choices are to continue living and do nothing. Continue living and try to help myself which I've been trying, or to hate living enough to die. I wish to avoid the last. My death would ruin people. I'm not selfish enough to escape at others expenses."

TLDR I don't have a bad situation in life but I have no reason for living besides not wanting to make others sad.
