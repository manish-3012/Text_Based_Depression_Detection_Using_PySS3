help is expensiveI dont really wanna give up but the lack of response is disappointing to say in the least. I couldnt afford to get help or to go for counselling and today seems like a good day to die. I dont understand why should i fight and live on when being dead is free. For one, nobody have to support my living anymore. In the grave I don't have to feel or care about anything that matters. 

People trying to be nice by saying I should gather my resources and help, form allies and all that. ..I don't want to care in this moment. Why can't I just shut down, die, and no longer feel. Why not? What's so good about being alive and watching yourself gets burnt and torn by strangers. What's so good about fighting and going on? I'm tired. I'm tired of feeling jittery and anxious. 

I'm tired of trying to seek help and receiving nothing. I wish I could just not exist anymore.
