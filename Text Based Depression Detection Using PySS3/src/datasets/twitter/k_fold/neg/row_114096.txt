I'm done.I hate existence. There's a constant scenario playing in my head where I put a bullet through my head. Another is of myself getting in a ghastly accident, like final destination or something. I get "fits". I can't actually yell, because other people might find it odd. So, at least 10 times every day I have to rush about to find a solitary place, usually a bathroom, and do a silent scream. There's an almost contant yelling inside my head. It's mostly profanity. Directed against myself and my mother. 

I've dissociated from reality and society to such a point that I can't enjoy *anything* anymore. I'm constantly looking for an audience at this point. I feel like something went wrong in my brain due to prolonged isolation durig my formative years. People commented when I was 15, that I don't spend much time socializing. Now, I'm almost 22 with no change in my situation. At college, I am somewhat famous for being 'the quiet dude'. In my family, it's canon that to meet me you'll have to call me or barge into my room. I phase-out a lot. 

I don't feel like a person. I feel like the rest of humanity is something different from me. I can't talk to anyone about anything. I feel hatred towards other people just because they can be something that I'm not. I'm a 22 years old dude with the angst of a teenager. 

I used to be an avid reader, now I forget everything about a book as soon as I finish it. I can't finish watching movies because I get really bored and feel like I'm being suffocated by myself. Music is just noise, unles someone is screaming about murdering people, which I think is a proxy way for my brain to calm down. I wasn't allowed to have a life. I can't remember anyhthing anymore. I feel like there's someone else making my body do stuff, while by brain, or "I", is bouncing around thoughts in a closed container. And it's been getting more and more violent and apathetic. Like Sandy Hook violent. When I see other people, I don't want them to exist anymore. At first I grew indifferent to their existence. Then I got annoyed by it. Then I got angry. I see people, and all I want is for them to die along with their loved ones. I keep browsing /r/watchpeopledie, because it still makes me somewhat.....shocked, numbed or such. Maybe afraid or something. I can't really tell. I guess this quote from a book I read might have some insight. Because I'm not introspective enough to figure it. 

"â€˜The men would all say that they had died,â€™ Gilligan said. â€˜These were the most incorrigibly violent characters. They would all say that they themselves had died before they started killing other people. What they meant was that their personalities had died. They felt dead inside. They had no capacity for feelings. No emotional feelings. Or even physical feelings. So some would cut themselves. Or they would mutilate themselves in the most horrible ways. Not because they felt guilty - this wasnâ€™t a penance for their sins - but because they wanted to see if they had feelings. They found their inner numbness more tormenting than even the physical pain would be.â€™"


The best part is, I used to be somewaht normal. If you want a case against love, my situation is it. My mother's love and protection literally killed me. 


And to be honest, do whatever you may I won't be helped anymore. I've already tried suicide twice. One time I was so drunk, I passed out before I went through. And this time I won't be convinced. I've written a note. Once I send it to my brother and father, I'm gonna get drunk and cut my wrists.

And let's be honest. No one wants to help anyone like me. I can successfully predict everything people will say if they know what I'm *really* thinking. 

"This is depression. You must seek help". 

I would have if I could. 

"I'm here if you need to talk."

You'll fuck off after two mesages and all you will ever repeat is same old shit that's in the auto-biographies of the terminally ill.

What's the point of going on, if I've got nothing to look forward to? I'm not interested in anything anymore. There's no meaning to my life. I'm not a part of society.  I can't stand existence, if all it has in store for me is anger and pain.
