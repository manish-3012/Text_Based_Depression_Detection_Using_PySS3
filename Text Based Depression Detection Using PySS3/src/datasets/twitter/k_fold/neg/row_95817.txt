I think I'll die alone and that makes me want to die.I don't think I'll ever be able to date a girl without her taking an inniciative. I can't stop cringing all day over all my past failures when talking with girls, all the idiotic things that I said because of my anxiety. I destroy any chance I would have had with any girl with my terrible personality. I just embarass myself at any opportunity and am a fucking joke to everyone. I want to stop existing, it's getting worse and worse everyday, even with my depression meds. I am a fucking failure and doesn't deserve to live.
