Not sure what to doFor the past year I've been having overly negative thoughts of failure, disappointment and just a plain sense of self-pity.

They aren't consistent it's more like they come and go. Some times I'll go ages without anything then I can start feeling like killing myself is the only way out. I couldn't go through with it though it feels like I'm being cowardly by thinking its a good idea. 

It's just really confusing because I feel like I have to live with some kind of mask because I don't want to burden my friends and family with something that might not even be an issue.

I feel like I've let people down by not doing well in school whilst also feeling like no one actually gives a fuck about my pointless life and rather, they tolerate me being around out of a morbid sense of duty or something. 

Recently I've started to cry at night because I start thinking about what a silver spoon I have complaining that my life isn't worth living when I've never really had any actual problems. 

Describing it makes me feel like a drama queen because I can't deal with feeling sad so I have to go to the Internet to complain like the parasite I am. 

I never got the whole forum thing but I found this subreddit and wanted to see what other people thought.
