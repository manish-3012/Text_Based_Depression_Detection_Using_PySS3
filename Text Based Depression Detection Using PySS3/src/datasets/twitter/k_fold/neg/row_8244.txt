Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more than I do right nowIt all started last March when I bought the new MLB game (terrible purchase, the popular game mode is very micro transaction marketed). 

Over the year I spent $7200 of the 16k I made in the summer on video games

Come September I knew I would need to pick up shifts at my dads place in order to pay for expenses (DR Trip, school expenses, etc). I neglected working last semester than during Christmas break I relapsed my gambling addiction and spent 1300 (on my credit card bill for feb). 

Now I am forced to work 3 days a week in Jan at my dads place (7:30am:4:30pm) while doing my unpaid internship for school Tuesday-Friday (6pm-10pm) Saturday 10am-4pm). The only bright side is after January I only work 2 days a week at my dads place. I am there until the end of March. 

I should add I am someone who values there time. I would much rather do what I would like than spend my time in the office of a factory. 

But yes welcome to my hell. Sadly killing myself itâ€™s not the solution as it only transfers the problems I created onto those around me while creating new ones for them
