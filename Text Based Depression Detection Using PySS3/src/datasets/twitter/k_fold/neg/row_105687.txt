It's timeI have attempted suicide more times than I can count. I've woken up in ICU so many times.

I feel like this is really it right now though. I know how to do it now I think.

Even when there are people around me, I am so lonely. The pain is just too much.

I'm going to do it on Friday. I am not worth saving and I would rather donate my organs to those who are.

I did try. I really did. The first time I attempted suicide I was 15. I'm now 29. It's time to say goodbye.

I asked my mom not so long ago about how she would feel if I passed away (I didn't hint at suicide). Her main concern was that she wouldn't want to pay for a funeral. They can chuck me in a random hole for all I care. 

Nobody will speak to me and nobody cares. It's OK because maybe I can make a lot of other people's lives better?
