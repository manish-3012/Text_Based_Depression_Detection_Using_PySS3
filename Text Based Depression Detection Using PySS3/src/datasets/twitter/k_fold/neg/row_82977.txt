I would skip many problems if I did it nowIt would be very easy and I just would not have to do all that shit that I don't want to do. I hate having to function as a human.  I wish I could live at a void, just invisible to everyone else and not have any obligations. I cannot do it now but I wish I had a gun, I would like to see my head explode into pieces of skull and brain. I had almost two good days. Seems like the breaks my head takes last less and less everytime. I hate the obligations we have as humans.
