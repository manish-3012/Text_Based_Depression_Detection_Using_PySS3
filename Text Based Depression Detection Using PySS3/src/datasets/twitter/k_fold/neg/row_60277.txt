The thought of suicide is creeping up on meFirst, of all, I'm not suicidal. I've had my ups and downs, and always had the thoughts of wishing I just didn't exist. 

Now I've found myself at almost 30, lost a great job during COVID. Somehow managed to get a shitty job and tomorrow I have a meeting with my manager and scared shitless I'm going to be fired. In this current climate, I'm well and truly fucked. Now the ideas of not wanting to exist have progressed to thoughts of suicide (not planning or wishing it)

I'm in a dead-end job, no prospects, few friends, never had a relationship. Struggling with a minor drug addiction as a way to self-medicate; a way to feel numb or happy for even a brief period. Living in a house my Dad pays for because I can barely support myself, in massive amounts of debt. I can't see my life getting any better and I feel like a failure.

I'm just not enjoying my life anymore and this has been going on for a while. I don't see the point of living out the rest of my life if I'm going to be miserable. 

Today I joked to a friend that if I get fired tomorrow I'm running a hose from my car's exhaust. My usual dark humour, but this time there was a small part of me that wasn't joking. 

I'm not going to do it. I once heard a quote that said suicide doesn't take the pain away, it moves it to other people. My friends and family. I couldn't do that to them. I love them more than anything. I'd walk into hell to make them happy. 

So I guess I'm not really suicidal, but I wish I just never existed. I want to be a normal, happy person but I can't see that happening. 

And now I ask myself if I didn't have friends or family in my life, would I do it? I'm afraid to go down that rabbit hole. 

Not looking for answers, just needed to vent. Thank you.
