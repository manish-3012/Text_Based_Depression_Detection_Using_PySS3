My parents donâ€™t love me anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of trying.Iâ€™m a terrible person. Iâ€™m a spoiled, manipulative piece of human trash and I donâ€™t deserve to burden my family anymore. I wish I was good enough to be loved. I wish I knew how to be decent. Why did I have to be born, when all I bring is misery to myself and others? I donâ€™t even deserve a peaceful death, they shouldâ€™ve just taken me out themselves. The only reason Iâ€™m not dead yet is because Iâ€™m a massive pussy. I managed to tie a decent noose, Iâ€™m going to try and rid myself once and for all. I tried my hardest to love you my family and friends, even though I know that means nothing after all Iâ€™ve done.
