I feel guiltyI really want to go back into inpatient for a short while. But my boyfriend just recently got fired. I don't want him to think it's his fault but I know he will. But also I don't want to leave him depressed missing me while he has to watch our kid. I also feel guilty like I shouldn't be depressed and having eating issues because I have a kid and a boyfriend that cares. But I've had a rough life and financially, I only have a dollar to my name. I don't know what to do. I just want to cry but I feel I don't have any right.
