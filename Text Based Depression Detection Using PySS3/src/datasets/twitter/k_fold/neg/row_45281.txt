i'm tired of being a cowardSometimes I like to fool myself in thinking that I want to survive... but at times I'm not sure. For the longest time, I have wanted to end my suffering. I just can't do it, I have searched and I just can't, the methods seem all painful and the ones who can work can also leave you paralyzed or with horrible consequences and the last thing I want is to try and end it just to survive and live miserably.

It hurts that I will have to live for the rest of my life. It hurts that I will never have the courage to end my suffering. Maybe one day I will have some glimpses of bliss but what if it gets worse and I end up torturing my soul even more?
