Finally tomorrow is the last day for me...I have made up my mind once and for all.Still no girlfriend, have a criminal record, no job, no saving and $180 to my name. I have saved up 7 bars of xanax and tomorrow I am gonna get couple bundle of Heroins, then I am gonna find somewhere to off myself for good. I can't stand my parent at all, they always said that they would have been better off if I was dead or never been born, so even if I don't overdose again. I am gonna purposely get myself in a high speed chase then get the police to shoot me one way or the others. I have no purpose in life and nothing to look forward to in life anymore. I will finally be free tomorrow.
