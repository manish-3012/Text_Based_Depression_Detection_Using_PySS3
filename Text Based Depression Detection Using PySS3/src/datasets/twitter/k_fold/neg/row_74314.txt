I want to die but don't want to hurt my loved onesSo I don't really know what I hope to accomplish by this, but I kind of just need someone to listen who won't judge me. 

I hate myself. Like I really, really hate myself. I don't like talking to people about it because they all just say it's going to get better. It's been 15 years and it has only gotten worse so I'm just tired of hearing that. For what it's worth, I would never kill myself just because I had a friend who killed himself when we were 16 and I saw the damage it caused and I don't want to hurt my family. There is not one ounce of love for myself that's preventing it though. 

I have anger issues and don't know how to control them. It has often cause issues with my wife and father. I am extremely intelligent, but a huge underachiever and hate myself for it. I secretly drink/smoke/pop pills just to get through my day because it's the only way I can function. And I know that's fucked so I hate myself even more for it. I have lost literally all my friends because I just don't care to go out and do anything so they've all just stopped calling to even ask. I can't talk to a therapist because I don't feel comfortable talking to strangers about my issues in person. I hate my job and drive 2 hours to and from that job I hate. Basically there is not one single thing about me that I actually like. 

I want so badly to be dead so all the pain would go away. I don't even enjoy music anymore. My wife and parents know I'm depressed, but I play it off like it's not a big deal because I see how it upsets them when I do talk about it and quite frankly they are the only things in my life worth living for. 

There's probably nothing that anyone can say to help and maybe I'll finally reach a breaking point, but thanks for at least giving me a place to write some stuff down.
