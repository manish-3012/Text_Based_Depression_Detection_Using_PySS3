I cried for the first time in a while todayI had been having suicidal thoughts for a while, but I realized how easily I could do it and how I could make it easier for my mom (like calling the cops and doing it before she gets off work so she doesnâ€™t see me like that). Once I realized how quickly I could go through with it I broke down in front of my mirror. It wasnâ€™t so much sadness as it was realization that overwhelmed me, and now I even have notes ready to send to all my loved ones. The barriers I put in place to stop me from thinking these thoughts are disappearing quickly
I donâ€™t even feel much pain anymore, just empty
