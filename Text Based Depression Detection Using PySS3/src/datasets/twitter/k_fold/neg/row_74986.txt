cv fjgvhI don't even know what I'm doing here tbh. Every day is the same shit, with more and more shit added each one. Spent years building up my favorite hobby to help get out of depression? Everybody involved hates me. Got a nice job involving that hobby, can't bring myself to do it. Every day is new wave of somebody mocking me or outright harassing and bringing me down. Been back in school for a year, have a 3.0 GPA and show lots of promise in my career, shit doesn't matter. Being a queer freak won't fly, and everybody keeps telling me this without even realizing what they're doing. Therapist helps me make progress, I have friends and love interests, but I still just sit in bed every day I can and hack away at myself.

I looked for a weapon in my house to make it easy, couldn't find it. Hang around spots at night where it'd be easy, can't do it. I just fantasize about it 24/7 and have to distract myself to not be in complete despair for a minute.

I'm not really going to find help here, I'm just saying shit to be saying it, I'm more or less already dead and it's just me waiting out the time.
