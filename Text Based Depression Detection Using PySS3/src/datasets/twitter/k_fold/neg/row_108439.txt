I canâ€™t take the pain anymore.Iâ€™m sick of this. Life is a joke. Iâ€™m planning on killing myself soon. Donâ€™t know when because I am afraid to die But I canâ€™t take all of the stress and pain anymore. I always dreamed of myself dying in my sleep and flying into outer space exploring other planets and all of my pain that Iâ€™m going through will be lifted of my head. And if I do die Hopefully that will happen. I just want to be happy. And if I already killed myself and you are seeing this these are my last words. Goodbye. Hopefully I will be happy. Hopefully I will get my dream that I always wanted. Hopefully I can create my own world and have people love me. And the person that I have been known on the internet for (Power_Wind17) will be the end. This will most likely be my last post then I will disappear. Like no one ever cared about me. Sucks that this had to happen so soon. 


Goodbye. ðŸ‘‹
