This is my drunk diary entry tonight. I changed the names so this post canâ€™t be traced back to me. The current time is 2:447/15/19


1:07 am: STRONG SUICIDAL URGES. Sought walking directions to the Golden Gate Bridge in preparation for a suicide attempt, to jump off. 12+ hour walking, 3 hour transit. Feelings stemming from not being enough for Abigail, losing her. Jealousy to her Israeli friend. Feeling like a boy rather than a man, feeling like Abigail would rather be with someone who is more mature than me, and can support her (financially and emotionally). Self deprecating feelings. Donâ€™t know why she wants to be with me. Feeling like my death would be better for her, because she would be better off with someone else rather than me in the long run. Want whatâ€™s best for her. It would be selfless and altruistic for me to die because of these reasons. 

This sucks to think about, so I am going to grab my Nintendo switch and play on that for a while to see if it distracts me.




IF IT DOESNâ€™T WORK, I WILL SELF HARM. I WILL USE ABIGAILâ€™S RAZOR TO CUT MYSELF WITH.
FUCK ME, I AM THE WORST. I DESERVE ALL THE WORST FEELINGS IN THE UNIVERSE. I AM TERRIBLE. I AM A CANCER TO THE WORLD. I MUST BE EXTERMINATED FOR THE BEST OF EVERYONE AND EVERYTHING. 


FUCK ME.



1:54: Accidentally woke her up. She moved further away from me. This relationship is doomed. 


2:00: I hit myself in the bathroom. Hard. Several times. 

2:02: Going to bed...I guess? Sleeping way over on the other side of the bed from Abigail. If she cared about me, she would move closer to me. 


Itâ€™s over. I need to let go. She deserves someone more mentally stable than me. As much as I love her,  her life will be better without me. My suicide will ruin her life. I wish I could disappear from her life and have her wake up and forget I ever existed. Thatâ€™s what would be best for her. I love her. It hurts to think about, but logically, I am nothing but a liability in her life. I have made up my mind. I will tell her we are better off friends, then silently disappear from her life, and kill myself. I love her and want whatâ€™s best for her, and this is whatâ€™s best for her, so it is what I must do. This is my last entry of tonight, or maybe ever. I might post this on reddit or some bullshit (3 times to 3 different subreddits lol Iâ€™m a fucktard). Idk.  Goodbye.
