Just A Question.I'm going through a tough time in my life, I'll spare you the details. I was just thinking if there's no god, or allah, or yahweh, or whatever what the fuck is the point of living through shit? I understand if a person is outgoing, positive, sociable, hardworking, driven, then they might be able to stay happy and positive for a lifetime, say 70-80 years and live a full life. I totally see why these kinds of people should live; they have life to look forward to. Me, personally, I have none of these things. If there's no afterlife what's the point of living at all? I mean we have all these other people we "love" and who "love" us, but ultimately we're all just farts in the wind of time and space. Who fucking cares what another three or four other farts in time and space think about us killing ourselves? They're fucking dead too eventually. They'll just die old. If there's no salvation why the fuck should I live? Any reason besides the normal bullshit? "Oh you're loved ones will miss you! You've got so much to look forward to!" Fuck that. Fuck That.
