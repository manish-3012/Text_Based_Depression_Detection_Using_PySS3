Iâ€™ve never really had a life, so what difference does it make if I take mine away?Every day is pain. Iâ€™m alone so much of the time, but itâ€™s mostly because it hurts to be around people. Iâ€™ve had crippling social anxiety for years. Tried therapy, medications, and just going out there and trying to work on things on my own. It doesnâ€™t get any better. I want to know whatâ€™s itâ€™s like to be normal for once. To be able to go out and not have panic attacks and go home to cry right after. Iâ€™m so depressed that I forget to do simple tasks like brushing my hair or eating and drinking. Because of sexual abuse, I get triggered every time someone makes a joke about anything related to it, or if I see certain scenes in movies. Itâ€™s hard not to avoid it. I never really got to live like a â€œnormalâ€ person. Iâ€™ve been trapped inside most of my life. I tried to kill myself not too long ago and was in the hospital for weeks afterwards because of complications.(I was found in time) I hate living like this. I hate staying up all night because my thoughts wonâ€™t allow me to sleep until the sun rises, and when I see the sun rise, it makes me more depressed for some reason. I hate being me
