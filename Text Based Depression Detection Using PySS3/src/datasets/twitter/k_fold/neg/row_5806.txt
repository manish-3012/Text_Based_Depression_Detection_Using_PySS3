Every time I think Iâ€™m getting better it hits me againYesterday I genuinely thought this shit was finally over and today Iâ€™m this close to drowning myself in the estuary by my house. I know drowning is supposed to be horribly painful but I donâ€™t even care. I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™m just so fucking tired and I want to rest.
