FiredHi. I was fired yesterday from my dream job in part because of my mental health issues. 
I donâ€™t see the point anymore. I kept it in for so long because I knew the end result would be this. My â€˜strengthâ€™ was questioned, when every single day has been a battle not to kill myself. Now I donâ€™t see why I shouldnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve never felt so humiliated and depressed in my entire life.
Iâ€™m currently in the process of hiding away pills to take. I want enough so that they wonâ€™t be able to bring me back, like 50 or so.
My family know I want to kill my self so theyâ€™re hiding my antidepressants from me and only giving me one each morning, but thereâ€™s cold and flu tablets everywhere that Iâ€™m ferreting away. I hope to do it in the next few weeks.
