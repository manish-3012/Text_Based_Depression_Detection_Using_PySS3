Self harm fantasies (NSFW)When i'm feeling super horrible and shitty i have really terrible fantasies of self harm. Just today a had a desire to rip my stomach open. It seemed like it was not gonna hurt as much instead actually seemed as if it would numb my psychological pain. Also have had fantasies of  blowing myself up and some other stuff that. I obviously i wouldn't act out on them. Yeah it sounds weird. But that's the kind of thoughts go through my mind when i'm psychologically in a terrible place. Anyone else can relate? Just me?Sorry if it was explicit.
