TiredMy social skills are non existent. I can't enjoy things at all anymore. I haven't felt like a person in an immensely long time. Dead inside is a bit melodramatic, but it seems appropriate.
I survived divorce as a child, looking after my family mentally and nursing my mother to her death when I was the least mentally stable member of the entire family.
Psychologist tries but can't help. Psychiatrist too. They've done everything. I've been to hospital. My friends are good but I'm not a person anymore.
I am truly sorry that my cat will be left alone. And I will truly miss that I will never be able to do things like befriend baby hippos, pet wildebeest or hug fur seals ever again - but there's nothing left.
I've taken a bunch of benzodiazapines and I hope to not wake up. I'm a true coward but I have a straight razor and I will bring myself to use it if the pills fail.
I've left a decent amount of money and other things to my sister.
I can't deal with this bipolar anymore. This has been a life of failures. Perhaps through my death there will be a little more space in the world for someone more worthwhile.
To everyone else on here: I hope you get better. If not I can understand. I am happy, momentarily, to have this space to verbally implode before I fade away.
Thank you.
