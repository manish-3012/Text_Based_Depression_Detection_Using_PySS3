Seriously considering suicideItâ€™s the middle of the night and Iâ€™m drunk but I mean this.
Everything has gone wrong. I really want to die but I have a family and friends.
I keep thinking about walking out and killing myself but I canâ€™t even think of a way to do it and Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll traumatise someone if they find me dead. I definitely canâ€™t do it here in my house with my family.
I feel like such a fucking hypocrite. Iâ€™ve commented on peopleâ€™s posts like this before with reasons to keep living, but here I am ready to give up.
The girl I love is now my ex, and she is pregnant with someone elseâ€™s baby.
I have a dead end bartending job.
I have always had problems with depression but itâ€™s just getting worse and I canâ€™t see a way out.
