I want to suicide because no one understand me, can you help me?I am abused by authority and parental figures at age of 25. No I can't leave them they will put me in psychiatric hospital without me actually having a problem.

No one understands me, no one believes I have no problems and their answer is ''how do you know'',  no one accepts I am abused or that authorities are not doing their job. 

This country could only be described as ''bad'' so I can't get any help from any service, or at least having much expectations from them.

I want to take my life!!!!!! I can't keep this up. Not feeling like a human or having human rights make me want to end all this and I actually find it beautiful.

Can you help me by anway not take my life?
