Suicide ongoinI've been depressed for over 5 years now. I don't even know how i got this far but every single day it gets worse. In the beginnning i was pretty sure it will get better but not really. Things really got forked up for me. The reason i'm here now is my mom's death. I didn't really know how to feel back then, i was.. empty. This affected me slowly through the years. Now i got to the point where i lost everyone in my life due to my condition, lost my friends, my gf, my father wasn't even here to begin with, he's always making me feel like i was an accident, our conversation only includes insults. I've always put others ahead of me but i still lost it all. I've been always treated like poop. I can't even remember how it feels to have a family anymore. I'm lonely af, got no one to talk to, everyone leaves in the end. No one gives a dam about my condition, i tried to talk about it to friends, but the more i talked, the more afraid of me they got and pretty much left me in the dark.

At the moment i quit college, quit my job i cannot seem to find any purpose in life in my current state.i have no idea what to do at this point. I lost everything i had. I'm currently trying to kill myself, the pain is too overwhelming now, i cannot even think straight. If i keep this up with my treatment i'll be dead in a week or so.. Meanwhile i'm just hoping that someone would stop me from doing that but i don't really think so cause no one gives a poop about it.

This may sound desperate but i could really use a friend right now..

Thank you for reading this.
