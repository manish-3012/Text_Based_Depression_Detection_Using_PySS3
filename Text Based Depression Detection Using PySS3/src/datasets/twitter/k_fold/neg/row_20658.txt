My friend could use some help.Hey everyone, never posted here before, usually just comment with a different account. A good friend of mine has been having some trouble lately. He's very depressed currently and he's been saying some suicidal-sounding things. I keep trying to talk to him but it's not helping. I've suggested therapy and at the very least talking to his parents (he is a college student living at home). What else can I do?
