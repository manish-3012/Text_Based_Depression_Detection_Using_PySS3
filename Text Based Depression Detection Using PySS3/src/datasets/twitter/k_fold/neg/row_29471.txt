Considering inpatient?After 3 years of struggling with depression and anxiety I don't feel like fighting anymore. I have been suicidal before but it has never been this bad, I feel like I am incapable of handling life. I would rather sleep and lie in bed all day than deal with all these responsibilities. And I feel selfish, for harming this perfectly healthy body, for not appreciating this wonderful life I have. I think I'm a serious threat to myself but I am too scared to ask my parents if maybe I could go inpatient for awhile and I can't go to a hospital myself. I could only find USA information about it, and I don't know what to do. I don't even know if my problems are serious enough. I'm sorry for rambling on and on.
