Full CircleI thought I was stronger, and I thought it was necessary, that somehow someway there is someone looking out. But there isn't. The greatest gift I leave for the world are my daughters. They will be the one's to heal this world. This world is not for those like me and in my final hours I realized that, my legacy will be the suffering that I have gone through, and the smile that I maintained. May the next life be your best life.
