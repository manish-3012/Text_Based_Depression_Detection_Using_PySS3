I'm not sad, I just don't want to live.I've never been "depressed" but I don't want to live. Seriously, it all seems pointless. I was smart, valedictorian worthy last year in high school, popular. Still popular in my home town. A good guy. Any girl I desire is easily obtainable. A safe million dollar job waiting to be handed to me as soon as I finish college. But I'm done. For no apparent reason I just don't want to go on. Nothing particularly bad. Dad's a drunk and is never home to take care of the kids. Mom tries to avoid responsibility as much as possible. I'm okay with it, I can manage just fine. Nothing bothers me. But when I spend 90% of my day wanting to end all, something isn't right. I know there's a lot to look forward to in life. Hell, I can be one of the richest guys in my state (Idaho) in just a few years. I can't complain about anything. So many people have it much worse, and I know this. I don't feel lost or sorry for myself. I just don't want to live.
