I wonder if this is accurate for other peoplePicture this, youâ€™re sitting in your room and you have nothing to do but you have so much to do. Your rooms full of dishes and laundry and your homeworkâ€™s still in your bag begging you to look at it. But you just want to use minimal effort, listen to songs with lyrics you can relate to, watch movies about people like you, people who want to kill themselves too. And itâ€™s not that you want to kill yourself, you just donâ€™t want to live anymore, you donâ€™t want to see the same pile of clothes untouched on the floor. You donâ€™t want to feel like the same failure youâ€™ve felt like for years and its not that you dont talk its that no one else hears. So you reach out to people without telling them whatâ€™s going on, you just ask them whatâ€™s new and they say nothing, everythingâ€™s the same and you say, me too, iâ€™m just messaging because we havenâ€™t spoken in a while. And you watch them go away again and youâ€™re on your own with nothing to do except watch movies or listen to songs about people like you, people who want to kill themselves too.
