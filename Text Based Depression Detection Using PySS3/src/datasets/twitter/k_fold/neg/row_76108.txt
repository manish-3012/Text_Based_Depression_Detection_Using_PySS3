I really just wanna leave.I wanted to before, but I just lost a seven year relationship for a reason I don't know. She just blocked me out of nowhere.

I guess I kinda know. Between my personal and professional life, I was unable to give her the time she deserved. I hope she found another relationship, one that makes her as happy as she did me. I hope she doesn't see this this, just in case ahe recognizes me and realizes who I am, but just in case I don't wake up tomorrow, O wanted to say I'm sorry, and it wasn't your fault. This is on me.
