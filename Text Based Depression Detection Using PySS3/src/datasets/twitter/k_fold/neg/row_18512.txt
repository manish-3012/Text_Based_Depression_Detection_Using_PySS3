Anyone else ?Does anyone else just feel like your life is slowly crumbling ? Like one day youâ€™re on top of the world and can do anything, but the next youâ€™re at rock bottom and donâ€™t even want to turn on the lights. Well thatâ€™s exactly how I feel, so much pain inside that it feels like darkness is just enclosing on me. Like if I were to just get a knife and stop breathing, all of it would end.
