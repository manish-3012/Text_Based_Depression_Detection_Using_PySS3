This weekend Iâ€™m leaving home and lifeIâ€™m going to run away from home as far as my little 14 year old legs can go with a pocket of pills and razor blades to end my own life. You have been great life, but my thoughts are too much for me to bare. This time as my 3rd suicide attempt, will not fail. Iâ€™m not going to stop myself or ask for help beforehand.
