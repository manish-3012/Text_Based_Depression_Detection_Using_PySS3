just tired and empty.I've done a good job keeping myself from hurting myself for around a year now and it's getting harder and harder to stop. Like a buildup. We're dirt poor, I'm physically unable to do entry level work full time. I channeled my energy for the last month into trying to get my baby sister away from our abusive parent. Our parent was granted more custody without me even having a chance to speak. 

I thought I was getting better, but today I've hit lower than I have in forever. The list i keep of people that my passing would affect/hurt seems false today; Ive justified a reason why each one of them would be fine. nothing's working right now and even my closest friend is done with trying to help me.
