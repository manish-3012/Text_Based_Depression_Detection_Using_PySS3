The hardest thing...I guess I just have to talk about this, it bothers me and I can't quite understand it, I hope I won't bother with my complaints.

To me the hardest thing about being stuck in depression for years is that vicious circle of self-destruction.
There seems to be some force that moves me into thinking I don't need to care about getting out of it, this fatalism, which make me abandon everything worth fighting for in my life, and get more and more into a desperate situation.

I don't know if I depict it well enough for people to understand, but I feel like there's no reason trying to fight back and get back up, as my problems won't disappear even if I did.

What brings me a sense of closure I am satisfied with now is knowing I'll help those I love, in my last moments, dedicate in a sense these last few months to them and making their lives a little better happier.
That's the positive outcome I see and seek.
