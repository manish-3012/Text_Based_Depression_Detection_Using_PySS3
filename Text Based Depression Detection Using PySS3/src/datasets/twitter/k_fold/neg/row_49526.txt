Things That Are Bothering Me (X-Post From r/depression)I'm ugly.

I have no friends.

I've never dated anyone.

I'm 16 but I still feel like I'm 14 or maybe even 13.

I feel like I've skipped over a huge section of my life, and never progressed or accomplished anything.

I can't believe that in two years I'm gonna be an adult. I still feel like a child. I'm not ready.

I'm anxious and paranoid around people, so I can't get a job due to my acne and bold/broad facial features.

I wish I had nice hair. I wish that the awesome hairstyle that I want to have would look good with my face, but I'll never be able to pull it off unless I get cosmetic surgery.

I sleep whenever I can. I don't do anything. My lack of presence doesn't change anyone's life and nobody notices.

No one asks me to hang out.

No one even talks to me beyond a question or a simple sentence. No one has any meaningful conversations with me.

My desire for my hobbies are disappearing. I can't even play video games anymore.

It's gotten to the point where I literally fantasize about some fictitious person complementing me and comforting me as I lay in bed with an electric blanket to emulate body heat.

If I watch ONE youtube video that is vaguely related to a political subject, then there are a bunch of political rant videos filling my recommendations. The comments make me realize that it's not just ME who is a horrible person... but the majority of humanity. I've become a nihilist who hates the human species.

Why? Why did my life come to this? Why did I have to be like this?
