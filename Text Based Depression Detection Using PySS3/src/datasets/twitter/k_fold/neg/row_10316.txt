Ever been so depressed you can't finish a coffee?I know the title sounds stupid, but if you knew who I was, you'd instantly know something is seriously fucked up. I love coffee, I will gulp it down in minutes and order another. Well today I've been sitting alone in the back of my favorite coffee shop, and my iced coffee is now watered down. It's been an hour or so since ordering it. I just feel like such shit today I can't even enjoy my coffee. Delete this post mods if it allowed.
