partway thru an overdose regrethi guys, 
i just received my new sertraline prescription today and decided i wanted to OD; even if it wasnâ€™t gonna kill me i just didnâ€™t want to be here so hurting myself in some way would suffice for now. however i had only swallowed 300mg before the guilt of what i was doing took over. 300mg isnâ€™t a particularly dangerous dose as the max recommended dose is 200mg for adults however, i do not have a tolerance to this specific medication as iâ€™ve just come off of fluoxetine as it wasnâ€™t working. iâ€™m afraid to tell my parents incase they feel theyâ€™ve done something wrong but not sure if i should contact a medical professional just to make sure iâ€™ll be okay. however, my parents will find out soon bc they keep the medication secured at night bc of my suicidal ideation etc and theyâ€™ll see the packet has been opened. any advice is welcome, thanks.
