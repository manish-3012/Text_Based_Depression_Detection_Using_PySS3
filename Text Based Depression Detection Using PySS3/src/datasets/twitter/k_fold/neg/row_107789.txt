ðŸ˜žI just want to be able to leave the house and not have a panic attack, Iâ€™m fed up dissociating and having the constant urge to self harm. I just want it all to be black. Just to commit suicide and do it successfully this time. I give up! I canâ€™t do it no more. Always having the battle with my mind of wanting to binge and then wanting to purge and starve myself. I canâ€™t keep existing in a world where I already feel dead.
