Such a happy man,I don't know

I'm like the happiest dude on this fucking planet I say stupid jokes and such

But I'm also so lonely, I don't have any friends or anything and I'm failing at.. A lot of shit, me and my family are struggling a lot and I have to lie to not make them even sadder and I just spent like fucking 30 minutes staring at the mirror slowly realizing how pointless everything is

Underneath all that happiness I am just  so fucking sad
