I'm shitIf someone is mean to me or if I get the feeling that someone treats me in an unfair way, I tend to get really angry. I think it's called impulsive. I just started university and after just two weeks people already noticed that I can't shut up when I need to. That was always a problem I had and I friend told me once that I might get killed someday because of that.
A girl that studies with me just told me that I maybe should go to a therapist because of my behaviour. I already am. I've been for years now. 
I don't want to be here anymore. I tried so hard to change and I really thought I did. I don't want to go to university anymore. I'm shit and my life is shit. I'll never ever be happy and I really just want to leave.
