I can't deal with seeing my rapist.Last summer, my boyfriend sexually assaulted me after I told him I no longer wanted to see him anymore. He physically, sexually, and emotionally destroyed me and left me a complete fucking mess. After working up enough nerve I managed to go to the police and have him arrested and charged and now he's getting out of jail soon, able to go where he pleases. I live in a fairly small town and I know I'll run into him again at some point. I can't even comprehend what will happen when I see him. I just can't take it. I don't want to deal with it. At all.
