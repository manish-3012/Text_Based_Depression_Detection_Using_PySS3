Living for everyone else. Iâ€™m tired.Suicidal ideation and BPD since my childhood has made my life feel so empty and useless. Just because Iâ€™m a mildly attractive and young female, people think Iâ€™m fine. No one questions that Iâ€™m a recluse who is so ashamed to open my window blinds and Iâ€™d rather be blackout drunk than see my family. Iâ€™m terrified to look into anyoneâ€™s eyes. Have you ever been so embarrassed of yourself that you locked yourself away from sunshine and the world?

I canâ€™t afford to go to therapy. My severe anxiety has lost me every job in my life. Iâ€™m unemployed, have no friends, and my family enables my addiction. Iâ€™m left crying to strangers online. I feel so useless. I cannot continue to live for others. I donâ€™t have the resources to live for myself. Iâ€™d rather be dead.
