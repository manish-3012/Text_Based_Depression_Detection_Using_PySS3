Can i die now?Went to work back at an old site. Faking my emotions is so hard. My coworkers almost took off my mask of fakeness and called my bullshit.  I tried to be happy but in reality I only feel depressed and sad. At work, we went to the movies today but I just felt so sad. So depressed. I just want to die. I can't deal with this just feeling fake emotions and faking to be happy when I'm truly sad. I want to die jump off a cliff or get hit by a train.
