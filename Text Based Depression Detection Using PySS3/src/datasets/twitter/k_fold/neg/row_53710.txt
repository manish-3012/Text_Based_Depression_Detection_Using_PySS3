My last week before suicide...I AM DONE! I've given 42 years to see if I want to still play this game called "Life"! I have experienced a lot more than most and I am tired of the toxicity this world has. I am tired, so very tired. On July 10th, 2018 I am going to hang myself far away from anyone who can find me... out of respect. The sounds of Blue October's "Hate Me" will be playing in my head as I hang. I refuse to live in this sh*tty world just because I don't want to inconvenience those around me with the loss of me. I'm done living for others. "How selfish" they will say....but who is the selfish one? "Don't kill yourself so I don't have to greive you!" SERIOUSLY?....I'm to live in my hell because you don't want the pain from losing me? I'm sorry, but I am FINALLY going to do something to end all my pain for once in my life! If I am going to hell because of it...well... then good! Why live in a heaven with a God who condemns those who are hurt and just wanted peace!
