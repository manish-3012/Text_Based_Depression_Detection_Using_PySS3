I really wanna end it allMy step father is a acocholic and it's never quiet in my house since my mum is always arguing with him, I'm a teen so it's not that easy for me,
I feel like nobody cares about me
Today I cried in our car and my mum was next to me she never said anything, she never noticed.
My sister has bortherline personality disorder and she always screams at me and calls me names, I hate myself and I wanna end it all
