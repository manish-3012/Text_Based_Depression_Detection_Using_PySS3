Lost my job todayIâ€™ve been teaching for 30 years and I lost my job today over something stupid I did on Wednesday. It was my fault kind of but it wasnâ€™t kind of. I live on the six floor of a building and all I wanna do is go out to the balcony and throw myself off of it. I think about it all the time.
