I'm tired.I've literally never made a reddit post before buy I don't know where else I can say this. I don't know what else to do. I am tired of suffering. I've been depressed since adolescence and I always believed it would get better. 15 years later and it hasn't gotten any better. I did all the things that I thought would make me happy, give me purpose. I had beautiful children. I got an education. I even landed my dream job. And still nothing. Just emptiness. I know that I should be happy but the reality is crippling. I recently ended a long term relationship. Of course it was my fault, another thing that I fucked up. And it occurred to me, all my life has been is a series of mistakes and fuck ups with brief moments of brightness interspersed. I've never been happy. I'll never be happy. I feel like I've honestly tried really fucking hard just to fail again and again. I just want it to be over. I've tried to kill myself before. I don't want to wind up in a psych hospital or permanently physically damaged - I just want it to be done. I have a plan and a time-line. And somehow having those things makes me feel a little more peaceful. Idk what my point is. I could never say these things to anyone in my real life. I just wanted to say this. I hope I didn't break any rules. Thanks for listening.
