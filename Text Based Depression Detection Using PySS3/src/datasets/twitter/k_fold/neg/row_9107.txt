If I don't get in to any of the colleges I apply to, I'm going to run away from home and die on a deserted island.I've never truly felt like I was worth anything and not getting into college will be the last straw. I know I don't have the willpower to make it without going to college and have no desire to have a menial job and see my peers look down on me.
