Finally starting to think of when my Granddad Committed Suicide, and the impact it had on my dad. I dont know what to do with these feelings?The title is pretty clear in itself. But I'll flesh it out a bit.

My current life and history is so unreal people refuse to believe our family about it. Its almost comical now. I am normally okay dealing with family drama. But one thing that happened I have never put much thought into is the fact of my grandfather's suicide in 2001. I was only 1 and a half at the time. He committed suicide by stepping in front of a train. My dad was and is completely destroyed by it, and what ensued, but that's off topic.

Growing up. No one ever talked about him, unless it was someone showing me something that used to be his. I didn't know what his face looked like till the last few months. My gran is only just starting to talk about him now. I want to ask questions about him, because I never knew him, but I know how much he meant to my dad. I haven't seen my dad in nearly 2 years. So I guess it might just be me getting overly emotional about the upcoming date. But I have felt so sad and down not knowing anything about him. I'm angry that I never got to know anything about him. I'm angry people act he didn't exist. I'm heart broken that he has just become non existent. I could never ask people because they would shut me down. I don't know how to handle these emotions in a healthy way, all I am doing is working myself up, and I dont know if its over nothing?
