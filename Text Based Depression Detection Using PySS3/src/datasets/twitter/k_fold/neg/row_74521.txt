I'm too weak to kill myselfOn the last 2 years I have tried to kill myself twice, cutting myself, and taking too much pills. I don't have enough energy to try it again, so i live everyday wishing to have an accident and die whitout effort. I have no perspective of life, there's no way I'll be alive on the 2021. 
Note: I'm a non-english speaker, sorry for the poor writting.
