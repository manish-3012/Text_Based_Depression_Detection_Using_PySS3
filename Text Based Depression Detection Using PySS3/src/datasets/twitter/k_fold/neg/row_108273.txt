I almost killed myself but I failed at the end.Below is my suicide note:

My phone is dying and so will I soon, I've found a nice high bridge, I look forward to feeling the wind in my hair before I die.
I don't want to feel pain, sadness or be hurt ever again. I had a decent night and I want my last night here to be decent. I'm so sorry for being annoying and weird, I understand that you and everyone else tolerated me out of pity and I thank you for that. Knowing you allowed me to feel more comfortable in my own self and I thank you for that. You were there when  I didn't want to keep going, you kept me breathing and sane.
But for once in my life I want to be selfish. I hate myself,  I have always hated myself, my dearest wish was to have died before I could have been hurt. 
Hopefully we will meet in the afterlife wherever and whenever that will be, I hope I have the courage to take the leap and I don't back out like I have before.
My phone is now at 2% and I hope I have the power to send this. I'd hate to leave without a proper good bye.
Thank-you, sorry and good bye

I failed at the end and I still don't know what to say to my best friend who i sent the note to.
