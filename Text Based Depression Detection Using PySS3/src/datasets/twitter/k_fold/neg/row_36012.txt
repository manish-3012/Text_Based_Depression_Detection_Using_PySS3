I feel so beyond help.I just got into a fight with my mom and sister. Iâ€™m probably victimizing myself but I feel like theyâ€™re always against me. Like they can never see my perspective, how much pain Iâ€™m in, what Iâ€™m dealing with. They just see me as a negative person and think Iâ€™m beyond help. Iâ€™m always the bad guy. Iâ€™m always the one hurting them and any reason or justification for my actions or feelings are just excuses to them. I desperately want to end it all so they donâ€™t have to deal with me anymore but also because selfishly I want them to finally understand although Iâ€™m sure they wouldnâ€™t. Theyâ€™ve never tried to understand me or how I feel. Theyâ€™ve never understood how used and drained I feel by them. How is it that I feel constantly suffocated by them and yet when *they* push *me* away and tell me Iâ€™m going to die alone, (their words but true) I feel so empty. Not a day goes by where I donâ€™t wish I could just simply stop existing. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore.
