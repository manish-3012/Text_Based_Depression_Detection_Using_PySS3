I donâ€™t know anymoreI just donâ€™t know anymore, I have convinced myself I am not suicidal, I convinced myself that with all the others suffering why should I, someone who has been given a great life, be allowed to die. A couple years back I broke and went to the kitchen grabbed a knife and tried stabbing myself for an hour before finally giving up and returning to my room and just crying into my pillow. I couldnâ€™t work up the courage to kill myself then and a while after that I started getting better.

But now I just donâ€™t see the point anymore once again, everyone and everything I know will go one day, my life is only going to be more stressful, everyday I have at least one thought of â€œWhat if I just hang myself there?â€ Or â€œWhat if I just jump in front of that car?â€

Now with the world as it is I started questioning it as well, people get taken advantage of everyday, young girls taken advantage of by old rich men, boys also taken advantage of by others. The world is corrupt and there is nothing I can do about it, Iâ€™m not special I just have to smile and pretend it isnâ€™t happening everywhere.

I hate this world, I hate seeing happy things destroyed. But I donâ€™t deserve to just kill myself I know that. But now it is just constant torment of â€œAm I going to hang myself today or will guilt get me again?â€ Even right now I am thinking of it, if I just hanged myself right now I wouldnâ€™t have to see all this. Iâ€™m afraid to think what would happen if guns were as common in Australia as they were America. Maybe I would already be dead?

Either way the only reason I got the courage to post this is because Iâ€™m tired. Maybe I will check the replies tomorrow if there are some. I actually intended for today to be my last day but as you can see I havenâ€™t been able to do it.
