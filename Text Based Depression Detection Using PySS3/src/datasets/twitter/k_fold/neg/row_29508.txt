Worse. Much worse. Every day. Much worse.i always had self esteem problems. Every day. Its getting worse. I wasnt liking my body. Was hating it. Was hating myself. A year ago. I found out about my bisexuality. I had to lie about my mental health. And my sexuality. I saw about 10 psys. Im mentally destroyed. Tired. I dont wanna die. I wanna be forgotten. Recently i've noticed something else. Something that is destroying even more my emotions. Im trans. The person i thought i was. The person everyone thought i was. The person i've always been. It wasnt me. Why cant i be a happy hetero cis... im not living but im not dead i feel nothing but im not dead

Im existing but im not present.
