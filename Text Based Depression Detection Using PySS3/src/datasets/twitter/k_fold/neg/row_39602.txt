I Don't Want to Seek Help because of the warped definitions of "help"I've been contemplating for what I'll just define as "a good long time." I can't remember the last time a day went by that I didn't contemplate without the aid of anti-depressants. I've kept these feelings secret for a great deal of time, because last time I made them known, I was nearly institutionalized. I've had friends and family in that situation, and that's not a step I'm willing to take. But that's what the next step in my situation is. I've heard it said that if I seek professional help, that they will try to institutionalize me solely out of fear for their job. I loathe the guy who looks at me in a mirror, for reasons that are too long to fit in this thread. I'm posting here searching for anyone who's been in this spot. What can I do? I lack the gall to end it, and the will to push the extremes. I'm stuck.
