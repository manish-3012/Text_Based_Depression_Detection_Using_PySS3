tbh, there isnâ€™t much i need to say except this. You know shits not going well when your parents tell you the way youâ€™re living isnâ€™t good and that you need more friends.Itâ€™s hard for me to open up to new people. Iâ€™ve had multiple friends leave me, but iâ€™ve had one small group in general that actually likes me. but the thing is, some of them go to a different school than I do. And, the ones that go to my school are girls. Iâ€™m a guy, so itâ€™s definitely awkward for me to be with them, so i try to do my own thing.

and. today. just like 20 minutes ago i asked one of my really good friends who I care about a lot of he wanted to have lunch with me. Now i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on in his life, but he said he would rather eat alone. Just, he declined me. And, he doesnâ€™t even really talk to me that much. 

my parents donâ€™t want me to have a bunch of friends online, but thatâ€™s how i do it. Since i donâ€™t get to see my real friends, my online friends make me happy. I spend hours a day with them. But, i know this isnâ€™t the ideal way to live. Iâ€™m too stubborn and too shitty of a person to change tho. Thinking about it right now, maybe i pushed my one friend away because i havenâ€™t changed from the last times iâ€™ve lost friends.

Iâ€™m just lonely sometimes. I really have no motivation to do anything anymore, and my parents get mad at me for it. the only real things that make me happy are being with my friends and being online in general, whether itâ€™s playing a game or looking at memes. I donâ€™t get to see my friends that much tho. And, my parents try to control my life. They push me too hard and try to make me see my friends, but theyâ€™re all too busy. I havenâ€™t seen them in over a month. I just donâ€™t want to be lonely anymore
