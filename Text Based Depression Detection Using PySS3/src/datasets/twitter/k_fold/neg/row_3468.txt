School fucking sucksThe one thing that made me lose my mind was fucking school, i never really liked this place since i was little, and everyday when i went there i went with the mindset ''gosh i hope this shit is over'' a few years ago i decided to drop out of school due to various anxiety problems such as social anxiety, panic attacks, and all due to fucking school, i hate this place all the people there sucks, and i can't even think of going back there, do i have to go back since i have to complete my education if i want to feed myself, but hey, i don't even think ill get a job with my shitty resume, anyway, life sucks.
