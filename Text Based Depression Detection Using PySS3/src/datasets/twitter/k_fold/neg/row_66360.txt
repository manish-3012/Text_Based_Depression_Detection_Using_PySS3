An Eye for an EyeThe first anniversary is coming up, since my former lover and best friend committed suicide, a week after our relationship ended.
I feel alone in having this date be so embedded into my mind, and I fear I won't make it through that day. Not again. 

Beneath the writhing of guilt and unresolved mourning, I just can't help but put the hope that he's waiting for me beyond this world. But only if I go the same way as him.
Crazy, I know. That's all that's been in my head since he died. Now that I damaged my body with riddled scars, and nearly wasted a year in deep depression, what good is it for me to go on?

I've been speaking to a therapist and recieving lithium (distributed from a locked cabinet from my parents) on account of a safety plan set by the ER. I don't self harm anymore, but my God. I feel desperate to do something beyond that. I imagine a funeral in the near future. 


August 29th, I'm scared guys. I'm very scared. I'm in absolute tears as I write this. Now it's a mix of fear, mourning, sadness, and agony. 

I can't go to the emergency room again either, and I can't open up to my folks, they've been through too much already. I can't speak to my therapist, although she is suspicious, because I become nervous she'll do something that will ensure my safety perhaps, but will probably put me in a worse mental state than before. 
Please guys, I'm in a vulnerable place. I'm struggling on a very shaky tightrope and I can't find anything to hold on to. Then I'll just be a copycat suicide. I'm finding too much comfort in this. 

I'm very alone.
