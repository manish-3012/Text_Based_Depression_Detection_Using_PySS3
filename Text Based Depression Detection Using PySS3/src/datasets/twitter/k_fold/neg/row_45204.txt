I just want someone to talk to.I live a very privileged life and yet when I go to school I constantly end up crying in the bathroom instead of attending class. Whenever this happens I have really scary thoughts about killing myself, and even though I have the opportunity to get whatever I want in life I have zero energy and spend my time either crying or procrastinating. I remember looking at my grades at school the other day and it was like a floodgate had opened in my head and I had this extremely vivid sight of my parents crying at my corpse. Once it was a really rainy night and I was on a practice cruise in driver's Ed and I thought about crashing so much that I had to pull my hoodie on so the instructor couldn't see me cry. I ride my bike to a basketball court nearby to play and there's a bridge on the way with a highway underneath. It makes really disgusting images pop up in my head that I don't want to describe. We were learning about terminal velocity in science class and dropped watermelons out of the window. You can guess what thoughts that sparked. I'm scared of myself. I don't think that I'd really do it but the thoughts won't go away. I'm so sorry if you found this disturbing.
