Is anyone else feeling like they are living from one objective to the next?I feel like the dictator of a failing state, making one five-year plan after the other. Constantly reconsidering my goals after completing one of these plans. As if I tell myself: within X amount of time I will have achieved Y and Z, or kill myself. Continually living in fear that I will fail it, and continually also fearing that I will make it. I don't even know where these goals come from, or who I am accountable to. I don't want to do most of the things I decide to include in my plans. 

For some reason the 

&gt; plan is law [and] fulfillment is duty.

I'm just waiting for the dictator to purge me.
