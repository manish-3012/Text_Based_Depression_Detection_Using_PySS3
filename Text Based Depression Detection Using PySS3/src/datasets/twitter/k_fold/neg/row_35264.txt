The thoughts are coming againItâ€™s been nearly half a year since my last attempt. I was doing pretty ok. Working a lot. But now Iâ€™m quarantined. Iâ€™m losing it. I tried sticking to a routine but I always failed after a few days. Iâ€™d start spending whole days in bed or on the couch. Iâ€™ve stopped showering and I hate myself every second of every day. Even when I can finally do something productive the back of my mind is flooded with self hatred and sadness.   


And then I start thinking about how nice it would be to not be alive. A few times a week at first and then a few times a day. And then every moment that my brain isnâ€™t distracted. And it gets hard to be distracted. I live with my girlfriend but I have no friends and Iâ€™ve never felt more alone. 


I wish I could develop an eating disorder and starve to death. 


I donâ€™t even know what I want to hear or why Iâ€™m posting this. Iâ€™m just so lost.
