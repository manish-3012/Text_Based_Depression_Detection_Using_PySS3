its hard to carry onI feel so alone in the world. I have people around still I feel alone. I dont feel loved and that makes me not want to carry on living. I feel everyday is an additional day that i am living it doesnt feel like i am getting anywhere either. I dont feel a point to live. Its very unfair that a lot of peope live lives where they get unconditional love and feel part of something. 

I dont know why my entire sucks right from a dead father to an emotionally unavailable and toxic mother. Friends dont seem to this void.
