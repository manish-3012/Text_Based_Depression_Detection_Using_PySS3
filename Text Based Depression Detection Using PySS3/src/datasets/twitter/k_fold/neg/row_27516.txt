Back from in-patientIt was...real.

Le sigh...

I am now on Prozac, Remeron, and Visterol which is an anti-anxiety medication. 

I met a girl named Zoe who was from Arkansas and had the best Southern accent! She was hilarious too. We got yelled at for being too rowdy in the dayroom lol. 

I guess that's it. It is nice being free again...taking  some valuable lessons with me from this admission.

I will be around I suppose. I don't need this sub anymore (no offense to anyone here!) but once I get back on my feet I may help out here now and again and share what I've learned from the doctors and the other patients while I was in the hospital.

Please don't give up your lives. I learned that things sometimes aren't as bad as we make them out to be on our minds and SOMETIMES it is just a matter of looking at things from a different perspective that makes the difference.

Love you all.
