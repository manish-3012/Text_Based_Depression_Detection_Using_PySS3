Constant suicidal thoughts and unhappinessI'm sorry that this is very long, I can't really summarise it in a TL;DR. I'm 16 nearly 17 Male for context. This is all written in one go and will have a lot of mistakes. I should also note I have been having constant suicidal thoughts for months and have had them multiple times throughout the past few years. I have never attempted suicide but have  considered it.

I'm constantly thinking about suicide at this point, every morning and every night. I'm not diagnosed with depression, however I am constantly upset and in a terrible mood. So many horrible things have happened in my life, my sister seriously physically and mentally abused me throughout my entire childhood. This has seriously fucked me up in every aspect of my life, I won't go in to detail of the abuse but I did make a post on r/offmychest in case you want context of it, its in my comment history. I've had sleepless nights and nightmares as a result of the abuse I endured from my sister, but no one cares. Both my parents ridiculously insist that I wasn't abused despite the fact that my sister attempted to kill me multiple times. My parents are separated, my mum lives in England and my dad lives in Turkey. I know that neither of my parents really care about me, and they are both mentally unstable and scare me. My father would often 'discipline' me, usually beating me up for something as small as saying a mildly rude word. I have many memories of my father losing his temper at me, but I won't go in to detail on that either. My father has not supported me at all for the last 7 years, he has played no role in my life and I might as well be dead. He doesn't even send money and I am forced to go to Turkey if I wish to see him, which happens very rarely. When I'm in Turkey he hardly talks to me anyway. I should mention my father avoids talking to me and doesn't send any money to my mother even though he is required to by law. To me this just shows that my father doesn't care about me and doesn't really want to be my father, he even said to me at one point that having a family was a mistake.  My mother is very possessive and gets incredibly angry if I try to maintain my almost non-existent relationship with my father. She calls me 'Her son' and I'm convinced she thinks she owns me. She goes on horrible rants, she has told me she wished she never had children, that I'm a disappointment and basically shits on my character. I'm very afraid of my mother, I tried to tell her that she scares me and this just triggered an explosive rant about how I was ungrateful and pathetic. My mother also 'disciplined' me as a child and would sometimes humiliate me by beating me in front of my friends. I have almost no one in my life who I can share any of my feelings with, I'm constantly afraid of my 2 unstable parents and I'm afraid that my abusive sister will come and hurt me again later in life. I have 0 trust for either of my parents or anyone else. I'm also not happy in life in general, as far as I'm concerned I've been treated like shit by everyone in my life with few exceptions. I hardly trust anyone, I don't even feel like anyone cares about me enough to even listen. My biggest dream in life is to have 1 person who genuinely cares about me, I don't want anything else. The thought of suicide is constantly on my mind, I'm very afraid of opening up to anyone, I only have 1 friend and I don't want to unload everything on to him, he also has a lot of problems and doesn't need to deal with mine too. I'm afraid of telling anyone about how I feel, I have many feelings that are bottled up inside of me and I feel like I'm just going to explode. I haven't even told anyone that I'm bisexual cause I'm afraid of what they will say (not a main issue but is causing me a lot of anxiosnes). I know that I make very sudden and impulsive decisions, I'm afraid one night I genuinely might just kill myself. If you've read this far thank you, I genuinely feel as if I have no support in my life and the though of someone caring enough to read this is comforting. I lack any real support in my life and I'm grateful to anyone who replies.
