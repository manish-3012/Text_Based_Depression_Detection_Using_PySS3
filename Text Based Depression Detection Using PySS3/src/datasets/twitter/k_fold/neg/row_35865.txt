Found a letter from my ex wifeI reached for a Bible tonight, thought I would look up something that might encourage me. Of course out flies a letter from my ex Liz, back when we were married, when we were together, when I had the kids here with me and her.  

Since then I've been stuck here like a goddamned animal. I want to die but mother fucker I can't get off this God fucking planet. Jesus Christ get me off his goddamn planet.

I've been suicidal for a number of years. I attempted a few times and obviously did not succeed. Shocker.

hopefully I can just find a way to do this. I don't have a gun and I've been avoiding hanging myself. I tried it from a short drop a while back and it didn't work. I keep thinking of jumping off a building but I'm worried that it isn't tall enough. I took a bunch of pills and couldn't talk one time for a whole day or two. You just can't get decent pills anymore to end this God damn mess.

I tore up the letter. And I tore up the Bible. There's another one around here if I need one. Scripture everywhere and no answers. But at this rate I'll probably find a wedding photograph. Fuck her and fuck God for doing nothing. Years of begging and fucked up dreams and no kids again for the holidays. 

Anyway I hope to not be here anymore, good luck everybody. Don't have any dreams and don't fucking believe in anything. If you do believe, never stop believing. And never doubt because you will be fucked like me.
