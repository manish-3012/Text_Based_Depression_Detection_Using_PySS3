Nearing the dateSo, I posted here a couple weeks ago about why I was thinking about doing this but ended up deleting it because I had to let a friend use my phone and didn't want her stumbling upon it. I'll just jump into it, get this offy chest and finish up the few things I've got to do before Friday.

Mid 20s male, living in Utah. I don't really know why I'm posting this, I guess it's just sort of final thoughts because I'm too chickenshitted to actually write them down for people I know to see.

I'm just not where I always thought I'd be by now. I always thought I'd have atleast a real relationship by the time I get to this age. I've never had issues getting a random hookup or a FWB that would last a few months but I've never really gotten to the real LTR area.

I thought I might have finally found someone a few months ago, we hung out a bit, texted or snapped quite a bit. After Christmas everything just sort of changed and I am not really sure why. We haven't really hung out at all besides getting some McDonald's once or twice and that didn't last long at all, maybe an hour or two at most. I got a little drunk late one night and in my fog might have texted her laying it all out. Woke up and saw it, immediately freaked out because this was not how I wanted it to happen. Went for a drive with a friend, came back home and finally had the guts to look at my phone and nothing. Just left on read.

I thought maybe she'd mention it the next day when I saw her but nope, just pretended nothing happened and I don't want to bring it up again, I can take the hint.

Career wise I'm nowhere close to where I wanted to be. I wanted to join the military out of high school, but my dad got real sick and I was the only one who could take care of him. Got a shit warehouse job and I've been here since. The money is okay for what it is, but this is not what I wanted to be doing with my life.

The thing is, things kind of lined up recently to make this   the best possible time if I go through with it. My mom moved down here late last year and is living with my brother and I until probably March. This gives each of them some sort of support system they'll need emotionally, and they'll be financially in a spot where they can easily make it.

My brother has been talking about going to school for awhile now, and I always felt that somehow I was holding him back. Now he will be able to get the degree he wants, and get into the field he wants. 

There won't be too many people that this will impact. I've only really got my mom, brother, my elderly grandmother, and one good friend. Everyone else that seems to act like my friends just seem like fair weather friends, and it's damn near impossible to do anything with them, not from the lack of trying. There is always excuses, and then I'll see them on some social media they have and they were lying all along.

I spent probably close to 300 dollars on Christmas presents for friends, and I didn't get a single thing from them. Don't get me wrong, I don't care about the money, I had it and spent it. I would've been happy with anything, even a damn hug from one or two of them.

I've already decided on how I'll do it, to where the family won't have to see anything. My hope is that the few people who actually care will never know what happened and just assume it was an accidental.
