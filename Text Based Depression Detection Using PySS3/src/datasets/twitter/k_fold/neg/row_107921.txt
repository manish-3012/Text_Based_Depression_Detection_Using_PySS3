SSRI isn't helping at all, I feel like a failure.I started taking 10 mg Lexapro on November 10 and switched to Citalopram about a week later. It's been over a month now and if anything, it's just worse. For weeks I just didn't feel any sort of emotion and being numb made me very uncomfortable. In the last week and a half, I've been feeling more and more sad. I don't have much of an appetite and I have no desire to make friends or socialize with others. I'm always tired and I yawn constantly. I self harm multiple times a week and that is getting worse too.

Half the time, I don't even feel real. I feel like I'm letting my family down. I feel like it's my fault that my brain just isn't working. It's becoming more and more clear that I am never going to get better. 

I can't see a doctor right now because of issues with my insurance (it's so shitty that NO ONE in my area takes it, and I even live in a large city). I feel like I'm going to have a breakdown. I just want to be normal.
