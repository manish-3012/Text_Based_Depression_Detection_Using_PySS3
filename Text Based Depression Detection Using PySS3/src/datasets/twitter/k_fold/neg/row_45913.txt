I can't do this much longer.I've got suicidal thoughts when I up till I go to bed again, day for day... in the last eight years or so i had so many therapies, medications and hospitalizations, nothing helped. I'm everyday depressed and lonely and i just can't do it mich longer. I have no more chances of a career, have no friends, no hobbies or anything that would make me feel good. I'm crying everyday and just hoping that I'll have the strength to bring it over me.
