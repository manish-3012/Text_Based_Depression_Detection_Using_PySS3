Why are mornings so hard?Days are a little rough, nights seem just fine, and then morning, fuck... I just want to die; rather it be the a workday or non-workday.

I have my story and it's quite pathetic, but I'll spare the details. It boils down to being 36 and tired of the same shit over and over regardless of how much I try to change it all. If it weren't for my kids (that I barely see), I'd checked out already. 

What I hate about life, is that you are involuntarily given it and expected to just live it. If you think about ending it, you're just a horrible weak-minded individual that doesn't care about others, and should suffer so you don't hurt others. What kind of bullshit is that?
