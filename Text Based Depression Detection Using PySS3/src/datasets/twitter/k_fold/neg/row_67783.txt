My cat keeps me from ending it allMy cat (my parents too because I care about them) is the only thing that keeps me from not killing myself. I know my baby wouldnâ€™t die without me and she doesnâ€™t exactly love me (I have 10 new scratches on arm) but looking at her cute little face and admiring her uniqueness (sheâ€™s crazy) gives me that little boost of serotonin I need to make it through another day. I literally canâ€™t be sad when I am looking at cats or with cats. If I donâ€™t have a career that involves kitties or other animals, I donâ€™t feel any purpose. I feel better about myself knowing that I can help cats or other animals. I just wanted to post that because maybe you guys have something like this that makes the future a little brighter. Maybe think of that thing and think of that as a reason to live. Taking care of animals and knowing they need me makes me feel a little less shitty and a little more purposeful :)
