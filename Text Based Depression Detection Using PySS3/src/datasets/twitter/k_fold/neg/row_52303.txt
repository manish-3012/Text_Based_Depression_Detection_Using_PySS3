I don't know how to solve my problemsI hate my body. In the past three years I've gained over 60 lbs. I'm 5'7 and I weigh 180 lbs. I know its not a whole terrible lot of weight but I hate myself for it. I'm too embarrassed to even leave my bedroom. This has lead to my being deeply depressed. Every time I think I'm doing better, I see a picture of my self and it all comes crashing down. I don't know how to stop eating.

I'm in all honors/AP classes at my high school, but I feel like an idiot. I usually enjoy school, but suddenly all this work just feels pointless. I don't think dropping the classes are an option; I have 3 other siblings in high school right now and they're all doing extremely well. All my friends are honors/AP too. To get off this path right now would be utterly humiliating.

I have an abusive mother who I don't really see anymore...but I still feel the effects of her actions everyday. I don't know how to solve any of these problems. The best option it seems is to kill myself. Please tell me I'm wrong
