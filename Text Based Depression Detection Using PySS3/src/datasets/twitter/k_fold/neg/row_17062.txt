Suicide through CoronavirusI live alone- my thoughts are consuming me whole. I really want an excuse to pass that doesn't freak out my parents. Think for me that has to be COVID. I'm not scared of a disease that I can contain myself away from others with. I know how fucked up this sounds, but 14 days to death doesnt sound bad. For the record, I have not been tested but am symptomatic for HIV after a sexual assault. If I am immunocompromised I have to think this will be a death sentence.
