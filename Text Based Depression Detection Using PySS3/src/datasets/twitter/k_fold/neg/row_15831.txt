I hate myself because I'm a pedophileI've searched this subreddit and pedophiles before me have explained the situation better than I could.  So I'll be brief.

I'm in my 20's.  I don't want to die, but I feel it is the right thing to do.  Four and a half years ago I was watching a documentary on pedophiles and it made me finally admit to myself that I had a problem.  My life came to a standstill since then.  I stopped working and spent most of my time planning out my suicide.

I have three categories of reasons to die:

1. My fierce intolerance of my own daily fantasies and urges
2. Society doesn't want somebody like me around
3. I fear that one day in the future I might harm a child

I feel really disappointed in life because I have goals that I could have aspired to if it weren't for this rude interruption.  Now I don't believe in myself and I have no motivation or desire except to complete the necessary suicide.
