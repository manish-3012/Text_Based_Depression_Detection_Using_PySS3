Iâ€™m feeling very hopeless and having suicidal thoughts and itâ€™s scaring meMy life is a mess. All of it except for my romantic life, but even thatâ€™s getting messy. I have no friends anymore, an awful job, school isnâ€™t in my plan because they messed up my financial aid again, and i have nobody except for my boyfriend. My mom is emotionally unavailable, my dad is dead and i miss him, my brother takes advantage of me, and i just turned 19 and am financially/cleaning wise responsible of an entire house. Iâ€™m getting no calls from jobs good and closer to home, i got blown off for an interview yesterday. My hair wonâ€™t even hold highlights. 

While i drive lately, Iâ€™ve been picturing my suicide. Iâ€™ve been picturing my funeral and how not many would be there. Itâ€™s my dog and my boyfriend that are keeping me going, and theyâ€™re just barely keeping me holding on. Iâ€™ve been wanting to self harm more and more lately and struggling not to. Iâ€™m trying to find a therapist but canâ€™t because my medical insurance is awful. 

I donâ€™t know what to do, but Iâ€™m not okay. I had a bad suicide attempt when i was 14, and Iâ€™m nearing the point where i was back then.
