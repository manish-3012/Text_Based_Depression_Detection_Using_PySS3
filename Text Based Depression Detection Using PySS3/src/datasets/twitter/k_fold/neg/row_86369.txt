UPDATE My (17f) boyfriends (18m) dad recently died and I donâ€™t know how to helpThis is a cross post from r/relationships since it got taken down and I was told to post here. 

My original post didnâ€™t get a lot of attention but Iâ€™m posting an update in hopes of some more advice. 

Hereâ€™s a link to my original post https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/8r7p61/my_17f_boyfriends_18m_dad_recently_died_and_i/?st=JIZIQRUL&amp;sh=4974351a

So over the past couple of weeks my boyfriend and his family moved (which they were previously in the process of). I stayed with them and helped during that time. The first day of then moving into the new house, they got the news that their dog had cancer and needed to be put down. This had been his fathers dog, and the news killed my boyfriend. We stayed back while everyone finished up moving, and I held him while he cried. 

I brought up therapy like the comments suggested and was essentially shot down every time, being told it wasnâ€™t his thing, and that he didnâ€™t need it. But heâ€™s really really depressed and talks about how much better it would be â€œup thereâ€ with his dad. 

Tonight he has truly been scaring with this talk and I sincerely donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™ve been trying to be there for him, looking up coping mechanism for him, dropping everything to come over, but nothing helps. Heâ€™s been accusing me of cheating (which is completely not true) because he feels like heâ€™s too much. I feel like if I leave him or give an ultimatum of going to therapy, heâ€™s going to legitimately kill himself. Any advice would really be appreciated at this point, I donâ€™t know how to go forward. 


Tl:dr boyfriend is hitting an all time low, refuses help from me or anyone. Iâ€™m starting to hit my breaking point as well.
