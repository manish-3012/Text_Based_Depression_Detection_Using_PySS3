Tired of being afraid of everything.I just want to go and be with God already so I won't have to be so afraid of the world and of death. I have PTSD and constant panic attacks where I am convinced I am going to die, it makes my life a living hell. Lately during these panic attacks, I've been wondering if death would be such a bad thing, since it would finally release me from my fear of death. I know it's ironic. Just wanted to vent.
