Does seeking professional help actually work?So recently I've hit a new low. I've always had "death" at the back of my mind but never legitimately considered it, however, things has changed since end of 2016 and I've been doing some research like looking up what happens to student loans after death, quick and painless ways to do it, and I've been hogging up some cash for my family if they are to pack me up.

I've been here for about a month or so and lots of people here either had professional help or told fellow members at a low point to seek it. 

I don't plan to, nor do I really want to. But I just wanna ask does speaking to a professional actually help? Or has it been a cycle of going nowhere?
