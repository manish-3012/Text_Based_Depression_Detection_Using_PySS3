Because I don't deserve to be loved.I watch the happy partners whiz around,  
As their love knows no bounds.  
And I know I'll never experience that,  
Because I don't deserve to be loved.  


Young, old. Freshmen, Senior.  
Everyone finds someone.  
They say you need someone to love,  
But I don't deserve to be loved.  


I look at myself and I'm not surprised,  
Covered in cuts from arms to thighs,  
And a gash of attempted infertility,  
Because I don't deserve to be loved.  


I look at the happy couples on my socials,  
As I down thousands of miligrams.  
And all I ever get from it is more torment, more pain,  
Because I don't deserve to be loved.  


Everyday, I dream about my wrists bleeding,  
My throat slit, heavy heaving,  
As I put a pistol to my head, I realize again,  
I don't deserve to be loved.  


I know that love isn't just romantic,  
But thats the only thing I feel.  
My infatuations with the perfect ladies is futile,  
Because they'll never, ever love me.  
 

I've tried over and over again,  
to change myself, to free myself of the demons.  
But after years of futile hardwork, I've realised;  
I don't deserve to be loved.
