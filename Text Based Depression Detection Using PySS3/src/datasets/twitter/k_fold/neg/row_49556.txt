Suicidal ideation is shit, any tips?I have a suicidal ideation for a fucking long time. Before the shitshow that is 2020 started, I used to have those thoughts every few months or so, but now this shit is in my brain every three days. I can't ignore it anymore, nor push the problem for later. 
How do you deal with it? For the love of god, do you have any tips on how ro make it shut the fuck up?
