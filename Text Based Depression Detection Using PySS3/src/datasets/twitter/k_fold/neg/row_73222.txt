I'm scaredThere aren't any available suicide prevention hotlines where I live. I don't have a therapist. My school councillor won't do anything because she already hates me a lot.

I'm having waves of suicidal thoughts and I'm scared. I have no one to talk to. My sibling is too young and innocent to understand, my parents will be deeply upset, and there are no hotlines I can use.

My friends won't care because they're already dealing with their own problems and I don't aant to be a burden.

I'm scared. Please help me. I just want someone to talk to. Please.
