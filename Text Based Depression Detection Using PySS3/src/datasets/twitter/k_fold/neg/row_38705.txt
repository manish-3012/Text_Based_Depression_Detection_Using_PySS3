I think it's overI have lost the best friend I've ever had. She was amazing and... not completely real. I was aware of the possibility from the first day, but still fell for it. If you've ever lied to a friend, fix everything NOW before they find out themselves. You don't know how devastated they will be.

I was depressed before, this made me snap. Fuck. I managed to stay strong for such a long time.
