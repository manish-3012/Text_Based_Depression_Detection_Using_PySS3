Who needs a plan anyway when I have thought about it over a hundred timesHave you had any thoughts of suicide? 

Have you made any plans? 

These are the questions asked by doctors and psychologists. I know what to say to keep me out of the hospital. What is even the point of these questions? Yes, suicide is on my mind all the time. At least once a day and more. 

Are they normal to me? Yes, absolutely. 

Am I actually scared and worried? Yes but I canâ€™t stop the thoughts.

Have I made any plans? Well... does thinking about it constantly and knowing exactly what youâ€™re going to do count as a plan. In fact, Iâ€™m so tired of making elaborate plans of suicide inside my head. Honestly, itâ€™s better for me to not think about it and to just do it without much thought. After all, itâ€™s been well thought out over a hundred times.

Anyone get me?
