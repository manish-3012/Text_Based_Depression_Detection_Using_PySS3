LonelyIâ€™m pathetic I need help, Iâ€™ll call suicide hotline and choke up. I call them just to hear the ring and then hang up. Iâ€™ve called them before but it never really helped me. It just helps me feel less lonely, hearing a voice when I feel this miserable. I need someone to vent to Iâ€™ll listen, it ainâ€™t always about me. I just canâ€™t vent to my friends, Iâ€™d sound sick mentally. Hit me up, Iâ€™d appreciate it.
