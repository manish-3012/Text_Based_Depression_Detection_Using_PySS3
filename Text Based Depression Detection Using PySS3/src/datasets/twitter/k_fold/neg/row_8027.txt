Every day i want to die, nothing changedSo after i failed my hs exams my life was: work, come home, sh, sleep, repeat. I ate 2 times in the last 48h. This summer i lost 10kg. Idk how i'm still alive at this point. There's not a single day where i dont think how i should die and how much i want to die. THERE'S NO MAGIC SOLUTION, nobody will come to help, no magic solution, nothing
