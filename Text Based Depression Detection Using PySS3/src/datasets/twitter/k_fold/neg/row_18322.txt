I think I've ruined my lifeI did everything I was told to do. I went to the right school, I took the right classes. I worked hard, I got my projects done, and a shiny new PhD hangs on my wall. And itâ€™s an albatross around my neck.

I defended a year ago, and no one wants to hire me. In a year of trying, I have gotten one interview. One. I have even tried leaving the PhD off of my resume, but I got caught. I fear that I will never be employed again, and the last six years of living hell was all for nothing.

I want to tear that diploma off of the wall and rip it up. It has brought me nothing but misery and disappointment. I think I may have seriously and irreparably ruined my life. Iâ€™m out of money and unable to pay rent.

Donâ€™t tell me congratulations, or that you have sympathy for me. It doesnâ€™t help. I canâ€™t stand sitting here. The anger and frustration makes me feel like Iâ€™m going to fly apart. Everything I have worked for was a lie. I want to hurt someone or myself. I want to punch my professor in the face and demand my life back. I have nothing to live for.

I would ask for help, but nobody canâ€¦ or cares enough to. I have nothing to look forward to in my life. I don't want to go on anymore. I can't handle being in this nightmare. Anyone who tells you "it gets better" is a liar who has never experienced "it" before.
