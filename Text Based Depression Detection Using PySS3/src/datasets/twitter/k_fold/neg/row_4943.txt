I couldn't face the world. spent all day in bedSo yesterday I got up dressed and made it downstairs. Sat on the couch and didn't leave it for 4 hours. My wife came down to got to work and was not happy to see me lying there but she left for work. I finally dragged myself back up stairs and slept for an another 4 hrs. Didn't get out of bed until 6:30 pm. Wife was super pissed at me, she said I'm letting her down and my business partners by not doing my best. What if my best is not killing myself everyday, there is no energy left to try and succeed in business. All I want is to disappear and cease to exist.
