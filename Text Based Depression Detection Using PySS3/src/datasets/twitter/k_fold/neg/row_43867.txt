Iâ€™m singing to no one &amp; everyone &amp; no onefor the longest time, Iâ€™ve always imagined singing and performing in front of people Iâ€™ve known. this wouldnâ€™t happen in real life. not from fear but I donâ€™t have the voice.

I do this when Iâ€™m trying to escape from life, imagining a happy dulcet tone can come out, showing everyone that hey, I can do something. 

Iâ€™ll imagine family (they know I feel like this but oddly donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve tried to blame myself but honestly, I know I just got some shitty family), Iâ€™ll imagine former friends who have passed away, Iâ€™ll even imagine exes &amp; itâ€™s never to impress them, itâ€™s just to show them that hey, Iâ€™m here, how is it going my old friend. i donâ€™t want to get back with them.

lately when I close my eyes and listen to music, thatâ€™s gone. gone is some ridiculous hilarious stage that would make hologram tupac think twice about the delusions of grandeur &amp; send hologram suge knight after me. 

its a blank white room &amp; im just softly singing to myself. no walls, nothing at all, just me and blank whiteness, which could also be my new nickname if I think about it. 

i am so completely and totally fucked. I donâ€™t want to die but things arenâ€™t getting better. thereâ€™s nothing here anymore. this isnâ€™t how it should be. but it is.
