Its it bad if i dont want to kill myself but i think death whould be fineI wont kill myself but i feel death whould give me peace, sometimes i take risk that i shouldnt like crossing a red ligh when cars are pretty fast always with thoughts like "well if it wouldnt be that bad or i could rest and stop at once" in the back of my thoughts

Ive been feeling low for a while now but ive been worse before, i lack of sleep since a young age, i feel guilt over meanless things, i feel like i cant acomplish anything and most  people in my erviroment its either disapointed or hates me, i dont feel any better with my hobbys like playing video games and taking walks around even when i try things that  should motivates i feel empy, i hate myself for feeling that way and i think if i talk this about this most wont take serius like how this will buried over others person problems, and others will feel horrible for me so ive thought that seaching for help trought reddit anonymity whould get me help but i dont it will, someone wont just stop and read the complains of some "teenager who doesnt know how real problems are" even when that tenager has been suffering for quite long but decided to sacriface his own search for help so every one can stay like there are no problems at all and every one is fucking happy . Ive even mentioned my suicidal thoughts during a panic attack every one just acted like they heard nothing. because at the end im problaly just the piece of trash that cant do anything but talk how bad he feels about being nothing.

wow that was quite a text im sorry for every one who readed that.
