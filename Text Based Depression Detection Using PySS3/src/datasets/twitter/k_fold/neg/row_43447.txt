Why I'm going to kill myself today.Since the time I left high school, I have been feeling depressed. I didn't know what I wanted to do. Under peer pressure I took up engineering. I don't like engineering. I'm more than halfway through the complete course. I cannot drop out of college because 1) I won't get a job 2) I have already spent 3 years in college. My mind has stopped functioning. I attend all classes but my mind remains numb. I cannot work on my passions because whenever I try anything, I feel like shit for not doing task I'm supposed to do. And to get myself away from feeling like shit, I go to youtube, phub, etc. I find it difficult to describe my thoughts. So for once and for all I'm going to end this, and kill my old self, give up all things I like, and live the way I'm supposed to live. Like a robot. Just work and nothing. I don't want to feel anything.
