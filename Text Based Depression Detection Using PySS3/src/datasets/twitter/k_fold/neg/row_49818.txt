What the fuck is the point? I'm miserable. I tried so hard my entire adult life. I've tried to pretend I'm happy but I fuckin hate my life. I've just been fucked over left and right for as long as I can remember. I'm only 24 but I've dealt with so much bullshit I just want to kill myself. I just don't see the point anymore.
