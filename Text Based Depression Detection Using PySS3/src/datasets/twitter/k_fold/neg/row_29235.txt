Why bother anymore?I really don't know what to do, i don't know if ill ever see happiness ever again. I can't stop looking at my self as a useless and awful human being. I have my doubts that anybody would miss me. Ive dealt with bipolar disorder for a while and it only ever seems to get worse and worse. My manic episodes make me go insane, i can't slow down and im angry at everything and when im depressed i struggle to even get a bit of happiness. I continously try to improve myself but it doesn't make me feel any better. I tried to lose weight and start a workout routine but as soon as the depression came back i went right back to my habits of binge eating and drugs. I know i shouldn't take my life for granted and i know i COULD be happy again but everything seems so grim. I'm starting to lose hope and someday ill probably have a drug addiction. Everything looks like shit, everything i used to love. I tried to get myself medicated but to everybody i'm either "just autistic" (which i'm not) or just a normal teen. Although i don't see all of my classmates getting angry at nothing and being scared of inanimate objects talking to them.
