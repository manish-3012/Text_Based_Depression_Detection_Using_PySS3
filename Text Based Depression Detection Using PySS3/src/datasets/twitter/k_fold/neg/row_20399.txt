Life is hellI reached a point where i start to feel tortured inside my own brain whenever i think about my life.
I used to see suicide as a "press here to end pain" button that i thought about and looked at all the time, but i learned that not only suicide is way harder and more painful than what i thought, also, i figured out i'm too much of a coward to do it, and my biological instincts that force me to survive and stay alive are going to prevent me from succeeding, or only make suicide possible when i experience the worst psychological pain. 
So for me now, life is hell and it feels like i'm somehow being tortured in a cage, everything outside the cage is poison, and the only way i can get the key to open the cage and poison myself to free myself from torture is to reach a certain unbareable amount of torture, also, if i try to open the cage without a proper key, i risk the cage shrinking to cause me extra pain for a while.

Side note: while i suffer,  priviliged teenage girls when they see mental illness be like: that's soo cute, can i have one?
