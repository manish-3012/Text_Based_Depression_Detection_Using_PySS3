I need someone to help me deconstruct a disturbing trend in my thoughts.My history is I went through several years of depression, about 8 months of it quite crippling. I got out of it, I developed coping mechanisms, improved myself and feel I have been well and truly cured of it for 7 years or so.

Recently, however, my lifes outlook has taken a nosedive. I am extremely apathetic, lack motivation, find solice in semi self destructive activities (well, that's how I feel about it, just watch tv-shows and play games all day when there are productive things to do) and the solutions are right there, but it's just so.... "depressing" the place my mind is in.

I sometimes feel like my coping mechanisms are from the "taking it a day at a time" approach. But now that I'm well, that's been very counter productive. Just accepting the situation and getting through it worked well when I felt the only option was suicide, but now that all the opportunities to live life to full is there, I'm still jsut taking a day as it comes.

What concerns me the most, is I feel vulnerable. I let this happen too much longer, life will inevitably deal me a rough hand when I won't be able to deal with it. I will fall back into bona fide depression. 

I am dealing with intrusive thoughts these past few months. They are taking the form of suicide as an option. It's not dangerous, as i immediately recognize thes thoughts for what they are. I don't FEEL depressed and the thoughts of suicide as a real possibility are not a threat at all. They are, however, getting more frequent and less repulsive. 

I'm a bit scared.
