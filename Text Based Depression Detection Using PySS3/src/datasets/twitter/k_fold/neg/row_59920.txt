my mind is the great fucking betrayer! (34 male and married)I dont know who im talking to here. i typed into google that i wanted to blow my fucking brains out and here i am. ive never been against suicide. i believe your life is your life, take it or live. just a bit of background.

i love my wife. shes amazing. beautiful, kind, gentle. but my fucking worthless piece of shit mind has fallen in love with a co worker. its been 2 months and feelings have only intensified. i betray myself and my wife. days are full of torment and nights are sleepless and miserable. i hate thinking about this other women. all my thoughts revolve around her. i hate her smile because it fucking glows. i hate her laughter because im filled with joy. i hate being near her, my chest fills with light. i hate my fucking mind. its been my enemy my entire life. if this shit doesnt end i'll happily blow my fucking head off. dont care.
