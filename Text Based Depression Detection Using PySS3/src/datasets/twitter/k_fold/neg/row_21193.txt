Today's my 20th birthday; two years ago I told myself that, if things hadn't gotten better by now, I'd commit suicide.And they haven't. If anything they've gotten consistently worse.


I can't even bring myself to cry anymore: the sadness forms, and I feel like crying, but I've done it so much these past few years it's like my body's run out of tears.


I went to therapy for a little while, about seven sessions or so, but stopped when I made my therapist cry two visits in a row. The other times, he's at a loss for words and says he can't figure out how to talk me off the ledge I currently stand on. Can you imagine that? I'm so fucked up that when I talk about stuff that's been with me since I was a little kid, I make mental health professionals cry and stammer. Am I really that far gone?


I've had the gun there for the longest. I don't know why I haven't done it yet. Why did I hang on for so long? Ignorance? Fear? Hope? Probably some combination of the three.

The only reason I live is because I fear death is worse. That seems like what would happen, give what's already happened to me. It always gets worse. No matter what. Hell, maybe I won't even get to die, but they'll pick the fragments of my skull off the floor and stitch me back together and I'll be forced to live out the rest of my life disfigured and locked inside a mental hospital. That sounds worse than death, honestly.

I don't even know why I typed this out. I might leave a link to this account in my suicide note so whoever bothers to bury me can read what I've wrote. At least nobody can say what I did came from out of the blue then.

Thanks for reading this, if you did.
