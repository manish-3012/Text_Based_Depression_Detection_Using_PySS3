Judt need anyoneI really don't know what to say. My whole life I've pushed everyone that ever cared about me away. Not that it matters anyway because I've always been the one that says "i'm fine, I'll be alright", I've been an open book, honest to a fault, been the sholder to cry on and nobody feels it necessary to return the favor. They all say they mean well, but really, they couldn't give a flying fuck about me, not in the least. The one time I come to call and they all ignore or reject me. So fuck it. I'm letting reddit choose. I'm doing the first thing reddit tells me to do. If I get a troll, I'm out the game, I'm kiling myself forreal. If I get a good samartitan, i'll listen. I'm done ignoring my destiny. Just give it to me already. Put me put of my misery.
