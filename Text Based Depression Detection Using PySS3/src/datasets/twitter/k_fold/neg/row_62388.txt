Iâ€™m going to kill myself within two weeks. Iâ€™ve decided for good.Just needed to say this. I have funds now, so Iâ€™m going to buy a cheap car and a shotgun with some ammo. Iâ€™ll practice with the shotgun to make sure I know how it works. Then Iâ€™ll drive to a quiet area and out the barrel against my temple and go for it. Or maybe put the barrel in my mouth - I havenâ€™t decided. Two weeks maximum. Iâ€™ve been acting completely normal - no one suspects anything. That said there isnâ€™t really anyone looking for it so yeah.

Iâ€™m a little bit afraid of the pain. I picked shotgun to head because statistically itâ€™s the most lethal and appears the least painful. But those few seconds as the bits of my brain die will feel weird. I might be a little scared knowing, as Iâ€™m dying, that I canâ€™t move my muscles or anything. That Iâ€™m not connected to my body anymore. I might be scared because I might not be able to physically think anymore, as my brain bits will be scattered everywhere.

Iâ€™m also scared I wonâ€™t shoot myself correctly and Iâ€™ll be injured for life. That would really suck.

But I think itâ€™s worth it. Part of me is scared, but part of me is looking forward to it too. 

My life is just pain day after day after day. But I know Iâ€™m taking a risk. What if there is an afterlife and my consciousness survives? That would suck too. I hope if there is a god, he does the favor of just wiping my consciousness from existence so I never have to think again, OR giving me a new one with a better outlook on life and better personality traits. The one that I wanted from the beginning. 

Either way Iâ€™m looking forward to it. Iâ€™ll update as progress goes further.
