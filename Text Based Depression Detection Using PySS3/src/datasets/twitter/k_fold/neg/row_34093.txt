Just end me , manSometimes, the pressure put on myself to do well is just too much, I just want my first year at uni to be over, I just wanted a job, a wife to come home to and kids, and down time after work to do things I like to do, and be with my new family. Now, it looks like I won't meet any of my goals. I'm so anxious about university, I just study until I pass out on the desk, I haven't slept in a bed with the lights off since I started. No one calls me, texts me, or wants to make plans with me. Girls never look my way, and not one has anything in common with me, like religious views, and love for history and geography as hobbies. No, they all think I'm creepy, or that i'm just ogling them when i'm really not. Most of them, I heard from others(from gossip) that most of them (or at least I think most of them)think I'm just some aggressive, violent and argumentative person that will be a wife beater when I grow older. That shit hurts.

Life just isn't worth living.
