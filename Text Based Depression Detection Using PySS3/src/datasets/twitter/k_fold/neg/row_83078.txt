I die more and more every day.I really DONT see a future for myself anymore. Not if i have to endure this pain every day. I donâ€™t have it in me to fight any longer. Iâ€™d rather be dead than suffer through this. Because it feels like Iâ€™m dying everyday. Every day a piece of me dies and a piece of me suffers. Iâ€™d rather be dead than experience this. I planned how Iâ€™m going to do it, Iâ€™ve been trying every way.. every thing to hold on to something to keep me from cutting, keep me from finally doing it and every day that reason fades. I fade away everyday. Nobody will miss me. But i know they will act like they do and forget about me because all i did was cause pain. And all Iâ€™ve done is be a burden to everyone around me. They tell me all the time. They never stop behaving and treating me like i am a burden. But it stops now. When Iâ€™m gone theyâ€™ll all be free of this burden. I hope their lives with be much better off now that theyâ€™ve all kicked me down and stepped on me to be happy.
