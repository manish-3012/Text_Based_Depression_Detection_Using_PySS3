To those of you who were abused, and now have mental health issues, thereâ€™s HOPE for you
You mightâ€™ve been diagnosed with : depression, anxiety, bipolar, ADHD.. and other mental illnesses but hear me out

If you suffered any type of abuse as a child then chances are you developed one or multiple mental illnesses.

What you should know is that it isnâ€™t written in your DNA. itâ€™s a learned behavior, and since itâ€™s learned it can be unlearned

Of course the journey isnâ€™t an easy one, but i promise if you give yourself one last chance instead of ending your life, you are definitely not going to regret it.

Youâ€™ll get to live a normal life, our death might be inevitable but why not put up a fight when thereâ€™s hope? Personally itâ€™s hope that keeps me alive.

If you want to learn more thereâ€™s a subreddit about complex PTSD :  r/CPTSD

And the book that Iâ€™m reading and I strongly recommend it is Complex PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving.
Book by Pete Walker
