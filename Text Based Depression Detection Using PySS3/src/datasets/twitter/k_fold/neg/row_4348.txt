HiHello I don't know how to type this but it I'll try. So I'm 14M (turning 15 in Feb) and I have a bad problem with telling my family that I Want To kill myself, I Want help but I just can't do it. Back in September I tried to talk about my Anxiety problems and was about to see a Psychologist in November but I ended up bailing on it. 

After all that I felt better but in late December My depression and anxiety came back, idk if this just me but my depression comes in waves like, ill be fine then out of no where I'll be in pits of hell for months and I can't fucking bear it. So anyways it's back and Idk what to do, I Want to get a whole bunch of opiates and OD but I can't get any. I just want the pain to go away I'm so sick of this shit I really want the help from a Psychologist so they can just dope me up on something.

P.S. Sorry for my username aswell it's stupid and offensive.
