At my worst but still trying to hold on.The heaviness is settling in. Eyelids are heavy--only sleep is wanted. Body is so heavy and achey--even the smallest movement is such considerable effort. Mind is heavy and perception is distorted. Motivation to do the simplest things is so scarce. 

Eating is a chore so Iâ€™ve lost a good amount of weight. It physically hurts to smile. My attempts end in tears. This confuses kiddo.  

Usually, before it gets too bad, it's easier to shrug it off and store it away. The past few weeks have been harder and it's only getting worse. Iâ€™m no longer able to just remain numb to ward off the sadness. Husband knows something is wrong but doesnâ€™t know how to help. Itâ€™s been over a decade of him feeling helpless. Understandably, heâ€™s about had it. 

Kiddo helps to keep me grounded so I stay away from thoughts that guide me to end the pain once and for all.  Lately, the heaviness is making it harder to be the mother I want to be for her. 

Knowing that the distortion is what's making me feel like a burden to everyone and completely worthless doesn't lighten the load.
