Going to a psych hospital: what do I tell work?I have had severe depression for years now and get suicidal urges from time to time. I have thought of going to a psych ward before but I have resisted out of both fear of the ward itself and because I had no idea what to tell work.

Now that a friend has been to a ward and has resolved my fears of the ward itself, I must ask: what do I / they tell my workplace if I am ordered to stay overnight?

I have already missed work this year due to severe depression. I have already used up all of my sick days and vacation days for days when I just had absolutely no motivation for coming in. I am frequently late for work as well and often leave early. No one has said anything directly to me but I am afraid of giving off the impression of a poor worker. Another thing is that I often lack the drive to complete the project tasks assigned to me, and just end up browsing reddit all day. I am afraid that missing a week may be the final straw to getting me fired. 

I am afraid that if I tell work that I am checking into a psychiatric hospital, that I will become the butt of jokes [the place I work isn't exactly the most tolerant company.] I'm afraid that my boss would start to treat me differently and look down at me, or perhaps even consider firing me. There are only two real reasons to go to one: a suicide attempt or a psychotic episode and neither is something that I would want my workplace to know about. I just can't work for them with everyone knowing that I was just hospitalized for having suicidal thoughts. 

So if I check into the place and it is deemed necessary to stay overnight, do they tell workplace that I am at a "psychiatric hospital?" Is there anything else that I can tell work instead? I don't know what. The whole thought just really stresses me out.
