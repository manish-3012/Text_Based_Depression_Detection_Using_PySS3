Someone help me, pleaseI need help, for like longest time Iâ€™ve been numbed by medication but Iâ€™m off it, I keep remembering the person in life, that cared for me. In their absence, I chased after someone else I barely knew, I almost feel happy but to find the new person I lost my friends, my family that cares abo it me deeply canâ€™t talk to me anymore, theyâ€™re being ripped apart. Blood is dripping down my thighs and Iâ€™m dizzy. Seeking to be free I changed someone who tried to help me. Iâ€™m feeling weak. I was doing great but now, I donâ€™t know. If anyone that knows me is reading this please donâ€™t be worried, itâ€™s me not you. Help, please.
