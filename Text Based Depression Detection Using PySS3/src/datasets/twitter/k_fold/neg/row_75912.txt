I want to disappearI just want to disappear I donâ€™t want to be on this earth anymoreðŸ˜ž, I just feel so sick and tired of feeling like I have no control over my life like Iâ€™m stuck in hell. I only have two friends but they both donâ€™t understand me and ignore me after a while. I been crying for two days straight. Everything is just a mess from my job down to my life itâ€™s just all a big waste I feel like a loser and I have nothing going for me. I just want to end it but I donâ€™t want to feel that pain of death. I think if I ended my life people would be okay with it Iâ€™m a burden anyways ðŸ˜ž
