please read this, pleaseI'm at a stage where I honestly cannot be bothered typing out a long ass message. Yet I know I still will.
Long story short I tried suicide and failed. More like my instinct took over and would not let me crash into the side barriers. I cannot explain in greater detail.
Blah blah blah after a little while at a mental hospital I am back living what you'd call normal life.
But I look back and I realise there was a reason that I was brought in that position. That reason didn't just disappear.
To whoever is reading this, let me tell you society is crumbling. Every single person (all guys) I have talked to in my grade (senior equivalent) has a strange mindset in the sense of 'look at me, I'm cool because I can insult U and call it a joke after U react, I'm gonna make racist jokes because it makes me stand out and seem edgy - I'm wayyy different from the rest of you. There's no one out there who is willing to listen to you like the good old days. Not that there were any.
It's so cliche but i often imagine what life would be like if I had a girlfriend
imagine being such a pussy that you'd have to say that.
And No this is not a post designed to get girls to dm me.
But if I had literally 1 person I could text knowing id get a text back, 1 person I could cuddle and fall asleep on, 1 person I could talk to without the fear of being judged, 1 person I could truly be myself to instead of putting on a 'cool' persona, I feel like I wouldn't do what I am going to do soon - finishing off what I never started.
