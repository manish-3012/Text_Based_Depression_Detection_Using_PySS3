I can't find reasons to liveI've been trying to find a reason to not give up of living. I'm staying still and not letting people notice it. Not even my goals are keeping me motivated anymore. 
I have wonderful siblings and I don't want to make them sad. But I'm thinking of me first.
I gotta go back to my desk at work now. Hope you guys are enjoying your day. I just needed to open up.
