Iâ€™ve been betrayed by everyone I knowIâ€™m going on 23 and have been in an embarrassing depression for the last 2 years. I havenâ€™t done anything with my life and became extremely sensitive towards others. 

During that time my social skills collapsed. I hadnâ€™t talked to people for so long. When I started reaching out again I was so nervous that I left a real cringey impression on people. 

My old friends started to think I was a freak. Theyâ€™ve called me reptilian more times than I can count. If I talk about anime or anything slightly nerdy they sigh and talk about how immature and weird I am in the third person. â€œDid you even hear what he said?â€ â€œNo I donâ€™t listen to him anymore.â€

My mom who has bipolar disorder had a really bad manic episode. I found out my old best friend who I hadnâ€™t talked to in years made her suck his dick for weed when she was out of her mind. I still donâ€™t really know what will happen with that because sheâ€™s still suffering from bipolar mania, but my uncle wants legal action and itâ€™s just a lot to think about. When I confronted my old friend, it ended in him saying I canâ€™t do anything because:
 â€œIâ€™ve been nice to you for years.â€ 

Ever since I graduated high school I feel like Iâ€™ve had zero enthusiasm. The people at my work have called me a â€œpedoâ€, taken pictures of me, all because I have no energy, donâ€™t talk, and have just become a freak. I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m so far behind my peers socially. Is there any hope? I always think about giving up.
