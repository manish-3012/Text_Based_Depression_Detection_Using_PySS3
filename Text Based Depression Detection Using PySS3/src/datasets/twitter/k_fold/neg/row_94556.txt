i canâ€™t wait for the day my parents are goneDonâ€™t get me wrong, I absolutely love my parents and i only wish them the best in their lives, but the day that theyâ€™re gone, Iâ€™m going with them. The only reason iâ€™m still alive is because I donâ€™t want to hurt them by killing myself. I have nothing going for me in my life except well... dying. Itâ€™s the only option i see for myself.
