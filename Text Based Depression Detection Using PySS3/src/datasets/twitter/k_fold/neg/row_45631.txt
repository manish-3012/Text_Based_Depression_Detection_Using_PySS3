titles SMHWho am I? What do I like ? what do I dislike ? what do I want ?

I cant seem to have any answers to any of this I cant tell if I like something or not , I cant tell if I want something or not , I cant tell what would be my normal reaction to something and always try to react with the way im supposed to depending on the person 

I laugh at everything and anything, I dont wanna do anything apart from maybe hearing music and Stilll I dont even know what music I want to hear since I can bring my self to liking and listening anything any genre 

I have over 5k hours in a game I dont know if  I enjoyed it or not , that could have been any other game but for some reason I ended up with this one 

I confesed to a girl that I like her and got rejected (it didnt change out relationship as friend ) after 2 weeks 

she told me that she changed her mind and that she likes me too 

Who does she like ? me the person that I was trying to be ? whose answers depends on each different person just to please them ? I'm doing and acting in ways I usually dont , Is this still me ? Or am I changing just to please her ? But I would do that with anyone who would speak ? So who the hell am i ? someone trying to please everyone but has no idea what he likes or enjoys or likes ?

I know I sound pathetic and im just a moron teenager thats just speaking shit 

But I usually fight my depression is that I just wait it out till it gets better ,thinking its just a phase and I will laugh at things I love soon enough as I did before ,But I cant do that anymore if I Dont know what I like Or even knowing if the feeling I had of enjoying stuff before was genuine Or just me pretending or trying to please other .
