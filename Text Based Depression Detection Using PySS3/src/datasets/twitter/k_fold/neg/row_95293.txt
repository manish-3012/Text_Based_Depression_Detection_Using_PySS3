I feel like I'm in hellI tried to kill myself back in 2016. I came very close but unfortunately I was taken to the hospital before I died. I'm pretty sure I went into cardiac arrest at some point because I remember having a sticky residue and missing hair on my chest in places where an AED would be hooked up, not sure my parents refused to give me the details. All I know is I went to be Sunday and woke up 3 days later in the ICU.

Everyone always told me that things would get better. That this was only temporary. I'll thank everyone who saved my life eventually. They were wrong. 4 years later and I'm worse off than I was before. I want to die now more than ever but I only haven't tried it again because I don't have a good way of going about it right now. I don't want to be locked up in a mental hospital for months on end again. I don't want to be put on mind numbing drug cocktails again. I just want for everything to be over. To finally put my mind at ease and my soul at rest. 

I'm not much of a religious man but some times I think I really did die that day. I died and this is my personal hell. Watching my life fall to shambles as I sit here helplessly, hoping one day things will finally turn around but they won't. I resent everyone who saved me. I resent my parents for disturbing such a rare opportunity for a peaceful death. I resent the paramedics that took me away from where should have been my place of rest. I resent the doctors that kept me alive against my will. I resent this society that thinks we shouldn't be entitled to our own lives.
