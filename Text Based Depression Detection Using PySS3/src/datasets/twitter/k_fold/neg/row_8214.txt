The Saga of Me Whining on the Internet ; Part ThreeI told my best friend my plan.

Well I inferred my plan lol didnâ€™t give him the specifics. I feel like if he didnâ€™t have my car I probably wouldâ€™ve gone through with it by now, but he has my only mode of transportation.

At 3 am he sent me a lengthy message of how he wants to see me grow...

How he wants me to keep fighting..

But the thing is - I just donâ€™t fucking want to anymore lmao

Why should I keep fighting? So I can sit alone on more countless nights thinking about how Iâ€™m just plain not good enough for him to be with? Lmao Iâ€™ll pass.

Sometimes I truly think he only tells me he loves me because he knows Iâ€™ll stay if he does.

But I canâ€™t tell if thatâ€™s reality    
Or my bpd

Tonightâ€™s her birthday... the thoughts running through my mind are truly disrespectful and itâ€™s so much easier to turn them towards myself than to battle with the guilt of flinging insults at my imaginary version of her.

I counted my pills last night as I got my dose ready. 16. Tonight will make 15. Monday will Mark me at 12. At the dosage each pill is I believe it will be enough to either effectively take me out, or at the very least do so much internal damage that it isnâ€™t feasible to keep me alive. 

My boyfriend has no idea what my plan is. Iâ€™ve only told this void really...

Honestly I am afraid.. Iâ€™m really afraid it will hurt.. but Iâ€™m more afraid of trying to get to tomorrow. Iâ€™m so tired trying to get to tomorrow. Iâ€™ve been getting told itâ€™ll get better for two solid decades now and I just... I canâ€™t do it anymore I canâ€™t. 

Iâ€™m tired. And Iâ€™m not a good person. And I donâ€™t contribute anything to anyone. 

On Sunday Iâ€™m taking my best friend to the airport because he travels for work and has to leave town again.

On Monday Iâ€™m gonna drive to south mountain and take 12 prescription pills of 100mg quetiapine.

Iâ€™m scared I think..
