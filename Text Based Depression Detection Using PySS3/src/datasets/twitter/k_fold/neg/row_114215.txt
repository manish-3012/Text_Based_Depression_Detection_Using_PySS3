I believe I am sociopathic or a-socialRecently I've been incredibly conflicted. I'm lonely but have no interest in people at the same time. I have an SO but I haven't seen her in months due to me being in school. Even if she were here idk how I would feel because right now she's just words and a voice on my phone. I believe I'm going to be in a constant state of poverty because my major is worthless and I am unable to create a reliable social network for work after school.

I am logically trying to figure out my options but for each one I come up with I either need friends or money, I have neither. Slowly but surely my options are narrowing down back to suicide.
