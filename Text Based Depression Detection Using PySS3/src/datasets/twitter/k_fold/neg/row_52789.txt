Humble Request for Assistance.I wonder what one could do when you confide about the people closest to you and their first response isn't "Are you doing well?" or "Are you OK?", but rather " How could you be so selfish?", " Don't you know that everyone loves you", "That's just a phase, because you're still young", "Shame on you leaving people that care about you"," I don't want anything to do with you anymore".

It stands to reason that while most don't know how to react to such news, they are "trying" in their own ways to "help". I don't hate them or particularly have any negative emotions towards them, they're just uneducated in that aspect.

Thus, I ask of you, a community anons that one would assume lived through all sides of reaching for external help. What would you do, when family and friends don't understand and don't want to understand because they see you as an anomaly?

Moreover, professional help isn't easy to come by in this country since it is still seen as frowned up and only accessible to people who have a lot of money.
