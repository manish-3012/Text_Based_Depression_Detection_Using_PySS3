I'm currently on watch over my fiancÃ©e, it's rough but I know we will get through itTitle says it all. Partner has suffered for a long time with severe depression and made numerous attempts. She has been working hard and the distance between them has gotten more and more as time goes by. Currently had to call into both our works today to let them know we wouldn't be in and we started cleaning as we find it helps her during the impulses.

Guesd I'm writing because she just found her meds she got me to pick up and told me to do a sweep and hide them all. While doing it got me wondering, should I hide the hayfever tablets? She has never attempted an od on them just painkillers and her meds, but we have a bunch for me and the cat (pet allergies are a thing).

I guess I'm just trying to get the emotions out rather than let them build up. It's horrible to see the person you love most suffer, and I'm so proud of how far she and I have came. She has motivated me so much to be better I only wish I could do a tenth for her of what she dose for me.
