I'm so tired.I'm so tired of feeling. I'm so tired of the noise. I'm so tired of having to live. I'm so tired. I just want to go to sleep, forever. It's all too much for me, I can't cope. My mind brings up these terrible, gruesome thoughts; different, brutal ways of murdering myself, all of the time. It's all I ever think about anymore. Depression has BECOME my personality. My jokes are depressed, my preferences are depressed, everything I make is depressing. I can't for the life of me find a reason to live. I don't think everyone was meant to live. I've come here before, made pseudo-pity-friends who left after a few days, gotten advice I've never used, and stayed in the exact same state. I don't have the motivation to fix myself. So where the hell do I go now? Is there even a way I could get better, now that I don't even want to? I feel like suicide is my only way out, but I'm too scared to go through with it. I'm always thinking about it, planning it, but never acting on it. I don't know if that's a blessing or a curse, I'm trapped here suffering, what the fuck did I do wrong?
