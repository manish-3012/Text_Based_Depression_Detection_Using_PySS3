RevelationMy whole life I was from in telling my family that I had no desire for kids or a wife. And I thought i it was a simple as that. Always felt suicidal but never thought it connected. Recently had the revelation that the reason I donâ€™t want kids or a wife is because of the fear that one day I might actually go thru with  it and leave them behind. And that would be the worst thing I could do. Hit me like a house of bricks :/
