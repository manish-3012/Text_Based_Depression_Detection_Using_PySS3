It's almost going to be a full year....Man I hate December. I keep trying to convince myself that things are different now. I'm a changed person, but it's all a lie. Yeah, what's around me has changed but I'm still the same. Ending it all seems like a great escape because it's just too much. My head hurts and it's getting too complicated and I just want to sleep eternally now. Please, this hurts so much now.
