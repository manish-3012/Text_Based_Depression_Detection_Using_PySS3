Looking for someone to share the painI'm not necessarily suicidal right now.. I have wanted to in the past and I probably will want to again.. but I just want someone to talk to I guess. I'm tired of crying alone every night and I often wonder why I bother continuing on with my life when I've screwed up so badly.
