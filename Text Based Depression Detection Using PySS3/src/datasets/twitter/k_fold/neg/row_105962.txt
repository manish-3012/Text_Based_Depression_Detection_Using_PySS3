The toll alienation can take...I have made great strides in my life considering im on the autism spectrum (or aspergers). I got my drivers license at 19, got my first job stable job at 21. And now at 24 (will be 25 this month) i'm a substitute working towards being a full time paraeducator and even taking my last class at community college to transfer to state. My goal is to become a special education teacher.

BUT...the one thing I cant seem to escape is the  lonliness and constant aching feeling of alienation that comes with being on the spectrum. I know i sound like a pretentous asshole but I really have felt like an alien all my life. This sheer feeling of "constant disconnect" after 25 years can take a toll on you physically and mentally. I also suffer from major depression, and OCD and am taking Paxil and Welbutrin to help.

People generally find me annoying or offputting either cause they misunderstand me and or find me awkward. Or maybe im just annoying. Its gotten just easier for me to internally call myself an annoying piece of shit. Its hard to explain but at least saying that internally makes me feel "socially" in control...like i'm on the same page "everyone" else is...like "at least i'm aware why people dont like me."

Obviously never been in a relationship and have had very few friends in my life, although the few that I do either treat me like an invalid or like a side piece to be laughed at or mocked.

I have parents and siblings who love me...so thats what keeps me around...but really thats about it. Im 25 and I feel like a 40 year old man at this rate...
