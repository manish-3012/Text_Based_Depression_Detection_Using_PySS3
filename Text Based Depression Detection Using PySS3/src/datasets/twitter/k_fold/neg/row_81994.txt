Help.... please. I don't want to die.Before I start here is some basic context. I am 28 years old male. I live in California at home with family. 

I am not here to mope. I am not here to complain incessantly about my current circumstance and I understand that context is needed for full understanding. But I have these conflicting issues of what I am allowed to share, what I should share, and what is appropriate. My concerns are that what I want to say will be taken lightly, or less seriously, or just contrived emotions, dramatics,or instability.

**I suffer from Complex PTSD.** I am a child abuse survivor. I grew up in a home that damaged me not only physically but psychologically as well. I went to therapy seeked medical advice, take medication and evaluate myself so critically with attempts at objectiveness to prevent biased remarks or unclear evaluations.

**I don't feel like I am being taken seriously.** Or how severe my circumstances are. I am actually quite lucky in terms of living situation but in terms of mental health I am at my limit. Most of the time people tell me to suck it up or tell me it will get better with time. But I see all this coddling in current generation and how things are and my circumstance and it drives me mad with frustration.

I have a lot to say I guess about what I can and cant control and finding resources to get out of this situation. And its terrifying for me to open up which is why this is a throw away account.

**I don't feel confident or capable like I used to be.**

I know I am rambling and avoiding directness but I don't know how to convey all the information clearly and concisely with all the context and information. But I will try.

I was born in California in a nice home in the suburbs. Went to school, and pursued a career in the arts, specifically design. My childhood was raised by Filipino Grandmother with abusive parenting and manipulation of guilt, shame, tradition, obligation, and control. **I grew up in a household where if I didn't cut my nails then nail polish remover was jammed down my throat.** I grew up being fearful of expression and opinion. Especially as I got older and had grow and be an adult about my circumstances. My Grandma didn't want us to end up like my mom so she decided to toughen us up. **See the thing about my Mom is she is a Vagrant drug addict living on the streets.**

She still asks me for money when she sees me and its just depressing. I grew up in a dysfunctional home.

I get that we all have dysfunctions and that everyone has issues. **But I am sick of people devaluing my situation or circumstance telling me to suck it up. I did. I grew from it. I had terrible relationships. I've made plenty of mistakes. I know I am not perfect.**

I lived on my own and went to therapy and was in a psych ward multiple times. What I learned from mental hospitalization is that its a process, its not compassion, its a business, I felt like a cow on a conveyer-belt. Take your medication, write your inadequaces, talk about your deficiencies... **The thing is I want to feel worth it. I want to be more than I am. I always had dreams of being something better, something greater. In fact when I got kicked out of my home the first time I built my life up, became confident, charismatic, charming.**

**I felt in control of my life. I felt strong. Maybe it was my antidepressants finally kicking in. But I felt like a dreamer. I felt like I could share my opinions without fear or judgement. I felt like I could express and be treated intellectually and not like a mental head case.**

Regardless, I lost everything due to toxic failed relationships, terrible mistakes, and self destructive tendencies. I lost my job, crashed my car multiple times. I know I fucked up. I beat myself up everyday. And thats the thing...

My sister... We both grew up in the same environment. But we came out completely different. We lived in a home where traditional toxic mindsets have been ingrained into our subculture. My Sister was rebellious and aggresive. I was submissive and timid. We lived in a home where our grandparents raised us because our mother was a drug addict. I was raised in a house with mainly women. My sisters and grandma. Grandfather was always overseas due to work. And Toxic Masculinity was the go to. The man was expected to do everything. The man had to be strong. I wasn't allowed to cry. And I was beaten and abused harder than my sisters. Feeling guilty about what I do. Example being that if I try to be helpful at a friends I am a shithead for not helping at home. If I don't help then I am a shithead for not being a good guess. A lot of the time I just get put in these lose lose situations. And even my sister has come up to me and apologized to me for her aggressive manipulative, vindictive, behavior. See I am a pretty effeminate male. And I feel like I can't be myself. I have to be what society tells me. And I am always drained and lacking energy. The only way I can get around to work is to take my antidepressants to just function. Although I have constant anxiety attacks and have failed at home. 

My sister is diagnosed Bipolar. She likes to take out her frustrations on me and my younger sister. She is a Nihilist, she likes to enforce her opinions and is very vengeful and spiteful when people attack or treat her unfairly. Like my Grandfather she has a temper about a lot of things. Unlike my grandfather which I try to understand and respect because he comes from an older generation and although his views are no longer up to date it doesn't mean hes bad. My sister on the other hand guilted me 2 years for when my grandmother had cancer and I avoided her. But now that 5 years have passed since her death she talks about how terrible a parent she was and how she was bad for us and how she hurt me more than anyone else. See the whole reason I have this feeling of hopelessness and weakness is that my sister likes to push my buttons. Push my limit. Shes left me on the street after her BF broke my jaw. She has won my trust many time again where I felt like we could talk to eachother and have heart to hearts and she told me she understands why I am why I am and how she doesnt want to be mad about things that wont matter 5 years from not. She finally gave me the validation of letting me know she didnt think I was unintelligent. And like every other time and with family I let her in only for her to manipulate and tell me how I mooch off the family at home and I don't give any help to the family.

For the finaly bit of context I will explain why what she says bothers me and breaks me down to the point of suicide. See I failed a lot. I lost multiple jobs, and wrecked my car and have been in a lengthy yearly process of trying to repair myself. Fix myself. Think of myself as less than scum. **I spend so much time trying to convince myself that I am worth it. That I am not scum. That in a nihilistic philosophical sense we make our own lives and decide what to do with it. That even if life is supposively pointless that we are in it, we exist in it and we control it to an extent of what we want to do.** And its one thing to try and fix yourself. Its another when you don't have a support system. I like to be expressive. I like to like what I like whether its popular, unpopular, not a click, not a hipster because no one else does but just things I like. I take from everything i enjoy.**I wanted to be a Polymath.** A creative, I had good grades, was in advance learning, I used to write and draw, I used to do a lot of things. I had goals and dreams. **I wanted to do it all. Animation, film, music, dance, acting, modeling, special fx, cinematography, Martial arts, cosplay, fashion design, make music videos, just art.... Art, expression, creativity, making things that convey emotion and understanding, convey expression, create ideas and dreams, like how comic books have influenced science, or even films influencing with concepts and symbolism, how science fiction dictated science. At one point i felt like I could do it. I could do more. I felt like I was good at multitasking, that I was good at a lot of things.**

Now the whole multitasking was a false myth. How it decreases productivity and IQ. Now I see all the failures, all the mistakes. All my friends live far away either out of state or whatever. I've become this rushing recluse who has become socially awkward and scattered. **I am sure I am missing more context as well.**

See where I am at now. I lost my last job due to a mental breakdown at work and other sucidal tendencies. Feeling behind, and inadequate. I have a new job and I try to avoid going to work when I have meltdowns. I try to avoid my family and try to help then when I have money but I am just trying to get out of my own hole.

I do have a couple vices that I hold on to just for sanity and I know its not healthy but I feel like I am living on a limb. Before all this I was constantly fatigued as if I was a narcoleptic. I know a lot of it is because I have issues sleeping and overwhelmed with stress and stuff. I smoke pot a lot and have a legal medical card as it helps me with stress and eating. See... I don't know if its from the trauma or abuse or self neglect as I have terrible self care skills but I have IBS, Gastritis, and ulcers. I smoke because it helps me with creativity, it helps me eat and it helps relax me... My sister holds it over my head calling me the same druggie my mom is although shes asked me to smoke her out and she used to smoke as well. I take Cymbalta and its finally starting to give me the energy I need to function during the day although I am still behind at the marketing company I work at... (which is great I have a job and I am not shitting on it but its not exactly my cup of tea, I hate selling things I dont have interest in. I hate bullshitting people) I crave authenticity but feel ashamed of my lack of it due to conforming in a society that is based on clicks, and selective judgements, with egocentric biases, or group biases. See I don't belong anywhere. I tend to hang out with friends who are crazy out there, friends who are healthy, A lot of goth people I hang out wiht share my similar interests but I dont share the fuck the world mindset or the whole idea of fighting back aggresively.

My last personal vice that I haven't shared with anyone is that I have been microdosing Adderall to function at work and not fall asleep at work. I microdose smoking pot during my lunch break too... What scares me is that Adderall makes me feel confident and in control like I used to feel several years ago. And I know its not healthy to do that. And I know I am trying to take better care of myself. But its hard doing it alone. I know no one is going to do it for me either and I dont expect them to... I know my mother has had an addictive personality and I dont want to be a drug addict like her either. But these things help me.

**I am not expecting my family to change or the world to change for me. I am just a futurist that believes in human potential. I am surrounded by nihilists here and I am the only person in my vicinity that believes in success or existentialism or potential or a future. Although whenever I mention these things its cheesy or cliche, or stupid.**

**The thing is I am not trying to find a bunch of people who just agree to agree either. I just crave authenticity. I am an ENFP if anyone is into that stuff. Not like personality types are the full indicator of who you are and they aren't set in stone.**

I just want to preface this with the fact that I am sure I have typos, or things that aren't clear, or clumsy, or sloppy. Please don't bite my head off. Please don't evaluate it as me being crazy. I just miss things in the process of scrambling to think it all out or write it down without feeling like I am in a constant state of rush. I have all this fear killing me. It kills me at work feeling afraid like I am not wanted there or thought of as weak. And I know I shouldnt care what people think. Its just that I have been ostracized and awkward or outcasted when I have no one else to turn to especially when I do become emotional and unstable and push people away. I have had borderline symptoms and experiences. But that doesn't dictate who I am. I know I can be a lot and I try to stay reserved and polite. But some days I explode. and I am sorry for that. I just want people to look at my thoughts as thoughts and not irrational emotions or crazy ideas that no one respects. I get expressive an emotional not because I am just emotional but I have a lot to convey and express and there are things I don't understand that I try to interpret or frustrate me.

Regardless of what you take from this long winded post... My thing is. I am trying to build my life together. I am trying to be independent. I am trying to take care of myself and not feel weak and hopeless. But I feel compassion is gone and i am alone. Therapy and psychology I have gone and looked into but I have issues expressing all my issues to my medical therapist and psychologist. I told them that I smoked pot and they told me how terrible it was and to not do it. I have the lowest level of medical which is Medi-Cal here in Cali. Which I am grateful its free of course but without reliable transportation(i am saving up to fix my car) it makes it very difficult to do that. Let alone purchase and provide food for myself(i tend to not eat and tighten my belt until payday. I know a lot of it is regulating priorities and I am trying to be better at it but its difficult doing it alone. And I don't want to take help from my family without with fear of obligation or guilt that they will uses anything i have used as a resource against me. (especially food). I used to have food stamps but I no longer qualify at my current income (I have been spending my income paying debts back and trying to fix stuff. I just finished paying for my laptop.)

I think I have a lot of analysis paralysis that has built up after my past failures. And in no way am I saying that I am not at fault either. I just want help and I don't know how to get it without judgement, fear, lack of control, or compassion. I want to feel like I am wanted or not a waste of space. I know you need to love yourself first and I am trying but I look back and think it too late. I am 28 and I wasted my life being bed ridden due to depression for 3 years and now its happening again where I wasted my life with depression, lack of energy from lack of food and trying to stay in my corner of the world to avoid confrontation. **I am not a coward. I am just tired....** I just think my dreams are so outlandish and so unrealistic but for some reason i want to believe in them. Even if its illogical. I felt like I was talented. I felt like I was good at talking to people. But here I am now all by myself at work rushing through this message trying not to look more ridiculously irrational to my coworkers while trying not to get fired.

**TL;DR** Someone please help me get out of this. Help me find a way into a better life. I have no support system, my friends are all out of country or out of state, and all i feel is helpless and pathetic. I dont need someone to do everything for me. I just want to feel like i used to. I want to feel like I did before. Where I felt successful. Where i started as a packager at a design company because I had no experience and i learned the ins and outs of the company. Even in the company I am in now. Although I miss work a lot they depend on me so much and its probably why I havent been fired... I basically do a little bit of everything at the company from production to consultation to design and marketing. I just hate selling because its selling marketing for real estate agents. I just need a direction or some kind of support please. Otherwise I am going to kill myself because I don't know what to do anymore.

**Its not about dramaticism, or emotionalness. Its about tolerance and a limit that has been far surpassed.** Its about finding peace or an escape. I don't want to die because I want attention and don't know how to get it, I don't want to die to get back at someone, I don't want to die because life isn't fair. I feel like dying because I feel like there is no where safe to go. I don't feel safe at home. I don't feel safe at work. And I don't feel safe in a psych ward or anywhere else. My mental sanity is at its limit... Please.
