I'm starting to get sure that I really should do it.(I'm not a native speaker, m/17)
I think about comitting suicide for months now.
I've seen a psychiatrist but he didn't help me at all. The opposite is the case, he told me how intelligent I am for my age and how much I will reach in the future. He talked so positive about me. In my view, the opposite is the case. He put even more pressure on me. I know that I'm way more intellectual than other people of my age, but that's not important at all. 
The thing is, I suck at school, I never learn and I don't pay attention during the lessons. I never did, not even 5 years ago. My grades are really bad and I won't finish school. Since I can think I want to become self employed, I already made a lot of money with online trade last year but I don't know if it will be as easy in the future as it was till now.
Another reason to finally kill myself is that I am antisocial af. I hate people, I get bored of people very, very quickly. I am very aggressive and violent too. Pretty sure I have some kind of ASPD, I don't know. I can't remember that I ever felt empathy for someone. I love to see people suffer and have extreme torture, rape and kill fantasies. I don't get off to normal sex. All together, my psychiatrist called me very complex and extreme.
To end my life is the best thing I could imagine to do. I see only pain and annoying things, things I'm not able to do. I really want it. I want it all the time. Half a year ago I knew that I would do it one day but it wasn't urgent. Now, since 2-3 months I want it really badly every, or every second day. I can't live like this any longer. To not exist sounds great.
(I am atheistic and I think that our mind, self conciousness, dies with the physical death. It's impossible to imagine how 'to not exist' feels)
