Turning 28 today...About a month ago I planned everything for my third and final attempt. Had access to preferred way out, planned my last meal and drink, had letters written, the whole enchilada. 

Then I got sick. Pneumonia, bad. Was bedridden most of Christmas and throughout New Years. My chest still hurts, but Iâ€™m here...I guess. 

Really wish I werenâ€™t. Been putting up a face since Christmas. Everyone thinks Iâ€™m happy but Iâ€™m still dreading the future and present. 

Happy Birthday to me ðŸŽ‰
