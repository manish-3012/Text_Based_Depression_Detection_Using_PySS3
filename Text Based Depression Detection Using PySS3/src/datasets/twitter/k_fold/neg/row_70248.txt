I want to rest.I'm never able to relax. To rest. I don't feel loved and cared for. I'd die for some affection. I'm always standing through all the shit and I feel alone. I feel tired. I want to die. I wish i was loved. I wish i had affection. Intimacy. He doesn't love me like i do. I want marriage. I love him. I love him. He doesntlove me like I do. I want to die. I'm not fitting there. I'm just harmful and crazy. I'll never get a normal life. Going back home to the one I love. I have no home anyway. Nowhere to go back to, nowhere I can hope to reach soon. No purpose. I want to die.
