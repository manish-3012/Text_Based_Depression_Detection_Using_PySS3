I'm ready to goEach day is less and less worth living through. I'm so poor that I try to sleep and conserve energy so I don't have to eat. I have a bachelor's and masters degree, I've been seeking employment since 2011, but all I've found is a way out. The doctors gave me triazadone and fluoxatine last year for depression. Health insurance is gone. Haven't had meds for two months and I've never been so confident that death is the right choice. 
Thanks reddit, for making the meantime entertaining.
