I want to kill myself because nobody understands meI want to die because no one has any empathy for people like me. They just see me as inferior trash and think it's all my fault and blame me for everything. And people wonder why I am the way I am. So I'm just gonna kill myself tonight because nobody get it. They have no idea what it's like to be in my shoes.
