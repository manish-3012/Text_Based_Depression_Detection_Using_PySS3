What do I choose?I feel suicidal and I'm at work (2:35am). In this place there are both drugs and a doctor. Do I take all the drugs from the pharmacy to end up my miserable life, or do I wake up that poor guy, knowing I'll annoy him and that tomorrow I will feel like this again? Because suicide seems the rightful answer to me right now.
I just don't wanna feel like this anymore.
