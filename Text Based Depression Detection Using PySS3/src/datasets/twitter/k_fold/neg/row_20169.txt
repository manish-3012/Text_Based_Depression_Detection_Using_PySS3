Has this happened to anyone elseI've never thought about suicide before. I've always been depressed for as long as I can remember though. Now these past two days I've been home alone with the flu. Now it might just be from being alone for two days but all of a sudden, everything in my life hit me. My ex of 3 months is doing great, and I'm just now realizing I'm not over her. I have no real friends to talk to except for my mom because she's also suffered from depression. And most of all I just have this feeling eating away at me that none of this fucking matters. No one's gonna remember me in 100 years anyways, and my life has no significant impact on the world. Some really existential crisis-y shit. So here I am still in my boots, jacket and hat, with a gun in hand, my mind still a blur. I know I won't do it, I cant. The main thing keeping me from it is that I can't put my family through it. So has anyone else had this sudden urge.. like you lose all hope and care for a good hour or so, and it almost takes your life?
