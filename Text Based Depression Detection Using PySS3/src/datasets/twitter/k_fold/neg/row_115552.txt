I feel like a burden to those around me.Obviously I'm asking for help because I don't want to die, at least not yet.  Happiness seems impossible.  This is nothing new of course, I have my bad days and worse days.  Today I spotted a nice spot to secure a rope.  

I have social anxiety.  I am under no medication.  I can't stand to be around 3+ people at one time, especially if I don't know them.  I recently learned that my uncle, with whom I am staying with, has been badmouthing me to others.  I've lived with many fake friends in the last year since I've been unemployed.  All contact has been severed with them, as I don't do drugs anymore.  I deleted all my social accounts a month ago, trying to ignore what I've lost.  I'm in a new area, and I don't know anyone here.  Being called worthless is one of the worst feelings in the world, especially when its by someone you look up to.
