What do you do when you genuinely want to die?It just hit me so hard today. I donâ€™t know if I would classify myself as a depressed person, Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with â€œmajor depressionâ€ and â€œpanic anxiety disorderâ€ but I donâ€™t know how much of it I believe because it was a general practitioner and not a doctor who specifically deals in behavioral health. 
I think I have a lot going for me in life. I work a decent job at a nursing home and am finishing school to become an lvn (a little late because Iâ€™m 27). I have my own car that I paid for, my own place that I pay for, and donâ€™t often need help for money unless Iâ€™m sick (I have Crohnâ€™s disease) and need a little help. I still feel like a loser. Iâ€™m on probation for possession of marijuana and was using up to my sentencing for my pain and nausea (the end of December) and at my first meeting (early February) I failed a test. I canâ€™t believe Iâ€™m this worthless. My mom always has so many nice things to say about my brothers (one is older and in japan running his own business and the younger one is moving up in the UPS world) and my niece is getting into the nuclear program in the navy. What am i? Just a loser who canâ€™t even get probation right. I didnâ€™t try to mess up, I really didnâ€™t. I made over the amount due to pay starting, went to all my classes, went to all my meetings. It came to me that dying and getting out of everyoneâ€™s way would be so much easier.
