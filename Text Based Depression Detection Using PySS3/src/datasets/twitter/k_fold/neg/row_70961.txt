Please tell me it will be alright in the end.days bleed into one and the nights are the hardest. i have so many problems and these are things i cant control. feel hopeless most of the time and when the shit hits the roof i dont know if i will be able to handle it and just thought i might as well end it before someone else makes the decision for me. i just dont want to feel alone in my troubles for once. i know noone can really help me but i just wanted consolation before the shit hits the roof and i end it anyway. i have wept enough for a lifetime. i dont want to cry for someone else all the time. i dont want to cry for myself all the time. i fear for others so much it cripples me. it is not selfless though. either way misery is all i get.
