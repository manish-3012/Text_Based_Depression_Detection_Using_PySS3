Tylenol extra strength: two bottles, one girl.Iâ€™m new here. Iâ€™ve been reading posts and comments in the community and words canâ€™t express how painfully relatable my experience is to all of yours. 

Iâ€™ve contemplated suicide more times than I can count, but only attempted it twice. The cops found me and I was hospitalized before  I could inflict any harm on myself.

Honestly, my life has been a fucking rollercoaster since day one. The highs are so high and the lows are so unbearably low. I definitely struggle with mental illness. Iâ€™ve tried medication and have been in and out of therapy for years but then I quit when I think Iâ€™ve â€œfigured it out.â€ Before the actual work of healing can begin.
