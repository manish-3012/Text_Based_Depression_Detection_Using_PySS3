Trapped inside all day because of COVID-19. I have no vices left, no money, no hopeThis virus has really amplified my depression and I'm spiraling. I live a few miles from that Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, WA where like 20 people died so I really do feel trapped! I don't care if I get sick, it's the older people like my parents and neighbors that I'm worried about infecting. No end in sight, except my own.

I've been so tempted to self-harm and starve myself to feel like I have control or power over my situation, but I've been pretty "clean" from that for over a year. So idk.

I really need a pack of cigarettes and some vodka and weed. I feel like I'm a walking corpse, and I think it's going to be like this for months unless I do something. I was already at the end of my rope before this Coronavirus shit started. My family doesn't care about me, my friends don't talk to me anymore. I have nothing. I really don't mean to mope but it's true.

Anyway, stay safe people.
