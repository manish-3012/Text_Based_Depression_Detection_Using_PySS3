I think I'm at peace with it.I've felt depressed my whole life, and my thoughts have always been dark and suicidal like I wanna hurt and end it all cought in a web of terrible emotions. I would feel bad for feeling this way but I think I have made my peace with it, not with life but with the fact that one day I will kill myself I'm not sure when but unless some freak accident I'm sure of it. I wonder if my father felt the same way before his. I'm trying to hold off a little while for my kids sake but I am worried if this curse is in them as well... I hope not.
