I can't do it.I was born and raised into a very fortunate family. I have two loving parents, a brother who needs me far more than I need him, and a fund from my late grandparents that will put me through college.

But I'm a monster.

I'm a pedophile. Not from any discernable source, just myself. After years of therapy (my parents and their insurance have been told it's depression,) I still am the same beast. Castration is extremely expensive, and not covered under my insurance, so thus far it's a no-go.

But I can't off myself., I owe my parents a productive life, for all the resources they've poured into me. I owe my brother nothing, but I have to help him; he's my brother.

But I'm at a loss as to what to do with myself. There are so many debts I can't filch on, but I'm among the worst category of human. (and no, if you defend pedophilia, you deserve to be downvoted and set ablaze.)

Just... What do I do?
