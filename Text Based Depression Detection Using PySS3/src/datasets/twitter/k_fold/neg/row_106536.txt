It's hard to know who to talk to because it's not even a crisis anymore. This is just how I existIt's not really fitting for me to call the Samaritans or other crisis resolution phone lines because I'm not in a heightened state of emotion, I'm not reacting extremely, I just constantly want to die and can't be convinced that it's worth living. I know I have the power to fix myself, it's within my control, but I'm so fucking lazy and self destructive that I even when handed the opportunity on a silver platter I just reject it outright. There's no definitive good or bad decision on me killing myself, it's just a variety of opinions and it seems that no matter who I talk to I just come away angry, frustrated and sad.
