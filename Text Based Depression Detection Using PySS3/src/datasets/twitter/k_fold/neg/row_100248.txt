well... it was bound to happen**update**: I spoke to a VA counselor and am very grateful for all your encouraging words. But as I don't hide from my past I'm leaving the post below.

...

So, I realize that you don't know me, but I have no one to talk to and I hurt soooo much right now. I'm hyperventilating and my heart is sunk down deep in my chest to the point where it hurts. Literally heart broken. I keep picking up the knife and putting it back down. There are marks all across my wrist. Superficial blood. I know I'm stronger than what I used to be, but this blow took the breath right out of me.

I just found out the only man I have loved got married. 

2 years ago, I left active duty navy and moved into the middle of nowhere, VA. I realized that I wouldn't be able to maintain a LDR with my boyfriend, Danny (at that point we had been together for 5 years) . I told him and we agreed to separate. No bad feelings. I visited every couple of months.
 
After 6 months, I landed a job in Columbus, OH and moved out here. He is still in the Navy and deployed. So the visits dwindled down. I saw him in October of 2010 when his father died. Then again in June of 2011 when I went to visit my mom and aunts in VA. He informed me that he had met someone new. Then there was radio silence. He stopped speaking to me completely.  So for almost a year, I have heard nothing from him. I periodically look on facebook. I see pictures of him and his new gf. A few months ago, I find out he brought her with him when he moved to South Korea for the Navy. That was a really hard pill to swallow. I had no idea how serious it had gotten so quickly. 

The last two weeks have been phenomenally shitty for me. I had work issues arise that threatened to end my job completely. I ended a brief short term relationship with a guy because I wasn't ready to be serious. My dogs got into some sort of poison and I have to keep a close eye on them. 

So I'm up here, alone in my house with this huge shitty piece of news that the only man I have ever loved truly deeply madly has found someone to spend the rest of his life with while I'm 28 years old single woman with no friends or family anywhere nearby that can talk me through this extremely emotional time.

Danny was my rock and cornerstone of my life for 6.5 years. We lived together for 4.5 years in Charleston and Norfolk. I saw him graduate and he saw me graduate from college. He would always listen and have the best advice. He shared so much. I love him with all my heart. He saw me through a two year bout of depression. From the moment I met him, I told my brother (who introduced us) that he was too far out my league. He is independent, articulate, handsome, educated, strong, and loving. And now he is committed to someone else. 

I believed deep down in my heart that when his time in the Navy was over, he'd be free to move and come be with me again. I still have the last voicemail message he left me that says "You are the most important person in my life." He left it after his father died.

In the two years since we broke up, I have dated 3 guys and gone out with around 25 other guys. Not a single one ever came remotely close. 

So r/suicidewatch, help me believe that I can love again. That this isn't reason enough to end it. Because right now I have nothing that I can see worth living for.
