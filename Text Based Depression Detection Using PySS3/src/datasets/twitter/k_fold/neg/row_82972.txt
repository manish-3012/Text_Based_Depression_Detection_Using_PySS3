It's not that no one caresI've been starting to accept the fact that my life isn't going to get any better. A large part of me wants to quietly disappear. The problem is not that I think people just won't care. I know I'm very well loved and I know many people, people that don't even know me, would be distraught. It would hurt my family more than I can imagine. 

I don't think I'd like to kill myself any time soon. The curiosity of what life might have in store slightly overpowers my realization that there probably isn't much more for me. 

I guess I'm mostly scared of hurting those around me just because I want to get out of this life so badly. I don't want to cause others any kind of pain.
