I donâ€™t want to die, but my brain tells me different.Hello. I am 25, nearly 26 years old, and Iâ€™ve had major depressive disorder and severe anxiety for a great portion of my life. I am trans as well, unable to live as myself because of familial judgement. I honest to god donâ€™t want to die, but I want things to be different. Iâ€™m trying my best to be the change I want to see, but it is a rocky road. Now, if I could just get my brain to stop defaulting to suicide when even the smallest of things happen... I know this post is dry, but I could really use some tips and support.
