I really am trying to find a reason to go on here..What is the point to living when you cant be with the person you love, in the place you love, surrounded by the people you love? What is the actual point? I can't be with any of them, in the place I love due to imigration policies beyond my control. What is the point of going on if i can't have love in my life, if i'm denied it?
