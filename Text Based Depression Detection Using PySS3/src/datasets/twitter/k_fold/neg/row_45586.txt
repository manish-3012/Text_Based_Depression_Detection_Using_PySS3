A snowball of stress is starting to crush meFor some background, I live in the  United States and am in my 12th grade, Senior in High School. I have been accepted into a local university but it feels like I can't get there.

I passed my first semester with the lowest grades I've ever gotten, and so far this semester I have multiple D's and F's. I don't know why but my drive to do things is nonexistent. I have missed so much school being sick or pretending to be sick, because i am too afraid to face the truth. My parents don't know about how I'm doing in school, and I even used inspect element to 'edit' my grades shown on the internet. Because of all the school I am missing it just keeps getting worse and worse.

It feels really stupid to be suicidal just based on what I've explained, but the thought just keeps popping into my head the thing is I don't know if I would be able to actually go through with it... It's not just a lingering thought as I also think of methods on how to do it. I'm too scared to tell my parents but I don't think I can catch up on my own... I also don't know if starting to recover in school will help.

I take ProZac daily (prescribed) so I think i should up my dosage after consulting a doctor. I just don't know how to start climbing this mountain and it seems hopeless. I feel like i've failed myself, my family, and my teachers.

I know I'm not going to kill myself today or tomorrow, but I need help preventing me from getting to that stage, as i feel i may be close.
