The only things keeping me alive are shitty short-term distractionsBooks, mostly, but also movies and music. I binged the first season if I Am Not Okay With This btw and it was wicked lmao

But what am I gonna do when Iâ€™m sick of it? When I have to face the music and deal w my problems? Even thinking abt it makes me feel sick. I have nothing left. Thereâ€™s no hope. Iâ€™m j trying to distract myself till I graduate but my therapist makes me share all my deep shit w her and she canâ€™t even help me at all w it bc itâ€™s family stuff and weâ€™re in quarantine so I wanna kms and sheâ€™s like â€œlmao sucks ripâ€ so thatâ€™s fun!

Jesus fucking Christ. Fuck this fucking quarantine.
