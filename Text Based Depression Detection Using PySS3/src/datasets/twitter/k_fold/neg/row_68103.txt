I'm definitely suicidal and I need help.Being treated to bipolar disorder for the last 10 years, I'm kinda used to feeling suicidal, so I wouldn't say I'm desperate, but I'm feeling pretty bad. When I get suicidal, I have the sensation that there's a cold blade on my pulse. I can't control it. It would really help to talk to someone. Appreciate it.
