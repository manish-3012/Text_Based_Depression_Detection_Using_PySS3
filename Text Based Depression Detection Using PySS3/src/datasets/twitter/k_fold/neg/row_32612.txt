My friend needs help and I don't know what to doMy friend is going to commit suicide tonight and I'm helpless. I honestly have no clue what to do. I've been talking to her for hours and she just won't listen to me. She keeps saying that everything will be fine in the end and won't listen to anything I say. I need advice. I need help on her behalf.
