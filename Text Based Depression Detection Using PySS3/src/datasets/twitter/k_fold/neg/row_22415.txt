I'm never going to be happy. Might as well save me the trouble of struggling, right?I'm u/suicidaldreamer and I've posted here before. Lost my password, so I'm using my main account. I'm just a simple dude from India with a dream.

It's been pretty hard to function these days. I've been depressed and suicidal in the past as well, and I don't think that part of me will ever go away, as much as I promise myself that it will everytime those spells of darkness are done with. My dream is to tell stories with the medium of comic books, film, and music. But thanks to the country I live in, fate seems to be pulling me into a profession I struggle a lot against (engineering). I work pretty harsh 12 hr shifts on alternate weeks as my 'day job'. This, and my constant state of mental torment makes me question everyday if it's worth going on. I feel like my optimism I carried as kid has completely died away. I see myself as someone who's already failed.

The universe seems to be telling me this as well, making sure that I have no place in this world. My PC, laptop, and art tools have slowly died over the past week, and I can't get out of bed. I've failed Inktober... I can't go back to a page anymore. It's also really expensive to buy pc components in India. I really don't want to go on. It's not worth it. I've never had decent friends, and loneliness is genuinely the worst thing I've ever experienced. It leaves me an empty shell who can't even weep. It causes me physical pain in the chest

I just want it all to end. I used to keep myself alive with this stupid mantra, while facing myself with an attempt - "you'll be happy". And it's very apparent that is bullshit. I've heard carbon monoxide poisoning is a pretty easy way to go. Not too messy. I'm not sure how to properly pull it off. Would like to make sure I don't come out of the attempt alive. 

Thank you.
