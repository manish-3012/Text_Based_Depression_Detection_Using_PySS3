I am a perversion of lifeNothing matters. Life/death, pleasure/pain, win/lose, love/hate are all things I used to know. I have forgone them and now I can't get them back. Everyone is deluded with purpose. I should die in order to preserve the delusion. Why should I eat food that someone else could eat? Why should I work a job that someone else could have? My life can only bring harm, it's already happened to my friends. They all turned to drugs while I was able to stay unaffected and sober. My parents have had problems coping as well. It's because I'm a perversion and I cause problems. Psychologists couldn't even diagnose me with anything so I was just prescribed pills to make me more tolerable. My life is already over, I'm just waiting to die.
