Wtf happened to meI used to be happy. Now everything just feels so fucking gray. Thatâ€™s literally the only way to describe it. Everything is dull, I feel numb, and thereâ€™s no excitement or enjoyment to anything anymore. 

I genuinely donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible for anything to make me happy :(

Iâ€™ve seen and know so much shit that bothers me as well and I canâ€™t get it out of my head.
