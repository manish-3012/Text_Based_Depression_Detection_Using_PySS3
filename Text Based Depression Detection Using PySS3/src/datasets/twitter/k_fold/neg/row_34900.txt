So, already regret not finishing Sunday's jobFml it's Wednesday and I already regret not finishing. I don't have paid time off yet (this is a new job after I was laid off back in the winter, only been there a few months) and I don't have time during business hours to make calls for doctor visits and to call the student loan people to see what income proof is needed to get a reduction in my payment plan. Work is horrible as always, it's customer service and doesn't pay enough to live on. I went to the gym and saw I've lost zero weight after a month of really intense working out (I'm a female over 30) and it just seemed like a waste of time, and EVERYTHING feels like a fucking waste of time. 

I wish to the gawd that doesn't exist or doesn't give a fuck that id finished things on Sunday night. 

I don't have the luxury of healing or "self care", gym membership is as good as it gets in that regard and part of me is screaming "even weight loss won't make you pretty, you're getting old and have a ridiculous face, just go eat cake it'll be more productive!" 

I feel alone. I texted someone who said he was there to talk but, as expected, nothing back. 

I'm alone and any to cry, about to hit the showers and do that. Glad I didn't throw out the pills after all. Rethinking another attempt. Unless someone can direct me on how to fly to Europe and get it done professionally (less horrifically painfully) there.
