I'll commit suicide when my parents die.This is just an off my chest kinda post. I had a good childhood, i have loving parents, i have great, caring friends; even though u ghost all of them. I literally have no reason to be suicidal, yet I am. My parents wont be able to take it if i go now, theyre close to their 50s. I just hope they live a good life, while seeing me. Thats my only goal now. As soon as they die, ill commit suicide. This is the only reason Im living right now, so that my parents dont have to suffer anymore. They poured so much into me, time, money, love. I cant just let that all crush them. Ill try to give back as much as i can and then Ill go. Thanks for reading so far.
