My mom told me she didnâ€™t think I had the guts to kill myself. That made me want to kill myself even more.A lot of it will probably be because I want to prove I can. I havenâ€™t slept today. Itâ€™s 6 am now and I feel like I canâ€™t get through anything anymore. I feel like Iâ€™ve been suffering for far too long and just want it to stop. I donâ€™t want to die, I want to stop feeling this. And if dyings the only way then okay. I donâ€™t have any friends to go to. No good friends no bad friends no acquaintances. I have no one. My siblings are all too young to talk to and I have no one else in my family to go to, but my mom. And guess what she said when I balled my eyes out saying I want to kill my self? â€œTo be honest I donâ€™t think you have the strength to do it.â€ I immediately felt numb and stopped crying so much. Steadying it to a half, and laid my head down on my knees. I usually never go to her because she doesnâ€™t know what to say. I know she cares about me, but her words pain me. The last time I confessed to her, she told me to just kill myself already. I canâ€™t get any psychiatric or therapy help until very later on. I donâ€™t know what to do but I really want this pain to end. I canâ€™t keep going when I have zero support. I canâ€™t keep going when I donâ€™t even have a crutch like medication or therapy. Iâ€™m lost and I feel worthless and tired and stupid for staying up this long contemplating death. Someone please talk to me
