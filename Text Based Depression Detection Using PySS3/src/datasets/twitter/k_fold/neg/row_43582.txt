Cornered, what should I do?I'm suicidal but my parents think I've moved past that "stage". I can't tell them about it because they will for sure put me back in a hospital, and quite frankly I can't be bothered to deal with that social lapse again. Going to a hospital messes things up, and has actually made me worse off than before. I can't tell a doctor, or anybody, because by law in my country they are required to inform the parents of the patient that the patient is having suicidal thoughts. I'm stuck. If I don't do anything, I'm not quite sure what will happen. If I do something, I'll get pushed back into the medical system again and I'll probably worsen myself.

I've also been getting weird flashbacks more frequently this past year. I can't really describe it accurately, but sometimes when I'm trying to sleep, or am sitting down alone I will have a very fuzzy (for the lack of a better word) replay of a bad event in my mind. It's like I can somehow remember the noises of the event, but the imagery is fuzzed, like a mesh of colors. It's also hard for me to even remember the events that I flash back to properly; if I try, it just doesn't work. It's beginning to bother me at this point, however my experience with confessing things like this to people has been rather lackluster, and I'm not convinced anything positive could come from it.

So, what do I do? I'm still living, but mostly because of the fear of physical pain and the effects my death would have.

I've been thinking about shooting a lot of footage and making a deepfake of myself so that once I go people who cared would still be able to see me, but to be honest I'm not sure if that would make the feeling of loss better or worse.

Thanks for any advice.
