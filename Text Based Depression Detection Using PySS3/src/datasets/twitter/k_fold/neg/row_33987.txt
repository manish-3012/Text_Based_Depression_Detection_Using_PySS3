I have nothing and no one. (besides my mom who has said she doesnt know how to help)im 22. I have nowhere to go. no one to talk too. no education outside of half way through highschool. and no future. I truly feel lost. my life is wasting away. this is not an exaggeration. I dont know what to do. I dont know if I should end it all
