Iâ€™m just sick of it.Iâ€™d like to say Iâ€™ve been dealing with a lot, what with the car accident, and two midterms from taking 9 credit hours of courses in the summer, to trying to expand my nothingness that is a social life. Itâ€™s just that Iâ€™m not looking for friends necessarily, I mean friends are cool and stuff, but Iâ€™m much more interested in something more intimate (if I can be immodest, itâ€™s someone I can have sex with, someone I can try sexual fantasies with), and Iâ€™m not going to lie to you, the sex part is a mandatory thing for me, I appreciate everything else, but Iâ€™m not majorly affected by not having anniversaries, or not going on dates weekly, if she wants to thatâ€™s cool, but we have to have sex at a reasonable time, which to me is about 2-3 weeks, or right now, but nobody seems to like hookups. Now this wouldnâ€™t be all that bad, but this seems to put me in incel land or niceguy land, and by god you donâ€™t ever want to be compared to that, but Iâ€™m serious when I say itâ€™s the sex, she could say we should stay friends but with benefits and I would be perfectly fine with that. Iâ€™ve flipped out on them, and I always acted like it was no big deal that they said no, Iâ€™ve worked up the courage to talk to them so many times, so why isnâ€™t this girl interested? Why does this other girl only date black guys? Why was I stood up at prom? How is a college girl not looking for a relationship? I thought college was like sex mania or something. Why did this girl have to be gay? I was so happy 2 days ago, when my brother told me there were girls who thought I was cute and wanted to set something up, so I gave him my number to give to them. Why would they text me at 3 am and then ghost me? Well, Iâ€™m getting tired of this shit, pardon my language, and I donâ€™t want to be around to see history repeat itself, this is a vital part of my development, and celibacy is a sacrifice I am not willing to make in this life. I have no money for hookers or premium porn, and no connections for hookups, I hate bars and clubs, and that entire lifestyle in general, but the one thing I canâ€™t stand seeing right now is other relationships, again, Iâ€™m getting a little heavy worded here, fuck every single person in a relationship who shows it off all the fucking time, I donâ€™t want to see that. Well anyways, thatâ€™s it, I just want to not feel this way anymore, and as long as Iâ€™m alive, Iâ€™m gonna feel this way, so...
