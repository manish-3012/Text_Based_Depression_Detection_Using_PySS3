What to writeHow do I tell all of them I loved them so much? How do I tell them it's not their fault, that I am my own mess and I no longer want them to worry? How do I tell them I did it for them? To not beat themselves up because it wasnt their fault? What do I write to make them feel less guilty? 
What do I write?
