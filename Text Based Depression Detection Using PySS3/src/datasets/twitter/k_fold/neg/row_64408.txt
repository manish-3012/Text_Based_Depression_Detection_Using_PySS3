Existential terror and the reality of insignificanceIâ€™ve felt this my whole life, but only recently have I deeply recognized how insignificant my life is. I wish I could say everyoneâ€™s lives were insignificant, and to a certain degree they are, in that we are all small carbon based life forms with a relatively short lifespan on the same rocky planet. However, some of us are born into or come into money, power, and prestige. These people will do anything to keep the status quo. 

That includes the silencing of others and manipulating their will. The modern state of religion, politics, and economics are prime examples. We like to think we, the common person, have a choice, but we donâ€™t, itâ€™s all an illusion. A well crafted one. 

Our education, employment, votes, lifestyles are all choices that we think we have. It all leads to the same place for a large majority of people. We all suffer, eat, cry, fuck, work, pray, and for what? Thereâ€™s no one watching, no one listening. No one cares. We have no voice, no advocate in the current state of our world. Thereâ€™s no loving god, no beneficent employer, no honest politician, no kind landlord. Our mere birth into this world is a form of slavery. Learn, work, die. Birth some new cannon fodder for the machine while youâ€™re at it. Even our deaths are means for profit. 

Why am I here? Why am I sentient? Why was I born just to suffer then die? Why prolong my pain?

FUCK I just want to blow my brains out!!! Thatâ€™s my one choice, my one freedom. Even then, my right to end my life is regulated. â€œOh you want to exit an existence that has brought nothing but pain and suffering? Well, you are clearly and obviously insane. Take these pills, stay in a hospital. Hereâ€™s your bill, please come again.â€

Iâ€™m stuck between wanting to laugh and scream at the same time because of the absurdity of it all. I canâ€™t be the only one who feels like the so-called amazing gift of life is a cruel, sadistic joke.
