I didn't know I could feel this bad.I responded to people, but now it seems like nobody is talking to me. All my friends seem to have ignored me, too. I can't afford to go to an ER. I can't reach anyone on 7CupsOfTea. I just need to talk to someone. Nobody will even acknowledge me in IRC channels. Does anyone actually care?
