I really want to find a way to kill myself that will still pay out my life insurance to my wife.There are concrete steps at work, part of the fire exit but they go down from the second floor to the basement.  I fantasize about throwing myself down them somehow to look like I fell and killing myself in the process, but I know it'd never work.  I'd just hurt myself and have to cover the medical cost and send my family through more turmoil.
I wish when I had my stroke I had it at work and I knew what was going on, I would have hidden in the bathroom, telling my coworkers I was just feeling sick before I snuck off.  Dying at work would have paid out well.
