It's been so longI just don't even know what to do. And I have no idea why I'm posting to reddit either. I'm the stereotypical person that reddit hates. I'm transgender, mentally ill and fucked up. I have no friends at school which I'm failing and I'm loosing all my online ones. I'm having nightmares all the time of sexual assault because I was molested as a kid by my friends. I hate being alive. I just found rope and tried to tie it to the pole on my closet but I put it down and now I'm just sitting aimlessly. I've attempted 4 times. I'm 16, but I don't wanna get any older. I have a funeral to go to tomorrow. I don't want to harm my parents with this. I feel so unloved and empty. I just hope I'm not bothering anyone by writing this. So many people want me to die and I can't change it.
