It's finally time.I feel like shit. I have thoughts of killing myself for as far as I could remember, but never this intense at the moment. I feel trapped in a situation in which I see no end. The only sweet relief that I find in living this miserable pretentious lie of a reality is to kill myself. However, I am having some concerns about how to do it in the least painful way. Any ideas? 

However, I'm conflicted seeing as though I posted on here makes me think that subconsciously this might be what they call.. a cry for help. Nonetheless here goes.


Here are some of the reasons why I feel the my nonexistence:

- I never developmentally experienced trust from parents, let alone love.

- I am emotionally challenged growing up. I was confused and is unable to feel any true meaning of a lot of emotions.

- father used to beat me etc etc not too bad, but emotionally distrustful ever since.

- dorm schooled when I was 5-12 years old. Most traumatic emotional roller coaster of my goddam life.

- horrible headmaster, corporal punishments - physical and emotional pains etc etc, bullied, turned into a bully, whole cycle, hated by the "authority", hated authority ever since, hated my life since.

- during high-school parents turned "Christians" turned "Christian extermists" turned "cult". They wanted to live a better life, so okay. they asked for forgiveness, so okay. let's give it a try.

- I became part of that cult, destroyed my pubescent years, probably affected my social development. 

- Felt duped, since I finally trusted for the better, only to fucking trust the wrong people. That's what cult does, I guess.

- After high school went to the school abroad (US), broke my bondage, learned a lot, felt free, I never felt so normal.

- College years, great stuff. great friends, real friends, best time of my life. Drugs, alcohol.. lots. 

- After college, polysubstance abuse stayed, felt lost, depressed, could not transition in the real world, I was on my own in a big city. Could not keep a job, stunted adolescent, unable to make real friends, or real relationships. hated the US decided to return home so I could be better.

- Now at home for over a year, came back to shit. I thought life would be better. I wanted to stay away from drugs and alcohol but came back to the home I never even knew, I never even had. I feel like a stranger here, in this house, in this community, in this country.

- Trapped. My parents gave me job, shit pay, the boss is a bitch (parents), lost my freedom, losing my identity again, losing myself.

- They started to be too controlling, something I just now realize. They dont get me, I dont get them.. my whole family is one big piece of pretentious joke.

- Trapped. Can't go back to the US, cant go anywhere outside the country, can't go anywhere outside the city. 

- Have you ever woken up in stranger's house and realize they are your parents, the people living there is family? FUCKING SHIT BALLS OF FIRE. Im in the twilight zone.

- Fact of the matter is, they actually dont know who I am, and I dont really know them. I just live in this house, came back to his country so detached from everything.

- All turned into more shit. Now they want me to leave the the house, but I am left with nothing. I dont know how to live here, and I dont know anyone anymore. I dont know anything anymore.

- Has my life been just one big life experiment? and I am a failed product of that? 

- I have become nothing, and no one and I have no connections to this world left. I feel so alone and insignificant. Maybe this is my fate, to be nothing and then... disappear. 

Why not end it now?
