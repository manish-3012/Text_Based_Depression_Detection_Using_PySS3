off balance, alone, scared, worried sickMy head is racing right now. I donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore. I feel like every time I try to sort things out work through them, Iâ€™m eventually tossed off balance before I can get into it. 

My father unloaded on me today and let me know just how useless I am. Although he didnâ€™t use the word useless. He didnâ€™t even ask me to help out more, explicitly. But he talks about how much money everything cost and how little I contribute. I do nothing around the house. Heâ€™s not wrong. I know I can do more.  Iâ€™ve always been happy to do more. I just never knew what I can or canâ€™t do without asking but I ask all the time, what can I do but I should just know. I should be observant.

I havenâ€™t got a pot to piss in. Not only am I useless, I donâ€™t have anything. I know this. I just keep trying to work through, hoping one day Iâ€™ll have a job where I can help take care of myself and my parents. Although I donâ€™t know how the fuck I manage that when I canâ€™t take care of myself in the slightest, I canâ€™t hold a job for more than six months, finding something becomes harder and harder. What am I supposed to do now, try to pay for a class I canâ€™t afford and struggle through another semester until Iâ€™m broke and then drop out? Give up on my commitments now and struggle to find some work, any work, no matter how shit it is. How will I ever find something in my field if I just keep burning bridges. WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSE TO DO. Why am I always caught up in such indecision and impossibly difficulty decisions to make? Do I do this to myself? I think of course I do, Iâ€™m the one making the decisions but I always feel like Iâ€™m making the best decisions I can given everything I can think about and know and try to do. 

I have to do it myself. I must want to do it myself. I canâ€™t believe this is what I have to ask because I just want to die. 9/10 days, I JUST WANT TO DIE. I want to die and no I donâ€™t want to get better because I donâ€™t think itâ€™s possible, I donâ€™t have some god-fearing epiphany or some superstitious guardian angel to â€œshow me the light.â€ I just keep living through this fucking feeling of wanting to die and shut my shit brain down. BUT EVERYTIME I BRING THAT UP. I get the fucking stupid fucking guilt trip â€œThat will just hurt more people around you.â€ What the fuck, I hurt them now. I keep hurting them with my dependent, indecisive, depressive, self-hating, self now. How am I supposed to get better? Because I keep trying to do it, I KEEP FUCKING TRYING. Iâ€™m doing the therapy, Iâ€™m taking the medication, Iâ€™m trying to keep the routine, Iâ€™m trying to talk more. These things, which help, THEY FUCKING HELP always feel like they are out of reach or will be lost if I fuck up. If I leave school, what will I do about therapy and medication? If I keep going, how will I try to support myself and them? Am I just fucking stupid because I canâ€™t see the way out of these situations? I live with the constant anxiety of being 60,000 dollars in student loan debt and I havenâ€™t paid my taxes in 4 years and I only ever barely keep strapping by and only by relying on other people. I suck at finding jobs, no one will hire me for one reason or another and I have doubts I can accomplish jobs. I donâ€™t see how I canâ€™t keep thinking Iâ€™m off dead when I hit these hard truths. Itâ€™s a pattern that makes me feel like my mother and my brother, and probably my grandfathers, and everyone else who canâ€™t get their shit together or â€œknow what they want out of life. 
I donâ€™t know what I want, Iâ€™m floating and trying to be better but Iâ€™m just fucking floating. I have no vision of the future. I look at it and I see myself homeless, lost, broke, alone, and all but ready to kill myself but struggling with the courage to do it. 

What I suppose to fucking do right now? I WAS SO READY TO TRY AND GET BACK INTO CLASSES. I was feeling stressed about making it work but I want to making it work until nowâ€¦. NOW I DONâ€™T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK TO DO. MY HEAD HURT, MY CHEST HURTS, I canâ€™t concentrate on anything, as if I donâ€™t struggle with that anyway. I havenâ€™t done in 3 weeksâ€¦. I keep trying but all Iâ€™ve done is fuck off trying to get back into a routine after I fell apart and itâ€™s worth. Iâ€™m back to where I started. Iâ€™m just hoping I can wait till Wednesdays for therapy, but I donâ€™t know hwy thatâ€™s my only thing I look forward too right now. 
I donâ€™t feel like I can talk to anyone about this because Iâ€™m such a fucking mess, Itâ€™s hard to just describe and admit to how fucking much of a failure and an embarrassment I am. 
WHAT DO I DO
WHAT DO I DO
AM I EVER GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS.

Iâ€™m exhausted nowâ€¦When is it ever going to change.. when I am ever going to change?
