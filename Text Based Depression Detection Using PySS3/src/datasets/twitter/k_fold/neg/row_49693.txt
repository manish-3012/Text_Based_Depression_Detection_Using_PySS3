I donâ€™t knowWhen I was ten I was suicidal (I still am). I know that sounds dumb like â€œoh you were ten how could you know what suicide isâ€ I donâ€™t know how but I did.

 I remember this one day at school something appended (I donâ€™t remember what) and I was crying so a teacher came to ge me to stop crying I guess. She was telling me to stop crying and I told her I wanted to kill myself. I donâ€™t know how it works but if a student tells you they want to kill themselves arenâ€™t you supposed to do something about it? 

I know I was only ten and she probably thought â€œoh sheâ€™s only ten she doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s talking aboutâ€ but I did. 

Now I canâ€™t stop thinking about that moment and what wouldâ€™ve happened if she did something about it. Maybe Iâ€™d be happy. Maybe she did do something about it? Maybe she told my parents and they were the one not doing anything about it. I donâ€™t know and I donâ€™t want to ask them. 

I canâ€™t change anything about what happened but I still canâ€™t stop thinking about it.  

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting this but I am
