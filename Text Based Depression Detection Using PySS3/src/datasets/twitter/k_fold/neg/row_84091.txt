I'm just so tiredI know things get better. I know I'll have a couple moments in the week where I think "hey, life is kinda okay even though it's falling apart". But it just doesn't seem worth it. I've been fighting so long, trying to form good habits and self esteem and deal with depression and mood swings and anxiety and whatever else I subconsciously decide to punish myself with. But I'm running on empty and I don't know what to do.

I'm just hurting so bad and I don't know how to fight anymore. I don't want to die. But what do I have left?

Thank you to anyone who read this. I'm sorry if it's not coherent. Have a good day.
