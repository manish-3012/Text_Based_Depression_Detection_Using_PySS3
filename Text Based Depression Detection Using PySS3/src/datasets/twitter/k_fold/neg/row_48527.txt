I have thoughts of suicide every 2 minutes without exception.The only time I'm not thinking of killing myself is when I'm sleeping. I had someone to talk to but she has been completely avoiding me lately and it has gotten infinitely worse. I don't know how I made it so long before I met her, and I don't even know if I will make it two more weeks. I am supposed to be getting meds then but if I don't, or they don't work, that will most likely be it for me. I had planned to kill myself in November but at this point every day I'm alive is torture. I'm living in hell and I just want it to end.
