I canâ€™t do thisI feel like my life is completely pointless and the only thing really keeping me here is the hurt itâ€™ll cause my parents if Iâ€™m gone. I have no friends, I donâ€™t even speak to anyone besides my family. I noticed that all the people from school only wanted something from me wanted to make a joke out of someone. I stopped reaching out to people and havenâ€™t had a single message since. I understand itâ€™s all my fault and that if I wasnâ€™t so messed up and disgusting I would be okay. I havenâ€™t been outside for the past three months because I donâ€™t want anyone to look at me. Iâ€™m so messed up and ugly and disgusting. I know Iâ€™ll never find someone who can love me and Iâ€™ll always be alone so whatâ€™s the point? I feel like Iâ€™m just waiting for it to get bad enough and then Iâ€™ll be gone.
