I think I might end my life on MondayI'm just bloody tired of my life. I've been riding the depression sine wave my whole life. Last Monday I basically learned that my mother had no faith in my ability to live my own life. I just wanna be done. "No mÃ¡s". I have thought about how, and what time. I've tried to cut contact with my friends. I don't think that I've done a good enough job of that. I'm scared because somewhere in my head I still have this part of me that wants to live, but I'm watching depression choke it out.
