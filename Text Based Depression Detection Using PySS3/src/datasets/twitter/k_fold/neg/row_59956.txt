How to tell my family i'll likely commit suicide?Preface: i don't mean wife and kids, i don't have those. i mean my parents, siblings and cousins?

I know the kind of people they are and i'm pretty sure they're not going to be very helpful in getting me out of depression. They're the kind that would just tell me to snap out of it. My father would say suicidal people are just lazy fuckers that never deserved to live anyway. So i don't want to tell them as they'll likely just push me over the edge sooner.

At the same time, i do want to tell them because i think they deserve to know first.  They're great people in every other respect except dealing with suicidal and/or depressed people. If someone i knew was going to die i would certainly want to know.

Should i leave a note instead?

Now i know you will all tell me not to do it, and i welcome that. But at the same time let me know what i should do about my family. Should i not tell them or tell them.
