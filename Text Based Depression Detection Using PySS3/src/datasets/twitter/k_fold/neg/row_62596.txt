How do I get help?Alright Reddit, here goes. I need help. I have been telling myself I am not that bad for a long time now but today I am finally realizing that I wan to be dead and I might actually be dead if I was not so tired all the freaking time. So I need help, I am that bad. 

My questions:

How and where do I get help?

How much is this going to cost? I can't afford a lot.

Is this going to ruin my future? I am going to college in the fall and I have a job and an internship to apply to. Will I be disqualified for all of this because I am like this?

My fear is that I will go through all of this "getting help" and spend money I don't have, ruin my entire future, and terrify my parents just to find out that I am fine. The doctors or whoever will say that this is normal and I was over reacting.

Any answers you can give would be so appreciated. 

Update:

I went to the doctor. She prescribed a lose dosage of prozac and told me to see a therapist. Does anyone know anything about prozac? I am a little worried about starting medication.
