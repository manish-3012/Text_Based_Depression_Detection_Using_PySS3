Should I kill myself because I am a virgin?I feel like there is no point in living for a 22 year old pathetic kissless male virgin like me. I am a laughing stock and people will forever look down upon me. I feel like a worthless human being who is not worthy of being loved by anyone. I feel like society as a whole is disgusted by me.
