Advice for DepressionI dont understand the point of living anymore. Everyday seem like a struggle, to the point that I halted going to college after returning from the psych ward a couple weeks ago. I have no dreams, nothing i want to do. Other peoples dreams all seem flawed to me or at least in my prespective but I have nothing  against it if it brings them happiness. I was raised in a christian household and used to learn about it more in my christian school. Now, for various reasons I dont believe in it anymore, personal opinion. I dont see a future in which this is going to change as its been getting worse and worse for the last 4 yrs. And I dont really understand whats wrong with death anymore. If people complain about how others around will be affected, i dont see a reason why I should be a slave to thier emotions while i continue to suffer. Even with the meds they been giving, it still sucks. I dont get the point of how death is coming anyway so why not live until because whats the point of living if its not enjoyable. If im going to be redirecting into go getting help, dont bother, i still got to weekly visit my psychatrist. Why should i continue living at all?
