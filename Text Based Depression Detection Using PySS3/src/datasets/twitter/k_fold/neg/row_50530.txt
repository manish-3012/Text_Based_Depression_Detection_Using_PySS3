I don't deserve my friends.My (only 3) friends are such good people, and I love being able to talk to them, but every time I'm with them, deep down I feel guilt. Guilty because I know that they would really rather spend time with someone else. There's always someone better than me. It's not that I'm a bad friend; I'm always there for them if they need it, but I can never make them feel better the way I wish I could. I'm just a boring, pathetic person.

So to C, A, and A:
I'm sorry for not being able to come up with the perfect things to say when you're feeling down. I'm sorry for making things awkward and abruptly ending conversations. I'm sorry for not being funnier or more interesting, because I know you aren't having a good time like you would be with anyone else. I'm sorry for wasting your time. In the back of my mind, I always know I'll never be good enough. I want you to be happy, but I'm incapable of being the friend that you have always been to me.

Anyway, life goes on and I know you'll be as amazing and perfect as ever. You'll make lots of great friends and work towards your dream careers. You'll live your life, surrounded by people who care about you and are able to express exactly how they're feeling in the most fitting way. And if I'm still here in 20 years, I'll just be on the outside, like I've always been. I'm sorry for not being better, and I wish you all the best.
