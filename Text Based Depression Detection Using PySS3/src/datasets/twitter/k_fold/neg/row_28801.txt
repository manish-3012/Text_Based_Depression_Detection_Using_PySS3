Suicide hotline called the cops.I often feel very down and have suffered from suicidal thoughts for my entire life.  I was encouraged to call the suicide hotline if I ever I felt the need to talk to someone.  Well I did. And they called the cops!  But the cops couldnâ€™t find my house, so they dropped in on a few neighbors asking for me.  When the cops finally did find me and knocked on the door and I opened it, several neighbors were standing across the street watching the cops and EMS truck parked in my driveway.  The cops wanted my name and now I have a police file!  The cops said anyone could access this file if they wanted to get my story.  And thatâ€™s that.  Now my neighbors are talking, thereâ€™s a police record on me and I will never, ever, ever call a suicide hotline again, regardless of how I feel.  Iâ€™m not suggesting you donâ€™t call if youâ€™re really in danger, but if youâ€™re calling because you just need someone to talk to, donâ€™t be surprised if your life is really messed up afterwards when the police come to chat.  

PS  At first I didnâ€™t want to give the cops my name, but when they threatened to put me in cuffs, arrest me and take me to the station, I told them who I was.  I live in a small town, the neighbors are really nosey, the local cops now know who I am, and so I am now thinking about moving because the shame I feel is tremendous. Calling a suicide hotline has left me more suicide than before I called.  How ironic.
