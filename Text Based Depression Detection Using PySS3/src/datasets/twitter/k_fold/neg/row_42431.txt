Why would I do this for another year?I  may of drunkenly posted yesterday, but now I can't sleep and that's all I had was to sleep and not be here. So I am posting again. 

I don't know why or how I'd make it through another year this depressed, especially when it's been a whole year and everything seems to just be worse then before. I have nothing to hope for, I destroy talking to people and I just don't want to anymore and my thoughts are more and more painful. New places have not helped  nor new things, or old things or drugs or therapy or all shit of all kinds fuck . I can't dream happy anymore, I dream this duress. 

I was thinking and I am probably just being a god damn psycho to hurt my ex who reads this cuz I am a piece of shit who won't change accounts. Shithead. That I really liked the feeling of being weak when giving blood and I could do that to die just bleed out and be cold . I am constantly made to talk to people and I am so alone even at there most caring. I can't do this for this long it's so awful
