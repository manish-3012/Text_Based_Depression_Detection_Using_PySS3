Don't know what else to do anymore.Longtime lurker first-time poster here. I have been struggling with mental health issues for several years. Within the past year I have reached out and sought help but it appears the situation only seems to become more convoluted the more help I try to get. Within the past 6 months I have:

-Planned suicide
-Dropped out of my last semester of school
-Attempted to admit myself to the hospital multiple times (however I was convinced by loved ones that there would be no help available for me there
-I was put on and changed medications three times (I believe the medication I am on currently is not working, unfortunately when I explained this to my doctor, it was suggested that the medication has not worked due to the environment I am in, despite having the same work, home, and life situation over the past year.
-Begun self abuse including burning and cutting
-Developed hatred for social activities

I am once again thinking about killing myself quite frequently, and have been hiding my thoughts and actions about doing so in order to maintain some peace to myself when I finally decide to go.

I am trying to resist this urge but the fact that I have reached out and failed makes me feel like this is meant to be. Any advice on anything else to try. Any bases I missed?
