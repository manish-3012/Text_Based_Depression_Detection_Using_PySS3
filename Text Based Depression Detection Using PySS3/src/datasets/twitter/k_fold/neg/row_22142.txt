Postponing the inevitableI've known I was depressed since I was 13. Maybe I was depressed before then, but I didn't know what depression was. I remember wanting to die as a kid, but the first time I wanted to kill myself, I was 14. Almost killed myself at 17 and 20. Self-harmed ages 14 to 22. Now I'm 25 and about to graduate grad school with no plan for the future. I'm fat, trans, and have $30k in student debt. My life has gotten worse every year. Don't want to spend the rest of my life working a job I don't care about just to make enough money to survive. I don't see why I should keep going.

After my post-graduation trip (the last thing I'm looking forward to), I'll be returning to my parents' home. Their state has much laxer gun laws than where I currently live. I'm thinking of buying a gun and ending it this summer. It'll suck for everyone who loves me, I know, but I've lived for them for years. I'm not spending another 60+ years feeling like this.
