How about tonight?Why not? I have an undiagnosed medical condition and the doctors don't give a shit. They say it's all in my head and give me antianxiety medicine. Before Christmas, I was the happiest person on the planet. Now, I am miserable.

So anxiety causes flank pains? COOL. Anxiety causes muscle atrophy? Nice. Causes my feet to move nonstop? Awesome. Oh, anxiety causes you to become vitamin D deficient and so fatigued you're basically bedridden? Wow. Oh, anxiety causes your skin to dry and shrivel? Excellent. 

Guess what? Anxiety can make you piss foam and make your urine cloudy too. Also, it can cause your nails to pit and your hair to become dry and basically stop growing. 

There's no hope for me. The medical community is arrogant and lazy. They don't care that I'm probably dying, they just want me out of the office so they can make more money. The doctors just want to go home to their families and live the American Dream while I suffer. 

Why not tonight?
