I don't know what's happening to me anymore.I, by no means, suffer in life. I have friends. I'm somewhat attractive. My family loves me. Everyone tells me I have the potential to do whatever I want in life. But not 10 minutes ago, I sat in my chair in the middle of the room with a knife to my throat. I sat there for about 2 minutes, applying and taking off pressure as I thought. I don't want to be here anymore. I don't want my life, I don't even deserve it. I'm the only one who sees how terrible of a person I am. I have the ability to spend months getting close to a girl, have her totally in love with me, and then crush her like she never mattered. They never do anyway. I've done it at least 3 or 4 times. Why? Because I could, and they started to get on my nerves anyway. I've made my mom cry more times than I can count, and just sit with a straight face when my parents try to tell me how they feel. I don't care about how they feel, they'll get over it soon enough. Enough about me being me though, I still have the knife. It rests under my bed, and I don't know if the next time this happens if I'll want to stop applying pressure. Maybe I can make art with my blood before I die. Maybe someone here can help.
