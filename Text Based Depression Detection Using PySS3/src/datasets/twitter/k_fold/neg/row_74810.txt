One of my friends almost attempted suicideTonight someone I consider a good friend was about to commit suicide before he stopped and informed his mother about his intent.  He's a great guy, but has been dealing with depression and suicidal tendencies for a while. My boyfriend is very close with him, and unfortunately I was the one to break these news to him. He's obviously very upset. I've never dealt with a situation like this and don't know how to show my sympathies and talk to either of them after this. How can I show emotional support to my boyfriend and our mutual friend?
