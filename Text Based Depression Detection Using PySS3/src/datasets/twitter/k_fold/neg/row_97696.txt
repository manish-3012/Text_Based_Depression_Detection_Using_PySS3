I love life butDoes anyone else ever cut out of extreme anger? Like when i just think of all that life has thrown at me i just get so angry and feel this huge urge to cut lines into my chest/arms/legs after i feel so relieved like a fresh breathe of air i know its unhealthy but it feels so good id never off myself its not that i don't want to its just im not dumb you know i know after this its lights out thats it i might as well try to be happy and have fun while im here my bday is coming up im not celebrating it but im still happy aging is a privilege some of us are denied im blessed i swear to god im blessed i love my life.
