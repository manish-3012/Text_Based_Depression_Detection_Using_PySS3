i feel like iâ€™m relapsing harder than i ever have beforeevery time i feel like i could be getting better i fall back even further and right now i truly donâ€™t want to live. itâ€™s too much. iâ€™m dragging down everyone around me, iâ€™m wasting so much time and i donâ€™t want to keep doing that. my life feels completely meaningless and iâ€™m just a weight on everyone elseâ€™s shoulders.  
  
i donâ€™t know what to do. i just want to be gone. then i canâ€™t ruin anything else.
