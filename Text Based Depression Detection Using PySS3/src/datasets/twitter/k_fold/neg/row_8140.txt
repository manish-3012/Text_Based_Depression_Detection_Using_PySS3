I'm gonna move and loose all my friends...againI can't do this again. After school i lost contact to all friends (expect one who i see 3 times a year or so). Everyone moved far away to go to a university and so did i. I fell in a deep depression and only halfway through my studies i could slowly get myself out of there. I met 3 amazing people during my studies and having  these 3 great friends was the best thing that happened to me ever. Now i finished my bachelors degree and gonna move 500km to another city for a masters degree. A friend of mine was planning to move with me and study at the same uni but she changed her plans. I'm gonna be all alone in a big fucking city. And ultimatly i will have less and less contact with my friends until everyone has moved on and forgotten about me. I can't deal with this. My friends are by far the most important people in my life. And i don't see a point in finding new friends, in 2 years my masters degree would be finished and i'd loose them again anyways. I don't see a point in living if this is how it's gonna be.
