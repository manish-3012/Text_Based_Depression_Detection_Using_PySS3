06-21-1989 - 10-28-2019What do you do when there is nothing left to say? I have deduced that the only answer is to check out early. I could name the laundry list of reasons, like financial burden, emotional burden, being manipulative, vindictive. And codependent but I donâ€™t think I need to. Iâ€™ve been clean from heroin since 2017. I think when I get paid Monday, Iâ€™m going to have a little relapse...My s/o decided that a little break would be for the best for the relationship because I have admittedly gone off the god damn tracks. I know she will be angry as hell at first, but I hope that in time she will see that I did it for her benefit, along with my familyâ€™s

Iâ€™ll get a hotel room, with an eight ball of dope, and I wonâ€™t leave a letter because I want them to think it was accidental. I can NOT have them know that I did it on purpose ... then again I guess it really wonâ€™t matter by then will it?
I know Iâ€™m a pussy, so Iâ€™m going to take the rest of my script of klonopin along with some liquid courage to get the balls to do it.
Iâ€™ve done it once before, so I know I have it in me to do it again. Only this time no one is going to break down my bedroom door to hit me with narcan in time.

Iâ€™m 30, and a child. I had everything given to me in life I could have ever wanted. I met an amazing woman in June who has shown me what it means to truly love yourself and share that love with another. I physically can not break up with her, I just canâ€™t. And she is insisting on this break. I am about to get fired from my shit job at a pizza place. Things were going good. Things really started to look up. But Iâ€™m mentally unstable and my illness has reared its head again, and itâ€™s worse than ever before and I no longer have health insurance for an emergency therapist visit. 

Trust me, this is for the best. Donâ€™t try to talk me out of it. I am doing it. 

Why did I write all of this down?
I donâ€™t know..maybe one day months from now she will look at my reddit profile and read this. If you do, just know that I am sorry. You are going to meet the right person...one day...and be the absolute perfect fit for them. And he wonâ€™t be crazy. Lol.
I make her miserable. I am dragging her down with me and bless her heart she actually LOVES ME so much that she isnâ€™t letting go of the anchor (me)
Since Iâ€™m too much of a coward to end it, then Iâ€™m going to do what I do best. Get really fucking high. So high I end up in the ground. 

Fuck man, I was really excited about Halloween and spending thanksgiving and Christmas with her ...
Câ€™est la vie
Touch your nose
I love you
