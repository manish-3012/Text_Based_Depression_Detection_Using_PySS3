Why live life when nothing fucking mattersIve had probably around 20 moments in the past year where if i had a gun next to me i would of pulled the trigger. Im too much of a coward to do it any other way. Whats the point of living life whats an actual reason to stay alive. I have 1 friend and have only had one friend for the entire 18 years of my life. Im so fucking lonely but wont interact with people cause i dont trust them to not be assholes who will insult and berate me for being trans. The struggles ive had have built up for years and now i feel just about nothing. The only thing i feel on the regular is hopelessness. I cant even trust other lgbt people anymore after my ex manipulated me. They got me to send them lewd pictures and i fucking hate the concept of sex/lewdness, i was that fucking brainwashed. It didnt even take much cause i was so fucking broken when we met. The first week of relationship was great but afterwards she just always talked about how shit her life was and whenever i had problems shed always make me feel like shit cause hers were worse. When we broke up she even tried to gaslight me about how i never talked to her when i was the only one communicating anything of worth. People are assholes so whats the point of living when no fucking cares about you and we all die alone in the end. I just wish I had the courage to end my life but I dont want to suffer just to end the suffering.
