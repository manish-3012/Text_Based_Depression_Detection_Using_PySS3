Today is probably the day. Going to get the gun.I swore to myself I would do it by years end no matter what. Things seemed to have a slight upswing for a moment and they did what they always do, come crashing down. 

It really sucks. It hurts because there was a piece in side of me that wanted things to upswing and not uphold my promise. But Iâ€™m just kidding myself. 

Iâ€™ve already started the self destruction and so now Iâ€™m going to go get a shotgun. 

If I donâ€™t pull the trigger tonight itâ€™ll probably be the next few days at least. 

Iâ€™m all out of steam. Iâ€™ve fought and lost, and now itâ€™s time to rest. I just canâ€™t take this anymore.
