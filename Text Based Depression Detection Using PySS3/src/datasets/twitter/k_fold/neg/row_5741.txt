not sure how I feel anymore. Girl left me out of the blue.I feel like everything has lost all meaning. My ability to move has diminished. I lay awake at night wondering where I went wrong and who to put the blame on. Ambition is non-existent and meaningless without execution. When my head is a little clearer and sober I contemplate what exactly is â€œloveâ€ and why does it have the potential to cause so much pain. The chemical reactions within our brain that drive us to procreate, a beautiful scientific miracle. Is it really that important or do we just need to evolve, mentally, and get past this unnecessary burden. Then there comes the issue of trust. When youâ€™re ready to commit, why should you? What gives you the right to think that this person will not turn around and fail to reciprocate the feelings you once shared? Bring me to my knees and force me to beg to forces unknown. Drowning in sorrow, not able to escape the pain, I look for a way out. As the walls slowly close in on me I begin to see and fully understand the meaning of grief. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m writing this but I donâ€™t know what else to do.
