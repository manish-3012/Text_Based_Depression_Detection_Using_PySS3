I think my mental health is too much for people and suicide seems like the only option.An old friend 'broke up' with me last week claiming that the panic attack I had a year ago was too much for her.

All of my friends talk about mental health all the time, but my anxiety is brushed off as me overthinking stuff.

I don't want to leave them. I feel like I would've failed and I would be alone.

I'm thinking of ending it. I feel trapped. If I run away and block them all, I'll be causing drama. If I talk about my mental health I'm causing drama and they prefer my old friend anyways. So I stay quiet and pretend it's all okay.

I'm in therapy and I'm trying really hard but these thoughts overwhelm me and I feel like I can't live anymore.

Everyone will be slightly sad I'm sure but relieved that they don't have to deal with my mental heath.
