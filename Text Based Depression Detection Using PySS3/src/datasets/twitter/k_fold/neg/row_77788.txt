im tired of being transthinking about collecting my pills up to a lethal dose since i cant just take a whole container lol. i cant get help. no matter how many professionals i reach out to, my parents stand in the way telling me to be happy. i cant muster up the courage to tell my psychiatrist that â€˜yes i have thoughts of hurting myselfâ€™. my dad always sits mext to me in the appointments and now that its virtual its even worse. i dont trust my therapist since all i have are suicidal thoughts, he would send me off and anger my parents for getting hospitalized again. i know my prents want to help but theyre just doing more damage. ive already told them that im transgender and that i self harm and think of suicide but nobody cares. i just want to be accepted and be who i am without holding myself back. ive been thinking of suicide since 2016 and ive been writing letters. so many letters, i have a whole folder of them. hell, for awhile i just wrote suicide notes every single day.
