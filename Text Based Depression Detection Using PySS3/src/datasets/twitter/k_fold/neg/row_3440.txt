Does being suicidal physically give you pain too?I was just wondering if I'm alone in this. I get like an aching feeling in my skin and bones kind of like growing pains. I'm so suicidal its physically unbearable sometimes. I honestly don't know how I made it this long. My shrink said some people feel this but I just want to ask.
