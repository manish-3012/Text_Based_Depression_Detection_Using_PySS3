No one understands.I don't want to be a lesbian. 

I don't want to be a lesbian with supportive people around me.

I don't want to be a lesbian with a girlfriend. 

I don't want to be a lesbian in a accepting place. 

I don't want to be a fucking lesbian. Period. I don't give a flying fuck how accepting people can be. No one understands that **I** **don't** **want** **to** **be** **a** **lesbian**. 

I don't want to be attracted to the same sex. 

I just want to be heterosexual. I don't care about improving my life as a lesbian because I don't fucking want any part of it. I'm sick of people suggesting improvements to work around this disease. It's not going to work or happen. I'll always fucking hate myself. I'll always feel alone. Ill always be at a disadvantage. 

No one fucking gets it. They never will. I'm done wasting my fucking breath talking about this mental disability I have.
