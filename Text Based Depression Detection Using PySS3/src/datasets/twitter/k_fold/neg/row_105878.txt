I don't want to live past 20I turn 20 in less than 2 months. Holy shit, I know it's close, but typing it out like that, it feels REALLY close. Oh my god.  
  
I don't want to be here anymore. I never signed up for this. I didn't ask to get born. Fuck.  
  
I have no future. No friends. No talents. No job. No connections. I just basically sleep all day. It's pathetic. I am doing nothing at all with my life.  
  
I want to fucking kill myself. I have stopped one of my meds because it was making me fat and I believe a high dosage of it would be lethal, so if I save it up for a few weeks I should be able to legitimately kill myself with it. But I don't know. I've never had the courage to do it before. I NEED to though. God I hate my life.  
  
why am I posting this what the fuck.
