I don't know how much longer I can keep this upI'm on edge, constantly worried about losing my job due to the marketing numbers not being good enough for the boss despite the holidays, and I can't stop feeling anxious when I go in. I have lost my job 3 times now, I'm in pain mentally, emotionally, physically, and I just want the pain to stop. I honestly wonder why I'm even still going, why do I just not realize that no matter how much I fight or how things will look better  - it's fleeting? It always comes crashing down again.

I want it to *stop*

I just don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm drowning and no amount of swimming is taking me to the surface. I'm so tired of things looking like they're finally going my way, only to have it crash down around me. It really must be me that's the problem. I can't handle it anymore.
OCD, Depression, childhood abuse, and a nervous system related pain disorder. It's barely living. I don't think I'm going to kill myself, but I have suicidal ideation, and I really just want the pain to stop. I'm starting to sink more into those ideations.

I grew up with a narcissistic sister, Fleas mom, and an enabler dad. I was verbally, emotionally and mentally abused day in day out, I was the scapegoat child. Still am. OCD misdiagnosed until last year, depression as well. Frequent panic attacks. Sexually assaulted in college. Eating disorder for 11 years that I'm trying to recover from, and a pain disorder that wasn't diagnosed until 10 years post onset of symptoms

Sometimes I wonder if the universe is basically telling me I was a mistake.
