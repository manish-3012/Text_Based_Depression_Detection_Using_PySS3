Can't afford the hospitalIt's getting bad again. The stress/sadness/frustration hurt too much. I feel like going to the hospital might be in order. The problem is I'm still paying for the last visit and there is no way I could deal with another huge bill. I'm still on my parents insurance so that helps but the bill still stresses me out to no end. 

Going to the hospital isn't something I want to do but I don't really know any other option besides that and dying. I don't have any friends. I do have a loving family but this kind of stuff scares them. I have my bf but I don't like to go in deep because he is suicidal too. I haven't seen my therapist in a very long time (schedule conflicts, illness, etc...). 
My boss is the closest that's seen the raw me as of recently. But you know... That's my boss...

I don't want to "want to die". I am activly trying to want to live but it's so damn hard. I know I should go to the hospital, otherwise I'll have a mental break and/or kill myself. However, a hospital stay would cause so many problems. The stress of it all is too much. I'm so tired of chasing after "getting better". Im so tired of being too scared to take action one way or the other.
