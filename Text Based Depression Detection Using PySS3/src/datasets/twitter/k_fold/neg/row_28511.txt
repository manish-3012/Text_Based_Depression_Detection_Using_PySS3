Constant thoughts of suicideWhen I was 8 years old I was raped by my older brother who was 15 at the time. He did this multiple times.I tried to reach out for help initially, but my family did not believe me and thought I was making things up. I was never a liar when I was younger. There should have been no reason for them to not believe me, but when I searched for help there was no one. My trust in my family fractured completely. As I grew up my family made me feel like an inconvenience and as if I was a spoiled brat. When I was 16 I got a full time job. I was trying to find a way out even then. My family and I were not good and my brother was still living at home. It's been so long since I have ever felt safe at home. At 18 I was going to move out with a friend, however her gf had her arrested over something she didn't do. My way out closed. I didn't tell anyone I was molested until I was 19. I told my best friend at the time. I cried away because it was the 1st time anyone had ever believed me for over a decade. I spent the next few years in counseling and even checked myself into a behavioral health hospital. The thing is, I can't love someone without reliving what had happened years ago. I feel like I can't talk to friends about this anymore. It hurts so much and I feel alone. Alone. I've thought of suicide since I was 8 and now I'm 24 and it is embedded that the only way out is suicide. Help me
