I don't want to live anymoreMy girlfriend broke up with me 2 weeks ago. It was entirely my fault. I thought we were going to spend the rest of our lives together, raise a family, and grow old together. I can't comprehend a life without her in it and I don't want to. I think of my future and all I see is her. Everything reminds me of her. I cry at the drop of a hat. I'm so lost without her and I don't know what to do.


I'm also thousands of dollars in debt because I trusted her promises to support me while I got my small business off the ground and get me out of a terrible situation with my old landlord. I'm terrified of being arrested at any time for not paying what I owe him. I'm just fucked in every possible way and I have no hope for the future.
