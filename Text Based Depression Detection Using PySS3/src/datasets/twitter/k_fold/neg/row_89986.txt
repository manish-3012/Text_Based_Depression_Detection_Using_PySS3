Almost not able to take it anymoreHi everybody. Sorry if this comes out weird Iâ€™m just awkward.

Iâ€™m about at my breaking point. I have panic attacks every time I get in a car, plane, bus, train etc. I canâ€™t go out with anyone. Canâ€™t be in the car at night. I even had a panic attack three minutes away from my apartment and I could even see my complex.

Itâ€™s been this way for 5 years. Iâ€™ve tried exercise, antidepressants (still on) and CBD oil (only made me sleepy and didnâ€™t help anxiety.) Iâ€™ve also been seeing a therapist for about half a year, and my panic attacks havenâ€™t budged (still going to therapy.)

I also hate how reality feels. When I look up from what Iâ€™m doing, everything just feels awful. Like â€œwow, this is real, and it sucks.â€ 

Iâ€™m about at the end of my rope and on Thursday Iâ€™m going to get some edibles (legal state) and maybe alcohol (not together.) If those donâ€™t work I think Iâ€™m going to end it. I canâ€™t stand having a horrible time traveling and affecting others with my anxiety. I just want to be able to go and do things, and thereâ€™s no point in going on if I canâ€™t do that or feel okay. 

Thanks for reading.
