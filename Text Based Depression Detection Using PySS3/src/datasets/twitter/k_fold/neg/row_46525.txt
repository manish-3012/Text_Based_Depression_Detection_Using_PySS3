Everyday...For the past 3 months I've thought about killing myself. I'm barely 20 and have lost so much so quickly.I've lost my family, my father's family, and my uncle's family. I've been homeless twice. I've lost both homes to someone elses alcoholism. I've been engaging in physical harm to myself to remind myself there's still real feeling. I've been faking emotions so long I forgot what genuine happiness was. The only time I've felt better was with cannabis but my license expired and in the house of my conservative christian mother they don't "believe" in it. I've been searching for a job for the past year and no luck whatsoever. Schools been one thing keeping me afloat, but a system error just took out two of my finals so I may not get to come back next year. I look around me where there was once people, there stands shades of joyous times past mocking me with knowledge that people used to really give a fuck. Everyday I think about just joining the military ,setting up my brother(my closest relative) as my beneficiary, and catch a bullet in the brain to just stop it. I've tried cutting my wrists to be stopped by the surprise release of the endorphins, and have twice tried to use painkillers and alcohol to od(ironically or luckily from your point of view, I have a high tolerance of both). The church doesn't help but aggravate the situation. Doing research into the religion and then having people get the whole thing wrong doesn't make me  any better but give me more reason to just snip it.
