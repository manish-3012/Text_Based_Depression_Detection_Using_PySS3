16 Year old guy who has 0 motivation for life.im 16. i cant be bothered with anything. i have no hope. i cant even be bothered to write with the right punctuation or grammar because what is the point? my life is the same boring loop of me doing nothing and i cant do anything about it. i want to die. i told god or whatever to enlighten me. he was silent, like always. why does he have to be a dick to me? dude i just want some happiness in my life. a genuine friend or a girlfriend or a reason to live or whatever. sure enough that shit doesnt just jump on your dick, i know that, but still i have put so much effort and it has never worked. it is what has led me to become this lazy motherfucker that probably sounds like an asshole. my father hates me, i dont talk to my family because theyre abusive cunts and ive grown into a judgemental asshat. i might jump off a building soon, do a backflip or whatever, ya know. but i want to cease to exist so that eternity will last no time, everything will go by so fast. the pain of boredom, lack of motivation and hatred will go away. my lazy, friend-less ass can go sleep forever. should be good, unless god enlightens me, or whatever. he doesnt exist right? this is probably the longest shit i have written in my whole life through my own will, but yeah... no effort put in. im a lazy motherfucking piece of shit, so i have been told, so i have accepted. this is just a long shitpost i dont really know what i expected to come out of this fucking mess but yeah... whatever.

tl dr; shitpost - im a lazy fuck who hates life
