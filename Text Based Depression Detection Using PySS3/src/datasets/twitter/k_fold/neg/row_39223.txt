The biggest sources of meeting someone to be in a relationship with don't work for me. I don't think life is worth living because I don't have access to the sources that do work for me.Bars &amp; nightclubs don't work for me because I don't drink alcohol, church doesn't work for me because I don't believe in religion, work doesn't work because they say "don't shit where you eat", and online dating doesn't work for me because the good sites cost money (tinder and okcupid suck) . 

The only place I know of to meet smart people is college but I dropped out of it, they aren't doing dance or fitness classes right now because of Covid-19, and meetups are out of the question too because of Covid-19. 

Does anyone have any advice or suicide the only way out of my loneliness of my situation? 

I probably won't get a lot of replies because no one knows what to say but thank you if you do comment.
