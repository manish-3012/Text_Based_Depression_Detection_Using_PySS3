Today is the day.Today is the day where I end my life. I had gotten help before but that didn't help at all. My relationship with my family isn't so great. I don't have many friends, and the friends I did have got away cause of my suicidal thoughts. Just got out of a 17 months relationship and she meant the world to me but it seems that I drove her away. I don't have much planned for the future. I even have thoughts of suicide almost 24/7. So what is the point of anything anymore.
