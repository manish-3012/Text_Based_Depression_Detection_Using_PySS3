I wish I could think of an eye-catching title so people would read this....I wish I was the complete opposite of what I am.

I'm unambitious, shy, scared of the future, unmotivated, depressed, and not very attractive. Even though I'm only seventeen, I just don't see the point in sticking around. I *know* there are people who care about me, but why does it matter? I'm still useless. 

I don't want to go back to school in September.

I don't want to work retail or food EVER again.

I don't want to deal with life. 

I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.
