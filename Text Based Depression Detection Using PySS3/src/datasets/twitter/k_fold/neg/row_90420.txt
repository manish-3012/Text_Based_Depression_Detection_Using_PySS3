i donâ€™t care about anyone and no one cares about mei canâ€™t form meaningful relationships with anyone. i see people my age having fun and making memories with one another and while i have a desire to be apart of something like that, i just canâ€™t form friendships or relationships that are meaningful in any way. 

i see myself as a selfish person and i see everyone else as selfish. 

i think this is why iâ€™ll end up killing myself. because iâ€™ve never felt â€œinâ€ with the rest of the world because i feel like an alien in any social situation. i want to be â€œnormalâ€ and have friends and a significant other but i could never see myself as being like one of them. 

i donâ€™t belong on this earth
