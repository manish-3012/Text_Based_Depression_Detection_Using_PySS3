Life feels meaningless at the momentI know this is all temporary but I just want to live right now. Instead of just waiting around for this covid thing to be over and I know there is still a lot I can do but it all feels so pointless to do anything right now itÂ´s just keeping yourself entertained and waiting for the day to be over, and when the pandemic is over it probably isnÂ´t going to change anyway.

I am not even sure why I still would want to live anywayÂ´s if itÂ´s just going to be the same shit anyway it is going to get very boring and lonely
