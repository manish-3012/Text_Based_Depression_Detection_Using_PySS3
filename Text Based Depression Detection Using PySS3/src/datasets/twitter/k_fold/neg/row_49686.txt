Being apart of my family is fucking depressingI donâ€™t fucking understand my dogshit parents.Every Sunday they keep bringing me to church knowing I hate going there plus, my dad doesnâ€™t even listen to the goddamn messages, the pastor literally points out the EXACT bullshit heâ€™s doing wrong.The pastor talks about not letting your children date non Christians my sister does that he talks about children moving away from church being the parents fault my sister did that and he doesnâ€™t give fuck which shows that he doesnâ€™t even fucking listen.So why drive an 1 hour there and back every week to waste 7 hours of my Sunday every week when his lung cancer ass doesnâ€™t even behave like a Christian.

Now my mom, she saves all her kindness and love for complete strangers and gives 0 fucks about me.A stranger was bringing his bike into a lift and she was quick to press the lift button to â€œkeep the lift openâ€ even though thereâ€™s fucking sensors there will already keep the door open.Her thoughts are filled with other childrenâ€™s safety and complete fucking strangers well being but not mine.When I tell her I donâ€™t want to go to church, sheâ€™s like oh thatâ€™s your problem you should tell dad yourself.Fuck sake I donâ€™t enough authority to just say fuck you I donâ€™t wanna go to church.

I really hope my dads lung cancer just takes his life soon I canâ€™t fucking take this shit anymore all this depression and the very that made me caused it and donâ€™t give a fuck.Everybody out there if youâ€™re not willing to actually care for your child then donâ€™t fucking breed.
