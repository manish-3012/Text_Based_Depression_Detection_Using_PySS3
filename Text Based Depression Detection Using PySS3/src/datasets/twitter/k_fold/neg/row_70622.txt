I may have severely damaged my brain by inhaling toxic fumes, and this makes me feel very despondent.Hello, and thank you for reading. I have never been inflicted with such an intense hopelessness in my life. I ordered acoustic foam, and after unsealing the air-tight packaging, a virulent smell came out. I began to worry that it would affect my cognitive skills, and I feel that it already has and is continuing to do so. I suddenly acquired a headache, I became nauseous, and I also started to feel very exhausted. I immediately fell onto my bed and went to sleep, with the toxic panels still in the room. I woke up, and here I am, still dizzy and nauseous, with a headache. Unless I throw them out, I am unable to place them outside of my room. I am stuck with them, and they are eating away at my brain, causing irreversible brain damage. I have done some research, and it appears that they may be a concoction of polyurethane and other chemicals.

I had aspirations, dreams, and other things that I wanted to do. These were not far off, either, as I had been working tirelessly on them. I can't believe that acoustic foam is going to destroy all of that. Without being at my peak, I will whither away into nothingness. I will no longer enjoy things. I can't think of a single that that I'd like to do, seeing as how my brain has been and is still being damaged.

I desperately want to die. It is the only solution to this ailment. I would love to die. It would be a harsh and brutal end to this misery, but I cannot bear this hopelessness any longer. Please know that I had dreams and things that I wanted to complete. I have enjoyed the exhilarating thrill of creativity; I have seen its awesome ability to entrance the mind, and the thought of never having another creative, apt thought fills me with despair.
