My cat Larry is the only reason Iâ€™m aliveIâ€™m 26. Failed in and out of my RDH program but finally graduating... I donâ€™t feel happiness. Iâ€™m very single and I romanticize the thought to be a wife one day, and have children. Thatâ€™s my dream. Since 18 years old Iâ€™ve never had on a paper real relationship just â€œtalking and flingsâ€ with guys. Every one of my friends around me has families or starting too. I have plans to rehome my cat Larry in March, I dread it. Heâ€™s the best. Truly, I donâ€™t want to die, I just want things to get better. The past 8 years they havenâ€™t, every day I think of it. Iâ€™ve been cuddling Larry extra because come March he isnâ€™t going to get it from me
