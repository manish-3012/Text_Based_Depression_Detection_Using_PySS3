PLEASE PLEASE HELP. I NEED TO HELP SOMEONE.I've posted here before, but this is a different situation.

A friend of mine has been threatening suicide and I am trying to keep him here for as long as possible. He's been physically and emotionally abused by his family, and there's nothing I can do to about it. I've been listening, but I'm very afraid he's hanging on by a thread. Every day is getting harder for him. I'm extremely afraid.

I need help. I don't know what to do in this situation. Depression, I've dealt with, but not abuse. Please help me, I'm very worried about his well-being.
