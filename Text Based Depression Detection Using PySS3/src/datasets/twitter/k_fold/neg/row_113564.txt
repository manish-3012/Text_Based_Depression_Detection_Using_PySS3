I have no idea what to do anymoreI've been working in a dead-end career for the last 10 years of my life in the hopes that someone would give me the chance to at least lead a team. When I finally did get the opportunity, it didn't come with the title change (which I realized after the fact is all that matters, not actually having fucking done the work required).

I cannot escape my daily stress at home between my girlfriend constantly fucking up anything and everything (she is extremely scatter-brained) and the fact that my current roommates have stated that they don't wish to socialize with us anymore (though that doesn't stop the guy in the couple we live with from sending me pissed off texts, accusing us of losing/destroying/stealing 10 bowls).

I can't go back to school because I apparently make too much. I can't get a better place to live in because I don't make enough. I am terrified every day of my car not starting because I'm reaching 118,000 miles on it and have no way of replacing or repairing the vehicle if it breaks down. No matter how much I struggle, I can't seem to make my lot in life any better and I just don't see an end to it.

The thought of taking my own life has crossed my mind more than once recently and, though I am too frightened to do it right now, I don't know how much longer I can go before I just can't mentally take it anymore. Do I keep waiting for it to get better? Do I keep working my ass off for no reward? And before someone hops in here saying, "it'll get better" I've been working my ass off on 60+ hour weeks, slaving away for next to fucking nothing and it hasn't gotten better no matter how much work I've put in. If it does get better, then how and when?
