im so FUCKING done with everythingmy life is shit. im so fucking tired of waking up, feeling anxious about doing anything, cutting, skipping school cuz when i went to school people told me to kill myself and i remember this one day when a group of dudes just appeared out of nowhere and started punching me without any reason. my teacher saw this but he didnt do ANYTHING to stop it from happening. one day someone put SHIT inside my bag and told me to tell nobody about it or he would fucking kill me. i started cutting like 2 years ago and it honestly has helped me to survive this fucking unfair world where we live in. i have had only one gf in my whole life. we had been together for over two years and she was honestly the best thing in my life. i actually felt happiness but then i caught her cheating on me. after that i started cutting. i am also diagnosed with aspergersÂ syndrome which makes it so FUCKING hard to live a normal life. i hope this shit fucking ends soon. i want to do it on the christmas day so nobody is going to care because they have other better things to do.
