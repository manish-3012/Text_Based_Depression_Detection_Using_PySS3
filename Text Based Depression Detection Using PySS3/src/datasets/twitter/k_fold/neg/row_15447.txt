Suicide hotline made me more suicidalIÂ´ve been on-off suicidal for a very long time and in and out of hospitalization and... I got quarantined a couple of days ago which is just Not Good for my mental health. I reached out to a local suicide hotline chat, because the calling option was closed. And I wrote how I was feeling. This counselor who is hired to talk to suicidal people told me to call my counselors. I said I was too tired to call anyone, and all I wanted to do was die, but my friends had convinced me to call out to this service. I also said I donÂ´t think just calling them is going to help, because it hasnÂ´t for the last year, they just numb the thoughts with some temporary medication and then itÂ´s back. She said you dont know that. I said all I feel right now is that IÂ´m scared, what if I fail WHEN I try this time? She said "I hope you get more energy and I wish you a good night. Goodbye." And ended the chat. I havenÂ´t done anything yet but. That stuck with me. If they canÂ´t even be bothered to talk to me, who will? She just. Ended the chat there.
