I think I'm gonna do itI'm done with being treated like shit by my family for being myself, having an opinion, and liking what I do. Sorry if this seems like a pity-party but I've lost so many friends and someone I was really close to killed themselves a few days ago. I've already planned everything and am doing multiple things to ensure I don't make it out tonight. Goodbye guys.
