Iâ€™m hopefully going to kill myself in a monthIâ€™m just done this year has destroyed my will to continue.

The person I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with is now with someone else, Iâ€™ve lost all of my friends and my best friend is finally fed up with me. My brother doesnâ€™t give a shit about me or even messages anymore, My mum used to be supportive but now itâ€™s full of â€œIt happensâ€ or â€œyouâ€™ll be fineâ€ I feel like Iâ€™ve lost everything that has kept me here for the past 5 years.

Iâ€™m on new meds and still feel this way itâ€™s pathetic, Therapy hasnâ€™t helped for the past year and they want to get me with a new one in February but I honestly wonâ€™t last that long. I just hope I have the balls to do it soon and not be a bitch about it.
