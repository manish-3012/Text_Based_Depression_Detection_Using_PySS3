I can't keep goingI've tried. So hard. I've had major depressive disorder since I was 13 but it's never been this bad. It's been like this for almost 2 years now. 2 suicide attempts. Anxiety. Depression. Hospitalization. I've lost friends and my sister isn't speaking to me any more. I lost two jobs but I finally found one that was going okay....but I can't keep up. I can't make it through 5 days straight of work. I'm exhausted. I know people at work think I'm weird and some of them don't like me. They don't know how hard I'm trying, how hard it is just to get out of bed. My boyfriend and I can't afford to have me not work, so if I quit, we won't be able to support ourselves. I had therapy but can't go anymore because I work full time. I'm on meds but they aren't helping much. We thought maybe it was the birth control but going off it hasn't seemed to make much of a difference. 

I can't keep doing this. Every day is a struggle and there's no indication it's going to get any better. My boyfriend always says it will. But he got in a car accident and I've had to drive him to school for almost a month, which makes me even more tired, all because the other driver didn't have a license and his insurance ruled him not at fault for rear ending my boyfriend. Now boyfriends grandmother died and I can't go to the funeral because I have to work. I feel like that's wrong...that jobs somehow own us that much. That we miss out on such important things because work. That I have to put myself through this just to live. That I don't even have time to get the help I need--it's eat or see the therapist, not both. 

I can't keep going like this. With the state of the world and the state of my life and no indication it'll ever change...i  will just keep dragging myself on day after day after day or lose everything. 

I have a plan. This time it will work.
