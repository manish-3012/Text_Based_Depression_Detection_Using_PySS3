I Have No Choice but to Kill MyselfI'm 21 years old and as much as I hate it, my life is pretty much over. I've thought about it a lot lately and I can't think of a single thing that would make me happy. I'm overweight, freakishly tall, I am constantly used by my family and other people around me, I have no hobbies, I'm a NEET with $5000 worth of debt, I've never been in a relationship or had sex with anyone, and at the end of the day, it's all my fault. I can't remember the last time I felt content with life (except for when I was tripping on psychadelic mushrooms). My mom died when I was 13 and after that, my dad kinda stopped caring about being a good parent. He provided food and shelter but that was about it. I've tried hard to get out of the situation I always find myself in but I always fail because the one constant is me. I'm the problem. I'm a worthless piece of shit who can't do anything right, and though maybe people enjoy being around me occasionally, given enough time they'll learn to despise me. Even if things changed, even if I was making $100,000 a year, with a beautiful wife, and close friends, I still don't think I would be happy. I'm just a broke human being and I can't seem to be fixed, even after years of therapy. I truly believe I was destined to kill myself. I don't know why. I'm not religious, but if there is a god, I'm sure he's laughing his ass off at me. I really wish things were different. I'm terrified of death but at this point I have no choice. I would go to a mental hospital (again) but I doubt it would help me very much, and I don't have insurance anyways and I don't want to further contribute to my insurmountable debt. I can't change for some reason. I'm just done. I'm terrified of death, and while I hate to imagine how my suicide will affect my dad, I can't see any other way out of this misery.
