Give me reasons not to kill myselfMy job sucks, but I don't know what else to do + locked in contract until end of January.
I don't have any hobbies. I spend all day on Reddit or reading self-improvement crap. I have read all the standard books, but I don't care about them. I feel like the authors are not really trying to help.
I don't have any friends. I can barely deal with my parents. Other people just annoy the shit out of me.

Life is simply no fun and there's no improvement in sight. 

Not sure if I make it to the end of this year.
