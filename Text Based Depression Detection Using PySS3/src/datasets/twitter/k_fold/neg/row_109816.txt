What can i do?im 14 year old boy and i have been feeling down for over 3 years now.
It all started when i moved to mexico i lost all my friends and i did not know how to speak spanish, all my teachers treated me like shit no one wanted to hang out with me at lunch so i spent 1 year of school being alone, every day they made fun of me and i mostly failed all my subjects.
Since my sister left and she is now living by herself in the USA my mom has been really mean everyday, every day she calls me a use less person and that i know nothing, i try to not talk to her but sometimes i need to ask her stuff and she always brings it up, im doing ok in school i could do better since im smart but honestly it has gotten to the point where i no longer give a shit, every day im sad and im starting to think about ending myself and stop the suffering, i know that if a kill my self my mom would probs die so that is what is holding me back of ending myself.
I get home from school and all i do is play video games, i try to escape reality and go into the world of counter strike, dota 2, and other great games, my parents hate gaming and they always call me a lazy piece of shit but like i said i dont care, i have met some really nice people online and i talk to them everyday, when im gaming i feel happy i feel like im actually worth something when i get that ace in csgo or i win the round and they say "good job dude" that always  makes me feel good, i am smart but i dont get good grades in school so idk ill see u guys later i guess.
thank you if u reply btw
