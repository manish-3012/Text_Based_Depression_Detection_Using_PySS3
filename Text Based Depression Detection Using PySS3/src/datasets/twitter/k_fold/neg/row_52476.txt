I have only 15 bucks left for this monthBecause of covid I lost my job and been living in my savings. Now I have only 15 bucks left. I won't be able to pay rents or other bills next month. I'm thinking about reaching out to my parents and friends. But my parents are poor and those friends have already helped a lot in the past so I don't want to put them in uncomfortable situation. What should I do now?
