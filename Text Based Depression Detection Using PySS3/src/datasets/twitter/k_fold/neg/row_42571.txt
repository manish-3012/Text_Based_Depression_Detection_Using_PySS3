I lost someone to suicide and I'm ready to goThree years ago, the day after Thanksgiving, my boyfriend sent me a text that said I was the best girlfriend he ever had, and that he was thankful for having me.  I didn't hear for him for three days.  We weren't living together at the time, but it was still odd to go without contact for that long, so I went to his house.  I remember vividly going up to his house and seeing his cat in the window.  I went inside and found him dead.

I went into shock after that.  Three years later, I'm married.  Recently, I contracted Lyme Disease and I have had a severe decline in mental and physical capacities.  I think about Mike a lot.  I think about his cat in the window, and I know why he did it.

The urge to do it so overwhelming.  Wouldn't it just be easier than being in pain all the time?  Being in debt from medical expenses?  Not having to think about Mike or the miscarried babies?  Wouldn't it be easier just to SLEEP?

God, I'm tired.
