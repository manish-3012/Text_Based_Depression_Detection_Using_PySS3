This is not an act of depressionIâ€™ve considered suicide since the age of 14. It has stuck with me for 14 years now. For about 12 of those years, itâ€™s been about depression. 

Now, it really isnâ€™t. Iâ€™m not depressed anymore. Lifeâ€™s been fine/good enough for awhile. Iâ€™ve just realized, thereâ€™s no fucking point.

Why do so many people try so hard to keep others from committing suicide? Whatâ€™s the big deal? 

At this point, Iâ€™m considering suicide because I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s any point to life. It becomes more and more obvious to me each day that there is no god. Escaping the cult of Mormonism after 23 years in it led me to research the shit out of religion and â€œgodâ€, and itâ€™s never been more clear to me that there is no fucking â€œgod.â€ 

Iâ€™m happy to finally say that my suicidal ideation is not a product of depression. Maybe more so curiosity.
