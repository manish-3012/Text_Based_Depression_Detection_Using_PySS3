Please stop calling people toxicI have a serious mental health diagnosis. I have been working on my behaviour with professionals for ten years. I have problematic behaviour stemming from childhood abuse, and which I'm aware of and actively trying to control. 

I'm scared to talk to anyone to let them know what's going on. I can't talk about my behaviour to anyone close to me because I know what people with think. I already hate myself enough. Even simple things can be so hard for me. Two choices really, either stop being cruel to people you consider toxic and realise that they may not be inherently bad people, or just let us kill ourselves in a loving environment without pain. This is going to hurt so much, but I've woken in hospital so many times from a drug overdose that I realise it isn't going to work. I don't want to wake up this time. I just wish I could slip away quietly and my last experience in life didn't have to be so horrible. 

Please try to think a little deeper before you write someone off. I'm sorry if I caused anyone pain, but I can assure you my miserable life is the biggest punishment I could have. Maybe the person this post reminds you of is feeling that way too.
