Back Again, Wasting TimeNow with intense self-destructive impulses and a plan. I recently started self harming. Hitting, cutting, stabbing myself with random shit in class. I can't stand myself for wasting this much time breaking myself when I have this much work to do.

It's so joyless. I texted the lifeline yesterday after testing short drop hanging, it only took about five seconds to see black splotches in my peripherals and it's even more infuriating knowing I probably won't go through with it any time soon. I waited an hour for an operator who essentially told me to stop causing myself problems "out of nowhere." I desperately want to, but I can't, and it's why I want to hurt myself.

My parents see this dark cloud hanging over me and my mom probably suspects something about self harm. My friends keep telling me to relax, but genuinely, I can't do that anymore without feeling the need to physically punish myself. I just feel so incessantly inferior, I'm so fucking fed up with myself.
