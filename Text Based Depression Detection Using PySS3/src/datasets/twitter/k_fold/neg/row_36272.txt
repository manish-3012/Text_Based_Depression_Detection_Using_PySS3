I hate this feelingI feel so strongly that I need to die, I know it's the best option. Yet, I know I can't do it, I won't. Every thought brings conflict. I tie my noose  but I still think about what I'm doing tomorrow. I think about living and I remind myself of all the reasons I want to die. College was supposed to go well. No stress from my family. A chance to learn new things. Instead I gave up. I kept digging myself deeper. I'm going to fail every class I'm taking. I'm not stupid, I could be at the top of my classes most likely. But I'm lazy, I can barely motivate myself to eat or move. I do well for short periods of time, but I always end up fucking up and I know that will never change. I will do this to myself again and again. Death is the best solution. But that cold logic doesn't stop me from crying with fear when I put the noose around my neck. It's almost 4:00 am, one of my few chances for redemption in my best class is at 10 am. I will probably sleep through it. Maybe that guilt will be enough push myself over the edge.
