Scared and alone. Don't see a point.My friends and family know I have been struggling lately but not how much. Scared to look up therapists or call. Scared to call the suicide hotline. But I've bruised myself tonight a lot; I want to keep going. I don't know if I can do it anymore. I don't see a point in life. Honestly, thinking/talking about suicide calms me down because that way I see a way out. I feel lost and lonely. I don't know what to do.
