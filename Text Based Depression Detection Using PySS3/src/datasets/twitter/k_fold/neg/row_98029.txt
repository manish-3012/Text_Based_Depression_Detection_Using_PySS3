I have a huge urge to cause harm to myself, but I can't and it makes me feel very frustratedAfter previous suicide attempts, my parents have hidden anything that I might use to cause harm to myself. I still get a constant desire to cause physical harm to myself. I feel like I need to express my internal pain somehow. I can't cry much anymore. I don't have anyone to talk to, and even when I do have someone, either I can't express myself or the other person gets tired of me. Then, I get this urge to cut myself, which I have done before, but I'm also having other horrible thoughts. But I don't have access to anything that I could use to do it. I know that's "good", but I feel so frustrated that I can't cause this harm to myself. I don't know what to do. I want to scream but I can't. Everything is just so horrible.
