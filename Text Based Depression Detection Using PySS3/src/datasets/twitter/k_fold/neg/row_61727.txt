I hate it when people tell me it gets betterI mean yeah, these sorrows will go away at some point but they will come back with more of their kind. They always have and they always will. By going away for a short time they give me the false hope that things would get better in the future but I know that they won't. The only thing that would stop these feelings would be a bullet in my head. I've been living like this since I was 13 and I can't take it anymore. I hate myself. I hate the person I am. I hate the way I act and feel but I know I can't change anything about it. Everyday the thought of suicide becomes more real. It's not an abstract wish anymore. I daydream about various ways of committing suicide all day every day.
