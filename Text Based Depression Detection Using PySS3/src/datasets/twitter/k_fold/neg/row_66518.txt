I don't deserve to live.I'm a shitty human being. All I have ever done is caused harm wherever I go. I've tried changing, but I just get worse. It would be in my best interest to do the world a favour, and just kill myself. I've tried before and I lost a lot of blood and I was permanently scarred due to my incompetence; but I won't mess up this time around.

If anyone of my family finds this, I'm sorry for being a horrible brother and son. I hope you can forgive me eventually, I know you will call me selfish and won't understand why I did what I did. To my exes, I'm sorry for not being the man that I said I was. I lied to everyone. I lied about everything, especially with regards to how I'm doing in life. If you want me to be honest, no I'm not okay. I never have been. Ever. Don't ever think I will be, and at this point in time I don't see a benefit to me continuing to be a burden to society.

All I ever wanted was to be happy, I guess this is the next best thing.
