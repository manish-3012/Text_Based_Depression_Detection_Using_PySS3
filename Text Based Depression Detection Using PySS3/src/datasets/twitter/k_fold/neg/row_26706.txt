I'm tired of livingYou know, it's very hard that I try my best for everything in life and nothing goes right. I'm tired of always failing, I'm tired of trying to be supportive to the people I love to get treated bad, tired of trying to get an approvel of my parents. I don't think i'll be here much long. I'm 2 steps to actually hang myself just to make all my problems dissapear.
