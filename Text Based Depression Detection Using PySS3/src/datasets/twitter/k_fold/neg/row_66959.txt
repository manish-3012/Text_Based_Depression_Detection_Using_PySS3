I donâ€™t want to ask for help because Iâ€™ll have to tell my parents the truthIâ€™ll have to tell my parents that Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for years. That I cut myself. That Iâ€™m bisexual. That they never had a daughter at all. They wonâ€™t ever accept me and the world wonâ€™t either. Itâ€™ll become real. I just want to disappear and have no one notice.
