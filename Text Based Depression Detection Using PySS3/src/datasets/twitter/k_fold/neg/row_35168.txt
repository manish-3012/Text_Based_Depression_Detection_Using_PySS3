What's the Point?Why do I have to keep trying so hard for everyone else's sake? I don't kill myself because people around me will be sad. But for what? They need to realize that everything and everyone would be better off without me.

I continue to work hard anyway because I don't want to disappoint anyone. But nothing is fulfilling to me. I don't have any sense of pride or achievement for anything I do.

Friends? What is that? I've tried so hard to make friends, keep them, only for them to move on from me for whatever reason. Whether it's because I screwed up again, or they found someone else better to hang out with, or they think I'm unreasonable... In the end, I'm not good enough for anyone. At this point, I feel like only my family cares about me just out of obligation rather than anything else.

Even my "best friend" has abandoned me. After all I've said about just wanting some encouragement every now and then or wanting to feel wanted... All that I'm told is that my happiness is too reliant on them and that they can't help because of that.

If my best friend doesn't even want me, then who does? There's no one out there who wants me.

Honestly, I wish I could die. I wish that painless terminal disease would happen and take me away quickly so that there's no guilt to it or anything. Anytime my family tells me I need to go to the doctor regularly to make sure that my body's fine, I just keep thinking to myself that I'd rather something happen anyway.

I don't want to live anymore. But I can't kill myself either. I don't know what to do. I just want to give up.
