I almost died today...I almost died today..... Im 28 and Iâ€™m a woman.  I think of suicide like sleep ... peace.  Iâ€™ve lived many many horrible things ( i know thereâ€™s worst). But 2 male members in my family raped me, one of them today acts like it never happened. Tells me how much he loves me ... and the worst part is I love him too heâ€™s my brother but it was a horrible childhood and each time I see him I want to cry ... why did he do this to me ?? .  With a mother who barely said to me she loved me, an absent and alcoholic dad.... Being bullied in school my whole life.  I found love real young i was 19... I thought the pain was over . He took all the pain away ! For years I was happy , But he cheated on me many times ... I had to let him go. Three kids later and him gone ......The  pain came back again tonight it hit me like a train and left me breathless .... i ...cant take it it hurts mentally yes but physically too, like if a hot rod was plunged in my soul.  Im the type of person that loves very hard and I help people as much As I can, I try to do some good around me.  Tonight I tied a rope around my neck and tried to fall asleep. Yes I know the kids ... what if they found me ? The need their mom .... but I want die I have never been so sure or so close to doing it and i was at peace, I was smiling and the pain was gone again for the short moment I was numb, lacking of air.  It didnâ€™t work this time.  The kids will have a good life with their father and grand parents they wonâ€™t be short of love and care.   

So I will be doing it again When I will be alone, I wanted to talk about it , good night thank you for reading.
