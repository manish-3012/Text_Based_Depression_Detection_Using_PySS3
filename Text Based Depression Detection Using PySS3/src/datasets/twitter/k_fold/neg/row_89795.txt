Life is killing me.It's one of those nights where my bones feel heavy, where it feels like my ribcage is a ziptie around my chest. I'm cold, and even my fluffy blanket isn't keeping me warm. I have a test tomorrow. I'll do okay, but not great. I lost my place to live because of overcrowding at my university. I tried to tell my mom about what was going wrong, hoping for an "It's okay", and getting nothing but mild disinterest, the same for the few happy things that happened. Earlier today, I had mumbled to my boyfriend about how I missed my mom. I don't think she misses me. She didn't say I love you. I had a dream that I was laughing and joking with my younger self. She seemed a lot happier. She had such nice, long curly hair and a body without stretch marks and chronic pain. She told me it was okay to go to sleep for a long time. I cried. I woke up crying. Crying about how lovely it would be for all of this to be over. Crying about how I would be leaving behind such a wonderful boyfriend. I wish I could tell him, but I'm selfish. I don't want him to leave, but I want him to forget me so he won't ever be hurt If I die. He deserves so much more than me. I know I'll never get better, but some days, I wish I would. It's so hard to breathe. It's one of those nights.
