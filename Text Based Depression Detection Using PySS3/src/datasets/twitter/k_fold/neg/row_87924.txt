Going to shot myselfToday on r/askreddit someone asked what was a life changing advice I got on Reddit and I said that this subredddit saved my life so many times. 
You guys gave me a lil comfort and company when I was alone in my deepest and darkest, you were my faith in humanity, keep it going pls 
I just wanted to thank each one of you and please be good to each other.
