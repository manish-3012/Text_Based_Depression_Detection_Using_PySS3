Feeling the worst. I want this to just be overI feel like an idiot for continuing to post on here but the alternative is keeping it in. I don't want to bother anyone.  I've been told before that I just like the attention.  That's not why I go looking for support.  I don't want attention from anyone.  I really don't understand why I post instead of just keeping a journal.  I'm sorry if I took up your time.
