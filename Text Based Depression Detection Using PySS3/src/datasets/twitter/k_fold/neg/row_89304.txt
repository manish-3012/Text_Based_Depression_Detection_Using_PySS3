How do i change thingsThe same exact things happen every single day...like, not metaphorically, *literally*. The same exact words, constantly, throughout the day, over and over and over. I don't know what to reply with anymore. I just feel like killing myself.

I want to hope it'll get better but I feel like I'm living the same fucking day on repeat, CONSTANTLY. The only  way to get out of this loop is to kill myself. If I don't I'm just stuck in it, hearing the same thing every day in and out every five minutes every hour, experiencing it all again over and over, crying myself to sleep again. 

I don't know what to do. Therapy won't change the loop, meds wont, *nothing* will. If I have to live this day over and over and over and over I'd rather just fucking kill myself.
