How i got my life back in orderThis is a long post, sorry for my english.

I want to start by saying that it is important to listen to your psychologist, treat yourself like you would treat your bestfriend if he/she were in your shoes. Also, take your medication, i know how hard it is to get out of bed when dealing with depression and (for me) meds were the thing that suppressed my negative emotions just enough to get things done.

Remember, getting out of depression is a marathon, not a sprint.

About a year and a half ago, i started really hating my self, and for good reasons (i thought). I started doing all the drugs i could find, almost overdosed a couple times cause i didnt care, i stopped working, stopped going to school, stopped working out, i was very self destructive because i was gonna kill myself whenever it was too much.

In september, i was a good student, i was kind and had never touched drugs, i was working out 5 times a week and by december, i had nothing, i was done, i never thought i could ever get out of the mess that was my life.

Just before christmas, my best friend (now girlfriend) invited me to go to miami with her for a week, i said yes and during that trip, we finally got in a serious relationship, this is what i needed, i had hope, i wanted to get better.

So when i got back, i started seeing a psychologist, and i started taking medication, sadly, i couldnt afford to see my psychologist after a while, but i still had hope. Heres how i got my life back on track.

I was going to "tidy up my life", one thing at a time.
First, i wanted to get rid of my addiction, to do that, i smoked 3 joints a day until i was used to it, then i smoked 2 joints a day, after that it was 1, then i started only smoking before going to sleep and one day, i was smoking 1 puff a day before going to sleep. After that, i stopped. Remember, its marathon.

Now i was addiction free, but i wanted to clean my place because it was disgusting, i think some of you will relate, i couldnt see the floor in my room, my bed was a storage space for anything that could fit, i had nothing to eat with because all of my plates had been in the sink for a while, i had no furniture except for a tv, a couch and an old table that used to be white but was now a mess of colours. So one day, i decided to clean my room, it took me 3 days, but in the end my clothes were in bags and my bed was only a bed. After that i did the kitchen, same thing there, it took days and i had to throw the plates in the garbage, but it was clean, same thing for the living room and bathroom. After 2 weeks, my place was clean. 

Now, i was addiction free and my place was clean, but i wanted some money so i got a job, i worked only 14h a week because i knew that i couldnt do more, and it was okay.

Now, i was addiction free, my place was clean and i made 800$ a month. But i was tired of the meds, so i stopped taking them, sadly, i didnt stop the right way so it was hard. I started being very anxious all the time, i was having panic attacks and for 3 months life was hell, but since my life was somewhat in order now, i got through it, and after 3 months, i wasnt on any medication.

Now i was addiction free blah blah blah and i wanted some furniture, so i got some with my 800$ a month,  i got a 50$ table and a 25$ table for my tv. Not much but it was good.

Then, at the beginning of summer, i started working out again, life wasnt great, but it was okay. Then, in august, i wanted to go back to school, so i looked for online programs in universities outside of quebec because my grades were too bad to go to university in quebec, and god damn i was accepted by a university for the fall semester.

I was now addiction free, my place was clean, i had a stable job, i was working out, i was off meds and i was in university. My life was back on track.

Right now, im making 1700$ a month working a job i like, im getting ready for my exams, im trying to start a buisness with my cousin and i smoke weed from time to time. It was a marathon, it took a year and a half but im now better than i ever was.

Dont give up, it is a lot to deal with, there is a lot of work to do, but every single thing you do will make the next thing easier, take your time. Do not hate yourself for who you are, depression is not a choice, it is real, and there is hope. Do one thing at a time, not matter how small it is, if you wash 1 dish a day, well god damn it is still 1 more every day, remember it took me 1 year and a half to deal with my shit. I hope my post was enough to help at least one person.

Depression is a marathon, if you sprint, you will lose your breath, but if you walk, you will find the end, no matter how far it is.
