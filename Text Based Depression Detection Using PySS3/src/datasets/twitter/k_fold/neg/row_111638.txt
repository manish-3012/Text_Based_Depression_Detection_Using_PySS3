Iâ€™m trappedI reeeeeally want to die. Iâ€™m so feckin pathetic, worthless and dysfunctional. My life really sucks I swear, and that is probably bc of me. And Iâ€™m transgender and my parents subtly humiliate me for that constantly and that adds 100 more percent to my screwed up condition. I see others live normally and that makes me really sad and Iâ€™m not able to do simple tasks also I have terrible social anxiety.
Ughhh. I donâ€™t know what to do now. Every day is hell. I have no way of getting to a thereapist since my parents do not acknowledge anything, but anyways my family will not be able to afford a therapist. Iâ€™m not dead yet just because of my friend who tries to help me, but honestly it doesnâ€™t really work, and I am worried about not talking to her because I really do not know how to talk to people. I didnâ€™t have any friends before her, so I rarely ever talk to anyone, even her. And my anxiety makes it only worse. 
So, I really want to die, but I donâ€™t want to worry my friend, whoâ€™s the most wholesome person in the world. 
What I want is some advice. What do I do now?!? I am really desperate. This is a nightmare.

And I apologize that what Iâ€™m saying is all over the place.
