My friend is going to kill himselfHe was being bullied by someone and said he was going to kill himself. I see him the next day and he jams a bus ticket from me and i snap at him. Then he calls me and said thats the last call im hearing from him. I kept texting him sorry and dont die and he isnt listening. He said its all my fault. Wtf? How do i cope with this
