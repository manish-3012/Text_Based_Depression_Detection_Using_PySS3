I cant do it anymoreIdk how I'm even writing this.. i have a baby sister. I don't wanna die, but I think I'm gonna do it. I have no support system. I have 0 dollars in my bank account. I need food, gas for my car. My propane is out, so I have no heat. I can't do it anymore. I'm going to shower soon and I'm bringing a knife with me.
