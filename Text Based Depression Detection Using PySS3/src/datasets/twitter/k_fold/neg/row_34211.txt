My problems are permanent.I have always thought about ending it, ever since I was 9 years old. I have been abandoned by my own family (in the most literal sense), I will always be cast aside, thought of as "less of a person". Nobody listens, everyone assumes I am ignorant, that I am not worthy of a second thought. I'm sorry for my kind demeanor and huge heart, because all it has brought me is pain. 

Nobody calls me first to spend time with, I am a last resort. I'm boring. Happy things make me sad, sad things make me sad. There's no winning. There are people in my life, but they won't do more than give a sad story at my funeral and move on. What's the point of it all?
