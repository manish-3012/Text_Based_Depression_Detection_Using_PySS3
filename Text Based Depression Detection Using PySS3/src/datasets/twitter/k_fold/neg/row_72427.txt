I don't have a titleI just cant find a reason to live and im 15
I look in the mirror and I hate the person i see
I feel like im at a dead end 
I see that i make good grades but i also see that if go to college its possible i wont get a job or even a job i want to do 
I see that our planet is going to fail to provide life for my generation and further
I hate being the exposable friend 
My friends will ask if im okay at times but i am forcedto have to sit away from them in classes and am never offered a seat next to them
Every day my mom gets off work and she comes home and barely does anything to make my dad upset and he starts treating her like she is subhuman 
I am ugly and fat 
I want to date people but they wouldn't go out with someone like me 
I try to imagine that i live with someone likes to be around me 
I am scared to die am i weak for being scared or strong because i havnt killed myself
