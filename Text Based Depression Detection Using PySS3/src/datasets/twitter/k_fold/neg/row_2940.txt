Antidepressants.Hello...

I would like to know experiences in using anti-depressants.


- What antidepressants are you using?
- How long it took for them work?
- What was the side effect like and how long they harmed you?
- If you could go back for never using them, would you?


I wish many people would answer, it would mean the world to me.
