Should I just give up?Everything seems just so hopeless, my has been going downhill for the last 8 years or so and I can literally not even imagine anything changing for the better.

I recently dropped out of school due to my literally crippling social anxiety and depression. I canâ€™t even leave the house anymore. Besides that, Iâ€™m nearly blind and transgender. My family is falling apart and if they knew that Iâ€™m trans, I canâ€™t even imagine how theyâ€™d react. I donâ€™t really have a support system and only a handful of online friends that unfortunately live relatively far away. I obviously donâ€™t have a job or any income and donâ€™t really have the right for any benefits or something of that kind. I live in Germany and am 18 years old. Everything just seems so hopeless and how I said, I literally cannot imagine anything changing for the better.
