Should I tell my housemates that Im suicidal? (Male, 19)I dont know if this is the right place to ask, but

I messed up really bad this time. 

Two days ago,  I cut my arm repeatedly and leaving a bunch of  wounds. I uses bandages to cover it up, but i know sooner or later the bandages will loose and reveal it self when Im not aware. 

Now that I'm back to college, im scared that my friends will find out my secret. Im pretty good hiding my pain in front of them. But this time I doubt I can do it. 

I know they will ask about it. And I dont know what to say. I always be that guy who make stupid jokes all the times. I dont want to messed my friendship with them since it one of things that keep me alive. 

This will be easier if I live in a surrounding that aware about suicide/depression. But im not. Here, suicide is considered "taboo" and if someone talk about it? Well you will labeled as someone who is weak and stupid. 

Im sorry for my english. Please give me advice.
