I constantly think about being dead. And I can't really talk to anyone about itFor the past several years Iâ€™ve been fantasizing about being dead. Not killing myself, or any active participation in the dying aspect. Just â€œwouldnâ€™t it be great if I was hit by a bus right nowâ€ or â€œif I just dropped dead of an aneurism.â€ In the past year these thoughts have become far more intrusive. They crop up all the time. I could be having a good time laughing with friends or family and Iâ€™ll think: â€œif I fell off of here I could be dead right now, thatâ€™d be great.â€ 
Iâ€™m not even distressed or freaked out by these thoughts anymore, theyâ€™ve become so constant theyâ€™re just a fact of life for me now. When I think about it too much I feel ashamed and embarrassed to want to be dead when my life isnâ€™t really that hard or fucked up. I love my family and they are loving and awesome. But I just feel like Iâ€™ve dug this deep, dark hole and someone is filling it in on top of me and I canâ€™t get out.  
I had a panic attack yesterday  and sobbed for a few hours over absolutely nothing. Then today I imagined blowing my brains out. Itâ€™s the first time one I took an active role in one of my morbid daydreams. It really freaked me out, shocked and horrified. Iâ€™m not suicidal right now.  Immediately after the idea popped into my head I thought of what it would do to my mother, then I felt all sorts of awful. And helpless.
I really just donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I havenâ€™t and donâ€™t really want to bring it up with my friends and family. To have the awkward conversation about how I donâ€™t actually want to kill myself I just want to be dead, to cease to exist. 
Sorry I just really needed to get it out.
