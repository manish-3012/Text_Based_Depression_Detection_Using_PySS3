I just want to be dead.I don't know why I want to die. I'm young. I'm attractive. I'm doing very well in my life with the stars as the limits; but I hate myself and I hate living. My girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. I left her. It was toxic. But holy fuck is it driving me crazy. Literally insane. I'm in the Army and have been seen by an army shrink. They want to kick me out. It started by my ex pointing out to me about a year ago that I've been different. I struggle with alcoholism, shit I'm getting lit right now. The Army says its clinical depression and some sort of anxiety disorder. I just always go to the worst case scenario in my head and always have that tight sinking feeling in my stomach. Always. I'll be driving home and think "if I take off my seatbelt and hit that tree going 90 it'll be over." I woke up on my bedroom floor several months ago with a gun in my hand. My plan was to get blackout and kill myself. I decided to listen to what the army says and "talk to someone about it." Didn't fucking work out. My chain of command handled it terribly. They humiliated me in front of my unit. I can't talk to them. The only reason that I won't do it is because of my sister. I love her dearly, and I don't want her to go through that pain. But Jesus fucking Christ do I just want it to be over.
