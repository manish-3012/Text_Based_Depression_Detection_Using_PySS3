Contemplating suicideI'm in my mid-late 20s, musician primarily who made his living through cover bands, wedding bands, cruise ships, independent music on the side, and a seasonal part time gig once in my life. Due to covid, I have no way to make a living. I'm on unemployment and have been searching for jobs daily and can't seem to land an interview for a minimum wage despite making roughly $35k a year in music on my own. I feel like a failure and having to lie on online applications that I'm some sort of outgoing person when I'm very much a loner tears apart at my soul and my very core beliefs on morality and being an honest person. I feel trapped, I've had over a decade worth of therapy, I was raised by hoarders in an apartment complex with meth heads and prostitutes all through high school, and only now after my parents inherited money were they able to even move out and get a house for themselves. I just don't see the point in life anymore. I hate everyone and everything, I don't see there being any return to an economic future for myself, living in my hometown with my family makes me hate myself even more, every relationship has wound up with me getting taken advantage of and lied to or cheated on. I don't know, this was probably stupid to even post this. I'm exhausted. Even being on meds and switching that over the years, doesn't seem to help. I try to go outside every day and at least get a little bit of sunlight and vitamin D, even that's not enough. Whatever, I probably sound like a whiny bitch but at this point I don't know what else to do. I'm tired of having vivid dreams and waking up that I'm late to a show or a rehearsal or a job and then coming to the realization that I'm not late to anything and I'm just an unemployed loser who can never find his place in society. If I had a gun I would've ended things by now, but those damn things scare the shit out of me.
