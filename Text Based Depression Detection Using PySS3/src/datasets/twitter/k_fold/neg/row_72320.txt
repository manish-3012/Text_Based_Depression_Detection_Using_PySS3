Donâ€™t even know what I want. Kinda messed up huhI want death. I want life. I hate my life. It could get better. The pain is too much. 
I donâ€™t even know where to start my thoughts or end them anymore. Life is a fucked up joke and every choice I make is wrong. I hold myself back from happiness. Or maybe I canâ€™t even feel true happiness anymore.
I want someone to see me, really see me. 
I want to talk to someone face to face that actually gives a fuck how Iâ€™m doing. 

I canâ€™t even make the decision weather I want to stick around for this to get better, or if it wonâ€™t get better. 

Iâ€™m a just over a year sober now... Iâ€™m 17 years old and I fucked up my brain with drugs for years and I have permanent damage. Somehting I fantasize about more then death is getting high, but I canâ€™t or my brain will be even more fried.... but what if I have one last blow out. Do the one thing I strive for, pop a few xans, take a perc or two, rail some molly, smoke a nice cigar and wash it down with lean and let the drugs do the rest. I will get the feeling Iâ€™m chasing and never come back to experience the bad part of it.
