Looking forward to it.I'm completely, utterly and entirely at peace with the idea of dying. I don't even feel sad anymore, quite the opposite. The thought that soon I won't have to endure things any longer makes me almost giddy with joy. I think about suicide with the same happiness I used to feel shortly before my birthday as a kid.

It will be terrible for my family, I'm an only child and my parents love me like crazy. But no matter how much I love them I just can't live any longer. I have tried my best to explain my reasons in a long letter to them. It's hard to talk to them on the phone now, they are really looking forward to me coming back. My best friends keep saying things like, "when you come back home we'll have so much to talk about!", "let's meet up when you get back!", "we have to go to that place you like!". They text me almost daily, checking up on me and telling me about the stuff I'm missing at home. These are the only moments that make me feel something else than joy. If it makes any sense: it's sad to know I'm loved. I know that this knowledge should suffice to keep me alive. But every day I have to wake up next to him brings me closer to my goal, and every time he screams at me the peaceful feeling comes again. Just knowing that I will escape soon makes me so happy. Instead of crying and shaking like I used to, I just smile to myself knowing I am at least strong enough to make this decision. He makes me feel like nothing belongs to me anymore, not my possessions, not my body, not even my brain. But I guess my life still does, so I get to decide what to do with it. And that is just such a comforting thought.
