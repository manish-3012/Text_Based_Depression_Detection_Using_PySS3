Huh. I guess there is really no point.I have been so upset about my masters program and my mom and now I just don't really care anymore. None of this really matters anymore. It never did matter. I will die one day. And everything I do in the world becomes irrelevant. So I am ready to die. When I stay here, I hurt others and suck resources. So I am going to go soon. My parents will be so sad. They just lost their son 2 years ago. I love my dad so much. This will be so hard. Hopefully this will make them be stronger.
