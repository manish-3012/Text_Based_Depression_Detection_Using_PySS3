Really need someone to give me a positive outcomeThrowaway account because people know my real one.

I'm done, I just started a college course that tbh I enjoy but after that, there's just nothing. I've started college while all my friends are staying for sixth form but I feel like i'll enjoy the course so that's the present. At high school we used to play together but then I stopped due to GCSE's and my friends all ditched me since I was no longer good at the game we played and I don't find it enjoyable by myself so I stopped playing.There was also a point when I was playing with my friends and I had suicidal thoughts, one of my friends was just bullying me and no one would help or tell him to stop, finally one day I told one of my friends and he actually was really supportive and talked me out of it. We had a 2 or 3 hour chat about how to fix this and he even told me about this sub-reddit, so to him I just want to say thanks for helping me get this far, anyway. I went to another game but played it through a 3rd party site. At high school this got me through the days, knowing I could come home and forget about all the shit and just relax, but today I was banned from it without even breaking a rule. I asked the guy that runs the site and he simply laughed at me shared it publicly and then deleted all the messages when I again asked if he could show me what rule I broke. Now after college I do football but the managers son started this whole thing. I do not want to go to training or matches since I honestly think I will break his leg if I get the chance. My parents are not easy to speak to, my dad constantly shouts and my mum is... shall we say not the brightest. I can't make new friends at college because I always somehow fuck it up by being socially awkward. All my friends that I played the 3rd party site with just ditched me since they are scared of getting banned as well. Now it's all black, what do I do? I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, but every time I thought of them I just thought, "wait until you get home and you can just relax by playing on the 3rd party site" but now, fuck everyone, non of my old friends will talk to me, I can't talk to my parents and I can't make new friends and I cannot even do the sports activity's I've been doing for years without getting worried that I'll kill the little shit.

Sorry if it seems I'm being over-dramatic. I have spoken to some of the people I played the 3rd party site with and they say "It's just a game". To you maybe but not to me, it helped me get through the days, I could forget about everything (even if it was just for 2 hours or so). I try to talk myself out of it because I know it will haunt my parents forever but whenever I think about my whole f***ing life outside of college hours it just makes me want to do it and end it all.

ALSO: If any of you think I'm overreacting that's your opinion and your entitled to it but the only way to get something positive out of this is by telling you all how I honestly feel.
