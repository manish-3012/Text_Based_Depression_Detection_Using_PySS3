Why do I hang out with my friends?Every time they get together they go on and on with each other about their experiences through high school, while I sit at the side keeping quiet. "You should have stayed in school so you could join us in conversation every once and a while."

I, being a fucking pussy, quit high school after just the ninth grade. I was too weak to take the names, the laughing, the general mocking. Now I sit at home all the time, regretting that I didn't stay, I missed so many moments, my adolescence is gone and I'll never get that time back.

Why do I go on? After adolescence you're only expected to keep a job, buy useless shit, retire, then die. I missed so much of the shit that most other teenagers get to experience, what the fuck.
