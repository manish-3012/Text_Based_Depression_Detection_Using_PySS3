So ugly and dumb i have to kill myself f(15)I honestly don't want to die i want to see some of the world but my stupidity, weirdness and ugliness block me from finding any happiness. I  saw a photo a family member took and thought who's that ugly person only to realise it was me I had been ignoring the mirror for a week because it's hard to look in because I hate what a loner I am, I'm crazy, stupid and so ugly I don't know how my parents don't cry looking at me, I don't have enough money for plastic surgery ,I wouldn't be able to get a job anywhere because of what big a moron I am. At school all the boys laugh at me because of how ugly I am and teachers laugh because I'm stupid, my mom hates me and makes remarks about me and my support group being crazys. Everywhere I go people laugh at me 24/7 because of how freakish and dopish I am, there is no point in going on if I jump off a height my face will smash so nobody else has to see it and I can just end this misery
