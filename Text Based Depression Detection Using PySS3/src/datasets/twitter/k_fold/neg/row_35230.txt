I need help.I have been in this abusive relationship for 6 months. I have no job, no money, have two interviews today but he got drunk tonight &amp; kept me up all night so now I am afraid to fall asleep for fear of missing the interviews. Iâ€™m really thinking about killing myself. I just donâ€™t want this anymore. He gets drunk &amp; terroizes me. I am not the most kind to him either but I just didnâ€™t know the drinking was this severe in the beginning. Iâ€™m looking to overdose. I have almost 8 months clean &amp; since being out of that life, I have no connections. I need someone to help me. I want out of this situation, or today Iâ€™m going downtown to find what I need to end all this. I will do whatever I have to today because I canâ€™t deal with another night of this. Itâ€™s been 6 miserable, crazy, abusive months. I canâ€™t take anymore.
