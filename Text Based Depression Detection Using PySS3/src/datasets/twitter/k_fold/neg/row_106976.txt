Didn't make friends in college. How do I accept that I'm probably gonna be friendless for the rest of my life?College is after all the pinnacle of friendship making. I can't forsee that I'll make any of the close friendships I saw in high school and college from my acquaintances. Those intimate coming-of-age friendships don't tend to exist in adulthood. Work is not at all the place to do that. Adults don't have the free time college and high school students do and are obsessed with being professional and formal.

The "friends" I see making are those that are friendly yet superficial. People you only see at work and have no interest in taking things further because they already have their friends. That's adulthood. Even if I became "friends" with them, I would be near the bottom of importance.

I want friends I can go out on the town on the weekends, go on long crazy road trips that are "Spring Break" esque, and attend the biggest music festivals.

I guess this is the consequence of being 25 and missing out on the college experience. As I get older, the number of people that want to do those things continues to dwindle and have even less time for.

I will continue to try and find younger friends but that is not a guarantee. I will avoid people my age and up because they have been caught up in their careers and other things. They are a big no no.

Being a late bloomer is a lonely place to be and I don't wish it on anyone.
