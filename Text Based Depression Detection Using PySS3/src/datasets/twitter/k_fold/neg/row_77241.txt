I don't know anymoreI know what life is supposed to be like, I guess.
I can see where one would get joy, or general purpose, maybe. It's just that for some reason this illness created a situation in which I'm locked off from all that. I'm the kid in the glass cage. From the point of realization to now, looking back, seems like an eternity. And with that in mind, looking forward is too hard. I hate this. I am going to cause so much pain to my sister, my mom..
Do I live a life of misery so that others can be unbothered? I'm afraid my darkness will choose for me.
