How can anyone say they care about people on here when all you see is a username? Please answer that. 

The first time I was suicidal was during 10th grade, and I regret not following through with it back then. 

There is nothing that makes me happy right now. I hate music, art, people, everything. The only thing that gives me a little bit of hope is riding across America, but I have no money to buy a bike, and over $25,000 in student loans. 

I'm being forced to live near home, taking a job that I fucking hate, and that only pays me a stipend, because of family obligations that mean nothing to me. 

I think of this world as some alternate universe that doesn't matter and doesn't mean anything. People will be sad when I die, but they will get over it. Only one person knows I'm depressed/suicidal. I think he's sort of trying to help, but.. 

I'm reading through posts on here and agree with everyone else wanting to kill themselves. I just want to escape somewhere.
