I don't really have a motivation to liveWake up. Go to class (if I'm not lazy). Eat lunch. Go to class again. Come back home. Study and do homework. Dick around on reddit. Eat dinner. Go to sleep. Repeat.

That is what a typical day for me looks like. What a grind. It's just all so empty and meaningless...

I mean, what next? If all goes well I graduate with a good GPA and a couple of internships, get a job in tech or finance, spend 20 years grinding away at code and sucking up to some asshole in a suit, make more money than I know what to do with, and then what? 

And this is the **best case scenario** that awaits me.

I just don't have anything left to believe in...

I keep hearing how relationships are supposedly super amazing, but every time I've tried, it's just ended in embarrassment, so I just don't bother. Besides, I don't really talk to girls much, and I don't even know any I'd be interested in at this point.

I guess I could just dedicate myself to increasing my net worth, but I was lucky enough to grow up in a lower-upper class family, so money really does not have much of an allure for me. I literally do not know what I would spend money on besides housing, food, and some basic amenities. 

Even the schoolwork I do, I don't even know why I do it. Maybe because it was just drilled into me by the uber-competitive Asian culture I grew up in. I don't study in order to get As in my classes. I sure as fuck don't study because I care about "learning". I just study because I feel "off" if I don't. 

I really hate to channel every edgy 13-year-old ever, but it really does seem that life just sucks, and then you die. There's just no point.

**TL;DR** I'm not sad, I just feel empty and bored. I have motivation to do things, but I'm just doing them because it's what I've always done.
