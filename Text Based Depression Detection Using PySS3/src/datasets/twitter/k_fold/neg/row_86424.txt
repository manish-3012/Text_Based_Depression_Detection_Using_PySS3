planning on ending my life when I turn 18I can't take it anymore. I'm too much of a failure. I hate myself so much and I hate being alive. The only reason I'm still alive today is that I didn't shove that knife into my heart 4 years ago. I really want to kill myself but I'm afraid that I'll suffocate for a very long time when I hang myself or that someone would save me. Thus, I decided that I'm going to *"give myself a chance"* and try to live through these 1.5 years left until I turn into a legal adult. And if I don't ever kiss a girl or get a girlfriend before I turn 18, then I'm going to go through the trouble of getting a shotgun and and I'm going to kill myself. It's quite impossible to get back after I pull the trigger, so I shall finally be put to rest. I can't wait to die and get rid of this pain and suffering. I know that I will NEVER get a girlfriend no matter how hard I try. No, I know for a FACT that any girl would look right past me because I'm hopelessly ugly. So, I'd better start looking for a shotgun right now.
