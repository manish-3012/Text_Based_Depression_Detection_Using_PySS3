I failed at adulthoodI was diagnosed with depression years ago but stopped getting help soon after. I had heard my mom talking about how she doesn't believe in mental illness and she complained about how much it costed. I had already tried killing myself twice. I felt like a burden. This feeling just ate away at me. I moved out of my parents at 19 to a new city, got a new job, and left University. I thought the change, independence, and growth from leaving would spark something in me, and it did. Things were going well I started exercising, going out, and being social at work.
With this momentum I decided it was time to go back to therapy. I started saving what I could so I can afford the sessions and medication... but then i ruined everything. I got fired after because I accepted an elderly woman's coupon, I had known it wasn't valid but I thought this was a good deed, I thought I was helping someone. When loss prevention found out about it I owned up thinking honesty was best, I told them I was sorry, but it made things worse I was let go and I haven't been able to find a job. Everything I saved for therapy disappeared when bills came around. Now I just feel like a burden to my best friends that I live with. When my roommates leave for work or a party and I'm left alone in an empty apartment I can't afford anymore. I sit in my room with a plan and a note but I just settle for drinking until I fall asleep... I want to get better I want to be stronger but I feel myself slipping more and more. I don't know how to bounce back from this I keep wanting to check myself in somewhere or going to an ER telling them about my thoughts. This is always in the back of my mind and I hope it'll keep me from doing something to myself, but I'm more terrified of the monetary cost.
