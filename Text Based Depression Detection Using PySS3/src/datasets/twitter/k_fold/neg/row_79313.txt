I can't do this anymore, honestly.I've been depressed ever since I was about 12 years old, I'm 18 now. Every day has been a struggle since, I've never formed any genuine relationships with anyone, and I've never found anything that I truly love. I'm currently in university and failed my first semester, I won't be surprised if I fail this semester either, all of this is causing my parents immense stress, which they don't deserve at all, especially considering my sibling who is a horrible kid who is causing the family nothing but pain and shame by their actions. A few months back I was about to end my life, until someone on this subreddit talked me out of it, but I highly doubt it'll be possible this time. My life has been progressively getting worse, firstly, I'm not the most aesthetically pleasing person this world has to offer, I've been looking worse by the day, losing hundreds of strands of hair a day, at this rate I'll be bald in a year or two, I haven't grown at all since I was about 13 and as a result am the shortest male out of anyone I know, even shorter than a lot of girls; aside from my physicality, mentally I am weak, everyone taking the same course as I is excelling, whereas I on the other hand can barely digest the content, living in another country also doesn't help my case as I'm all alone and cry myself to sleep everyday, barely finding the time or the energy to study. Everyone promises it will get better, but it never does, it's only getting worse by the minute. Additionally, I have severe IBS, causing me to excuse myself out of a lot of classes, leading to embarrassment and anxiety, not to mention all the extra studying I have to do because I miss out on so many classes as a result of my health. Day by day, the concept of suicide is becoming more convincing as I notice no one cares, even though my family does care, they will never understand the pain I'm going through, suicide seems like the only option at this point.
