Today I talked to someone who got out of depressionHe said that he couldn't stand hurting everyone around him so he just pushed himself to get better. But I don't have that strength or I can't find it. I'm surviving with the comfort that it will end soon. I just haven't found a 100% chance of dying accessible to me right now. And is he really doing better anyway ? He built a strong anti-friends wall and I'm doing the same. The less people you have around the less you will hurt people when you die.
