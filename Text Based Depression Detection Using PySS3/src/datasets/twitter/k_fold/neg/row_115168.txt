Screwed everything up, lost my best friend.First and foremost, at the moment I'm not on the verge of suicide, but Im just depressed and don't know where else to go.

Sorry for the amount of text.

So I'm an Australian 19/m started dating this American girl when we were both 17. We met online on August 1st 2008 and started dating (or at least made our anniversary) September 14th 2008. We first saw each other on December 26th 2009 when I flew out to see her. She flew out to see me in June/July for 13 days in 2010. Then I just flew back for the second time to see her over Christmas and New Years.

I had already bought my ticket for the Christmas/NY trip when we broke up November 1st 2010. (I remember dates quite well)

The trip was fantastic. We fell in love again but knew the distance wouldn't work out when I returned home. We were best friends. She said she felt safe around me and that she could just be herself. I felt the same. For the first time in my life I could just express who I was with her and not hold back. I've never had that many friends, and especially since the start of high school, not many female friends.  I never thought that I could have a relationship like this with anyone let alone a girl. Normally I'm nervous and shy and don't really talk to girls, but with her... damn, with her it was just amazing. No hesitations whatsoever. My life had finally turned around.

Now it's a month and a bit since I've been back and things have never been worse. Anticipating that she'd be feeling down after I left, and especially after we broke up she decided to get a job, and enroll in the maximum amount of University classes she can. She also does Polo which took up last weekend and is taking up the following with tournaments. She trains a few nights a week on top of this for three hours per night.

I on the other hand sit in my room and do nothing. I've just changed Universities as I hated the one I was going to before my trip, to one that was back in my home city. As I've just got back from the trip I haven't been able to have a job during my holidays in Australia. Though I have had an interview last week for one. But now, as I wait for University to begin I sit in my room day in day out, listening to her talk about going to polo, then having homework, then wanting to spend time with friends, then going to work, then going to class.

Furthermore I don't really have any friends. She was my best friend and we would spend a few hours talking every day up until lately. My best male friend is awesome and we get along well but he's pretty much the only person I have now. My next best friend was this girl from high school, who told me last week that she can't hang out with me because she doesn't think it would be appropriate given she has a boyfriend. She also said that she didn't think it'd matter because we weren't that good of friends.

So now I'm down to two friends, her and him. And now that we've broken up and she's coping so god damn well and I'm completely the opposite I need someone to talk to. I try and talk to her but she thinks my problems are stupid and my life is fine. We've been fighting on and off for weeks, which were half my fault, half hers. But I've tried to turn it around. I tried to be extra nice to her lately. I really tried. And I sent her a Valentine's gift, she hasn't received it yet but I really wanted her to enjoy talking to me when she got it. So on Saturday night my time she was going to give us time to talk. Four hours in fact! Four hours! I was ecstatic! I barely ever get one let alone four.... and then skype screwed up... everything screwed up and we got 45 minutes. But who cares, those 45 minutes were great! They were fantastic in fact! But I really needed to talk to her this weekend so she would enjoy talking to me again before she got the gift. So I told her this, I told her how much I wanted us to be good. So the following night, Sunday afternoon, she plans to talk to me for three hours. From 10-1am Saturday her time. But before this she goes out with her friend for dinner at 5pm and then onto a movie at 7pm. Apparently there was a problem with the sound so they only got out of the movie at 10pm and then her friend started talking to her about *her* depression which causes my friend to stay there a few more hours meaning we didn't get to talk that night either.

This made me really annoyed. I really needed this and this was my one chance before she got the present. The one chance to turn it around so that she would enjoy talking to me again and value our time together. I can't get mad at her for talking to her friend when she needs her but if she told her friend at dinner that she was going to talk to me tonight then her friend would have brought it up earlier.

She has this habit of never telling anyone she talks to me. For the last few months of her relationship with me none of her friends knew we were dating.

Whenever one of them comes into her room (she shares a room) she minimises the screen and just says she was watching TV. I get annoyed at her every single time for the past year for this, as I feel like she's not treating me like a person. And she never changes. She never tells anyone that we're friends.

I feel like the unpopular kid at school. You know the one that has no friends, but then one day he finally finds someone. He finally gets a friend! He's so excited but then that friend denies knowing him in front of everyone.

I feel like that kid.

So now things have gone to shit since then. I'm thinking about doing something (re:suicide) but know that I can't just yet. I got mad at her and she retaliated getting pissed at me for expecting so much of her time, when it was just this weekend because she offered and got me excited about it.

She's my only true friend and she doesn't even want to spend time with me. She finds time for everyone in their life except me. That's fair enough at the moment given how our friendship is but it was fine just the other day, and now she's saying that she's too stressed talking to me (when if she just fucking tried to give me the time of day we'd be able to be happy again and I wouldn't be fucking depressed all bloody day) so she doesn't want to be friends anymore.

So now I'm down to one bloody friend. That guy. This guy is awesome and I share everything with him. I share everything with both the guy and the girl but then I find out that she betrayed me about a few things and kept secrets from me for months. And that he lied to me about ever doing drugs for years. This really got under my skin (it was only weed) because I mentioned about how I would like to do it some day but only when it was legal (because it's only a slight urge and I don't really want to risk a fine). So it couldn't have been that he thought I would judge him or anything. In fact I talk about wanting to try LSD for over a year now and constantly talk about how things like this should be legalised.

He won't even tell me his girlfriend's name.

This just really kills me because it reminds me of what the girl did with her friends. Though at least he admits to me he has one.

So I really have no one to talk to. Even if the weed and girlfriend thing didn't bother me about the guy, talking to him about any of this stuff makes him uncomfortable.

I can't talk to my parents because even though they put me up, they don't like spending time with me. I constantly try to sit out and talk to them but they just want to watch TV and get annoyed with me if I try and interrupt it for a board game or something. Because of this I'm not comfortable enough talking to them about it either.

So I have no one. Admittedly I am a bit asocial. I don't like meeting people and that makes this worse. I could quite easily ask some people on my city's reddit to go out and I know they'd say yes, but I just hate talking to people I don't know. I really despise it. I never have anything interesting to say, and whilst I'm good at small talk at the barber's and what not, I can really never develop friendships.

I coach a little kids softball team in my spare time as well, but of course the two people my age that I was friends with there have stopped this year, and the one little girl I practically thought of as my daughter has switched to tennis.

If I had to pick a dream it'd be to become a Formula 1 driver. And I would kill to be able to pursue this (trying to at least) by starting karting this year, but I can't, I just don't have the money. It costs A LOT and I've worked out that maxing my job hours at this place I got the interview for wouldn't be enough (and that's a $23/hr wage - average/high for a student in Australia).

tl;dr So I don't know where I am or where I'm going. My beautiful female friend (who is absolutely gorgeous) wants nothing to do with me. My parents want nothing to do with me. My one friend cares but I can't talk to about anything personal. I hate socialising and am about to start going to a new University. I don't know what to do anymore.
