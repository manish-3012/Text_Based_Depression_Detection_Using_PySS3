Tired of suffering just to make parents happy20 years old and been depressed since I was 10/11. Suicidal ideation throughout. Never wanted to die, just tired of going through the slight ups and major downs of life. Been living the past 6+ months just to make my parents happy that Iâ€™m not dead. Almost tried it once with pills, but know the odds arenâ€™t good. Was looking into fentanyl instead. Might just say Iâ€™m running away and drive as far as I can and see if I can overdose. Love my parents and friends but just tired of me suffering. Keep trying to get a plan in my life, but canâ€™t figure it out and parents donâ€™t know what to do either, but canâ€™t blame them because Iâ€™ve done this to myself. Not ready for the pressure ahead either, college, life, more relationships (last one wasnâ€™t too great). Thanks to anyone who sees this, I hope everyone on here gets through their demons, not sure if Iâ€™ll be able to get through mine.
