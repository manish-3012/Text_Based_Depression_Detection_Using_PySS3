How does anyone make it?How the fuck do people afford college? How the fuck can people afford to live? Jesus fucking christ am I a goddamn idiot. I have absolutely no idea how I'm going to make it in this world. I don't know shit about shit, and I have no money. I have absolutely no fucking way to make nearly enough money to support myself. I have absolutely no way to pay for college or any other kind of schooling for that matter. I can only save 50 fucking dollars a month after all of the expenses I DO have such as car insurance, gas, food, medical bills, car maintenance  and my phone service. How in the fuck is life supposed to be enjoyable when it is utter shit? Can someone please fucking tell me how keeping on is better than jumping off of a fucking bridge? I CANNOT COPE. 
Edit: Thank fucking God I have a home to stay in rent-free because otherwise I'd be in the fucking streets. Forgot to mention that part.
