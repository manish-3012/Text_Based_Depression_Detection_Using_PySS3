Honestly fuck the "september is suicide prevention month" posts on social media.Like noone actually gives a fuck, since we all know that 90% of those people are just posting for the trend and don't actually give a shit about anyone but themselves.

Noone gives a shit about me, noone, and I don't see a single person asking how im doing or just wanting to be with me. (Not like I'd be honest if they asked me how I felt, because I'd feel like an attention whore)

Fuck those people, its honestly so infuriating. Just felt like putting this out there.
