I feel like I'm in a bottomless pit without a ladder.I don't really want to be alive anymore.

I realized that the world doesn't need anymore fat girls crying on the internet. I shouldn't even be here. I feel completely hopeless and I'd like to give up already. What the point of living if you're never happy?
