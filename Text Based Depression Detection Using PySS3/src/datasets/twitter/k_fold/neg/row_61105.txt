its getting tiringjust like I've always tried to pretend I'm not autistic so people don't pity me or look down upon me, I try to act like I'm not depressed so maybe I can go about life like I'm not. but its getting so tiring. I can only pretend I dont think anything of going out alone or that I dont get anxious in certain social situations or whatever. sorry i cant come up with any good examples but basically when I'm around people I do everything I can to act as if I'm just like everyone else and I would say I do a pretty good job of it, even though I have a crisis pretty much every night before bed. and it's only gotten worse. I wouldn't say I really knew what having a crisis was up until this semester started. it's an indescribable feeling for anyone who hasn't had one I think. or maybe I haven't even had one and I'm just being dramatic. anyway I don't feel like I can keep this up anymore. my university  has free counseling but i have to call to make an appointment and i hear they're super busy anyway. so i doubt I'll ever find the courage to make use of that. I'm not really sure where i was going with this. guess i needed to get it off my chest. i always wonder if it would be easier to just end it all. I fear an afterlife though. but the deeper I go the less I seem to worry about hurting those close to me by killing myself. it sounds awful to say but I think about how if I'm dead I wont have to worry about how they feel. fuck I hate myself. all i long for is love and i have always hoped it would find me but even if the perfect girl just falls into my lap, who the hell would want to be with me? and even if someone did somehow I'm not prepared for a relationship, I'd screw it up immediately. it just really sucks that my reasons for living have nothing to do with myself and everything to do with others. I have nothing of my own to live for and the only reason I'm still here is for the sake of everyone else
