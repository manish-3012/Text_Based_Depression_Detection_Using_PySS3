I think this is the last timeFor a while now, I've just been setting a date for me to kill myself, but I haven't actually done it. Every time I would set it and think about I would back out. This time, I don't feel that same fear. Maybe by doing it so much I've normalized the idea and it just doesn't really seem all the much of a bad way to go anymore. My parents have a gun in the house and getting access to it would be nothing. I've never really planned out every little detail of a suicide plan before, but I almost feel proud for having come up with it. It's just so meticulous that there's no way it could fail. My parents are supposed be out of town when I'll do it, so there won't be much stopping me. I just can't take it anymore
