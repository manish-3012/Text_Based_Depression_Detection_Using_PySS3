So...My arm is scarred really badly from cuttingMy life is horrible. It may not be as bad as other people's lives, but I also have Bipolar Depression Disorder, so taking that into account, it's all the more difficult to deal with it. To start off, the beginning of my life was okay. I lived with my pothead dad who let me do whatever I wanted, I was top dog in my school, and my dad loved me unconditionally. In second grade, someone from child protective services came and told me I had to live with my mom. Her boyfriend abused me. She always sided with him. Then they broke up. I started getting depressed a year ago. I am always being yelled at by my mom's new boyfriend, always grounded, and when I can't deal with anything, I leave a new scar on my arm. But lately, at only 14, I've been thinking of ways to kill myself. I have a boyfriend but I doubt that he really loves me. My parents don't accept that I'm gay. They would care less if I died. I don't have any real friends. I am going to talk to my boyfriend about it and see what he says. I just want my miserable life to be over.
