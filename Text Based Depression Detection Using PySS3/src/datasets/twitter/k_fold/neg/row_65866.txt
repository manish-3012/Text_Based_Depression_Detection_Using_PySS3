Here I am againScreaming into the fucking void. No one cares but here I am.

The second I got close to some kind of conversation the mods locked it for no reason. Itâ€™s like a sick joke. I have no one to vent to and so many miserable feelings brewing inside. I want heroine or a shotgun or an exit bag to just whisk me away from this underwhelming reality.

Iâ€™m 17, nearly an adult and Iâ€™m dreading it. College sucks ass and costs a fortune. Then I work til I die. Alone. Because if youâ€™re not attractive or not like everyone else youâ€™re thrown into the garbage. I fucking hate hormones 

I want to be loved so bad. I want to be valued and be at least one personâ€™s favorite person. I want to go on an adventure, I want to matter. But what I want means jack shit

There is no hope. It never gets better. 

Thatâ€™s all a little melodramatic I know, because honestly life isnâ€™t bad. Itâ€™s just not enough for me. I see no reason to live it. 

Iâ€™m going to work on getting a gun license and getting a gun then kissing my gray matter good bye. Wish me luck
