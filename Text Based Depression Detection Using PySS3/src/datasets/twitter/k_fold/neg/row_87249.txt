It's Your FaultI think I'm going to kill myself, and it's your fault.

It's your fault that I want to go to sleep and never wake up.

Your fault that my children will have memories of their mother decaying into an empty shell.

Your fault that the love of my life has to live in dread, wondering, "Is this the last time I'll see her?"

It's your fault that I will never know my grandchildren.

It's your fault that I will destroy my wonderful, beautiful parents.

Your fault that I will never fulfill my dreams, and people will lament the fact that I could have done great things, if I'd only tried harder.

Your fault that everything I loved about myself has shriveled up and died, and that only my wretched, despairing ghost still exists, and remembers.

You are so incredibly cruel. You've robbed this world of so many phenomenal people, who unintentionally left their loved ones in a state of anguished wreckage. You're the meanest, most despicable son of a bitch that ever was, and I hate you with all of the energy I can muster. 

Because of you, I will hurt the people that I love so badly that they will hate me. They will call me selfish. They will say I was a coward and that I took the easy way out. My family will doubt whether I ever loved them. My friends will be gutted. Every good thing I've ever done will be discolored by the stain of the last thing I ever do.

You've been tormenting me since I was a child, and I hate that you are a part of me. You've taken over my brain, and I wish I could rip you out of my skull. You're the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and I wish you had never been born. You're a real asshole, Depression, and if you were a person, I would want you to die, screaming. 

Like I will.
