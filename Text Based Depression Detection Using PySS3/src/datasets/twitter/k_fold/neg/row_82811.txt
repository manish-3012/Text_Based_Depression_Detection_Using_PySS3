Just finished the examinationsFinished the exams for my job application. All turned in and heading home. I should hear something back in a couple of days. I think I did well, but I've felt that way before and didn't. So when they come back with the "we're sorry" letter, it will be time.

My plans are for an accident, but I don't know if I will be able to do it. I found the perfect bridge column, but it's just off the route to/from work so they will wonder why I went that way. Placed my order at Amazon for a backup plan. Have a third (rifle) and fourth (rope) backup ready to go, but I'd like to have all of my options if this doesn't come through.

The thought of all this finally being over is electrifying. I can feel the cool rush all over my skin from head to toe. I should know something by Friday. Part of me is wishing that they don't schedule another interview.
