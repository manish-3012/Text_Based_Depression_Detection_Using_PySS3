Sometimes I really wish my parents just hated meSometimes I really wish my parents just hated me
That my brother would just hate me
That my friend wouldnâ€™t care if I disappeared 
So I could just disappear and have no one worry
I feel so selfish and horrible
I feel so sad and stupid
It feels like I canâ€™t do another day
Thereâ€™s nothing for me in my life
I have no goals or aspirations 
I thought I could live on with my gf, but we split and now weâ€™re just friends but itâ€™s weird and I donâ€™t understand it. I donâ€™t know if sheâ€™ll forgive me and weâ€™ll get back together, or if sheâ€™s just using me for food. I donâ€™t know why she wonâ€™t talk to me about her problems even when we were together. I donâ€™t get why sometimes weâ€™re good and others we seem to suck. I donâ€™t know if she loves me
I donâ€™t even know if I know what love is
I feel useless and pathetic
I feel horrible and selfish 
I donâ€™t get people
I blank out in the middle of conversations
Iâ€™m boring and not funny
Iâ€™m fat and disgusting 
I have no job and I hate to work
I want to die but I donâ€™t want those who care to feel sad or hurt
If I disappear will my mum follow me
I want to talk to someone but I donâ€™t want to moan
I want to be confident but I canâ€™t even fake it now
It feels like everyone else has had it so much worse than me
I shouldnâ€™t have anything to complain about
I just donâ€™t know anymore
I just donâ€™t get it
Am I just being dramatic
Why canâ€™t I just stop
Why wonâ€™t I be happy
Iâ€™m so confused all the time
I donâ€™t know if I should move on
I just want to die
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this
I donâ€™t feel unless Iâ€™m hurting now
I want to cut myself but Iâ€™m scared of being shamed
Iâ€™m scared of losing her
Iâ€™m scared of keeping her
Iâ€™m scared of hurting her
I just want to stop
I just canâ€™t
This is all too much for me
I feel like an imposter
I have no goals
I have no future
I should just disappear but I canâ€™t
I hate me so fucking much
I hate me so so so fucking much
I just wish I wasnâ€™t ever born
I just wish I wasnâ€™t
I just donâ€™t know anymore
I just canâ€™t
I donâ€™t even know how Iâ€™d die
In a way that wouldnâ€™t hurt 
In a way that wouldnâ€™t hurt someone else
I feel so selfish 
I only care about myself
I find everything so hard
I think thereâ€™s something wrong with me
I feel like Iâ€™m retarded but no one had me tested
I just donâ€™t know
I just donâ€™t want to anymore
The quiet is so noisy
Itâ€™s ringing in my ears
Deafening
I daydream my death
I daydream what would happen if I wasnâ€™t born
Everyone would be so much happier
Why wonâ€™t it just stop
