Stressed out about family issues. Started thinking about suicde...* Father died. My mother and sister depended on him, but didn't have any piece of his estate. No other family physically have the room for them to stay. So they are forced to live with me.

* Brother trying to afford college struggling with a min wage. He is living in his girlfriend's room with constant stress of paying his dues. He borrows money from me regularly in hopes of staying in college and lives far away. In return he gives me his uni account credentials so I can make sure he is passing his grades and shit. He is doing good with 2 years to graduate.

* New upper management changes making me hate my job. I have an awesome boss (not part of upper management) and co-worker. They are in different offices in opposite part of the states. All of my friends at the company left. Need more money to support family, I like my co-worker and boss, and hate upper management. I am looking for a new job. I feel guilty leaving my boss and co-worker behind after knowing them for so long.

* Looking for a new job for myself and my sister (22 years old no college or work experience) is adding a lot of stress. Running out of excuses to leave work to go to interviews. Job search is doing okay.

* I want to go back and finish my teacher's certification instead of hoping to another software dev job. With 6 months to do it while holding down a low wage part time job, it is not an option without my brother, sister, or mother going homeless. I have to put that on permanent hold.

* Best friend moved and got married. We only talk on facebook once a month for a while. Those precious minutes are the best I have had.

This stress have been keeping me sleep deprived, miserable, and down for almost a year. I see no end to this. :(
