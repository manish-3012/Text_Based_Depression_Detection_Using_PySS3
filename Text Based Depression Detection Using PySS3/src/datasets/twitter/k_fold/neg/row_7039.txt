I really need to talk to someoneI have so much shit I need to get off my chest and try to sort out, but I don't feel able talk to my psychiatrist about it. I have tried subs like /r/offmychest, but none of the replies helped, and I can't take this much longer. I've been miserable with life for years, but I don't want to be happy, and I can't even tell anyone why, and I wish I had the guts to just end it all, but I don't, so I guess I'm just stuck with trying to make my mess of a life into something bearable.
