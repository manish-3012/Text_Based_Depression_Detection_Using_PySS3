I'm so doneI'm so done with everything I don't want to live anymore. I have one friend and one day she'll leave me one day like everyone else. I had a sort of friend that I would stay up so so late at night talking to and we'd text a lot throughout the day. We were also fucking around with sex stuff and he'd call me sweet and cute and hot and I felt so special and so good about myself like maybe I am pretty maybe my scars don't matter. Of course I read into things and felt more than he did and and he told me last night he just wants to chill and play video games with me and I'm just so broken. Everybody leaves me and he's leaving me. I hadn't cut in a month but I did last night because I was so mad and I deserved it for being so fucking stupid and then I got high as fuck but instead of being happy I think I cried for 4 hours. I'm done with life everybody leaves me I dropped out of school now all I do is work and sleep because sleeping is better than being awake. One day soon I'll have the guts to end everything I'm so fucking DONE.
