i dont even know how i keep goingI just nonstop feel depressed and suicidal ig. I almost never am able to be happy, feeling joy is a bitch to do. Not completely sure why, but I don't want to be here. I hate myself with a fiery passion. I don't deserve to be here, i've fucked up way too much. I've had 2 people kill themselves that i was close to within the past 4 months, its too much pressure. My family hates me, out of my mom, dad, little and older brother, only the older likes me. the other 3 nonstop pick and pry at me and it just destroys me inside. I got nobody i can turn to, no friends i trust anymore. Nothing. I'm way to close to relapsing with my cutting. i just need to go, i don't belong here. I just need a quick way to go and call it a day honestly. All the pressure of school and sports is getting to me and im just ready to go, but im afraid to kill myself. I just want this pain to be over
