Had a dream about friend who's deadI had this weird dream about my friend who killed himself 3 years ago. He was begging me to remember something (I have no idea what is was), he was worried and scared. He wanted to say something to me but I couldn't hear it, like his voice was muted. I woke up at 4:00 AM, in cold sweat. I have depression for almost 4 years and dreams like this make me want to rethink everything.
