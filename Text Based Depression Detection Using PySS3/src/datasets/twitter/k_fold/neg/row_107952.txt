I really want to be happy I just donâ€™t know howI find it extremely hard to derive pleasure from anything. I smoke so much weed that I donâ€™t even get high anymore. Even when Iâ€™m around ppl I always feel like I have to keep up appearances so I donâ€™t come across as antisocial or whatever. I feel so empty and unfulfilled. The worst thing is I know that itâ€™s not visible to most ppl because I act like nothings wrong. Itâ€™s not hard for me to pretend that Iâ€™m happy, all I want is to not have to act like I am.
