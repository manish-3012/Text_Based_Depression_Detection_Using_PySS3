As an adult is there any happiness?I just graduated high school a few months ago and started college. I still live with my parents in the same house. Things have been kind of rough after many of my closest friends moved to college, but it kind of opened up an opportunity for me since nobody is counting on me. I just don't know if I want to put in the effort to get better or just end it before I have any obligations to continue living again for other people. If there is any adult reading this (past college), is there actual happiness anymore? Not just being okay with life because there's no other way to look at it, but actual happiness and joy?
