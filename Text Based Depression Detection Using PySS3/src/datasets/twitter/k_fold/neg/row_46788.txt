My Online Friend "Recommended" me.Most of my Suicidal Ideation can be summed up like "Everybody wants me to live, but I want to Die" I want to die so badly! 

People care and love and I know but I don't feel it. If anything I'm more alone than any other time in my life.

 I'm just done with this and becoming to get to the point were my brain soon will do anything to kill me, not there yet but I'm scared for that day because when that happens. I will be trying to die every minute, hour, day etc.. 

If someone killed me right now, I would not fight back in fact I would only fight to have them stab or shoot me. I also know that I excuse what most of what anyone says but I cause I'll say it's "whatever" when it's not! It's the only thing I can say when it's so bad that saying the truth would literally break a person in metaphorically pieces and me too see there face as they realize how dark and deep my abyss is.
