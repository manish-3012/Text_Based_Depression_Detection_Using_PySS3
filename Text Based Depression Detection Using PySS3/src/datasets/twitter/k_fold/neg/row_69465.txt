My life hasn't turned out the way I want it to, and I'm not the person I want to be. None of this can be changed. I feel hopeless and suicidal thoughts are getting worse (though I'm not in danger).I'm going to try and break this up into sub sections a little bit to help me structure it a bit and it not be a ramble. That tends to happen.

**Mental Health**
I have bipolar II disorder, which I am sure most of you know what it is. But if not, it's a form of bipolar disorder where you suffer primarily from depression, and your high are not full blown mania, but lower manias called hypomania where you are still very very up, and it isn't normal, but you don't lose control or lose touch with reality.  

But I have some very serious problems that aren't typical of bipolar II disorder. If I had a different doctor, I might have a diagnosis of OCD, GAD, or Panic disorder on top. I don't say that in a bad way, because I don't believe in firm boundaries between mental illnesses and think they can kind of bleed into one another, and my psychiatrist treats me symptomatically instead of making me conform to what bipolar disorder is supposed to do. Though it isn't that I have huge problems that are evident of another mental illness. 

But I suffer from really obsessive and intrusive thoughts about a girl that are dominating my life and bringing me down.

**Heartbreak**

So, I'm still trying to get over something, as mentioned above. I've pretty much reached a standstill, and I've been here for a long time.

I met a girl in late August. We pretty quickly became good friends and she was a big part of my life. We were best friends. That feeling was mutual, because she told me I was her best friend. Her friendship meant a lot to me... like *a lot* because I was in love with her. She was by all means one of the most incredible and beautiful people I have ever met.

Because of my mental health, I started to find it really hard to cope with my feelings because I didn't think the time was right to tell her how I felt, but knew she was dating and hooking up with someone. I would start having panic attacks if I saw her ex around -- who I had never even met but knew who he was. Out of the blue I would get panic attacks too thinking about her being with other guys, and was kind of haunted by the memory of when she told one of our friends she had gotten laid for the first time in a while. Those panic attacks still come along sometimes, as well as other panic attacks about other things related to her. I started to get very depressed when someone she worked with kind of came on to her and she sent me their text conversation and she flat out told him she was kind of seeing someone but didn't want a boyfriend.

Eventually, my mental health continued to decrease and eventually, in December, I did tell her. By that point, things had gotten pretty bad for me and I told her because I couldn't keep it in anymore. I had to do something. She didn't feel the same way. And, even though I told her I didn't want it to affect our friendship and I'd get over it, and she said of course we were still friends, she pretty much stopped talking to me. I get that.

She did invite me to her birthday party about a month later. But my mental health had gotten worse in that month. A couple weeks before I told her, I went to see my then psychiatrist and told him something was not right. I was not in good mental health and while it was situational, well things just weren't right! And told him about the panic attacks and other things. He more or less refused to treat me -- he said he didn't want to change my medication when he was retiring soon, and just gave me a valium prescription without doing an adequate assessment of my substance abuse, both present and in the past. I was hitting the bottle pretty hard, and was now putting valium on top of that because I was out of it and was trying to feel better. I'm ambivalent about if that was really stupid of me, or if I couldn't control it because I was ill. Though December and January don't feel real to me.

About a week before her birthday I seriously considered ending my life, and was moving forward with plans to do so. I was more or less building up to it, because I knew how I was going to do it. I am not sure what I was waiting for. Maybe I was waiting to see if things got better, or wait until after her birthday, idk.

At her birthday party, I ended up getting very drunk -- not sure how much I drank, but I do know I was on 15mg of valium. I blacked out, and the evening is kind of spotty after a certain point. I did tell her I was upset about the way we had left things. I remember a friend of hers I don't know driving me home and I broke out in hysterics crying and told him I was going to hurt myself or something. I don't remember. I just remember crying, hard. Anyways, the next morning when people checked in on me, sternly, I came clean about how bad things were and that I had almost ended my life. She and another friends forced me to go to the hospital, and I was there for a couple of days.

When I was discharged from the hospital I texted her to tell her I had been discharged and that they did the right thing by making me go. She told me that she had been uncomfortable when I told her how I felt and that she needed more time.

We've talked since then. Like, a couple times. Mostly it's just liking each other's stuff on instagram. But a few time's we've texted and talked a bit about really casual stuff. WE've never hung out since.

**Relationships in General**

Never had a romantic relationship. Never been kissed. And I'm a virgin. Those things don't usually bug me, and I loathe guys who are obsessed with sex and only view women as sex objects (and I am afraid that is how she thinks I may have viewed her). But sometimes things like this make guilt and shame about those things flare up, because it makes me feel like there is something wrong with me.

And, I've always put way too much emphasis on relationships and girls. This girl played  huge part in my life, and I fell in love fast and hard. I thought I had overcome that tendency because I had been in therapy for it for a long time on top of finally getting a diagnosis and taking mood stabilizers. But I guess not.

**I haven't moved on**

I haven't moved on. I haven't been able to. It isn't that I continue to feel guilty about what happened -- which I do, and I often wonder if I should message that guy who drove me home to apologize (I've talked to her and apologized before and she has said it's ok, it wasn't my fault, I was sick). But I also just yearn to have her back as a friend. And I still hope that we will end up together some day. Hope is too weak of a word. I literally pray that we do. But in the interim, I also pray we become best friends again very soon and that I have the strength to be able to handle not being in a romantic relationship with her in the mean time and to have the strength not to feel destroyed if she dates someone else. In my prayers I pray for us to end up dating within like a year. But the friendship I had with her was incredibly special, and I miss that. I miss it a lot. It would be enough, as I live my life focussing on the present, if that makes sense.

Another friend told me that I can't be friends with someone I want to be intimate with. I do want to be her friend again. I really, really do. I want that friendship again, and it is separate from my desires to be in a relationship with her.

I've never felt as if someone had understood me and cared about me like she did. We also had the exact same sense of humor and taste in music -- which were both really off kilter and obscure, and music was both a really big part of our lives. This was literally the closest I've ever come to being in a real relationship, and the emotional intimacy I had with her was really powerful. Or I felt like it was. I finally thought I had found someone who cared about me as much as I cared about them. 

**I Hate My Life** 

I wish I was an entirely different person who she would love. I'm not resentful. I get why she didn't feel the same way, because I feel like a really week and pathetic human being. Deep down, really deep down, my feelings for her feel like they are a part of me. I have struggled with feelings of emptiness, incompleteness, and shame over not having a girlfriend in the past, as trivial and juvenile as it sounds. But I coped well, and I wasn't expecting to meet someone like her and fall as hard as I did. It just kind of happened. And when people tell me I need to decide to move on and get better... I just can't because it literally feels like I am lying to myself and that only makes it worse. Seriously. Like I'm not saying in the moment it feels bad. Like I have crashed hard from lying to myself for extended periods of time that I am going to move on, etc etc etc. I just can't do it because she plays a monumental part of my life, and did then too. It is too big to let go of. The thought of losing her and it is so catastrophic to me that I'd rather die than lose her.

And part of the reason why I feel suicidal is that I am starting to realize that might happen...

**My user name**

My birthday is coming up, and it is hard that I won't have any friends here for it. Last year, I had a good crew of friends and we did something for my birthday. The year before that I didn't, but the years before that I did as well. It is really hard to spend my birthday without any friends this year, knowing that part of the reason I don't is because I didn't make room for other people in my life, and kind of pushed people away by being a crazy depressed person who was over bearing as I reached out to people in the wake of this and probably expected too much of them.

**Conclusion**

This is -- SUCH -- a fucking mess, my life.

I have good psychiatric care, but, I'm just not getting better when it comes to my feelings for the girl. These re not symptoms of bipolar disorder, so I am not convinced medication is going to ever change this. As for therapy, well, I've been in therapy for most of my adult life and things have not changed.

I think about suicide daily. I don't mean now, I mean I have for a long time. I think I thought about it before this even happened, but they were probably fleeting and I don't really remember for sure because it was inconsequential to me. But the suicidal thoughts have been around at least since the suicide crisis in January. They never went away, I just managed them better. And like I said, I think I always had them because I definitely have had periods in the past where I **know** I had had those thoughts on my mind, and they weren't new then. 

But they have gotten a lot more intense the past couple days. And no, I don't think I am in danger and do think I am safe.
