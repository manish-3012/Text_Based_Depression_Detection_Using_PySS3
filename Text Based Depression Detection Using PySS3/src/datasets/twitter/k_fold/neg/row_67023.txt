I've started making plans to kill myself. 24 years old male.I'm just too ugly to live. 25 next month and only ever had one girl in my entire life like me. She left me for someone else, someone normal looking after two years. I just can't go on anymore with this face. I feel a sense of letting go as I type this. The doctors say I have body dysmorphia but that's a lie..they say I'm fairly average looking but I know I'm ugly. I don't want to cause my family pain but I need to end this constant suffering. I feel I'm actually in hell right now.
