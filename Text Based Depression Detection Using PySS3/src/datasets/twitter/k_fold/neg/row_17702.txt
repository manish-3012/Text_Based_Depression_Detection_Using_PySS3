How painfull is drinking ammonia?I'm 15 and im with friends right now but nobody here or any of my other friends actually care about me, i feel like i have a god complex but deep down i know im absolutely worthless and that my life won't matter  
I can't even love myself how do i even expect people to love me, nearly everybody i know has had or is in a relationship but not me cause i suck. In the near future i plan on watching my favorite movie saying goodbye to my dog, then afterwards drinking a cup of ammonia and waiting til i die. So my question is would it be extremely painfull to drink ammonia or is this a good way to end it?
