Booked my hotel room. Going to buy pills tonight, and Iâ€™m gone tomorrow! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½ðŸ‘‹ðŸ½Iâ€™ve been in bed for three days and all my friends manage to say is, â€œOh that sucks.â€ when they know I already tried killing myself and I still suffer with depression. My parents are no better.

The one person I thought would be there for me stopped seeing me and said things are better this way and only calls or texts me if heâ€™s frustrated with work and needs to vent. I blocked him on Facebook and Instagram because it hurts too much that heâ€™s ignoring me, and of course he hasnâ€™t texted me asking me if Iâ€™m okay. 

Even the fuck boys who only wanna see me for sex have stopped texting me ever since I shaved my head.

Iâ€™m just beyond done. I donâ€™t want to exist. I want to just end everything and cease to exist. Iâ€™m tired of feeling like this every single day.
