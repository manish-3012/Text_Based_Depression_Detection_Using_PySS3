Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself since I was nine years old, and I shouldâ€™ve done it years agoI think this sub has helped me live longer in the long run. And Iâ€™d like to thank everybody, dead or alive who has posted here


Iâ€™d love to tell everyone that Iâ€™ve had a horrible life - that Iâ€™ve been raped, beaten and tortured all my life, but thatâ€™s just not the case. Iâ€™ve had a much better life than most, and I almost feel guilty for feeling this way. But I do feel this way, and I canâ€™t change that. There are so many people with horrible lives, who have been through things I cannot even begin to imagine or comprehend what theyâ€™ve been through. And that makes me feel worse, because I donâ€™t have a right to feel the way I do. There are stronger, better people out there who suffer everyday, and I just exist 


Iâ€™ve felt this way since I was nine years old, when I first started to cut myself, and Iâ€™m now seventeen. Thereâ€™s been good in my life, I canâ€™t deny that, thereâ€™s people I love and care for in my life. Iâ€™ve had happy memories and good days all throughout my life, but as ungrateful as it sounds, theyâ€™re just not enough. 

I know I wonâ€™t amount to anything in my life, deep down Iâ€™ve always known it, but Iâ€™ve tried to bury it. It breaks my heart to see doctors and people with kids on here, people who have achieved something in life. I will never find love or a good job in my life, and Iâ€™ve accepted that. I donâ€™t want to discredit these people, because I understand, I just want them to know itâ€™ll be okay. They deserve to be happy, for all the good they bring to the world, and how sorely theyâ€™ll be missed. 

Iâ€™ve wasted my time and money on a worthless career path, Iâ€™ve cut off nearly anyone that cared for me at one point, and Iâ€™ve burned too many bridges to count. I look through the social media of others and see how happy they are, how much they enjoy their lives, and I wonder why I canâ€™t be one of them. The hardest part about this will be how few people will even remember me once Iâ€™m gone. 

If I die tonight, I will miss out on absolutely nothing, and anything I was looking forward to will probably never happen.



Thank you for everything, I know I mean nothing to you, but Iâ€™m truly grateful for everyone here
