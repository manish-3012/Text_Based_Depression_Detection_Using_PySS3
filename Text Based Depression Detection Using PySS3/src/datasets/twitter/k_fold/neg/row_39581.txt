When you've tried everything, and there's nothing leftAfter going through therapy, being on and off of waiting lists for multiple services. In total, for my mental health, I've tried:
-GP
-Medication
-Crisis team
-A&amp;E mental health team
-Inpatient mental health care
-NHS talking therapies
-private talking therapies
-CMHT
-Online CBT
-Self-help books etc
-"self-care"

Despite it all I'm in the same place I've always been. So what now? I'm faced with the probability that there really is nothing left. This is how I have to live.

It's so unfair that the world forces you to live miserably. Dying is the only way this will ever stop. But I just can't do it and I hate that fact. I feel so completely trapped and helpless. Stuck with this thing life I never wanted.
