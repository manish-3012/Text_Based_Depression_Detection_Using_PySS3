I am too broken to be fixed :(I remembered being punched by my dad when I was 5 . I didnâ€™t want to have ponytails since it made my head hurt he told me he would do them and if I didnâ€™t like them he would take them off and I didnâ€™t like them and he got mad and gave me bloody nose. He didnâ€™t take me to school and asked someone to watch me. He gave me two more bloody noses one in middle school and in High school. They would always humiliate me about my weight I tried not eat a lot but as soon as a ate as a normal person my weight will go up. Turns out I have chronic illness dealing with my digestive system I am always in pain and nauseous. No one in my family takes my illness seriously they make fun of my I canâ€™t complain about my illness. When I was young my dad cheated on my mom and he took out his anger on me and my other sister I have 3 siblings. My sister and I have a bad attitude but I donâ€™t blame her they ruined our childhood.  My parents donâ€™t owe up to their mistakes they put us in the middle of it when dad cheated on my mom. We had to leave the country for a few months when it happened it was affecting us at school. The lady my dad cheated on my mom had everyone of their child bullyâ€™s us at school and bothers us back home. I am always sad they always comment on my weight when I canâ€™t even control it. I always have to be on medicine. I just want to give up on life already. The only thing that keeps me alive is my bf but sometime I wish he would find someone else so I can just end everything without guilt. I donâ€™t feel bad leaving my family behind. My dad told me he prefers me alive so he doesnâ€™t have to pay for the funereal.
