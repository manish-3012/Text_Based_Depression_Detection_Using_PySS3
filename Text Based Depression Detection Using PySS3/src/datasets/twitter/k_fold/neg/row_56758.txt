Here is my story and why I want to die.I have failed in my past. My life got sucked up by happiness consuming demonic friends of mine. My mother and father don't care about me and after all these years no one heard my scream and turned away from me.

I was a very weird kid that everyone calls a faggot from my back and to my face and I wasn't even know my sexual identity.  During university I have made a terrible mistake to pick the wrong discipline and I wanted to be a computer engineer. However I do not think that I can pass the elimination exam in my country to attend some place. The exam in 5 days from now on and suicide will be the right choice to end all this misery and unbearable pain. No one speaks to me right now. No one cares and please dont say you are important. This wretched world is not a place for powerless. I know that because I am one of them. I feel like the natural selection is rejecting me from the existence of all things. Rolling my sleves up and make the finale is a way out for me. I never successfully achieved my dreams. Not a single of them. So I failed the exam of life. I want to leave a mark and I will mark people through this way. When I'm gone I want them to suffer because of the happiness they have that they have been blessed with.  I want them to feel my pain, my agony and scream like I did.  I am done. I know that no one will hire me ever and know that I do not have time.  And I admit it.   You guys......  win this war.
