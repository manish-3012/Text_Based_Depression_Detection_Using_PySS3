Antisocial shut inHi! This sounds blunt but here it goes. I'm a 18 yr old F and I find suicide to be a very appealing option. I have a manipulative mother and a coward absent father who wants nothing to do with me. My sisters call me ugly often and I feel like the black sheep. I dropped out of school half way through 8th grade but I stopped paying attention in probably sixth grade.  So my education is rusty and I barely have a grade school education.. When I was in school though I was bullied and had no real friends. I followed my bullies and fetched their items like a puppy. Now I struggle with relating to people my age since for about four years I stayed at my house and only left for grocery shopping. I feel like I really have no social skills at all and people don't like me. I now have a basically minimum wage part time job. I have a boyfriend and we're in a long distance relationship...but... I booked the hotel to meet him and I feel so stressed out. What if I'm not as pretty as he wanted me to be? What if he feels like he made a mistake when he sees my body? I spend so much time, I mean hours a day thinking about jumping off a bridge. If I jump I can be at peace and I won't have to figure out what to do for a job, how to deal with my boyfriend not liking me, or how to properly make friends. The only thing keeping me here is my boyfriend. If he lets go I will let go. There really is no future with my current education level. Sorry this was so long and if you read it all. Thanks.
