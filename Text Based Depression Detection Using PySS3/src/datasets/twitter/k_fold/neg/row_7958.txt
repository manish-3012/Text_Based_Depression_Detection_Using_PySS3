I desperately need to talk to somebody.I'm a 17y/o male from the central US. I've been stuck in this reinforcing loop of self-hatred and social isolation for years and it's driving me fucking crazy. I really just want to talk to somebody right now.

Please message me if you're willing. Honestly, reaching out like this scares the shit out of me, but it's something I need to do. Some topics might be hard for me, but I want to talk about whatever. I think I would prefer phone calls because I need to actually physically talk to someone, but text is also great. Thanks.
