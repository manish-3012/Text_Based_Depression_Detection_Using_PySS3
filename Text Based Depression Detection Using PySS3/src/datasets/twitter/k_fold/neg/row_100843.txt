So fucking lonelyI'm so lonely tonight and fucked up tonight that it actually stings. I want to die so bad, and as soon as I can, I will. I'm well-past the point where I know that I'll never be the most important person in anyone's life, I'll never find "true love", and I'll most likely die friendless. I deserve this, but it hurts so fucking bad that I just want to die right now
