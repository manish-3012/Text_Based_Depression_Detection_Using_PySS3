I can't do this anymoreI wake up and feel nothing. Somehow it feels like everyday is the same day (since the outbreak i've completly lost my touch with reality and time) it feels fucking weird man. All i can Think about is if I get to drink some alcohol in the evening (since i live with my parents) and numb my mind.

Drugs became a huge value in my life, they show me different emotions such as love, confidence,carelessness and happiness.

And it fucking sucks. I can't get to experience this without drugs...

So this is hopefully my last fucking post.


On the 2nd of August I WILL TAKE MY FUCKING LIFE AND NO ONE IS GOING TO STOP ME!
