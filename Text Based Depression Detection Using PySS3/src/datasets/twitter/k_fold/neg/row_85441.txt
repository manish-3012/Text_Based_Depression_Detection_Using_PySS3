thoughts coming backI've done therapy, and left feeling great and with a good hold on my life. I'm on 40 mg of citalopram, and was feeling awesome.  

I don't know what's going on to cause them to come back, but they are.  

Nothing in my life is terribly *wrong* at the moment...I moved in with awesome roommates. I have a new boyfriend that treats me well. I'm well respected at my job. But I still don't want to be here.  

I get nightmares again. About him..leaving me for her. Almost every night now. And I wake up with a horrible attitude trying not to think about how much I hate both of them while pretending nothing's wrong to the one sleeping next to me. 

I had a panic attack at his place, I was on the bathroom floor crying quietly because all the bad memories came flooding back and I didn't want to keep fighting anymore. It's so hard. He found me and held me as I cried but how to you explain to your new boyfriend that your old one completely destroyed who you used to be. 

I few months ago I almost did it. It was the worst day of my life, the day I knew he chose her over me and I wanted everything to end. I called my friends sobbing scared that I was going to hurt myself. Sometimes I regret calling them. Sometimes I wish I had just done it. I can't explain why I want to die but I do. I wish I would just die in my sleep. I don't allow myself to buy pain medicine because I know that's how I would do it. 

Maybe I can just be hit by a car. I feel like a burden to people. Easily forgotten and passed up when someone better comes along. They all leave, eventually.
