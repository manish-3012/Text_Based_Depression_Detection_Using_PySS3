"Don't be sad, there's no point being sad." TF? just tf?So this happened a couple of days ago, and it seriously makes me angry. So  I was talking to my dad and I hinted about a year ago that I might be depressed and suicidal. After that he never really said anything about it until a few days ago. Now my dad is the kind of person who will say wake up early, exercise and think healthy and all problems will go away. While I'm fine with his methods as long as they're for himself, but he didn't do that. So the story, on Saturday I was a little far too low, and it was visible. And so my dad walked into my room and saw me, then he sat down and talked to me about school and so on. After that he went on about how the weather is pleasant and I should enjoy it. Now that's all fine, but then he said "Look, there's no point thinking you're useless and all that. Just think that you're useful, you're so useful, you help me so much." and I internally just lost it, like no shit, i never thought of that, like holy fuck, that's just bad advice on another level. OH MY FUCKING GOD.

Okay, I'm done ranting, thank you for reading this hope that you have a good day.
