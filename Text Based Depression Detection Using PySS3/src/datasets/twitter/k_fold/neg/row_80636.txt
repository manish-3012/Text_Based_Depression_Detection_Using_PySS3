Sad and tiredI'm sad. My life is going nowhere and it's because I'm a stupid fucking cunt. I wish I never existed. I mean nothing to no one, not even to myself. Only things keeping me together right now are games and music, and I am getting tired of listening to the same playlist and playing the same games every single fucking day. My whole life has lacked variety, I'm an uninteresting person and it's all on me. I was born and hopefully soon I'll die, everything in the middle has been and will be uneventful. I've lived for 19 god damn years and I have nothing to show for - no friends, no job, no goals or dreams, no girlfriend, no nothing. At this point I don't care what happens, I'm ready to go. Although the last thing stopping me is the thought of failing, being disabled or paralyzed wouldn't exactly better my situation. Well, what the fuck am I supposed to do now?
