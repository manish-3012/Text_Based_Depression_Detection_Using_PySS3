They say don't worry until you have a plan......and the other night I looked at a bottle of Ambien and thought that maybe if I took the whole thing I could just go to sleep and not have to wake up. The only thing that stopped me was the fear of what would happen if it didn't work. 

I still think if I had a fool-proof plan I'd do it. 

This Christmas just cements in my mind that nothing in my life will ever truly be good again.
