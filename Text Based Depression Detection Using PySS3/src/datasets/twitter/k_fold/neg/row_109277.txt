Just some thoughts?Suicide is an interesting topic for me. Itâ€™s something I have witnessed both from family members and friends doing it along with my own tendencies. I always tell myself â€œoh they are just thoughts I wonâ€™t actually do itâ€ but In the end I know if it came down to it.. I would do it. And to me thatâ€™s the scary part, the being uncertain until that moment comes. Just living my life in a shell of a lie, wearing a fake face. Iâ€™m the greatest actor I know. When you play it off and â€œpretendâ€ to be good, it ends up (at least in my case) just eating you up more. Itâ€™s like the rings inside a tree marking its age, each ring inside me is just another year closer to my inevitable end. And yeah I know that goes for everyone cause everyone dies. But I can feel it getting closer for me. I feel like the one tree standing still in the logging site, and itâ€™s day is about to come. And once Iâ€™m gone? Nothing. Not even a memory. Sure you will have some time of warmth brought on by the burning of my memory but with time that fades. Then one day Iâ€™m just an after thought no longer recognized. My life has been full of love and family, but for some reason I feel empty. And my fear as I read this back to myself shifts. The thing thatâ€™s fears me the most isnâ€™t the ending of it, but rather what comes after. Will I be remembered? Will my spouse love and cherish me forever? Or within 5 years will they have moved on and just forgotten me. Once my parents are gone... will there be no one to remember me? And in conclusion I can say with great assurance that my one fear over all is being a forgotten piece in this ever expanding time line. 
Thank you for your time,
Goodnight.
