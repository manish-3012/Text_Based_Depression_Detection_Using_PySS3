COVID is slowly giving me suicidal thoughtsCOVID has really made me depressed for the first time ever in my life I have never been down so bad in life to where I canâ€™t even have the energy to get up or do anything. Ever since this COVID shutdown procedure came to my city with fast food and everything where people and my friends used to have fun and eat closed I have been stuck in my room by myself playing my game or just FaceTimeing my gf and occasionally seeing her I also had some of my friends over and stuff but slowly over the past months that started to end. I recently broke up with my gf of 8 months a month ago and to make it worse I moved a couple weeks ago losing the ability to even link with my friends because I live a hour away now from all of them only making me get over my brake up even more painful I have just been stuck alone in my room playing with my Xbox friends to somewhat have some communication with people I donâ€™t have the motivation to do virtual school, I have 30+ absents and flunking all my classes I no longer answer any of my friends calls or text or post on social media my life has been complete hell this past month I donâ€™t know what to do my only hope is school starting back up but I doubt thatâ€™s ever going to happen Iâ€™m completely isolated from my family and everyone I hate everything about myself I have 0 motivation I canâ€™t even fall asleep I stay up all night just to eventually over sleep and skip virtual school waking up at 6 which is ithe time my mom is coming home from work and hearing her scream at me for doing so Iâ€™m sorry if this post has grammical errors and is long and all tht other shit but Iâ€™m just here to vent and clear my head the least Iâ€™m asking is to suggest some good romantic/sad animeâ€™s to watch this is the only thing that keeps my heart from Ease and lets my negative thoughts go away even if itâ€™s for a short amount of time...
