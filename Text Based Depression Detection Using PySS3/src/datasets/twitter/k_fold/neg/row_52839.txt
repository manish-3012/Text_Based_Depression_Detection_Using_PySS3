The state of the world is so shit I see no point in continuingLockdowns, authoritarianism, stupid political bullshit all the time, everything that used to be fun was ruined by politics and bullshit a long time ago. I hate myself and I hate absolutely everyone. My desire to harm both myself and others consumes my thoughts at all times. I no longer fear the consequences of either. I don't do it and what? I get to live in a shitty world with absolutely nothing to look forward to? Hard pass.
