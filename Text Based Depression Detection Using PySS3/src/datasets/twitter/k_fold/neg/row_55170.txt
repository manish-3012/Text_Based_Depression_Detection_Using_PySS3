If life isn't about spending time with friends, seeing cool places, doing fun things, and just plain having fun and doing everything you want to do, life is meaningless.But no, all we do is go to school and go to work so we can give money to the government. Where's the meaning in life when you can never enjoy the life you have? Life is given to you once and you have only a given amount of time to have and enjoy life, but no all we do is work work work.

I don't think I want to live in a world where you can't enjoy the one life you have, all you do is work.
