Im a little more insaneIt seems like im a lot more off then a lot of people on this subreddit. Probably means i wont actually do it. But holy shit every hour i think of killing myself. I've been dreaming since as long as i remembered i wanted to be something great and now all i feel is incompetence. Im scared to fail, i want to make sure i die. Sleeping pills are written off they'll probably leave me even more retarded than i already am. I fantasize about killing and killing myself with various methods. I need to be put down and maybe this just an attention thing but i feel like i can really do it. All day i feel pain and maybe it will go away but god i just want to end it.
