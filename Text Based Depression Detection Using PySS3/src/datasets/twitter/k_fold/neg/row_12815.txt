I really feel like this is it.Every time it seems like I post-pone these thoughts and suicide altogether, but the way everything has been going I'm not sure I can go on anymore. Like, I'm posting on this sub, this is my last attempt at trying to live at all. It's pathetic of me to ask strangers on the internet to give me reasons to live, but that's where I'm at. I feel like people will only like or talk to me, because they think if they don't then I'm gonna kill myself. I don't want to live like that either, that seems unfair to them.
