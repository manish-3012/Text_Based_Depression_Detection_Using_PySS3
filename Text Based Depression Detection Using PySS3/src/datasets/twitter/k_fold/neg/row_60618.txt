They will say I was "Loved"I wish I could read my obituary. It will say things like, "gone too soon" and "loved by many." Like bitch, if I was loved by many I wouldn't have killed myself. Everyone will say, "I wish he would've told someone." I have! I have said, "I'm going to kill myself" to people, actual people who I know. I hurt so bad man, nothing helps. I have a therapist and take medicine but the only thing it does is empty my wallet. Nobody cares about you until you're dead, they don't even care about you then but they'll say we were best friends. Damn life is wild, I hope there is an afterlife so I ask God some questions before he sends me to Hell.
