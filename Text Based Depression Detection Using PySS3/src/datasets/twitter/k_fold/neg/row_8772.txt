Feeling of being done, ready to endI don't know why I'm posting here. Maybe I'm trying to avoid the hospital again, maybe I want to be convinced somehow. I just feel like I'm done with life. Things aren't getting better for me. Moreover, I'm bored. I'm bored of the normal stuff: jobs, eating, sleeping. I'm bored of specialized activities: computers, sports, etc. I feel as though no one wants to be my friend and I don't blame them, I feel like even if I had friends I would still feel like this, which is sad, not too long ago I thought loneliness was the problem and that I would feel better if I just reconnected with people, but now I don't feel like that at all. What use is there? Why do I feel like people are kidding themselves when they have stuff to look forward to, or aren't suicidal in general? I think there is just something fundamentally different in my brain that wants to go away forever. Normal people don't feel like this. Death seems peaceful. Who knows though.
