A little rant about my thoughtsSo, I think about wanting to die a lot. It's not an emotional thing, I just feel tired of living sometimes. The feeling comes and goes, sometimes without a trigger. One month I'll be my normal happy extrovert self, then another month I'll barely leave the house. I always have feelings of being worthless, stupid and lazy though. When something happens to remind me how shit I am, I don't get sad, I just get tired. Sometimes when I feel like dying, I'll just lay in bed and wish death would come for me..... I guess I'm too lazy to even kill myself.  


  I have never been able to picture my life beyond my early twenties (where I am now). Maybe it's a premonition. Maybe it's just pessimism. I feel like my life will end soon, I don't know how or why, but I don't think I'm going to try to stop it. I'm going to keep applying for jobs though, just in case.
