Any helpI actually wanna kms now, not from people or words, but because I feel like Iâ€™m a burden. Itâ€™s just that no matter how much times I try and be calm, I lie and be mad and can be very stingy. I can understand if you donâ€™t wanna help me or give me advice, Iâ€™m used to people posting about me and leaving me. I also cut, but I donâ€™t wanna give a lot of information about that since I donâ€™t wanna be labeled as an attention seeker. I know this sounds confusing and thereâ€™s no context, but over all, Iâ€™m a catastrophe born in this world, just ruining peopleâ€™s vibes and happiness, thatâ€™s why I feel like a burden. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting this cause Iâ€™m not the person who would talk about my personal problems unless you are very close to me. I also need help to be accountable of my actions, cause I feel like thatâ€™s the main reason why I feel like a burden and driving people off...so any tips on how to be accountable?
