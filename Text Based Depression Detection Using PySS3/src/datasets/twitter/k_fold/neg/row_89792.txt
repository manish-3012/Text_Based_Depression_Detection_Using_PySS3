I donâ€™t see why people have to try to helpIf I think life is a joke, and being on this planet is shitty and pointless. Who are people to force me to live? If I think working a job I hate going home to being single and depressed my whole life, with only bass guitar and the gym and video games to try and block out the pain I feel from 24 years of heart break and unfortunateness isnâ€™t worth living then itâ€™s my life and should ultimate be my decision to euthanize myself and put myself out of my own misery
