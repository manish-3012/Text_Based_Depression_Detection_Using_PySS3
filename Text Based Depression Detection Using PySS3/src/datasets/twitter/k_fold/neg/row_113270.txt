My inner monologue is making me my own worst enemy. How to I change it?I've been at least passively suicidal now for about the past six months.  I won't bore you with the details, but my life has undergone very stressful and tumultuous changes since last Christmas or so, and most of it was self-inflicted.  As a result, I spend all day, every day calling myself a failure, even though I know that that's not necessarily the case, and some of my more immediate issues have since been resolved.  

As a result of my self-destructive thought patterns, I've been going out of my way to spend as much time as possible around other people so that I can escape from myself, if that makes sense.  I know I can't go on like this much longer.  Besides seeing a therapist (which I've started doing), what else can I do to change these thought patterns?
