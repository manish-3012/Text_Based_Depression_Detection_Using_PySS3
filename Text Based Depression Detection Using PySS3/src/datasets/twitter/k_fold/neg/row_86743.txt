Everything's not fine but I'm tryingJust a rant
Got drunk, way way too much. Had a panic attack in front of my friend who's never seen it before. Vomited on the floor. Got a new job and for some reason it's making me suicidal. State of the world is jacked up and makes me want to end it. I'm getting fat because food is the only thing that makes me better. At this point I'm wondering if I'll ever ever be content. Every day I hope I do. I hope everyone finds peace one day
