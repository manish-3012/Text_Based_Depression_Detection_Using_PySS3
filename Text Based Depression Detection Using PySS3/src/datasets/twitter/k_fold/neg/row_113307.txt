I made a mistakeI should've never called 911. I should've died. I have no reason to stay here never did never will. 
I am only waiting for my next attempt, this time I won't reach out, I won't care about nobody. Nobody cares about me they only see me as a piece of ass. I have no real friends. I have nothing. 
I'm done
