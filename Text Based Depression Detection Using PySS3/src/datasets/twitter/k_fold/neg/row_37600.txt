I'm going to do it soon.Recently it's all I think about, where I'm going to do it, how I'm going to do it and how people will react, will they care? Will they cry? What will they do once I'm gone? And also in the past few days I've ignored so many calls and texts from everyone, distancing my self so it's not such a shock to them, even though it's been going on for a while. I've tried to reach out to people but they just push it aside and say "just don't think about It" or something along those lines. I'm so sick of this bullshit, the asshole at school, I was already struggling at a school with less than 300 people, but now it's worse especially at a school with just over 1500 people.

I have so many dreams for the future, I want to be an actress, i want to get rich and famous to tell all the people who never helped me in any way, shape or form to go fuck themselves. I just want to die in general even though I've never done anything I've never had my first kiss, never told my crush that I liked them, never had sex  , I would say never had my first alcoholic drink but I have. I'm just so ready to end myself

I can imagine the school telling everyone that I'm dead, I can imagine my funeral, i can even imagine how my friends would react. I've had these thoughts for over 3 years, I've come close to killing myself 7 times. I'm just so over it. This is where I say goodbye.
