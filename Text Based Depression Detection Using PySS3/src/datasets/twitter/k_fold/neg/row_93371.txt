I've thought about killing myself every moment for the past week.I have a lot on my mind but I'll try not to ramble. Last week was my 20th birthday. I got really drunk with some friends and for some reason (I don't remember why) I got really upset and had a meltdown, walking around town at 7:00 AM not knowing how to think about my life other than the fact that I hate everything about myself. When I got home I cut myself with a way too dull knife and went to bed. Since that night the thought of committing suicide has made me feel so low I can barely function. I've missed classes, a group project, and now I don't even think I could go to my finals next week. I don't think I want to die but I know I don't want to go on living. At least not this life. I'm also really tempted to get all my shit together and just run away and try to start over but I don't think I could manage that. I'd be happy to just fall off the face of the world forever...
