In a world where I didn't exist.Mybe it would be a little brighter, less carbon prints &amp; maybe a little more oxygen. I don't mean a world wherein I kill myself, but a world where I never existed.

My family would be all neurotypical, they'd succeed gracefully, no one would disrupt the routine. My siblings would have a perfect role model.

My mom wouldn't have to worry about having a daughter she disliked. She wouldn't have to worry about me growing up to be the black sheep of the family. Her mind wouldn't be tainted by my thoughts.

It'll be more peaceful &amp; calm...?
