How do I get my parents to understandBackstory-Iâ€™m in college and had depression since 3rd grade (it comes and goâ€™s)

So I had a quiz today and my professor has a rule weâ€™re out of 3 quizzes the worst one gets deleted an it doesnâ€™t count 

So I told my mom and dad who are divorced and dad yells at me a little them my mom goes and starts yelling at me to shut up. U can get loans and live by yourself. Then proceeds to call my dad and I can just here her say heâ€™s ungrateful. So I just got into the shower with a bag to post this bc itâ€™s the only place im alone. 

What do I do? I feel like crying but when I do that they just start yelling at me more.
