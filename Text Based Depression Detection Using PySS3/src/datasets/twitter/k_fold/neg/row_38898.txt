I can't take it anymorethis pain inside me. It's too much. I can't handle it anymore, it hurts so much. I just want it to stop, please I'm alone everyone has abandoned me. Everyday that passes my pain grows, I have no one to cry to, no one to talk to. They're all tired of me, they don't understand me. Everyday I pray to God to release this pain of mine. But where are you? I can't hold out much longer.
Someone, please talk with me on the comment section or something, I don't want to be alone
