Parents donâ€™t understandThey never will. I donâ€™t think that anyone who has never felt this even can understand this. I try to talk with my Parents about how Iâ€™m feeling sad, while I actually feel like killing myself, and they tell me â€œgo for a walk, studies have shown...â€ I donâ€™t give a fuck what stupid studies you have read mom, I need someone to talk to when I canâ€™t talk to my friends. They never understand I donâ€™t think they ever will. Iâ€™m not asking for pity, I just need to tell someone, anyone. I hate my life. The masks I wear, I donâ€™t know who I am anymore. I donâ€™t know how to stop.
