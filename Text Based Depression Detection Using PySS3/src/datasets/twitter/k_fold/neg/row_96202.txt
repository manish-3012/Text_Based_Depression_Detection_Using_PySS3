I'm back to feeling like this.I'm glad I kept this account.

Last week i was sort of able to keep myself together. It was a welcome change after spending 2 weeks at a low point. That's where I'm at again. I've tried to improve myself, but I can't commit to anything.

The virus is starting to shut businesses down again. I'm so tired of this.

I spoke with my doctor finally and I have a Psychiatrist appointment on Tuesday. I can't wait to be sent home in the same state I came in.

I've been feeling more and more alone. I've got nobody to talk to and my best friend's busy with work or his girlfriend. It's like I don't exist anymore.

I'm so fucking ready to end it. I'm tired of the false hope, where there are days where I can laugh and smile and genuinely feel happy and then entire weeks where I can barely emote and I remember just how terrible things are. I hate it so much.
