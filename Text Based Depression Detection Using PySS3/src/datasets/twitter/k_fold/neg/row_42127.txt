I had 3 goes at hanging myself today (on my bday) 1st couldnâ€™t do it, 2nd stepped off and hung for 5 sec but grabbed the rope and didnâ€™t get to do the 3rd as I would of been caught. The front and back few vertebrae of my neck are very sore. Anyone know how long this lasts?I have a lumbar disc spinal injury 6 years now already that has me in so much pain and Iâ€™m allergic to pain meds so thatâ€™s what pushed me to today.
