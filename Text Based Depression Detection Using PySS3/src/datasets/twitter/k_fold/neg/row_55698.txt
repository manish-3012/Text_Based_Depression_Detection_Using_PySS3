What happens when you go to the hospital for suicidal thoughts?Iâ€™ve been considering going to a hospital near by but I want to know what will happen if I do. 

I have a plan and a way to carry it out but I may go to the hospital. Iâ€™ve stopped myself before and didnâ€™t get treatment but I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll be able to stop next time, I came really close this time.

I want to know what will happen before I go in there so I know what to expect
