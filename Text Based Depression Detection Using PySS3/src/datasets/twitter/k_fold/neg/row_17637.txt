Tonight?I canâ€™t do my schoolwork anymore. Itâ€™s too hard. I canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m a dumb student. Iâ€™m behind. Iâ€™m a failure. Iâ€™ll never be enough.

The only validation I get from my parents is when I do good in school. Right now, I am doing bad. I am horrible. Iâ€™m stupid.

Iâ€™m trying to figure out how much of this medicine to take to get me into the hospital. I canâ€™t find the information anywhere. I want to know if this dosage will kill me but I canâ€™t ask that here. Fuck!
