I was on top of the world... nowThis time last year I didnâ€™t know what anxiety was! I was busy everyday, training, studying, socializing. 

Now Iâ€™m at home.. Canâ€™t catch my breath, depersonalization, dry mouth, sweaty, depressed. 

Funny how quick things can go downhill.

Iâ€™ve dropped out of uni. I donâ€™t train anymore with my team. 

Anxiety is the devil. I just want to be the happy guy I once was. Who didnâ€™t take life so seriously, and always had a smile on his face.

My life changed this day 7 months ago. I was out partying, relaxing, unwinding. Went to a nightclub with my so called buddies. Was found 8 hours later on the street having a seizure. Brought to hospital, I awoke to be told by the doctors that I had been drugged. Since that day the anxiety Iâ€™ve been experiencing is out of this world. 

Now at the moment Iâ€™m crying. Crying cause I know that Iâ€™m going to end it. Iâ€™ve been suffering for 7 months, doesnâ€™t seem long. Itâ€™s been an eternity. I donâ€™t want help anymore. Talking about it only fires the anxiety up. Iâ€™m totally lost. 

I was once the popular kid. My phone never stopped with messages, notifications etc. That of course was before I got sick. 

Nobody truly cares. Bye
