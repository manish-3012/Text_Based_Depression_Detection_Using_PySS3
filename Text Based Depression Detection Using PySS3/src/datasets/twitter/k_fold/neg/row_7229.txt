Anyone here often think of the fact that one day you WILL die? Is this normal?Sometimes I think about it but usually when I'm going to bed I think of what it's like dying. It's an overwhelming feeling I get, acknowledging the fact "someday I **will** die and never exist again." I will die, I won't see anything else, experience anything else, I won't be able to live here anymore and the world will continue for who knows how long and I'll never live again. I dunno that just pops up out of no where in my mind and I get extremely depressed to the fact I have to fight to surpress my thought from continuing any farther once it starts. It spirals me into this extremely dark depressing place and totally brings my mood down. Anyone have any advice on how to deal with this?
