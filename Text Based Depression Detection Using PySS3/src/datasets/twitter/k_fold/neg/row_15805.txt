How badly does a codeine overdose hurt?And how long would it take if I took 10? :/ 

It's so easy it's right here and I've lost everything already. 

Please I just want to know how fast it would be? How long would it be? How much would it hurt? And could it hurt worse than this?

I'm tired of crying every single day I'm tired of getting my hopes up for something better. It's not getting better and I'm running out of hope. 

Who am I supposed to talk to when all I want is for him to listen? He'll never listen

I want them all to hurt for knowing and not saying shit they don't even ask me how I am!!

Please I'm so close to being free of this someone just tell me what it's like
