yikes mani searched up hanging pics and it looks 'easy.' its fucked up but its just with curtains from a fan you dont need a rope or anything.

i have been thinking about this scenario for quite some time now.

when/ if i were to do it i would block in my door with a chair so no one could get in. i would add a note saying to call someone to take me out idk if 911 does that or what. then id leave my note on my table. id keep my note short and sweet, with the obligatory dont blame yourselves.

itd be nice. im too afraid to go out at night to a bridge since i might get assaulted and id rather be dead than that. itd be nice in the comfort of my own home, and i dont even have to go to the garage where id see my dogs and reconsider.

my life in particular isnt shit, just the way i am. my life is great honestly but with the way im handling shit its best that ill be gone. i hope theres no afterlife if there is then id kill myself again lol
