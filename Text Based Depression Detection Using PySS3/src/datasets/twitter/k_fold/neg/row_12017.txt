I feel overwhelmed by merely existing and I don't have a clue how to combat these feelings. Sometimes it feels like it's asking too much to keep living anymore.A couple of times a month I get slammed by this wall of general anxiety about merely *existing* and it makes me want to do anything to end it. I've never tried to commit suicide before, but I've gotten really, *really* close to slitting my throat or crashing my car, and it scares the shit out of me. Do any of you have some good advice for calming down?
