I have no oneI havent a single person my age to talk to. Where the fuck do I find friends? I cant do this shit anymore.
Since middle school I told myself I was just gonna kill myself one day so I never tried anything or had motivation to even want the pursuit. 

Im sick of the cycle. Happy and healthy then i'm not? I have tried many things to guilt trip myself down to suicide like drugs and hookers. 
I fell guilty but im still alive. Im only 19 and Ive been to the lowest parts fuck this feeling I HATE THIS.
