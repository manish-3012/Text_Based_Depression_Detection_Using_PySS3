I need a purpose in lifeWhat is your purpose or meaning on this world? What is something you look forward to in life? Do you â€œfan girlâ€ over anyone/anything?

Background: 22 female, birthday coming up soon. I am in my last year of college and I am studying to be a mechanical engineer and I am the president of two clubs. I have a boyfriend that cares for me and a many people who say they do. I really just feel like I have no emotion and nothing to live for. Iâ€™m not sucidal but I think about it often.
It really sucks being a female in a male dominated field because I feel like I have no friends. All of my friends are male and I just want to be a girly girl with someone. I have a feeling that once I graduate Iâ€™m going to be just as lonely. I talk to my boyfriend about how I feel sometimes but I donâ€™t want to burden him with my issues. I hide my feelings in front of a â€œmaskâ€ and people always think Iâ€™m happy. Iâ€™m too shy to make new friends, people have to push themselves on to me to be friends.
Lately I have just been crying about my weight (Iâ€™m 6 feet tall 190lbs), school, and lack of feminine friends. I really want to find something that gets me going in the morning. This lack of emotion everyday is getting to me and making me stressed at school.

So just answer my questions above and Iâ€™ll see if that can make me truly happy.
