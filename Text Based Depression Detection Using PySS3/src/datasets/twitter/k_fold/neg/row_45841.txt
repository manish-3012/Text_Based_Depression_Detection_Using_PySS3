Drug abusing acoholic... forgot what a normal body feels likeI don't know where to start... I know that I have not been sober for at least 8 years. I drink at minimum an 18 pack of beer per day. 
Normally I can maintain a sense of social clarity.. but the last two weeks have been completely strange. By strange I mean... When I look at people, especially those I love I see nothing. Nothing but a new face.  Something odd is happening to my body.  I feel like my skin is similar to aluminum foil that is being heated by a lighter.  

I recently saw a doctor for my liver, but his advice was wasted breath.

I wanted at the time of the news of my liver being that of a 50 year old alcoholics, to change.  But that quickly faded.  I reverted back to drinking heavily and snorting, and smoking more and more opiates and the like.  

What do I have to live for other than my family? I don't see myself as anything other than a drug abusing alcoholic.  I'm not sad. I am concerned.  This is new...
