How does suicide effect people around you?Does anybody know the effects of suicide on friends and family? Is it likely they'll recover and understand eventually? 

I wouldn't call myself suicidal but it's an option I keep in mind. I think it's cruel that I have to stay in this world to avoid causing upset to people. I just want to know they'll eventually be okay if anything happens
