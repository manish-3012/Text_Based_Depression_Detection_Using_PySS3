I canâ€™t go back to school after spring break...Like everyplace in America, my college is going to take the retarded reactive approach to the coronavirus and wait for a student to instead of proactively closing it. The school is around several elderly communities and nursing homes and hundreds will die when it spreads into the community.

The school is international, kids are traveling everywhere right now. The school banned travel to an anemic list of countries, completely ignoring places the have hundreds of cases and that will have thousands next week.

Itâ€™s not a question of if someone brings it back. IT. WILL. HAPPEN. Iâ€™m sick of complete disregard institutions have about this disease. Just because your demographic of people (young and healthy) will have minimal loss, doesnâ€™t mean the more vulnerable wonâ€™t.

Proactive gets you prepared hospitals and a readied populous. Reactive gets you a nursing home full of dead people.

This day 3 months ago I tried to kill myself by overdosing and woke up the next day. I have spent 3 months dragging myself out of madness and depression to get my life back together. Iâ€™m home hours away from school on spring break right now. Iâ€™m around the few things I give a shit about. My family, my pets, my home and my hobbies. I have a few acquaintances at school, but no friendships. Besides getting my degree, Iâ€™m more or less incapable of giving a shit about anything at school.

I know my school is going to make the wrong choice. Itâ€™s the classic â€œat least itâ€™s not meâ€ situation with a disease that kills less than 0.1% of young adults, but 10% of the elderly. I donâ€™t want to lose my scholarships and grades, but I refuse to go back until this damned virus is gone.

I donâ€™t want to be in a city filled with the elderly and infirm during a pandemic. I donâ€™t want to be quarantined in some kind of structure surrounded by the sick. I donâ€™t want to be isolated from my family. I donâ€™t want to watch this shitshow unfold in a place with nothing I care about and nothing to live for.

At least at home I will have the strength to move forward and get through this. I know myself and how I work. I have autism, loneliness eats my soul, stress, Despair, meaninglessness and hopelessness drives suicidal thoughts. A sustained situation like that will push me off the deep end and will kill me unlike this virus. Iâ€™ve been through natural disasters before, a support system like my family is what keeps you going through it. I have nothing for me at college, I merely am a collection of organic matter when Iâ€™m there. If Iâ€™m forced to go back and Iâ€™m right about what is to come, letâ€™s just say there are better things to overdose on...
