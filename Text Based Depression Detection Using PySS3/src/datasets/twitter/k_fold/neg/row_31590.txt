I am a mistakeI donâ€™t know what to do anymore I mean Iâ€™m such a screwup. God cursed me with all of these mental disorders that screw up my life even more Iâ€™m tired of living in this body and I just want to be a normal functioning human. I get terrible grades in school I manage to screw up everything. Iâ€™m done trying to live. thereâ€™s absolutely no hope for me nobody cares about me loves me or anything. Iâ€™m always alone with anybody and even the â€œfriendsâ€ that I do have they just make fun of me and ignore me My parents donâ€™t give a shit about me the only thing they care about is Jesus and thatâ€™s it. Nothing can fix me 2 mental hospitals didnâ€™t work therapy didnâ€™t work nothing will. Iâ€™m sick of living. I donâ€™t give a shit what anyone says anymore it wonâ€™t matter when Iâ€™m dead tonight. For everyone reading this I may already be dead
