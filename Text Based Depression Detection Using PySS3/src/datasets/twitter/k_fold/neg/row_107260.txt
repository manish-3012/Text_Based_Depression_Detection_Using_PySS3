i donâ€™t know what i want so iâ€™m making this post to process.iâ€™m fucking scared and iâ€™m really fucking confused.
i posted here a little bit ago making it clear that i was going through with or had already gone through with my plan, but i didnâ€™t because i was too scared that the medication i had wouldnâ€™t be enough and because iâ€™ve failed two suicide attempts in the past and have spent so much of my youth stuck in psychwards already (iâ€™m not joking, i canâ€™t even count how many hospitalizations iâ€™ve had anymore), i really donâ€™t want to fail if i do go through with this.
and now here i am, i just bought 100 more unisom pills finally on my own. so now i have all of these with even more unisom, and tylenol, and latuda, and pristiq.
and i can do it. i can do it right now. i donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll work, but itâ€™s a lot of medication so iâ€™m willing to try.
but iâ€™m just still scared and confused.
in my head iâ€™ve already pretty much processed this. i know that my life has fucking sucked, and that in my heart i truly believe that there is no fucking way that iâ€™m going to accept who iâ€™ve become, whatâ€™s happened to me, and ever be able to move on. iâ€™m seventeen and iâ€™ve suffered for the majority of these days since iâ€™ve been eleven or twelve.
my life has just been depression, anxiety, anorexia, ocd, binge eating disorder, and BDD behind closed doors. iâ€™ve been lonely, and the truth is that if anyone cared enough about me i wouldnâ€™t be so lonely.
this sounds so scary to me, but i donâ€™t even feel human anymore. i donâ€™t feel alive. as iâ€™m typing this, i feel like iâ€™m in a dream. i feel like iâ€™ve already died. i donâ€™t feel like iâ€™m even here now. i really believe this is what i have to do, itâ€™s not that this is what i want to do, but what i have to do. i didnâ€™t want to suffer like this and reality is i never wanted to have to kill myself. but everything thatâ€™s happened to me has brought me here. iâ€™m just so scared.
i could call my therapist today and tell him how iâ€™m feeling. and iâ€™ve been looking into the idea of finishing my senior year (which is just a couple months away) in boarding school. but i just feel like itâ€™s too late. like i said, iâ€™m so broken, and i donâ€™t feel human anymore. i donâ€™t know if anyoneâ€™s gonna read this but i just really am trying to process what iâ€™m about to do. i just want someone to know how scared and lost i am. iâ€™m also very afraid of death because i donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s next. heaven? hell? just eternal unconsciousness? resurrection? i just donâ€™t know and that makes this situation bad because what if i die and whatâ€™s next is bad too.
