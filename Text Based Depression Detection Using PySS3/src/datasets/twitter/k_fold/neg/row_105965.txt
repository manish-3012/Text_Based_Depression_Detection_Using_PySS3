Almost virgin nearely 27 suicide in two monthsI am ouv of ideas. I like girls, they like me. I've had many female friends ovec the years, they all give up on me of course, managed to love my firginity to a fat girl. Nothing since. I value love and affection and I am not bad looking but girls expect too much, I can't go to nightclubs or even try to live a normal life because I find attractive girls everywhere. I have no real ability to attract them and I had no way to learn. I am depressed most of the time because of lack of affection. Girls I know and value the opinion of have told me the usual, I'm a great guy, I'll find someone. Ten years, no one. I'm meant to have confidence but no one wants to help me learn what I apparently should have learned by now. I need help and the only people who could help are unwilling or unable, I can't take it anymore.
