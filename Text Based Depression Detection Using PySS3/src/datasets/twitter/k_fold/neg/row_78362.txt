'why are you getting so worked up over something simple?'why do i get so worked up? Maybe because all my life I've grown up around people who freak out or argue over simple things. People who will start fighting over you saying the wrong thing. Maybe i'm getting tired of my opinion never getting heard. Maybe i'm tired of constantly being laughed or yelled at. Like when i say to stop when someone jokes at me flinching after they raise a hand or walk behind me. Maybe i'm tired of being brushed off. Maybe i'm tired of keeping a smile while i'm degraded in front of other family members. Maybe all the toxic people i grew up around have affected me. Maybe its because my identity is constantly being brushed off even when i'm not out to you. Maybe all the stress and pressure gets to me too. Maybe i'd like to go one day without someone getting upset. Maybe i'm tired of always being the butt of a joke and ignored or called 'overreacting' when i ask to stop. Maybe i just don't know how to react since I've never been taught how to deal with my issues besides arguing or breaking down.
