I didn't dieLong story short I messed up and didn't drink enough liquor to let the tylenol and prescription medications kill me. I took 30 pills of extra strength tylenol, 70 pills of antidepressants, between 350 and 500 mg worth of weed edibles (just to ease any pain, not to contribute to the overdose in any way) and about 5 or 6 beers. I woke up about an hour after falling asleep and puked, losing a lot of pills and what little liquor I had in me, in the process. I went back to sleep thinking maybe I'd still die and woke up a bit after and when I wasn't dead, called an ambulance. The lady in the ambulance told me I was going to die a slow painful death and generally made me feel like garbage the whole time. At the hospital I overdosed about 15 minutes after arrival and woke up from a coma about a day or two later. Since then I've made multiple trips to the psych ward but lied to them and didn't tell them the severity of my issues.
