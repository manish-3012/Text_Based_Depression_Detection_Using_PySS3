Iâ€™ve become numbI look back at videos from times when I used to have emotion, when I used to like stuff, when stuff used to amaze me. I used to feel love, sadness, amazement, so many intense emotions but since I joined the army that has been slowly going away. I used to be so happy, but after I joined the army depression hit me like a ton of bricks. Eventually it just got to be so much that I think my mind just shut down, itâ€™s hard for me to feel anything anymore. I hardly eat, I hardly sleep, I donâ€™t clean my room, I donâ€™t leave unless I have to and I donâ€™t do anything productive. Looking back at memories and songs that I used to love, and having that intense emotion all over again proves that I can have that, that I donâ€™t have to be a mindless zombie aimlessly wandering through life, I can have love, fear, I can be amazed by the beauty of incredible things. I canâ€™t stay in the army or Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™ll lose that forever, I need to get out! If I get to the point where I canâ€™t feel ANYTHING anymore I will 100% kill myself, the moment that happens. If thereâ€™s one thing the army can take, itâ€™s your soul, and I canâ€™t let it take mine.
