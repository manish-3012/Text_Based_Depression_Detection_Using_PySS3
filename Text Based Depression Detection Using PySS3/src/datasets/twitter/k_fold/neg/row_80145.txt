Fuck thisI canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™ve been pushing through this shit for too long. I see no reason anymore. Iâ€™ll never amount to anything. Iâ€™m talentless and completely fucking stupid and unmotivated. My two reasons were not to hurt my friends and the hope to get with this girl who Iâ€™ve been trying to get with. At this point Iâ€™m done fucking pushing and fighting. Iâ€™m done breathing and dealing with this constant abysmal fucking never ending pain. Iâ€™m on the verge of just going through the fucking cabinet and taking a bunch of fucking pills. There is no purpose for me and there never was. If Iâ€™m not here in a few hours I love you all and donâ€™t be weak like me. Keep pushing. I love you guys.
