I have had enough of this destiny bs, I have hurt enough peopleI have been regularly failing to get into a university for two years now. I absolutely hate it more Because everytime I give it my all and Because of some their party interference whom I have no control over my entire work gets splashed away, till now I have got 5 university rejections and 1 visa denial.
I got a girlfriend who looked after me as I have MDD but she also cheated on me and now when she's back in my life (not as a girlfriend only as a lover), she supports me a lot but I can't stop feeling paranoid and jealous and I end up hurting her.
I have spent a lot of my parents money and they just look disappointed now.
I am already sitting with about 10 clonazepam tablets ready in my pocket to pop in and get knocked out once and for all.
I am such a big failure and loser that I don't even have guts to end my own life.
