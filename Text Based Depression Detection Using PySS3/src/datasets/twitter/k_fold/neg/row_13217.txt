it hurts

Hi, I have no one to talk to and no one to listen. I really want to kill myself. I have really bad depression and anxiety and i cant do this anymore. My dad is abusive and I have bad ptsd from an old abusive relationship that i cant get over. I miss him. Also my best friend committed suicide a bit ago and life hurts so much. I want to elaborate but i worry no one will read it. I have no one and I feel very alone and sad. I keep waiting for it to get better like everyone promises but it never does. Iâ€™ve been waiting for a very long time. I really hate myself so much. Anyway, thank you for reading. Iâ€™m so tired.
