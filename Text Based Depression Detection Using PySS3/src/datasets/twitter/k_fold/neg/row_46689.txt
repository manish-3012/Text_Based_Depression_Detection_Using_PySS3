How bad are your finances?Do you owe the IRS (or equivalent) thousands of dollars?

Are you months behind on your student loans?

Do you owe ten grand back child support?

Have you recently been evicted so can't rent anywhere anyone would want to rent?

How do you feel when you look into a future that has no solutions? Death is the only way out. Put a bullet in me, the only sweet liberty.
