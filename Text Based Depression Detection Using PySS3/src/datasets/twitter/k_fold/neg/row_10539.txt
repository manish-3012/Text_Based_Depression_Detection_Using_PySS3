Just here to helpIâ€™m here to support for anyone who needs it I mainly can support in suicidal, self harm, and eating disorders as thatâ€™s what Iâ€™ve experienced irl but I can try to help with other things though I may not be the best. If you need support you can comment or pm me although because reddit is being stupid for me I normally donâ€™t get much notifications so if I donâ€™t respond right away sorry, if you want to contact me quickly unless Iâ€™m asleep Iâ€™m always available on discord my discord is Logan41#9814 (17m) remember though Iâ€™m not a professional but Iâ€™ll still try my best to support you
