Death was closeI almost killed myself yesterday, but I couldn't find my dad's gun. I ended up opening up to my parents and telling them how much I hate school (and life because of it). I'm going to finish my last year, but I'll probably get shitty grades compared to what I'm used to. They're okay with it though. They just want me to graduate. They wouldn't listen to me at first until my mood switched, and I was ready to end it all. I'm glad they care, but it sucks that I had to appear (and be) distressed to get their support. I don't want to graduate just to work for some fucking corporate company (in an office). Hopefully, I get my shit together.
