Ever wonder that us suicidals is just nature's way of culling off the weak?I searched here because I know I'm not alone and tell my story...  but then I see there are so many of us. I look at outsiders (because I have no friends) and wonder "how must it feel to wake up each day confident with who you are?". I'm talking about deep down confidence. Not superficial shit about how one looks in a bikini. I'm talking about the kind of confidence where a person **lives their life as if it means something** regardless of the faults that everyone has. 

I'm 30. No job, no friends, no family. Nothing. Oh wait I have PTSD. And debt. And anger. Anger at all these fucking patronising, upbeat, yellow and pink ribboned fancy anti-suicidal threads that for the most part (not all) are created by people who just have zero clue. And if you do have a clue remember that all this upbeat  "it'll get better" shit is just offensive. 


**"Oh this is fucking temporary is it?"**


**"Oh my life is fucking precious, I'm unique, I'm beautiful on the inside and deserve something!"**


**"easy for you to say it'll get better!"**


---------------------------------------------------------------


Pfft. I know people who have gone therapy and it's worked. For their sake I let them believe this bullshit but the mere thought at saying those words aloud leaves a bad taste in my mouth. When this crap is spewed at me by people that don't have a fucking clue I just look them in the eye and nod politely. 


**"STFU and get over it", some say.**


**"My god aren't you a self-absorbed prick?" others.**


**"Fucking hell you wont get anywhere with an attitude like that!"**



SO what I'm a defeatist? I don't know any other way. I would love to be unfazed by all the bad shit thrown my way. I have known a couple people with perfect lives - perfect being nothing PTSD inducing, comes from money, a loving family and the biggest crisis they had was turning in an assignment late costing them another year at uni. And they bounce through life without a care in the world and great success. Upbringing and environment counts for something. 


No one thinks I'm worth anything least of all myself. Not for a friend, a worker or as a lover. I'm just here to be culled but nature is efficient so I have to do it myself.
