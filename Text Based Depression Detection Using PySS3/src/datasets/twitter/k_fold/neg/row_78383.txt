Drinking, cryingMy home is full of people I love right now. My best friend Q is in my living room playing on her phone listening to music. My other friend B who lately has been acting as my lover is in my bed trying to go to sleep and sexting a girl she recently met. I ignored each of them and instead cleaned the house. Now, I sit here in my office alone in the darkness drinking.

Q was just crying herself earlier, she's trying to make the decision to move away and try to put her life back together. B was pouring her heart out to me professing how she loves me and I'm the one she wants to be with, I instead tell her how I'm broken and can't love back.

I am broken but moreso, I don't deserve any of them. I don't deserve love or compassion. I'm a broken freak with nothing in my future. If I died, Q would get money she needs. B would be free to find someone else to love. I wouldn't have to feel this pain any longer.

I want to die, I've been so close so many times to it. I have the means. I push the ones I love away and it hurts to do so but I deserve the pain
