Nothingâ€™s stopping me from killing myselfLiterally. If â€œlife isnâ€™t fairâ€, why live? Why continue to try. â€œSuicide is the cowardâ€™s way outâ€ oh so youâ€™re gonna shame me for wanting to die. Okay. Or how about â€œman upâ€ even though Iâ€™ve been through hell and back and still continue to show respect to everyone every day and hold in the pain from the shit they give me. Yeah I totally need to man up. I havenâ€™t been happy in years. Iâ€™m done. I know for a fact my family wonâ€™t miss me. All they do is shame me for feeling this way, as if I donâ€™t appreciate them. Iâ€™M the one who gets zero appreciation from anyone. The fact that I can just run out to the street and get hit by a car at anytime is making me so happy. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
