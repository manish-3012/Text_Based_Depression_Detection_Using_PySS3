feeling really hopelessi used to have so many hobbies, friends, and just things that brought me joy in general. but I havenâ€™t felt happy in a really long time, and I donâ€™t think I ever will. The idea of never knowing inner peace and happiness is so draining. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s much to this life, I mostly feel like Iâ€™ve wasted and ruined everything. I think Iâ€™m better off gone.
