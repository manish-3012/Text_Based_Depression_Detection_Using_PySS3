Sometimes everything is overwhelmingI dont really tell anyone how I feel ever, and sometimes it gets really overwhelming. I feel really alone. I donâ€™t really have anyone supportive in my life to me. The people I call my friends are not really my friends. My girlfriend just left me yesterday without giving me a reason and never tried to work it out. I know there is so much to life and I am only 18 years old, but this feeling of confusion, anxiety, being alone, constant sadness, and this constant feeling of just everything being too much. Iâ€™m not going to kill myself, but sometimes everything is too much for me to handle. Its been 5 years of suffering. I used to abuse drugs and alcohol to make it better when I was 16, but now Im sort of sober now. I just want to have love in my life. Every sort of chance I get is ruined. I am the problem in all of the relationships I have had. I am the problem when my parents are always mad and disappointed. I am the problem I have no real friends, If it wasnâ€™t me then who else could it be? If could not possibly be everyone else in the world except me. I just want love in my life, I just want someone who I genuinely love to be here with me and I would be here for them. I thought I had it and right when I get so secure and safe and happy itâ€™s gone. Just like that. When I am out or I look around I see everyone just living their lives and if I wasnâ€™t there literally nothing would be different in life. Im useless, I make everyone sad, I want good things in my life, but I donâ€™t deserve them. I am sorry to everyone I have hurt. I hope I am not here for much longer. I am not ready and I have no clue what path in life I should go in, and I donâ€™t want to go to university yet, I just want to do nothing forever. i just want to stop forever. God if youâ€™re real please talk to me. I am trying. So hard.
