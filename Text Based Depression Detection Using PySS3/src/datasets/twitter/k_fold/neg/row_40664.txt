I think I'm just permanently brokenI was abused as a child, pretty badly. The first time I ever considered suicide I was 7 years old, by 10 I was sure I would never make it to adulthood. Whether due to the abuse or my own weakness, I'm not strong enough to exist. Any slight stress or bad day is enough to send me into an emotional tailspin leaving me wishing it was all just over.

I'm 21 now, and still just as fucked. I'm not happy, I've never been happy. I'm just tired of doing the same breakdowns over and over again. I'm tired of having to fight so hard to do basic things. I just want to not hurt and be afraid anymore.
