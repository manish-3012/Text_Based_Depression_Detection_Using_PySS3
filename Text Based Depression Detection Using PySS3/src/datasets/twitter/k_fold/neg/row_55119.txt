just got out of an inpatient ward and I feel even worse than beforeI tried killing myself a week ago and called 911 after freaking out when I slit my wrist. I wanted help and I was at my lowest and while I was inpatient I got treated like shit by both the staff and most other patients. I was singled out just like I have been my whole life even though I was always trying to just mind my business in the corner and not speak with anyone unless spoken to. I know I'm going to try again at some point and I know next time I'm not going to call 911, and the more I think about it the more I think about using something where there really won't be any turning back like a gun or something.
