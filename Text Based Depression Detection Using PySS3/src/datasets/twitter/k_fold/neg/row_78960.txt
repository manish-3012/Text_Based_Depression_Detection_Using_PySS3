sometimes i think about killing myselfif i wasn't such a little bitch, i'd probably already be dead. maybe one day i will work up the courage. i know it's fucked up that i'm looking at this like some kind of act of bravery, but it's how i feel. it doesn't even make sense but i sometimes feel like my whole life has been a giant waste and a huge disappointment, and i just feel like i want to die. like, i deserve to die.

sometimes the only thing that keeps me from doing it is my fear of dying. god it's cliche but i feel trapped between a life of misery and death. i don't always feel like this, but when i do i just try and wait it out, because i remind myself that the feeling doesn't last forever, but death does. i think i really just want to fall asleep, and drift off to never-never land.

my life's pretty good in a lot of ways, so i try and stay grateful for existing, and getting to experience everything that i've experienced in this relatively short life. it's a beautiful and cruel world, and sometimes suicide feels like the perfect expression of that dichotomy. that's probably some projection bullshit, but it feels real. i can't even trust my own feelings, they've just lied to me too many times. sometimes i don't even know what is real.

i know how pathetic this all reads, sometimes i just feel hatred towards myself, and my brain is trying to kill me.

ugh and blech.
