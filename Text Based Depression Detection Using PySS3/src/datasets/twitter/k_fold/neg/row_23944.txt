Is this enough?I have 12 Vicodin (325mg Acetaminophen / 10mg Hydrocodone) and 60 zzzQuil (25mg Diphenhydramine ea). I'm keeping it in my glove-box and I have 2 water bottles under my driver seat. I've felt broken long enough; a lot is going well in my life, but it simply doesn't matter anymore. I don't know when I will take them, but I will. I'm waiting because I'm getting some things in order before I go. Is this likely enough? And am I likely to vomit? If so, how should I avoid this?
