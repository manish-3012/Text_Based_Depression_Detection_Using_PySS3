fuck this shitEverything I do seems pointless. I live at home and I'm almost thirty, my mother thinks that I'm a joke, anything I like doing is bad for me physically and mentally in the long run. I just want it all to go away. The only thing that keeps me going is my younger brother and my girlfriend. They have no idea the despair I feel day to day. As time goes on I think more and more about how I'm going to end my life and I don't know who to turn to. Going to get help from a therapist would cost money and make me feel like more of a shitstick. I'm just looking for a reason, any reason to keep going. I have no interest in anything, nothing excites me; I pass my time reading stupid shit on the internet. I care about other people, but I don't feel like anyone really cares about me. Everyone wants something, and I don't have much to give. I feel like a drain on them and the world would be better off without me. Maybe this is a cry for help, but while I have some misgivings about cutting my life short, I really don't see life getting any better.
