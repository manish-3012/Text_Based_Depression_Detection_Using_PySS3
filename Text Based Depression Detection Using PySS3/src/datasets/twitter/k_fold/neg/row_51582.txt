Letter to my wife and other wives who are horrible people.It's you. It's totally 100% you. You are the reason I want to kill myself. You are the reason I am unhappy. You are a vile person who doesn't deserve a man like me. You don't deserve a daughter like we have. You need to shut the fuck up sometimes and let me talk. You need to let me have the last word for once. You need to get your ass off the sofa and help a little bit. You did OK for a few months but the old wife is back again. Sometimes i don't want to cook dinner. Sometimes I don't want to pick up the daughter. Sometimes I feel down and need you. I shouldn't have to write about you on the interwebs. I should be able to talk to you but you never listen. Sometimes it's me who needs help. 

I'd divorce you but the woman always come out better in court and I'd be worse off than I am now. Then you'd have even more to hold over me and I can't let that happen. I can't let you get anything up on me and that is why I have to check out of this misery called my life.

I probably won't do it tonight but some day I'll have the courage to and you'll see. Everyone will see that I really do have it in me. 

If you read this I hope you understand that it was you all along. You were a good person when I married you but now all you are is nasty and lazy. I hope you are happy.
