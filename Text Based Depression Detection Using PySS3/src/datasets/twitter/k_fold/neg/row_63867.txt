Feeling really low.I've suffered from depression since ages and recently I hurt someone really close to  me and also got to know that I probably can't be with the woman I love. I am seeing a psychiatrist and I have been prescribed fluoxetine. I am feeling really really down right now and I can't help thinking how worthless I am and how everyone will be better off without me. :/
