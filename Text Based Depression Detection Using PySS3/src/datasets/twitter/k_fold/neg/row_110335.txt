A Million Reasons Yay vs 1 Reason NayThe one thing that has kept me alive for many of the past years of my life is my family. Not in the way that the support they show has helped fight against my depression and better me as a human, but rather in that I cant hurt them by taking my life. I have accepted I want to die, I have for a long time now, and I have accepted that my death will most likely be at my hands, no matter when it happens. My mind is too far gone, and they all say it gets better in the future. Even if that is the case, even if in a few years I will find happiness, I truly don't care. Life is a game, and even if I am bound to win, I am sick of playing anyway. That's a large IF though. I don't care what happens in the future, its the path to get there that I really don't feel like traversing. I don't want to live. I have a million reasons why I don't want to live anymore, on why I want to die, to why I already know how I will do it. But there is one single thing keeping me from doing it, one single thing that has been the only counter to the decision causing internal debate that has existed within for years. My family. I cant stand the fact that I have a super caring family. I have fantastic parents and a sister, and we have grown up a pretty close-knit family. I cant get myself to hurt them, and it makes me hate them for it. I am jealous of those who have no family that care about them. Because then I could so easily just go through with my decision. Why do they have to care about me? Why do I have to care about the pain I would cause if I do as I wish? I occasionally daydream about terribly morbid and tragic stuff happening to my family so I could finally end my own life. It makes me feel awful that I would even wish something like that, and I tell myself I don't actually want something bad to happen to them like that, but sometimes I cant tell. I also so badly wish I could get terminal cancer, or some random incurable disease that kills me relatively quickly. Or I want some accident to happen that ends up killing me. I hope for tragic things to happen to me because then for the sake of my family, it wont be my own doing. I just feel stuck. I have long given up on living and working on my life and trying, but I also cant kill myself. I want to, it would be simple and I am so completely ready to, but I cant. So I am left "living" just to keep my family from experiencing unrelenting grief. What am I supposed to do?

Sometimes I get impulsive and almost do it. Almost go through with it. I have a short note already written out, but I truly don't really know what to say because I know that it will leave a million things unanswered for my family anyway. And I know no matter what, they wont understand. I hate it when I hear families grieving somebody's suicide say, "Did they even think about the pain they would cause us?" Uhhhh of fucking course we do. That's literally all I think about. Choosing suicide is not an easy decision by any means, rather its probably the most difficult decision a person could ever make. I, for example, know that I want to commit suicide. But guess what, I haven't yet. I've held it off for years, and you know why? Because I AM THINKNG ABOUT THE PAIN I WOULD CAUSE YOU. It is LITERALLY the only reason I am alive right now. I despise my selfishness, so I haven't let it win yet. But I know that I can never get you, or anybody, to ever understand what goes on in my head. I don't know the point of this post, I am sorta rambling some shit that has no meaning anyway. Please, someone just come murder me or something, so I can get what I want and my family wont think it was my own doing.
