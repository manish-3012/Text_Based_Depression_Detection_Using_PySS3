i feel very stupid writing this but oh wellFor about a year now i have had thoughts about killing myself, and Iâ€™ve come close to it several times. I can, from an outside perspective, see that me killing myself is not a good thing. But on the inside, every cell in my body is screaming that it is the only way out. My mental illnesses have been getting worse, my friends feel so distant, the world feels so far away. Its like Iâ€™m in space, or under water, and Iâ€™m screaming but of course nobody hears me. I canâ€™t stop thinking that it would be so easy, just slip out of reach, forever. 
i feel writing on here about this, but i can admit i am desperate.
so why am writing on here? i donâ€™t really know, maybe to see if Iâ€™m just screaming into an empty void, maybe to get some of what i am feeling out. honestly i am completely lost.
