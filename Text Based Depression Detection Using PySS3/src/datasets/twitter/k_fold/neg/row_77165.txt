I lost the only motivation to keep livingI met this amazing girl online, we were together for 4 months and it was going great. She always helped me out when i needed her. She broke up with me yesterday, she wants to be like best friends. And I'm okay with that, but she isn't in love with me anymore. But I am, I love her so much and I can't have her. I've been struggling with depression for a while now and have many suicidal thoughts but even just thinking of her made me think to keep pushing so I could be with her when I leave school.

But now, there's no point, I have a few friends + family and they'll be hurt. But I don't want to live anymore. She is all I fucking want, she told me the distance was too stressful for her. And she also told me she loves me but she isn't IN love with me. 

I've already tried hanging myself with a belt but all I can use is a doorknob and I while it was happening I panicked and took the belt off. There's no reason to live and keep on going. I want to keep everyone from wasting their time and money and just die.
