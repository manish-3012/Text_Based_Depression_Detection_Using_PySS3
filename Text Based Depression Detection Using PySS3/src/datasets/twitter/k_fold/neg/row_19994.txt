i feel like a freakin messiâ€™ve ruined every good thing that has come to me with my stupid mental illnesses. from grades to friendships to anything honestly. iâ€™m tired of it and iâ€™m at my breaking point. i ruined my relationship recently with having too many issues and burdening my ex with it, i am at fault. i cannot feel or think it isnâ€™t my fault. he was so good to me and i ruined it just like i ruined everything. itâ€™s taking a lot of self control to not off myself rn, but idk how long thatâ€™ll last for. iâ€™ve been feeling like this for weeks and iâ€™ve talked to my therapist and texted the helpline, but nothing feels better. i relapsed in sh because idk what else to do to feel just even a little bit better. nothing feels ok, nothing is interesting anymore, i donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore. i donâ€™t even want to talk to see my friends. i donâ€™t want to feel like this. i donâ€™t want to exist. iâ€™m just so exhausted.
