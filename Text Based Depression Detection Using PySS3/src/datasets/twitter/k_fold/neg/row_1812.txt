Iâ€™m studying pharmacy, so I know the number of pills I took wonâ€™t kill meTbh that only makes me feel worse, like an imposter amongst people that genuinely want to die. I didnâ€™t calculate the dose beforehand, just as I laid on my bed afterward, my brain went in work mode. Barely ceiling dose but well above what I was prescribed. But i wonder if I knew when I was taking them that it would be fine. Like subconsciously. 

Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll sleep well, sucks that Iâ€™ll wake up at the end.
