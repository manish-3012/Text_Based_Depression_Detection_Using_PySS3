No one helpsAll I did was report someone who broke the rules.

That's all it took for the entire school bus to hate me.

I try and sit near someone, and one of 3 things happens:

\- They shove me off the seat

\- They crawl over the back to another seat

\- They begin to scream at me to leave

I reported a 6th grader who wasn't supposed to be sitting in the back, and my life went to hell. She calls me a "stalker" for some reason, states I follow her, and says that "I just want to be like her, and that I never will". No one else on the bus likes her, but they don't stop her. I'm in 10th grade. This shouldn't be happening. But it is. Another 6th grader also hates me, because the first one does. No one ever helps me.

I try making cookies for the whole bus. It doesn't work. I try not saying anything at all, even off the bus. People ask me what's wrong (I'm normally talkative). I just want it to end. None of my friends ride my bus, so I can't get help there. The bus driver never does anything, and this is the only place where (hopefully) people will listen. I asked a girl why she signed because I was wondering how she was, and her friend yelled at me (this was at the actual school). My mom refuses to drive me, and I don't have a dad. The school also does a shitty job of helping.

Sometimes, I think of hurting them. Showing them what they've done to my emotions through force. Maybe even murder, as that seems to be the only way to stop them. But I have no strength, and my sick fantasies of murdering all my problems away stay fantasies, as I know violence isn't the answer. I've tried a therapist, she just made me feel like a horrible son and never actually talked about my feelings, always taking my moms side.

Please help, I'm on the last straw.
