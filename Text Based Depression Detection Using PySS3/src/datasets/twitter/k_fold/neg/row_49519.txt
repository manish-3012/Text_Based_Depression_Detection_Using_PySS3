I need help but don't want itI'm Chris, a 13 year old male who lives in florida, I'm homeschooled and have no friends. I've been suffering from major depression and dysthymia for about a year now and have symptoms of OCD and have told nobody. I've been using weed for about the same time, and it helps me cope with my anxiety... I know my parents do it too but they don't know I know. they have a dab pen, my brother found it and invited me too do it with him, but that's not the main reason I'm deppressed. Anyway,  me and my twin were caught using it at around 3 in the morning. my emotions are going crazy... this was the breaking point for me. I feel like I'm dead inside my depression has been more than ever I started inflicting self harm, my anxiety is out of control and I want too kill myself more than anything in this world. I feel like I'm loosing my grip of reality, and I don't want help but don't know how too cope with this. I'm not sure what's going on with me and I'm confused on my decision too post here. this is possibly the last day I will have my phone, and computer for a while, so I'm going too review comments as long as I have everything. I'm just looking for someone too help me though this or tell me what's going on... I don't want treatment and I don't want too talk too anybody about this. I have severe social anxiety and  have trouble talking too people. I have other secrets that I try too hide and I'm hesitant to say even online. my life is online, I don't interact with anyone but online friends, so I don't even have anyone too talk too... someone help me please. (sorry for incorrect grammar or spelling I usually don't type on my phone at all and autocorrect can be a fag)
