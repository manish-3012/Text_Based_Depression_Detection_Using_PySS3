Maybe today i'll find the strenght to end it allAs i already said in the title, maybe, today it will be finally over for me, days are just suffering, i have a group of friends i love and a pretty good family, but i'm not ok with myself, i really hate myself,i think i never did something to be proud of. I often have panic attacks and i'm always anxious for everything, there's a girl i like but like the other girls i ever liked she doesn't feel the same about me, i can accept that since i'm pretty ugly and a bit fat, i may be a boring person too, i can't judge this, anyway i think she played with my feelings like other people often did, lastly my family has a lot of problems and we got through my grandfather's death a week ago, today i'm alone walking by the river thinking about ending it all someway, i wanted to express what i feel to someone who can't just go "it'll pass" i don't need answers, i just needed to send out this heavy weight i feel, thank you and goodbye.
Ps sorry for the bad english.
