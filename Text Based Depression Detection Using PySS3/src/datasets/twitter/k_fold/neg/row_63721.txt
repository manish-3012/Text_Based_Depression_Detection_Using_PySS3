a broken heartI simply cannot "move on". I can't.  I wish I didn't wake up every day and think of you and how I ruined the only good thing I ever had. I wish I wasn't bombarded with images in my head of you and your new perfect girlfriend.   I wish I didn't cry and wail and scream in my sad little room all alone.  I wish I could function.  I wish I didn't have this disgusting eating disorder which I cannot shake.  I wish I hadn't lost all of the friends and your amazing family when I lost you. I guess I deserve this misery.  I don't know.  My life is just not worth living anymore. I wish I had the guts to jump.  just venting, no need to reply.
