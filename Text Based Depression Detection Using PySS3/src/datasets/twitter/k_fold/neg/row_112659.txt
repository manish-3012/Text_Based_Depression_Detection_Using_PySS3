Things never change....So I have felt for a long time that no one cared for me as much as I do for them.  I felt isolated and was ostracized by my academic peers (university), work colleagues and any group I am part of.  

Last year I was desperate for social interaction and asked a lot of people to catch up to chat.  I asked in person, over IM and broadcast open invites to anyone who wanted to get together.  A few people said they would but no one followed through.

I did the thing I knew I had to do and committed suicide.  I was unsuccessful and was left paralyzed in a wheelchair and blind in one eye.  People were very supportive over the internet but its the same thing all over. People arrange times to meetup but never show or say they would love to chat but they are to busy in life currently.  

Its not one person that gets me down its the fact that its everybody.  Now I am thinking about trying for a second time.
