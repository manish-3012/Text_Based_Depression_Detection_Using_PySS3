poor quality of life, no futureI think the combination of things i have had happen to me, and the things i am, are pretty much death to my quality of life.

i was raised in a cult and psychologically, physically, and sexually abused by my own parents.
i was homeschooled, raised in isolation that has ruined me socially.
i left the cult and they cut me off from my siblings, who'd been my only friends for years.
my PTSD and ADHD make it hard for me to do college homework and my job.
the love of my life left me for a terrible abusive man.
i am extremely, abnormally short and look like a child. not midget-level but still VERY short.
i have an eating disorder that has caused me to be sickly and underweight.
i am in misery every day, also transgender and have dysphoria.
i am very very poor

i don't think i have a future and i have been trying to get help, with little to no avail.
i wish euthanasia was an option where i live, but i'm not afraid to kill myself; i've got a very reliable method planned out.
i just don't know if i should. things could still get better. i just don't want to have any false hope, or waste more of society's time and resources.
