I think I need help.Contextualizing, I'm 17M, I live in Brazil and I identify as a bisexual male.

My mother is verbally abusive, I don't have any friends near me. There is a lot of pressure on me to go to university and apply to major in International Relations. I want to be an artist, I want to express myself. I want to be able to tell my relatives and friends about my sexuality. She is oppressing me into hiding my sexuality, and humiliates me when we're alone, shaming me about my sexuality, about my body, and about the type of art I appreciate. She belittles me in front of my family, talking to me like a baby and saying I'm a drama queen. She says I'm a cry baby, and all I say is bullshit. Lately, I have been contemplating suicide and I got back to cutting myself (I had stopped two years ago.)
