I want to get over a girl, but I donâ€™t know howI went on a date with a girl who I like from my school theatre class, and we didnâ€™t really talk afterwards. I guess we really didnâ€™t click, and one of her friends later told me that she said she liked me just as a friend. This isnâ€™t the first time this has happened, especially after a first date, and every time, I do the exact same thing. I start to obsess over the girl, and I donâ€™t move on from her for weeks or even months. This time itâ€™s even worse because we see each other every day. Every time I see her, I keep trying to talk to her and trying to win her over even though I know itâ€™s not gonna happen and end up embarrassing myself. I donâ€™t get it, how can I be so hopeless? Itâ€™s gotten to the point where I wanna drop theatre, even though itâ€™s my favorite course, just because having to see her everyday is making me feel so miserable and worthless. 

I know I sound crazy, but knowing that Iâ€™ll never be with her makes me feel like my life is empty. Like thereâ€™s no reason to keep going through life knowing that sheâ€™ll never be a part of it. My friends all keep telling me I should be proud of my accomplishments, for having good grades, for being good at singing and acting, yet I feel like I would throw away every accomplishment that I have for a month spent dating her. The fact that Iâ€™m the only one of my friends whoâ€™s never gotten past the first date makes me feel like such a fucking loser. How am I so fundamentally unlikeable that every time I like someone, it always falls apart? People tell me Iâ€™m so talented in choir and theatre, they say I could have a good career in the business, but Iâ€™d trade it in a heartbeat to have a loving relationship like my other friends have. Iâ€™ve started to consider driving my car into the lake at the end of my street every night driving home from a day of failing to win her heart. I imagine cutting my throat open every time I open her SnapChat streaks and see her face. Even if I get over her, itâ€™s just gonna happen again, Iâ€™ll like someone, Iâ€™ll ruin everything because Iâ€™m so fucking stupid, and Iâ€™ll be miserable and obsessed with her at the same time. Why do I keep expecting it change? Itâ€™s never gonna happen. Iâ€™ve spent so much of my life practicing and studying and going to lessons for fucking bullshit, while everyone around me is succeeding at the stuff that actually matters.

I wish I could be like my friends. I want to know that itâ€™s possible. Or maybe I could just stop liking girls all together. I just wish I could enjoy the good things in my life.
