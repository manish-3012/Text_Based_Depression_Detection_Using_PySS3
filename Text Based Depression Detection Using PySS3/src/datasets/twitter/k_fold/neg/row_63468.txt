I lost my dad, my job, and my mom within one year. Already had depression. Can't cope with this.I've been extremely depressed, exhausted, and hopeless.  I have tried therapy, support groups, and medicine.  But I can't get rid of the nightmares, flashbacks, and memories of my parents dying.  I have a lot of emotions that I suppressed while taking care of them, and now I have been facing my demons and they're winning.  How can I have any hope for the future when I don't want to be here anymore?  How can I get a new job and be perky at interviews and say "hire me!" when I feel at my all-time low, with no self-esteem, and absolutely crushed by what I have gone through?  The last 6 months have all been a blur.  The only thing keeping me alive are my dogs that make me get up to take them out.  But, I am not all here.  My mind is always on death, dying, and wondering what's the point now.  I have opened up to just a small number of close friends about my thoughts now, and have received a wide array of reactions.  The worst one being "how do you think it makes ME feel hearing you say things like this?".  They don't understand the pain I'm going through, and just not wanting to be here.  Everything just seems like a distraction now.  Pointless.  Some say that now I have a "blank canvas" and can be/do whatever I want, but that is not how I am seeing things.  It's not that easy, and if anything, having a blank canvas of nothingness gives me more anxiety.  I put on the image that I am ok, and everyone around me thinks I am strong, but I know that I am not.
