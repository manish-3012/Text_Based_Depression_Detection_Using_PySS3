I joined this sub Reddit a while ago. It's been six months at my new job, and it took me a while to shift to the industry from academia having done my bachelors and masters in one stretch. These six months, all the while, I've been trying to find a reason to sustain myself through the present.I came across a post 2 months ago on reddit while searching for my answers, and a guy recommended reading "Man's search for meaning" by Viktor E. Frankl. I read the book, chapter by chapter, taking it all in, slowly and it helped me discover the positivity in my life. It is all there, we all have our answers, we just need a peek inside.

Anyone looking for meaning, or for a reason to if and why you should be living your life, go have a read. It will help, definitely.
