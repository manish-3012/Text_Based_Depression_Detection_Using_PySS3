By no way do I feel that I have anything more worse going on in my life than some of the people on this subredditI just feel extremely low. Nothing should be wrong in my life (although I haven't had the best of upbringings, and these still effect me even now). I know I've been drinking and sorts and I have no right to probably even think any of these thoughts but I really don't have anybody to talk to.

I feel as though I should be strong and the best person I should be, I've even talked my sister out of suicide when I was a teenager and now I feel like a hypocrite since I'm now just feeling to just end it. It's probably just the drink talking but I've just felt recently that I can't deal with everything in life. There's so much drama with everything. I'm always the person people know that won't be bothered by trivial stuff, I can always see the bright side. Everybody know me as the happiest person they know. But they have no idea what I'm like when I'm alone.

The only thing that has stopped me from doing anything tonight is the fact that I cannot let my little sisters (who are 8 and 10) suffer from my selfish urge to be a dick and leave them.

I wish I could stop feeling like this, the worse I feel is guilt for them for even thinking anything like it. 

I usually don't feel any emotion at all, but for some reason over the past few week it has just suddenly fell upon me with it getting worse tonight.

I just need somebody to talk to, if you know any way to get me out of this mood. But like I said, other people probably need more help than I do.
