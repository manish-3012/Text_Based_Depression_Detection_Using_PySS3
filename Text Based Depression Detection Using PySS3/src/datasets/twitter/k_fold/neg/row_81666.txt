Nothing going right, lonely and self destructingAs of the past few months everything feels like it's falling a part and I'm reaching a very bad place.

To not go into huge details, I've been for the past five years pursuing a career in acting. Things were going well and I just got off working a year on a show when I found out a couple months ago my agent is going out if business and I can't find any more representation and it feels like my whole career plans have gone up in smoke so I'm stuck in a day job I can't stand.
On top of it, aside from the boyfriend, there's nobody in this bloody town who'll make time to see me. I feel alone and like my life is leading nowhere.
I feel like a failure and no matter what I try to do to push myself out of this funk more and more bad news keeps coming (family friend killed self, pet passed away, being treated like crap by job, etc. Etc.) 

I'm at a point right now where I don't feel like anything is going to change and I'm gonna be stuck in this awful, abject sense of failure. No matter what I seem to do though nothings turning out right. I've been trying so hard to stay the positive, "water off the ducks back" type but I can't do it anymore. 

I dunno, things probably don't sound bad from an outside view but I'm feeling like I'm at my breaking point. I feel like everything I've been working towards was for nothing..

I just want this pain to end
