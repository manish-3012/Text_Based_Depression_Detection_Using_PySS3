QuestionI will try to explain this as best as possible 
I have a couple really good friends who basically know my mental status and that I could be a mess most times 

They tell me multiple times that they are there for me and what not and they need me in their lives but I still feel like a very annoying burden to them. So I still donâ€™t really open up to them all that much. I donâ€™t even really text to check in or anything because I feel that they have better things to do or just donâ€™t want to talk because they donâ€™t want anything to do with me. Or they just donâ€™t care. I also feel like Iâ€™m bothering them if I do try to talk to them. But they constantly remind me that that is not true. But I still think and believe it in my head 

I guess I just want to know if other people feel this way 

And to people who are friends with people who are basically suicidal are you guys annoyed by our existence? Like are we actually a burden to you and would you rather not deal with it?

I donâ€™t know if it makes sense. Itâ€™s just something thatâ€™s  been on my mind because I feel like I have no right to share my thoughts or feelings with anyone
