Ugly, suicidal, and hopelessI didn't know weather to do this or not... but here it goes. Last year I was forced into a lesbian relationship while still questioning my sexuality. Everyone at school would make fun of me as my school's is very homophobic. I tried going to my school counselor but she too is homophobic. I was sexually assaulted, mentally abused, and emotionally manipulated in that relationship. I would get groped and touched in front of this girls friends to show her "prize" off. I started to cut myself and tried to commit suicide multiple times. I finally was able to break away but she sent her sister to bully me. Calling me nasty names. I finally came out as bisexual and my parents rejected me. I went to the hospital and almost got admitted into the psych ward. I got on medicine and saw a counselor. It has been going well as I've made zero suicide attempts and stopped cutting. Recently though I've been being shunned because I recently broke up with my girlfriend. I've been called ugly, people have said I look like a man and a penis, my friends stopped helping and my parents have no idea what's going on and I'm too scared to go to them as they're abusive also. I'm only 14 but seriously thinking about committing suicide. I'm sick of being called ugly and worthless. Please help.
