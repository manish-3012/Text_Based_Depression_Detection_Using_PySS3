Tired of being aliveThink I'm bi-polar because some days on on top of the world and others I'm suicidal and severely depressed. Just yesterday i was thinking that I've done everything I'm ever gonna do in life and might as well hang from a tree. Yet I'm low-risk since i dont have the courage to pull to the proverbial trigger like that but the seed has been planted.

A simple advil can change my mood from despair to downright sillyness for a few hours.

I'm so scatter-brained it would take 100 posts to get out everything I need to say. No one cares anyway unless they have an agenda like getting my dollar or wanna add a new member to their church congregation. 

Lies are all I see.
