This is the end, my only friend, the end.I was wandering a graveyard once, and there was a gravestone of a young man that read "He was a testament to himself."  Beautiful sentiment, eh?  Well, he's my testament to the end of my life, because nobody in my life will be saying or thinking "He was a testament to himself." after I'm gone.

I'd like to the jump of the Golden Gate Bridge: one grand gesture for an otherwise lackluster life.  I doubt I can wait a week for a cheap one-way fare, but who knows.  Would give me time to tie up the loose ends of my existence.  In my case, loose ends means unloading a massive collection of books to show for my pathetic life.  At times these books where my saviors, my friends, my life, but now they are just part of the heavy burden of accumulation.

The boring biographical breakdown: 27, gay male, jobless, without health insurance, broke, massive debt, failed out of college multiple times, abused as the child of a single parent, chronically depressed, on and on.

Before this point, I tried to make some sense of this thing called life, but I am tired of suffering.  I've read countless books on Buddhism, philosophy, self-help, and spiritual books.  I've filled journals with my feelings and bad poetry; I've been in therapy on and off for 11 years; I've tried various combinations of meds; I've called suicide hotlines, and I always wind back up at this point: wanting it to end, permanently.  I'm tired of trying, tired of existing.

So there you have it: the last testament of a life that was a perpetual grinding of gears, until -- I have finally had enough and am throwing myself on the gears to get the horrible machine to stop, break.

Thanks for reading.  It brings me a small amount to comfort to think I am being "heard" before I go silent.
