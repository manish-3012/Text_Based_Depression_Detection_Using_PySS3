Why the fuck do people care about life?For my entire life I havenâ€™t wanted to live. I just see no point to it all and donâ€™t understand how people can care. I know everyone says you have to make your own meaning out of life and everything, but no matter how I try everything seems futile. Iâ€™m on antidepressants, but I really just donâ€™t understand life. Everything I do I do for the people who care about me. The only thing I really want in life is to die.

Can anyone here help me understand how people give a shit? Because Iâ€™m too braindead to even comprehend life.

I have no intention of ending it unless I get access to a gun. Iâ€™m not strong enough mentally for that. Thanks for reading my rant.
