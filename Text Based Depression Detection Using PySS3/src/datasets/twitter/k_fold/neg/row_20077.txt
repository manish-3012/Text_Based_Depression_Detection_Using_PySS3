I want to reach out but I can't stomach hearing that other people go through it tooLike bitch, I k n o w. I could give a quarter of a shit that I am not the only dumbass googling painless ways to die rn. none of the other dumbasses are with me at the moment. my counsellor won't take me seriously, because she treats me for OCD and steers my ideation back to that, and i lie to her bc i don't want to end up in a fucking hospital. I don't want to talk to my parents or my close friends. I only want to talk to one person but I don't want to introduce the idea of suicide back to him. actually offing myself just seems like a better idea than getting some half-assed help from people who don't believe me.
