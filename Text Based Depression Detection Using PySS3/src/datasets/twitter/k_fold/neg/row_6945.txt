I am already dead, might aswell kill myself.Two years ago I tried a drug other than alcohol and nicotine for the first time in my life. During the buzz I panicked, my heart was racing and my body felt heavy and strange.

I immediately got the feeling that I fucked up and that I was damaged for life. About 24 hours after the incident I tried to sleep. Yet again I panicked because I still did not feel normal. I started to feel muscles twitching and hear sounds in my head.

A couple of days later when I felt better I noticed that my dick felt dull and that I could'nt orgasm.

To this day I still have these problems. My sex life is dead because my orgasms are weak as fuck and my body has zero urge to ejaculate. I do not longer feel any attraction to women. I hear screaming sounds in my head/ears every time I try to sleep. My muscles twitch like crazy when I am anxious.

I am seeing a doctor about my problems at the moment and I am subscribed some antidepressants. I still feel that I have fucked up so bad that I will never be able to forgive myself and will forever live a compromised life.

The anxiety and constant thoughts about this takes over my life completely. I do not wish to sit in my sofa in 20 years, crying about that I fucked up when I was only a teenager. Might aswell skip out of the window sooner than that.


Kind Regards
