I donâ€™t know what to do anymore
I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this to be honest. Maybe itâ€™s because I have no one else to talk to so this is the only place people will ever listen. Iâ€™ve just hit this spot in life where I donâ€™t even care to be here. Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™ve never had any friends, never had a girlfriend, never had a first kiss. I started community college in January and Iâ€™ve hated every second of it. Turns out my dads been stealing money from an account my cousin made for me before she died. My mom left when I was 5 and 3 years after that my dad fell and has been physically disabled ever since. All he does is complain all day and get mad at the slightest things. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m just alone like I have literally no one. I just sit here everyday trying to distract myself until the day ends. Sometimes I think the future is going to better but at the same time Iâ€™m getting told we wonâ€™t have a place to live when I turn 18 because of my dad not getting the money for me from disability anymore. Where do I even go from here?
