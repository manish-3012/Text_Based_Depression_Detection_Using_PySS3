Chosing to die at 22 :( sorry and goodbyeHello everyone
I used to be happy and wanted to change the world.

I write this as i am crying in the kitchen floor. I  finally realised i dont belong here in this world. Everyone around me has found thier place in the world except me and have thier lives all togeher.

When i was younger i thought i would have an amazing life with a job i loved and a man who loved me . I cry over job applications and get rejected for shop jobs.

I lived all these years but i have nothing to show for it. I never had job, never had boyfriend, useless degree( law but dont want to be a lawyer). 

I am an embrassment to my family i am an unemployed loser.

I messed up my entire. 
I dont feel young . I feel like i am running out of time to have all together .

I got diagnosed with moderate depression
I am going to overose on diaphendyramie pills( ntyol UK also known as bendrayl US ).
I want to kill myself so i wont have to see the future.
Noboby wanted to listen. They all said i will be fine .
Noboby saw how scared i am .
Noboby saw how much distress not having my life together has caused.
Goodbye world
