HappinessI have everything I could ever need including money but I feel empty.
My husband committed suicide a little over 2 years ago and financially he made sure I was well taken care of in the event of his death. He was active military which means I get monthly payments from the government for the rest of my life. In short I want for nothing.
I live a simple life in a small home, Iâ€™m 37 have no children and never planned on any. I donâ€™t live extravagantly, donâ€™t have a penchant for jewelry or brand names. 
The reason I bring all this up is because when I was younger and struggling I always thought money would solve depression or at least make it less likely. It truly doesnâ€™t solve anything but the amount of comfort in ones life.
I think about dying every day, I donâ€™t have the courage to do it myself, because it terrifies me with how inevitable it is. I want to die because I feel empty and numb inside. I find it difficult to try and connect with people, and most of the time I look forward to just sleeping and escaping this existence.
Thank you to anyone who listened, I just needed to vent and unload.
