I want to dieBut I promised myself I wouldnâ€™t for 2 more years. I am a worthless, useless, fat, unhealthy and an extremely ugly socially inept and a complete waste of space scumbag. There are over 7 billion people on the planet. 1 less wont make a difference. Is there any point waiting out those 2 years because nothing right now indicates my life will get any better?
No I am not depressed or unable to think straight because Ive thought extremely hard about my worth as a person both potential and current and both return as zilch.
Yes I am here for your pity. I have no idea why but pity makes me feel better briefly.
