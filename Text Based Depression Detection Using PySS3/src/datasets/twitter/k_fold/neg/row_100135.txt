When is it worth going to the mental hospital?Iâ€™ve had a shit day and Iâ€™ve dealt with it by cutting. I donâ€™t feel as bad now as I did then but it comes in waves. I have a plan that I 100% know will work, but I donâ€™t have a â€œwhenâ€. 

Iâ€™d like a serious answer. Mental hospitals arenâ€™t free where I come from and Iâ€™m not well financially. Iâ€™ve heard a lot of people talk about their bad experience at hospitals and I donâ€™t want that to happen to me. 

I also donâ€™t fully understand how itâ€™ll help me besides just having people watch me 

Iâ€™m bipolar btw
