do you agree that 911 is one of the worst thing to do when someone you know is suicidalEven if they had a gun to their head it kind of seems rash. I'm sure a lot of them would just want to talk or be comforted. Wouldn't calling the cops just make the situation worse? What are the statistics of people who got called on ending up doing it anyway?
