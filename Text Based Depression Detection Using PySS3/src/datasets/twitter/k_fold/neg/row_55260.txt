I donâ€™t want to die, but I feel like it would be better for everyone I care about if I did.Iâ€™m a garbage person. My husband doesnâ€™t respect me, and rightfully so. Iâ€™m toxic and abusive and entitled. Iâ€™m a Karen. All my efforts to change have failed, and believe me I have tried HARD.

I am dishonest, unfair, cowardly, uncooperative, unforgiving, ungrateful, impatient, I lack all common sense and self-control. I have no ambition or creativity. No self-discipline. Iâ€™m a fat, ugly slob. I am an embarrassment. Even my parents donâ€™t want contact with me because I am human garbage.

I have a two-year-old child. I love them immensely. I canâ€™t leave my kid. But I also feel like they would be better off with no mom than with the mom they got. If I disappeared off the face of the Earth, my husband could remarry someone decent, who would adopt my kid and be a real mom. The mom my kid deserves. My kid is still too young to remember much, and would never have to know I existed at all.

I donâ€™t even actually want to kill myself but I feel like I owe it to the people I love. I hate myself for being too much of a coward to do the right thing for them.
