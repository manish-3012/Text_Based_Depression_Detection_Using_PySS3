The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fear of death.I've always been a piece of shit that can't do anything right. I've failed my way through life and make everything harder for the people around me. I can tell even my parents at least subconsciously recognize this due to how the treat me compared to my sibling. I know I will die alone and afraid. I want to kill my self but I am afraid of death. Of the nothingness that awaits me.
