I fail even at killing myselfEvery day I utilise a new way to kill myself I even fail at that. It's maddening that all this energy in planning and going out to get it over with I'm always met with some mishap. I consider myself very unlucky that I'm still unfortunately alive. Still languishing in this shitty existence is not positive for me at all.
I'm always found in some way because someone just *happens* to pass by when previously abandoned, or the poison isn't strong enough or the rope or beam somehow breaks or accelerant refuses to light or  I'm just severely bruised from a fall that would've killed anyone else yet I'm  STILL NOT DEAD.
I thought I'd finally die when I caught the Rona. 
Nope. Recovered from that shit too when everyone else dying around me. 
I thought I'd atagonise the cops and get shot at with all these riots going on. No head shot for my brown ass though. 
Why am I still here? 
I'll try again in the morning...
