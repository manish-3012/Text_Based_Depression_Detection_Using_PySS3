Wrote It DownI have written down my plan to kill myself. It's not very explicit for the means I just have preferred methods based on the circumstances at the time. It also has some end of life activities to make sure that my mind is made up on the decision when the time comes. 
I say when and not if because I've realized that it's a matter of time. Even when things are going my way and even when my philosophy surrounds being content with all of my feelings, my mind still defaults to hopelessness. 
I'm the only person that deserves my own criticism because I'm the one that sees everything I do. I don't matter and my mind is so flawed with depression and antisocial tendencies that I'm going to die alone. I've switched medications with almost no difference in my mindset. I've done both talk therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy as well as trying bits of other methods. 
My life is garbage and I'm stuck. I will try to be around for as long as I can in hopes that good habits make me happy again. I hope that when I die, my plan will help minimize or eliminate the pain in the aftermath.
