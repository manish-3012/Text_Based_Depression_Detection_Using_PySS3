I'm turning 30 and have gotten nothing out of life.I spent a lot of time in school but all I got out of it was debt. 

I've never had any career success. The longest I've been in a job was in retail, and I quit after my suicide attempt. That was more than six years ago now. I've honestly just been drifting since then.

I don't have friends. I haven't since leaving college. I don't know how I'm supposed to connect to people.

Time hasn't made anything better. I've just gotten older. I'm tired of therapy that doesn't do anything. I'm tired of going through the motions. 

I'm so tired of this. I understand anti-suicide messages when someone's going through a brief hard time, but this has been most of my life. I don't want to do this anymore.
