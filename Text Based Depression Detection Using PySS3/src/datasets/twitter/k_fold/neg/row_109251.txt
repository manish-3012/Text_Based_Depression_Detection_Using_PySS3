MySince I graduated college all I've had were temp jobs and a year-long gig at Starbucks. That's it. I'm in a temp job now and my supervisor suggested that I might be let go and I can't keep looking for jobs that I can't get. I'm living in a loop and I can't take it anymore. My choices are a life of anxiety, depression and poverty or checking out early, and I haven't felt this hopeless before ever.
