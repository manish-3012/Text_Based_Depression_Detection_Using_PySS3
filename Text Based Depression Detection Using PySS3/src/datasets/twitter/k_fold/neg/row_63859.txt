I don't want to, but...Sometimes the thoughts just creep in before I can stop them, even with all the mindfulness tools and the other crap I've picked up in therapy and group. I'm becoming less able to talk things out by the week and I'm so scared that one day the part of me that tells me to ignore those nasty thoughts will stop telling me to ignore them. I would be leaving behind so many who love and need me and every day that matters just a tiny bit less... and that scares the daylights out of me.
