Worried about my self being.Pretty sure I'm kinda messed up. I've read the in and outs of the depression reddit and some of this reddit. But, I don't want to die. I love my life, but suicide always creeps up into my mind. I can't get it out of my mind, and it's tearing me up inside. 

Any tips or similar happenings to you guys? :)
