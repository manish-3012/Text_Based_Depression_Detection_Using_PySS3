Making plans for the future feels like holding your breathMy life is in absolute ruins right now. I'm horrible at everything, I can't even be trusted with even the simplest matters. I used to contemplate suicide every once in a while, but right now I consider killing myself every day. I can't shake the idea out of my head.

I decided to fix this situation by making plans for my future, goals that, if achieved, will make me satisfied with life. Seriously, if I manage to get these things right I will finally enjoy my life.

The problem is that those plans will last about 5 years. That means in order to become satisfied with life I need to spend another 5 freaking years in the same situation I am right now. I will have to prolongate my misery all that time before I finally reach happiness. It's so damn long.

It feels like holding my breath for 5 years. I just can't visualise where the heck am I going to find the strength to do it. I can barely take one more week of this, let alone several years. I'm walking on a tightrope between suicide and happiness, and this walk is going to take 5 years. It's so despairing.

And the worst part is that I have no guarantee at all that I will achieve my goals. Maybe I spend all this time working to get nothing in the end. If that is going to be the case, I should kill myself right now; it's not going to change anything.
