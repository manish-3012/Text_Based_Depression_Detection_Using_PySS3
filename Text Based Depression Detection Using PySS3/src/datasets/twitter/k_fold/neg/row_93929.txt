Nothing to look forward to.I went for engineering after my highschool and I know that I am gonna fail, and even if I don't fail, I would not be able to find any job anywhere or even go for higher studies. I have no talents too, so I can't even earn money through something else. Everyday I wake up, I find myself to be an absolute liability for my parents and really feel bad for them because they have some successor like me who is completely useless and worthless. 

Despite of this they still love me and I feel bad for them and hence I have made my mind to kill myself. I just wanna know how I don't break their hearts because I known that me dying will potentially shatter them and I really don't want that to happen. 

I there anyway in which the impact of me dying will be much less or even no impact would take place??
