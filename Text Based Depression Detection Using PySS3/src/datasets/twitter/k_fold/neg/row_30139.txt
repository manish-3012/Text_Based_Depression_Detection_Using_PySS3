What's so unfair is that if you have a fucked up childhood, your adulthood will be fucked up tooMy childhood was fucked up and now I'm all fucked in the head because of it. I'm so sad and tired of existing everyday. This world feels so unfair. It's like some of us are born to suffer and things just happen. I'm always waiting for the next horrible thing to happen and it always does. I've done therapy, I've done meds, I've done the whole thing. I just don't enjoy anything and I wonder why I struggle so much for a life that brings me no joy.
