Suicidal urgesIâ€™m a 19 year old guy with autism, tourettes, and IBS-D (relevant for quality of life discussion). Iâ€™m in England.

I just left my third college course because of poor health and low attendance. I have been struggling with what I assume is clinical depression (4 years on and I am close to seeing a therapist). As of current I would not kill myself because of the effect it would have on my family. I do plan on killing myself if my physical health cannot be improved in 25 years time. 

I am struggling with being passively suicidal and going through depression loops. Has anyone had any experience with coping with these issues? Iâ€™m really not sure what to do, especially as I have not been able to get medical assistance through my doctors (I have never been able to access medication such as anti-depressants).
