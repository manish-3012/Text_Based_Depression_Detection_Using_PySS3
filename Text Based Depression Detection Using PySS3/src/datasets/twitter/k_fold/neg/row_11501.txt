I have no future because I'm a dumbassWhat the fuck am I doing with my life? Absolutely nothing. I tried going to college, but I'm just too fucking stupid. I don't get very good grades even when I try because I'm just not smart enough. I went to the disability service office at my school and they said I should go in for an orientation after they asked me a bunch of questions and stuff, but I never went. And that was so long ago. 

What can I do? My future looks pathetic. I have NO job skills whatsoever. I'm 20 years old and I've never had a job! I'm horrible at talking to people, I'm too damn shy and I'm stupid. No one would hire me. And even if they did, I would get fired after the first week. I don't even know what career I want. I took this class in college that was supposed to help you with finding a career, but all the teacher said was to take this test online to find out your "perfect/ideal career." I took the test, and it said I should be an art director or a fashion designer. Both don't sound good to me. It's not like I can "try out" a career and if I don't like it, I can just quit. And I don't want to be like my 47 year old mother who works at taco bell.

I don't know what to do. I'm too dumb for college. I'm not good enough for a job. And I have a horrible personality. Even on reddit people think I'm dumb. Even after going to the disability office at my college, I still don't think I have a genuine disability because being 20 years old, you would think doctors/teachers would have seen it already? I know I'm just dumb. Dumb and stupid, can't put it any more simpler. 

So, what? Should I give up because obviously my mind is still in the "teenage" stage and I'm not cut out to be an adult? Or should I just live my life being an unsuccessful fucking loser?
