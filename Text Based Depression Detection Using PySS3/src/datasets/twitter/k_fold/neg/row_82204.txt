My next moveI don't even no where to begin. 

I've already tried suicide once. Obviously it didn't work since I am here now. Can't really talk about what I'm feeling because the one time I tried I got the suck it up, someone has it worse than you do response. And I am sure they do, but everyone is different and copes in different ways. 

I am a mother of one and married. I have battled with depression long before this. As my husband likes to remind me what did I have to be depressed about? I grew up in a middle class household with everything I ever wanted. Or so that's what his mind tells him. Yes I grew up in that kind of house, but it was not all roses and lilies like he thinks. I realized I was depressed about eighth grade. It has gotten no better since then. 

Since high school I have gone down hill. I have been abused mentally and physically, I have traffic tickets I cannot hope to pay or do the time so I have no current license. I have no job, my mother is battling cancer and the best thing that happened to her since her divorce from my father up and left her, my husband has threatened to kick me out at least once a year since we have been together and threatened to make my life a living hell if I left so he could get custody of our son, we get over that and are good for about six months. We have been fighting the irs all year to get our tax return. We live in a house that is falling apart,  vehicles that need to be fixed and no money to do so. I am so done with life. The only thing that has held me back from a successful suicide is my son. But even now I think he is better off with relatives than with me or his father. I'm at my lowest point and plan on my date of death at the first of next year. Nothing is getting better. Only worse.
