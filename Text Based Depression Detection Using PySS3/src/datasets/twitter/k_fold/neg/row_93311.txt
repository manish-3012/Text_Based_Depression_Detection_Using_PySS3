On the up!So I know this isn't what's normally posted on here but maybe someone will read it and it might give hope...

After years of on and off depression I sunk into the worst depression I have ever felt. I had hit rock bottom and continued going down. Multiple hospitalisations, multiple attempts. Lying in bed for days on end not eating, not sleeping, not showering. Hours and hours of therapy and such much medication. It seemed like nothing was helping. It felt like the light at the end of the tunnel was so far away. I lost my job, something that I worked so hard to get, and through losing my job I am losing my accommodation, my friends and my pay check.

But then something changed. It felt like all was lost and I had no direction in life. No reason to keep going. Something then clicked. I decided to make a plan. This time not for my death, but a plan for the future. I have decided I will go back to college, to get my honours degree in computing software. I have a place to live. I am also talking to a guy and have a date next week (which believe me is a huge step forward for me!). Today I finally went to the gym. Sure I didn't run long and I didn't run far but I did it nonetheless. I left the gym with a huge smile on my face. No longer does my poetry (a coping mechanism for me) consist of dark and depressing words but instead there is a new found hope. Small things like singing in the shower or dancing down the hall. Eating and getting out of bed.

The path was long with so many downfalls. It won't be the last time I will sink in depression. But I know I can survive, and in this moment I am happy. If anyone has read this I want to leave you with one last thing.

Sometimes it's hard to see the light at the end of the tunnel, but then you realise the flashlights been in your pocket the whole time.
