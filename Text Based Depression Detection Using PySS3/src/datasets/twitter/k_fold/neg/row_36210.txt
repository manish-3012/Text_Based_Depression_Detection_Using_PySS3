Please help me quick I'm in a bad situationIll use "p" as in parent to remain anonymous. My parent was freaking out and I really need some advice on what to do. So my parent was freaking out about seeing my sister after 10 years and as soon as a little doubt came onto p he immediately started ranting about all the pain p's been through(and its alot) and then stormed out after p felt nobody was on his side. I followed after p and after more ranting about how stupid I am along with everybody p tells me to just go back so I did. I told p "I love p" and he said" I bet". P would be walking for over 24 hours just to get back to our home and I think he's suicidal I dont know what to do
Please help me
