TL:DR People too nice to me, I jumpIâ€™m typing this from the edge of a bridge from which I intend to jump. Also be warned, I have a pretty irreverent sense of humour for this situation I am in so I may joke about it.

Iâ€™m 17 and sitting here debating whether itâ€™s worth it to return to school in the morning after the holidays (I live in QLD, Australia). Weâ€™ve had several assessments to do over the holidays, I have been incapable of even beginning any of them as every day I try to work on them I end up on this very bridge that night. I know that come tomorrow it will just be all of my teachers telling me I am a disappoint and having my enrolment cancelled, so I see no reason in going, but I know I have nothing else in my life as school has been the only thing I have ever done, I have no skills and am incapable of contributing to any modern social environment. But I am not actually that depressed, Iâ€™m more just sick of people and how everyone seems to be throwing positivity and support at me blindly when Iâ€™ve so clearly disengaged from life. People just irritate by trying to be so supportive of me, I just want to say â€œF*ck off, I can handle myself and deal with my own consequences.â€ This became much worse when I came out as trans and everyone was immediately supportive, Iâ€™m cynical, contrarian and a debater by nature, so having everyone blindly agree with me irritated me to no end. When push comes to shove Iâ€™m not doing this because Iâ€™m depressed, Iâ€™m doing this just as a general middle finger to everyone I know for liking such a rude, arrogant, lazy, try hard edgelord. But I know no one will see it that way, theyâ€™ll think I was some tortured genius (a teacherâ€™s words not mine) that was exposed to too much hate, when hate was the only thing that kept me going. So this ran on much longer than I wanted it to and thereâ€™s a lot of terrible grammar in there, I see why I failed English, I apologise if you tried to read and understand that, just know that positivity all the time doesnâ€™t always equal happy all the time, I lacked negativity where it was required and now Iâ€™m going to let gravity decide my fate (I wouldnâ€™t know, I also failed physics).
