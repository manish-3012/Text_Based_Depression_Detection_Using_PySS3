Shame over pastI've done so many weird sexual things in my past and teenage years and they keep coming back to haunt me. It's too much, I feel horrible and filthy. I've never been as suicidal as I have this past week. I was so close to going and hanging myself, I really wanted to do it, the thoughts of doing it made me feel so comfortable and content. I feel as if I have so many problems and things wrong with me that I'm a lost cause. I hate myself.
