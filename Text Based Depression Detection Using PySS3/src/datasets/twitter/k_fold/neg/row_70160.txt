I put myself in a position where I don't deserve anyone to love me.I did the most horrible thing I have ever done to one my old friends and he is one of the most respected people I know. 

I had an "I don't even care" moment when I did what I did. Ever since then I have been feeling guilty as fuck. It's only gotten worse. It's been months of pain. I never got caught but he's visiting my brother (he's still good friends with my brother) and I think I'm going to confess to him then. It's the only thing that makes me feel better. But I know everyone will know afterwards and basically think I'm just a massive degenerate that is untrustworthy.

My friends all suspect that I did something to him because I told them I did something awful. Everyone asks me what is wrong and sometimes I lie but I hate lying. I hate not telling the truth. If there weren't such massive consequences, it would be easier to talk about. But it's the heavy burden of knowing that what you say could ruin your life if you tell the wrong person.

And that's when you know that if it's that difficult to talk about, then you did something awful. 

I just have been living in this apathetic hell. I used to be well respected, very sociable, had a personality, something unique that identified me, shared my taste in music with others, had hobbies, all of that.... it's all gone now and I haven't even gotten to the hardest part yet. 

I'm not looking for sympathy. I just want anyone who still has a happy, moral life to read this and to never forget about the ones they love and always think about your consequences before you act. So you don't end up like this. 

There are people from my past who left me because I was crazy and they're just going to be laughing because they are going to hear about this and know they dodged a bullet.

I hate being the bullet, which is why I'd rather take one to the head before I hurt more people.
