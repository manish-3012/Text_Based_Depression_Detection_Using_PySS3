I'm NumbI've attempted suicide in the past. Yeah, I was messed up mentally but they were all cries for help. This time, the last time, will be different.

Losing two children, my 11 year old son and 4 year old daughter, I cant even finish the sentence.

I've overcome heroin addiction several times. Alcoholism, check. I'm stone sober and have been for some time. I was given everything as a child. I had a silver spoon. 

I ruined lives. They took them from me. I've been sober but it doesnt  matter. She helped. We were married and even though I was the one that called 911 they still put me in that case because of my past. She couldn't get it right. Didn't matter. 

They took them from me. 

Now all I have is her. She gave me those two. I dont want her. I cant stand to look at her. I want my babies back. Doesnt matter. This system is designed to destroy and take pretty white children from good parents and put them into the system and get money from adoption. They want me.  I want them.

Doesnt matter. 

I'm sorry I failed you. In two years you'll be a teenager and maybe you'll discover Reddit. You'll never know why you were abandoned. But maybe you'll see this. I love you D and A. Take care of your sister. Shes so little. And you're so strong. I wish things turned out differently. You're my best friend. I'm so proud of you.

Doesnt matter. I dont matter. I'm ready to go. I'm planning it this time. Not some spur of the moment bullshit that won't work.  

I love you guys.
