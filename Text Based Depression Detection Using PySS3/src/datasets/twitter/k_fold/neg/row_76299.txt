What do I do to bring meaning back into my life again?I feel like thereâ€™s nothing to look forward to anymore. I feel like I donâ€™t really care about anything anymore, and all the things I did care about, Iâ€™m not good enough at. So why would I bother caring? People keep asking me what I want to do with my life, but I honestly donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a single thing I want to do with my life.

I want to leave. Start over over. Change my name, change my socials, and just be a different person. But then what? Then what I do? I still donâ€™t care about anything. I still donâ€™t want to do anything with my life. I donâ€™t have a dream job that I want, I donâ€™t have anyone in my life I want to pursue a relationship with, I donâ€™t want kids. I simply desire absolutely nothing.

Is there any way that I can bring meaning back into my life, and make it feel like itâ€™s worth living again?
