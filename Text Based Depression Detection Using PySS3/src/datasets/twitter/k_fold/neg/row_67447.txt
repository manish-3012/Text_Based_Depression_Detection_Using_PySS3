At the endParents think I choose to be miserable. Therapist isn't working, medications don't help, and their God sure doesn't help. Today my Mom told me that she doesn't want the burden, as if I wanted her to have it, and that if I want to kill myself, then I should. I'm all out of reasons not to. I look forward to nothing, only feel pain, and no, it doesn't get better and it never has.
