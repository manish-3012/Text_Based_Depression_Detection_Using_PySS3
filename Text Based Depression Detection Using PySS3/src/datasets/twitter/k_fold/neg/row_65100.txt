The Sun again? ..Fuck!Woke up this afternoon feeling like complete shit. I was hoping yesterday was the last day that I'll ever see the sun. I wish I could easily just fall asleep instantly at will like the effect of switching off the power on a machine. I know that I would abuse that power by using it at each waking moment. I'm tormented by existence. I cannot shake the thought. Fuck I want to die. Please kill me. I hate this shit. The suicidal wrath rages on. I hate myself. I have no appetite. I have no will to interact with society. I hate people. Stop thinking. Stop moving. Stop breathing. Make your own grave. Shotgun blast to the brains and fuckin end it all. Wish it was that easy. I hate the second thoughts. Perhaps they can be drowned out with alcohol... Or heroin. I've never done heroin before. Why now? Because I think it makes you numb, well from what I've read. Fuck that. The main goal is to completely eliminate the inherent primordial drive to survive so that trigger can be pulled. You need to die to be cured. All thoughts need to perish. The mental faculty needs to to be irreversibly flushed. I hate this shit.
