My Only Reason to Live is to Not Hurt Others with my Own DeathI donâ€™t really know where else to turn about this. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for years now and Iâ€™m tired of people telling me that itâ€™s going to get better when the sad thing is that things havenâ€™t and things donâ€™t appear able to improve in the future. Honestly, in most of my life situations it just seems like God is a cruel little kid who builds me up for excitement only to follow it up with extreme disappointment and sadness (sometimes within the hour). Itâ€™s starting to feel really fucked up; I just want a win for once in my life.  
It dawned on me last night that the only reason for me to not go ahead and just end my life is the effect it would have on my family; which means my only purpose is to just exist in pain and not cause any to others. I donâ€™t want to hurt my mom with my death but I really donâ€™t think I can do this for much longer. I know this all sounds so selfish but Iâ€™m just looking for a reason to live. Has anyone else felt this way before? How did you overcome it? What have you found to give you purpose and not fall into the void?
