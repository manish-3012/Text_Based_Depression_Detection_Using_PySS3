I don't like livingSo I'm at a place where I'm too weak to commit suicide and too tired to live. I enjoy nothing in this life. There is nothing left for me to look for. I can list my reasons and details of my situation, and you may agree or disagree with me, but that doesn't change the fact that i can not go on with life anymore. And it's not just my life, but life itself. Looking at the beauty of life and turning your head the other way of the ugliness doesn't make life any better. People are killed, innocent are raped and murdered, lazy drop outs are rich phd graduates are on poverty limit. Life is so unfair, there is no recipe for success, life is just not for me. It is not for me. there is nothing I want anymore, nothing that makes me happy nothing i love, nothing I want.   


I am seeing a therapist. but frankly all I want is to find a painless and fast way to end my life. if there were a button to end my life I would have pressed long time ago.   


I wanna go ahead and thank all the ones who sends me nice replies about how life is precious and I shouldn't do it. Don't worry, I'm probably too coward to do it anyways. but I can't live like this either. So help me get out of this in-between state please.

Just little details, I got 2 cats who are very attached to me, and a loving husband. So I can't do it at home. But i can't take a risk to fail at it and become crippled. Please help.
