No one will understand....Sorry the strong language. No one ever fuking understands! I want help I fuking cried out but my parents gives no fuks! they think I'm crazy.... they think I wont kill myself soon, my mom says she's reach the point where she doesn't care anymore, my fuking step dad looks at me let shit behind my back. I'm sick of been around them now. I was planning on just enjoying the rest of this year an ending it on new years but seems the plans gonna change. I just want to fuking escape this shit hole an my ass of a life, from what I can see things will be better without me around. For my birthday on November the 5th I cracked, like I heard the voices saying end it!! I cried so much and tried to just take it in but my little sister came in and found me then my parents came in. They showed some comparison....well just for that moment then back to the same fuking shit. Lol no matter what I say they'll NEVER UNDERSTAND the thing is I fuking tried to talk with them but oh well. You know what I dont feel so sad about it anymore, it's like I'm comfortable with dying now lol it's like I'm anticipating it as if it's some kind of big event for me lol sigh. I'll write them a nice note before I leave so they'll fuking understand this is not a game and the pain is very fuking real!! waste of fuking time. I'll gladly sit in hell if that's real! If I could of ran away from this place I would've but i got no where to go. My only option left is taking my life, might just drink some fuking poison, hang myself or buy a gun from someone an open my fuking skull.... honestly either way I'll be dead so yea fuk this world an every person that thinks people that has any form of depression is crazy, I hate them all!! NO ONE FUKING GETS IT!! I'm done fighting myself lol I officially give up. Anyways, I'm out guys....honestly wish we could of lived in a better world.
