Why not? Why shouldnâ€™t I?Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense but Iâ€™m kinda drunk rn... My lifeâ€™s a mess, Iâ€™ve been single a long time and no matter how hard I try that not going to change, doesnâ€™t help that Iâ€™m ugly af. I fucked things up with the one person I loved the most and they arenâ€™t speaking to me anymore. My family hates me for being gay. I mean, being gay is largly the problem. I work a dead end job and canâ€™t get anything better. My only 2 â€œfriendsâ€ only talk to me when it suites them. The one friend I just made will probably drop me once they realize who I actually am as a person. Like I donâ€™t get why I should be here. Why shouldnâ€™t I take all the oxy I have sitting in my cabinet. Why should I be alive? Iâ€™m just.. Iâ€™m desperate for a reason to be here, Iâ€™m desperate for someone to come along and tell me things will be alright. I want to live. But.... itâ€™s just not worth it... this Friday.. I think Iâ€™ll take the pills and have a few drinks and wait for it to end..... I guess this is my goodbye
