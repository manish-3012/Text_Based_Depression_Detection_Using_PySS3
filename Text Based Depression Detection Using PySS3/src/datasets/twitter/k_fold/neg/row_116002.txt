I just need someone to talk to right nowGoing to this subreddit just made me realize it really never can get better. I've been sad for as long as I can remember. I suffer from anxiety and panic attacks that have led to me ending up in a hospital from trying to hurt myself. I've tried calling friends and it's obviously too early and also probably nobody wants to deal with this shit.

Lastt night I went out dancing because I used to love it and it would always cheer me up. Instead I just had random men grabbing at me and trying to put their hands up my skirt and disgusting shit like that. I ended up crying in front of everyone and my friends took me home but it made me feel like a wuss who can't be taken anywhere. I didn't leave the house for a long time because I used to be terrified of people. That's how I feel again. I don't want to go outside because everyone is so horrible. Why should I want to live when I can't even be near strangers without having a breakdown? I know what other people are capable of, I've had much worse things happen to me. 

I don't have any coping skills. I don't know what to do when I start having a panic attack or how to even prevent it in the first place. I'm from a very small town and moved to a big city and still am not used to the crowds. It doesn't always scare me but when it does I become completely broken and useless. 

I've been in this state of mind before and it terrifies me. I have little moments of realizing what's happening and being fairly reasonable about it but then two minutes later I'm back to freaking out and crying and wanting to hurt myself. I shouldn't have been born. This has been a miserable existence.
