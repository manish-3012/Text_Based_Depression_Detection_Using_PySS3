I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening.I just had a single minute of an intense, electric need to stab myself. I have no idea why. I had to pin my hands under myself to stop the shaking. 

I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy. 

I hate people. I hate everyone so goddamn much. But if the interactions are online? Then itâ€™s okay. 

I absolutely despise people outside of the internet though. It makes me skip school, and it keeps me in the house for weeks. Iâ€™m so disgusted with myself.

I have school tomorrow, and my anxiety is on meth right now. I donâ€™t know what to do. I made a promise to stop cutting, but I feel like I need to break it.

I donâ€™t even really know what Iâ€™m posting about, I just want to be heard at this point.

I havenâ€™t met anyone yet who can really comprehend my hate towards people.

I donâ€™t know anymore, I just want to die.
