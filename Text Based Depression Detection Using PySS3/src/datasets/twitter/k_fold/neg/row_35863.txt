Question.I have an appointment with my psychiatrist on Wednesday. In your opinion, should I tell him about my suicidal thoughts/plan and my self harm relapse?
I'm just scared to because he might send me to the hospital and i can't go back because my work needs me right now. And he might change my meds and I dont want that either. Any advice would be great.
