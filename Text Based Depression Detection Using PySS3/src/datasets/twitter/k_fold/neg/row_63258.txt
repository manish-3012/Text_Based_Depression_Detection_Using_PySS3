I'm trying to find reasons to not end it, but nothings working.I'm jobless, not over my weird break up with my gf of 2 years, don't have any pets, don't have a good relationship with my family so I don't give a shit about how they'd be affected, and I've isolated myself from anyone that could be a close enough friend. I don't have anyone or anything but I'm also too much of a coward to do anything too violent to myself. I wish I would just get into an accident or someone would just off me. Everything's hopeless.
