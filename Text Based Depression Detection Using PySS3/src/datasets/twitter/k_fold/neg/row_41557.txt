Finding it increasingly difficult to find hope.Been feeling pretty down lately, everything only seems to be getting worse instead of better each day. 

I met a girl at a friends party awhile back and we really seemed to hit it off pretty well. She offered me her number and kept coming up to me and talking and even sitting in my lap. Well fast forward to a few days ago, I got the courage to text her and ask her to be my valentine, never expecting her to say yes. Well she did but also mentioned she was busy today on Friday and this weekend. Part of me felt excited, but another part of me couldnâ€™t help but feeling like it was an easy way to let me down. 

Well today I text her again just to say hey and try to make some small talk and 5 hours went by before she replied back. Iâ€™m normally not a impatient person but that seems like a really long time to wait to respond, especially when I knew she wasnâ€™t busy because she had made a few posts on Facebook and Snapchat, one of which she was out getting drinks after work. We ended up making a few exchanges then she goes MIA again not responding for a few more hours whilst also posting again on FB and Snapchat numerous times.

I know it seems minor but Iâ€™ve just been really depressed lately and this is like the pebble that triggered the avalanche. Itâ€™s just made me feel worthless and hopeless. I just feel like I will never be happy or find anyone and sometimes wonder if life is even worth living anymore.
