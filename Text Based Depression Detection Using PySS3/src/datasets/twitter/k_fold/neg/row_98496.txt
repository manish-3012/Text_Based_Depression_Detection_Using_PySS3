My thoughts tonight before going to sleepIt's becoming more clear to me over the years, that life is just a blank....
an empty hole that everyone is trying to fulfill in their miserable way
There is no way to change anything in this world, so why should we keep living

I'm just feeling angry all the time, and I became tired 

Good night
