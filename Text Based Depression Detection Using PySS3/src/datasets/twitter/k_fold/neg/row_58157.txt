Have any of you had a happy dream regarding your death?I canâ€™t count the amount of times that I had a daydream of my suicide/funeral. I even have journal that I write in sometimes where I described how my casket would look like. I can sit in class and happily dream of me jumping off a bridge or hanging myself. Itâ€™s dark I know but suicide seems to be the only release for me. Iâ€™m trying to give myself until 25 and if nothing changes/if my self hatred gets unbearable Iâ€™ll definitely go through with it (unless I lose it one day before I turn 25 and just do it). Whilst most people can dream of a future and have goals, i canâ€™t barely see or manifest how next year will look like. Man I wish that I wasnâ€™t alive
