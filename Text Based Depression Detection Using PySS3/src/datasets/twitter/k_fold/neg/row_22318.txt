Pain pain pain it never endsItâ€™s 4.50Iâ€™ve been crying for hours unable to sleep. I suffer from chronic pain, i have ptsd after 15 years of abuse. Iâ€™m so tired i have a migraine right now and pressing my jawmuscles to dull the tmj pain. My head is a flood of suicide and self harm. I think its been 2months since i last cut. I want to taKe a razor blade between my ribs, dowN both arms slash my legs then throat. Its the only thing that feels good. Iâ€™m tired of being so broken. I cant do a single thing right. I eat i cry i plan my end i struggle to sleep

I dont want to  live 

11 years ago i made myself believe things wouldnt always be this way. I held on and began to hope but was attacked again. And now 7 years of purely failing at everything
