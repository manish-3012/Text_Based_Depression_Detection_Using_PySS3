Tired of livingEverything hurts so bad I can't even function anymore. I was already doing bad in college and then I just stopped doing work or going to class for a few weeks because I couldn't take it. I emailed my professors but they don't care. My mom wanted me to go to law school and be a lawyer cause i'm so smart but if i'm so smart why am I failing every single class i'm taking :(. No one will hire me so I can't get a job. I've been going to therapy for years and it doesn't help, I've been on a bunch of different pills and they haven't help. They put me in a hospital and it didn't help. It just made my mom yell at me for giving her outstanding medical bills. I have no friends. All I do is smoke all day and cry. I hope a bottle of pills and a bottle of alcohol will kill me. I dont want to live. I'm sorry.
