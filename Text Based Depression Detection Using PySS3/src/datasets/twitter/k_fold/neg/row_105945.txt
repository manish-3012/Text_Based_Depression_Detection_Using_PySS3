What you pick, you pay an opportunity cost and you canâ€™t have it all.My dad had passed away when I was 8. My mother worked hard to put food on the table. Too much was expected of me as I was good at studies back in school. With the life savings, she sent me abroad for higher education. 

Iâ€™ve tanked my two semesters and now Iâ€™m on academic probation.

I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined my life and have no hope for the future. Iâ€™m utterly irresponsible as in chasing short term happiness, I let go my long term responsibilities. 
I wasted my time doing â€”

-	Part-time job which required 2.5hour commute each day. 4hr work +2.5 commute.
-	I didnâ€™t keep up with the assignment deadlines. I procrastinated.
-	I played games, watched YouTube, browsed through reddit. My average screen time was 5-7 hrs a day. 
-	I missed my morning classes because I slept late. It was more important to spent time going places with my friends.
-	Instead of studying my university courses, it was more important for me to get my Coursera and Udemy certificates. 

This list just goes on and on. I know that I shouldnâ€™t do these things in excess but I did it nonetheless. I know Iâ€™ve only got 16 hours a day and I didnâ€™t spend it wisely. Rationally, I understand I did this to myself but I canâ€™t help with the emotions that Iâ€™m feeling right now. I wanna end it now but I donâ€™t want to make my mom sad. 

From now onwards, I wonâ€™t let how I feel right now be the judge of my decisions.
