How do I not pressure the one person who gives me a reason to live?I've been battling depression for several years. I've had some extremely low points and some points where I felt like I was finally out of the woods. I started dating a wonderful, kind, supportive man about a year ago and have been slowly opening up to him about how much I struggle with this. It has taken me this long into the relationship to feel anywhere close to safe and secure enough to show him that side of me, and he has always responded positively and been there for me.

Over the last few weeks I have fallen into a really dark place again. I have no idea what happened, I just went off the rails after months of progress. I didn't say anything about it to my boyfriend, but ended up having a panic attack in front of him and had to talk about it. I have been massively isolating myself from my friends and family and the other night I picked a fight with him over nothing. I'm so afraid of driving him off. I feel like everything I do or say is the wrong thing.

I want to continue opening up to him and not hiding everything, but I don't know how to say, "The only time I don't wish I was dead is when I'm around you" without putting massive pressure on him. I know it's okay to sometimes need extra support, but it's not fair for him to be tasked with keeping me alive and functioning. He is an incredibly driven and and well-defined individual, and I feel so guilty for needing him so badly, for not being able to build up a life of my own. I feel absolutely empty and directionless, so I end up depending on his affection and attention, which helps but obviously doesn't fix the underlying problem.

We love each other very much and I know he wants to be there for me. I just don't know if I can stand to make him bear that burden for me.
