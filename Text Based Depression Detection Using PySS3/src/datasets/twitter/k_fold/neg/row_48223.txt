I can't stop crying right nowI can barely see my keyboard my eyes are so full of tears. I havent cried in so long  \  
  
every aspect of my life has just been getting worse  
  
im failing out of school. i am to upset and lazy to do my assignments of study for exams. i missed the deadline to sign up for community college. i have no motivation. i dont even want to go i wont meet people at community college its not a reall college experience its just for fuck ups like me  
  
my friends dont really like me. i have no close friends. i texted 4 people to hangout and no body replied to me. i do nothing on weekends. winter fucking sucks i cant even get out of my fucking house  
  
a friend and me started dating resently. ive had a crush on her for like a year and i finally asked her out. we went on like 3 dates and now she ont even talk to me. we where suposed to go out tonight but she wont text back even though shes posting shit on twitter right now. I fuck LOST HEr as a FRIEND and a LOVE INTEREST.  im stuck on her becasue i have no toher ptions shes the only girls who will even talk to me. i have no girls in my social cicrle or classes. IM to painfully UGLY to meet people online. I havent even kissed a girl. I FEEL LIKE A FUCKING FAILURE all i want is to not be a virigin and have a girlfriend  
  
i wish i could get a job. for fucks sakes. i applied eveywhere. i could meet firedns of girlfriend at a job. a plave where no one noes me. A JOB WOULD KEEP me BUSY. it would keep my mind offall the negative shit but i cant get hired  
  
BOTH My PARENTS HATE me. they are so dissapointed in all my failures.my sister is more pretty, has a job, firends and a boyfriend. I HAVE NONE OF THOSE THINGS. I DONT EVEN HAVE HAPPiness.  
  
I HAVE NO ONE WHO CARES ABOUT ME. im crying even harder now. why the fuck am i even writing this oh god
