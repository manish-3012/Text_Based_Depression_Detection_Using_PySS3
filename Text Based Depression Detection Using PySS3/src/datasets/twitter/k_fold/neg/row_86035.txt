I'm a freak and deserve to dieI had to make an hour and a half drive alone yesterday, on the highway. It was my first time doing so since my suicide attempt (crashing my car on the highway at high speed). I was terribly anxious and so tempted to try again. I think I shouldn't drive for a while. I'm pathetic and fucking worthless and I want to hurt myself so badly
