A â€œSuccessfulâ€ LifeA Typical Life â€”-

You work hard. Go through school. Get â€œa good job,â€ which usually means sitting in a cubicle all day for most of your life like a robot. Live paycheck to paycheck. Get married and have a couple of kids. Send them to school if you can, and then they become drones for tax revenue. Soon, you retire, with the promise of a great life youâ€™ve been hoping for. You go to Florida, live a few years, unable to do much because your body is worn out and then you die, losing touch with family along the way. You were lucky to take a week off each year and get a little piece of this experience (a vacation), beforehand.

All the while you fight little nuances. You struggle and worry the whole way through. Life is constantly beating you down. 

Why is this a life worth fighting for? Is it really that easy to change and go down a different path? For some, yes. But for many others, you either have to be very gifted (intelligence, athleticism, etc.) or very lucky.
