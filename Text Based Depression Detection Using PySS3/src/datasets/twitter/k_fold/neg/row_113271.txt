Just being OpenTo anyone who takes the time to read this, thank you:

I'm what you would consider an antisocial young adult. Homeschooled for the last 5 years with no friends. I don't have much self confidence (I'm short, among other things). I used to crave a relationship and I let it make me bitter.

I've been struggling with a pornography and masturbation addiction. I'm a Christian and it completely goes against everything I believe. I feel like the self worth issues and the addiction are very much related.

I've been apart of a group on reddit called Nofap Christians, and honestly it has been a God send for me. I've struggled with suicidal thoughts for almost a year now. It almost feels like there is no reason to live sometimes. When I first joined I found freedom for nearly half a year and ended up falling back into the same lifestyle that made me miserable. It is so easy to feel like there is no hope. 

I can't count the number of times I've relapsed, and I feel like it is just taking one piece of me at a time. I don't want to get to the point where I don't care anymore. I've been so close to suicide before. I've got a caring family and a few people I know who I really care for. Sometimes I just feel like it wouldn't matter if I was gone. 

The isolation doesn't help. I don't get out a ton and its terrifying trying to make friends. I'm great when I know a person but meeting people is absolutely terrifying. That fear keeps me where I am at, and I don't like it. I don't know where I am going with this post, but I just feel like things are hopeless. I can put on a smile but there are times I am really struggling with wanting to live. 

If you've made it this far, thank you.
