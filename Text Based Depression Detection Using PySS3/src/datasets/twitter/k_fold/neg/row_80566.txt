My parents are going to have to bury me one day.Probably sooner than later. I don't care about anything anymore. I used to be a straight A student throughout most of high school, but now I've sank down to Cs. I've slowly driven away most of my friends. No point in having aspirations since I don't see myself having a future anyhow. I stopped going to therapy because I can't tell my therapist anything anymore (or anyone, for that matter), since anything I'd say to her would be grounds for breaking confidentiality, and I don't want to get locked up somewhere. Shit, I can't even tell you guys what I've been thinking because I don't want anyone to...I don't know, call the cops I guess? But it's been crushing me. I'm backed against a wall here.

I don't deserve help anymore. I just wanted to vent, I guess.
