LonelyWhy do I feel so lonely.
A dozens friends I meet a day, but at the evenings I have noone to tell my story.
Meeting girls at a night out, but noone wants something serious.
Being brown in a white neighborhood and getting those looks from them like I was a dog or something.
I have got so many people in my life, but noone that feels right.
