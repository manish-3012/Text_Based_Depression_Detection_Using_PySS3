LetÂ´s not!I really do not know what to do.

I have only been diagnosed medically with depression very recently, May 2012. Aged 21.

Here I am now, I have enough money to last 1 month, after that I have nothing left, and nowhere to go.

I am currently living with my girlfriend but she can not support me once my money has run out and without her I would have absolutely nothing.

I am at the end of it guys, I think of dying every single damn day, regardless of what I have been doing, I have been thinking the same way for a long time. The anti-depressants I have been given are doing nothing to make me want to live right now, I was in a hospital for threatening suicide not long ago and nothing has really changed since then, I have been given different pills and they have made me feel worse not better.

How do you do it guys? How do you get yourselves up again after all the shit you go through, I really do not think I can, and I know it is selfish but I think suicide is the option, because hell? What is the worse that can come out of it? Nothing, and that is what I want, fucking nothing, I am sick and tired of it all and am making plans to end it very soon, I wish I had the balls to do it now and hell I think I could, all it takes is a tiny bit more courage and it is gone, I want that so much.,
