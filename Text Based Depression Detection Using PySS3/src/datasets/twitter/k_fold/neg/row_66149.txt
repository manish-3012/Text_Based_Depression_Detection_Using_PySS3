I don't know what to do anymoreI entered college last semester and I have been struggling. My parents are no help at all, they still see me as a kid that doesn't know any better, and they constantly mock me and force me too stay. Right now, I am feeling worse and worse. It's hard for me to go to sleep, and when I do I'll only sleep a few hours. Today, though, is the day that I trully think that I dont know what to do. IÂ´ve went to this test, studied a lot, did great on the practice tests, and, just a few minutes ago, I opened to see a zero. I've done okay in the rest of my classes, but not great. I honestly donÂ´t know what to do. I basically cannot stand anyone I meet, and I have started considering suicide more and more in the past few months. I have been told that I shouldnÂ´t complain, but what else can I do? I'm going to the gym, managed my time correctly, and all of that stuff. I really don't know what to do, I am uninspired, tired, and considering dying. The only thing that can of stops me is a lack of strength to do it, but everyday, every second I do feel more determined to do it.
