One week leftIâ€™ve set my date. I know what Iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™m trying to think of a good location, but Iâ€™m not really able to go anywhere on my own because of chronic back pain that makes me only able to walk for a few minutes before the pain is too intense.

Anyway, it feels good to have most of my plan ready.

I was going to leave a note but I think I might just post on FB and tumblr and leave my blog open before I leave. All I really want to say is that I love my friends and family and I am sorry to hurt them so much.
