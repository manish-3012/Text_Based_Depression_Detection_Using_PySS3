I keep ruining every friendship I have.For so many years I've known something has been wrong with me.  I go through depressive phases, push people away, think about killing myself, and just kind of ruin every friendship I have.  A little over a week ago I tried to kill myself and was baker acted for a few days, talked to a doctor and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.

While I still think about killing myself constantly throughout the day constantly, I don't think I will go that far again.  I don't know if this is the complete right place to post this, but I figured because of those feelings I would.

Every friend I had I have pushed away.  The one support group I had, I lost.  I've resorted to drinking and taking pain killers when I'm not drinking to numb the pain I have.  

I'm supposed to be getting meds to help with my depression, but am going to have to wait for insurance to kick in, which I don't know how much longer that will be, I think a few weeks at least.

All I know is that every day things just get harder and harder, and I have no friends to talk to because of how I acted.  I'm no victim in this, I could have controlled my actions and not said the things I did, and not tried to push them away, but that still doesn't make this pain any less.

I feel so alone, and I just want my friends back.
