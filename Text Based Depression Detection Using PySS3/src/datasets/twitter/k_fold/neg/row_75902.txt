Laugh and the world will laugh with you. Weep, and you'll weep aloneThe quotes from oldboy but originally it was from a poem. Every day i think about this and it fits so well. Please dont think im an edgelord or anything. Its true, no one wants to be around you when you dont love yourself. My friends dont even reply anymore when i say something suicidal. Its fine though i understand why its like that. They still care about me but i think thyre just tired. I wouldnt really know what to say either and plus i cant think of anything that will make me feel better. I recentlybecame a citizen and everyone was so happy for me and a lot of people reached out through twitter. That was really nice of them. But if i started posting suicide shit on twitter everyone would unfollow me. its understandable but people keep telling others its ok to take a break, its ok to cry. But its not ok because the moment you do that the world will leave you behind. Ive already taken a month leave from work bc of depression a while ago. It didnt help, and now everyone treats me with kid gloves. And it definitely highlighted me out as the unstable one. If they ever decide to lay people off we all know who's going first. I dont blame them either. Every day i feel like im falling further behind. I take a shower every week or so. I havent brushed my teeth in a month. Im barely hanging on and barely working either, i still meet the deadlines but its not looking good. I feel like im at my limit i dont know how much further i can go. Sometimes i get moments of clarity then a day later its all gone. My parents think im doing well but its anything but. I have so much to do and a deadline this week but im so tired. I just want to off myself already
