When it doesn't get better, then what?I've had severe depression my entire life. I've gotten treatment. I take a handful of medications every day to get by. It has never gotten better. Some days are okay. Some are absolute hell. In my whole life I've had  a few years where I felt happy. I was married and had a lot of good friends, house. The life I wanted. That ended.  I'm divorced for 15 years and I've lost everything. No friends. I live in a tiny apartment. I have a good job but I don't make enough to travel, go on vacations or do much of anything fun besides play online games and such. I've been in a relationship with a man for 14 years that has severe ADHD and aspergers. He has financially destroyed me and broken me. I'm in severe amount of debt. I love him but it is hell being in love with him. Absolute hell. I am semi-disabled so I don't think I could live alone so I stay. I have no friends. I have no family. I'm 50 years old and I'm fat, ugly and invisible to the world. I spend my nights getting drunk and staring at my computer. I have nothing but books, computer games, music and my cat. That is my entire life. I never leave the house. I am thinking of checking out permanently because I'm in so much pain and it just seems pointless. I don't have anyone to tell this to IRL so I'm posting it here.  What do we do when it really doesn't get better. You know how people say, oh it will get better. What about people like me that it never does get better. There are no guides to that one. So that is my question, what if it doesn't get better like people say it will? It hasn't and it won't
