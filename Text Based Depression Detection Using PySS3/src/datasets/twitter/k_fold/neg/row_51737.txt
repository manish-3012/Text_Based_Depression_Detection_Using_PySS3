a repost since the original didn't get any hits then fell through the reddit feed (new posts come in, the old one's get pushed back. not salty, just how shit is). i'm doing this cuz i need help-note: i know that suicide is objectively a stupid choice, however what is a few minutes of suffering in comparison to years of suffering?

-repost:

-my father died when i was 11 (shitty ass american healthcare system)

-i've never had a girlfriend (16, male, straight) or any physical or non-physical romantic interaction with a girl, and i feel so alone.

-im poor af, and cant get a job since im to poor for a car and there are no jobs within walking distance to change this.

-no friends (this also combines with the 2nd point) and i never go anywhere since i can't drive and live in the middle of nowhere. this has had a negative effect on my mental health.

-i don't have a method of killing myself, but i've thought about it. i don't want to die, i just want the pain to end.

-note: i've posted in the depression subreddit before and people have said "don't worry, you'll find someone eventually" or some shit like that. it would be great to have someone in the future, however we're not in the future. we're in the present, and in the present i feel like shit. and i want to feel loved now
