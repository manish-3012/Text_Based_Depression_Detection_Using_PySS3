I kept it together for awhile, but I am without a doubt actively suicidal again.I have severe panic disorder, I've been trying to find the right medication for most of my life. Am having a hard time getting benzodiazepines, my doctor thinks I'm addicted. Probably am. I can barely go to work. Every day I'm either in a state of panic or trying not to end up in one. Happens anyways. I really don't wanna die, but I think it's better than living this way and being a burden to my family and few friends I still have. I'll never be successful. I've always been focused on staying afloat rather than moving forward because it was exhausting enough to try to keep myself calm enough to go about my life. I graduated high school and that's about the only accomplishment I've ever had. And the only reason I did that is because if I didn't I wouldn't have had a place to live. Same reason I force myself to go to work. But that's gonna end soon too. The boss is starting to notice I can't handle it. And I really don't say much about it, it's just obvious I'm a mess all the time. Everyone in my life has done a really great job of supporting me, but they shouldn't have to. I'm not gonna get better.. there's no point to it honestly. I don't want sympathy or anything, I just felt like I had to tell someone about it. Sorry for the wall of text, I didn't plan on writing this much and just kinda kept going. I hope you all have a great day/evening.
