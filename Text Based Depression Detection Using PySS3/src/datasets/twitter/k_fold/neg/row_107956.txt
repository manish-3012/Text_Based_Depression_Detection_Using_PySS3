I guess what I really want is someine to talk toI dont normally do these kinds of things, idk why i am now. I have been thinking about suicide for a while and it doesnt really make me feel depressed, i am kind of numb to the idea to be honest. 

I dont have any friends. Serious, i just am not great at making them. So i really would like to have someone to talk to. We dont need to talk about anything depressing, anything you want.

Maybe if i can feel some semblance of normalcy, it would help.
