How much trazodone do I need to take to die?edit: Iâ€™m fine now. 250mg later, I slept for 15 hours and Iâ€™m still really tired. Ended up having really bad hiccups, and I was in a really deep sleep where my mom couldnâ€™t even wake me up, and when she tried, I was snoring (I rarely do this) as well as breathing really loud. 

Depression is a fucking bitch.
