GoodbyeHey, uh, I donâ€™t exactly know how to start this off. 

Life has fucked me over pretty hard lately, and I donâ€™t want to really be here anymore. Everything sucks, and I donâ€™t see a point in waking up tomorrow. I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that Iâ€™m done. iâ€™ve reached rock bottom, and I donâ€™t know how to come back from this. I donâ€™t know if I even want to. Iâ€™m 18 years old, and I donâ€™t want to live to see 19. Um, sorry for making you waste your time reading this I guess. Goodbye.
