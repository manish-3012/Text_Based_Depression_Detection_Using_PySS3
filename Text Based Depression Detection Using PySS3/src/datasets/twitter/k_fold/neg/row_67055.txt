It honestly depresses me so much knowing I'll never leave earth.It really just irks me that of all the times I could be born, I happened to be born too early to go places other than Earth. I know a lot of you will say that Earth has many beauties and all that, but I'm not interested in that stuff unfortunately. I really wish I had been born farther into the future. I know if I worked hard enough I could possibly become an astronaut and maybe go to the ISS, but even that feels like I'm still to locked to Earth because of how it orbits Earth so closely. I feel like I'm not from here. I feel a connection to Sedna, an outer dwarf planet that orbits the sun highly elliptically, and at times is really really isolated and far out from its planet Friends and at other times is really close to them. I guess that's how I feel socially. I've considered killing myself because maybe in the afterlife you can spectate everything that happens in the universe, and I'd like to get there faster. Anyways thanks for listening to what I know is an unusual post here.
