My depression is spiraling down, about to hang myself.Iâ€™ve been in a deep bout of depression since last November, as Iâ€™m unemployed, single, living with my parents, and in my early 30â€™s. Everyone I grew up with seem so much more successful with their careers and dating life than I am. Today, I learned that my best friend is about to become very successful with his career, and make lots of money, and this is making me feel even worse. I think this could be the trigger that pushes me over the edge. Iâ€™ve been thinking of ending it for at least 2 months now, and I think today just proves again that my life is completely pathetic, worthless, and I am just a failure at my life, career, and dating. I honestly donâ€™t even care what the people in my life would think of me when Iâ€™m gone. Honestly, Iâ€™ll be gone and I wouldnâ€™t care. But the burden of my defeat and continued failure at my life I cannot stand any longer. This life is not worth living for me, the emotional pain of failure is so strong, that I just donâ€™t think another day is worth waking up to. I really just want this pain to end. Because Iâ€™m just not worth anything. Most of all, Iâ€™m not worth anything to myself, because Iâ€™m just a pathetic failure. 

And yes, I am 100% sober as Iâ€™m writing this. Iâ€™m thinking very clearly, with only the emotional pain inside as the only thing Iâ€™m feeling.
