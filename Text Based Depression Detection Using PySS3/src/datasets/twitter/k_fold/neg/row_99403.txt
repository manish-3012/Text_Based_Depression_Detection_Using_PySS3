Birthday Oct 18th. (Will be 18)Planning on potentially doing it then or the day after. I'm just very sure it's not getting better for me, I'll never find people who gets me, a lover, anything. My guardians are mentally &amp; physically abusive.. almost bordeline narcissistic. I struggle with my race (black), my weight (no idea but obese), my general outter appearance really.. so much in fact that the thought of being perceived by any one else except for my 'family members' (i don't go out at all so dont have to worry abt it usually) will send me into a breakdown because i am that disgusting to look at (especially men). I can't do basic things because my parent has treated me likr a child up until this age and has done everything for me. I am incapable of a lot things. I have not gone to HS because my parent decided that i shouldn't be in HS the day i turned 16.. 2 years ago. I have nothing to live for, I am sad everyday and it's exhausting.
