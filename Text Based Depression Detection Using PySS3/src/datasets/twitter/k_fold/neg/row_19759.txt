The Dangers of Thinking Too Much.       I think too much.
And I realized this a couple of minutes ago, since someone was dealing with anxiety and losing sleep.
The dangers of thinking too much are as follow:
1. Losing control.
If you think to much your emotions run wild and if you are like me or most of us here that suffer constant depression it may lead to a mental breakdown, and that is not a pleasent experience for you or those who witness.
2. Getting depressing thoughts.
I have stated many times before that I am guilty of very depressing thoughts, they come in my mind quite often. And those lead to more depressing thoughts that eventually lead to suicidal thoughts.
3. Questioning too much.
Sometimes you gotta be more simple, and not think of questioning things, specially things that trouble you, since those are the most harmful.
4. Hopelessness
That's what you may sometimes feel if you think too much of your problems. And the feeling if hopelessness is haunting at best.
       
Now on to how to fix.

1. Slow down.
2. Relax.
3. Read.
4. Listen
5. Get sleep.

There is hope.
