Limbo (Also, why don't you guys reply to my post)I never really wanna commit suicide. Whenever I do it's just thoughts. Whenever I think about it, I'm too much of a coward to go through with it. I'm having financial problems and little issues. When I do want to go through with it, I back out. I want to die because I'm a coward and I can't because of that previous fact.
