â€I'm 19 but I already hate the world and my shitty luck and I can't wait to die
I think the only thing stopping me from killing myself is my mom, who I know cares about me so much and I feel so guilty for wanting to kill myself and thinking of ways to kill myself every single fucking day. I think I'm going to be selfish and just kill myself in one of these days because I just don't think I can take it anymore. I try to motivate myself and try to actually do something significant in my life but it always backfires and I'm always back with being a loser. I barely have anyone to talk to about this. I don't think anything really motivates me or interests me anymore. I'm so tired of pretending I'm happy.
