I hate myself more than anything else. Think I'm too far down.So I'm 20, male, and a university student. For pretty much every I've had the lowest self-esteem. I never feel like I fit in anywhere and while I do have a few friends, I still have problems feeling like anyone really cares about me. All of my romantic relationships have been relatively short and shitty. I don't really like my job anymore even though I used to. I do go through periods where I feel okay but then I'll go back for a while to thinking about how awful of a person I am, and every time I open my mouth I feel like either a dick or the most awkward person on earth. I have anxiety attacks where I'm convinced I have awful body odor (which may or may not be true, although I think I have pretty meticulous grooming habits especially due to this). Either way, this has been one of the really bad weeks and I've thought every day about how much I want to kill myself and how I would do it. Of course I haven't ever had the guts because I'm afraid of upsetting my family, especially my grandmother who is a sweet old lady. Well I'm tired of dealing with this and I don't know what to do besides something desperate, but maybe venting to nobody in particular will help. I still am pretty sure I know how I'm going to die sooner or later, and it'll be at my own hands. I don't think it's a question of if, just when.
