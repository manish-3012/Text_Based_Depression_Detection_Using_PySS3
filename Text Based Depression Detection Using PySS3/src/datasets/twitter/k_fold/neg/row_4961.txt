After multiple attempts i think it's time to do one final one.Gonna be completely honest and write out my entire life in bullet points. I'm dying tonight and want this to be chronicled somewhere other than some shitty notes I'm making for my dearest friends.

- Abused repeatedly by my father from a young age (4- 7) He would often hit me with a cricket bat when my brother or i did something he disliked.

- My mother became a raging alcoholic when i was 8 or 9. Mentally, verbally and often physically abused me.

- Went from being a star student to one of the lowest rated students.

- Went to a boarding school, got beaten, bullied and molested.

- Came back to normal school, bullied repeatedly, mom was out of rehab, didn't work, she'd pass out at around 4 - 5pm every day. Never fed me but my brother was old enough to have a refined enough pallet to eat leftovers that kept him of average weight. I couldn't, i would throw up.

- Dated girl who molested me about 2 years later as i was lonely.

- She would often molest me and force me to perform sexual acts on her.

- she took me to a party once where i was drugged and raped.

- I lost my virginity to her technically, it was rape but it is what it is. She'd threaten to kill herself or tell others i raped her if i didn't have sex with her. She forced me to lay down and she rode me while i was half erect. She got off very quickly, i did not and have suffered sexually mentally for many years since.

- Mom was continuously alcoholic, Father was never at home at this point. She would bang on the doors, barge into my room, break my things often. I would skip school often due to me not getting any sleep because of her.

- She told all my friends Mothers i beat her regularly and threw her down the stairs and would abuse her. Messed with my mental health immensely.

- My brother became distant and not himself, impossible to have a conversation with.

- Girl who molested me cheated on me alot, i mean an incredible amount. When she moved to Australia we tried long distance, didn't work out, cheated on me multiple times.

- When i manned up and broke up with her, she sent a video of her having sex with another man.

- I have attempted suicide 4 times, twice by hanging and one with a gun of which i failed to operate. Another by overdose.

- Got a new girlfriend, things were great.

- She abandoned me after almost 4 years due to my depression turning me into something awful.

- My ex before that contacted me Spetember last year. telling me things no man can bear to hear. Ruined me.

- (Age 21) After my newest girlfriend left me i met up with my ex, who tried to coerce me into sex and to get back with her. I suffer from Erectile Dysfunction now and refused, i also knew she was bad for me.

- She constantly begged and pleaded me to get back with her, i told her no, and out of frustration i told her to kill herself for ruining my life and ruining my relationship with my ex that i actually love.

- A few weeks later she moves back to Aus after visiting where i am, she then kills herself a week later.

- I feel immense guilt.

- My newest ex did sexual things with someone when she promised me she would not until we could talk, she then says she didn't promise that. I looked in my diary, she did indeed promise it and i consulted my therapist and he reaffirmed i said this to him the day after we broke up. She was either gas-lighting me or did not care enough to remember her promises.

- In the past 6 months my life has crumbled around me, my father beat me and is lying about it to everyone, turning his fiance against me as well because she refuses to believe me and only believes him.

- I saw a therapist for a while that was helping alot, but after i told him my father beat me they got in a fight. My father now refuses to pay for further therapy.

- My brother has become a flat earther, and believes the moon is hollow. He has gone insane and i avoid him for the sake of my mental health.

- My mother has left the house many years ago, but she is still a raging alcoholic and often sneaks into our house to try talk to me. I despise her and what she has done to my life and relationships and won't be writing a letter for her.

- I was diagnosed with an adrenal gland and thyroid disorder, which is highly unusual in males that are 21 and was messing with my depression and metabolism for years.

- Have been treating it constantly, i suffer from borderline anorexia as well, i eat 3 - 4x more then i did 6 months ago, yet gaining weight is almost impossible. I take 11 pills a day, 2 protein shakes and eat more than i ever have. I have grown a few inches taller, yet i struggle to stay around 50kgs of weight.

- My friends don't come around my house anymore due to my brothers beliefs, and as such the band we had formed has dissipated. One of the few things in life i enjoyed. 
They live too far away now for them to pick me up all the time, and my father refuses to give me money for Ubers. I am home alone alot of the time.

- I am a proficient guitarist who is often praised for my playing, but have not been able to touch a guitar properly since my ex abandoned me. Only a few times and even when praised for it i still feel empty.

- My other passion, my main one i have been doing since i was about 3 or 4, gaming, has completely left me. I try playing games, and cry, i tried playing a Final Fantasy game (One of my favorite series) and they said my exes name like 5 times in 10 minutes. I cried. Haven't touched single player games since. I now only play online games just to hear my friends voices.

- My best friend and i had a falling out because i refused to do cocaine she offered me. She now says i am not worth talking to.

- My other great friend has become a sexist asshole monster.

- My other old time friend died a few weeks back and was only informed recently.

- My other friend went insane, and made me watch terribly violent and disturbing movies with her. After expressing my distaste, she throws many slurs at me. We are no longer friends.

- I have nightmares every single night of my life, sometimes they're just bad, others they are beyond horrific. I have seen a few specialists and doctors but no medications or therapies have helped.

- My father is now more abusive then ever, and told me i should just kill myself if i want to.

- My ex and the girl i am in love with recently got a new boyfriend, despite her promises that she wouldn't do so until we talked face to face. She will probably state she didn't promise this, again, despite me having it written in my diary.

- I sleep anywhere from 10 - 14 hours a day, and lay in bed alot of the time too. I take depression medication, and it helps a bit but makes me really tired and the come down makes me want to end it all.

- I used to browse reddit alot, now i struggle to do so unless it's something that interests me incredibly. Mainly old nostalgic things.

- I tried looking for childhood photos to experience good memories, realize i do not have any.

- I cry literally every day.

- I just want to be held again.

- I have no support system whatsoever.

- The dog i grew up with is on the verge of death.

- The only family member i cared for died right after my 21st birthday.

- I haven't had an erection in months (that i know of) and my testicles are literally in pain. I am only 21.

- I had to stop working out due to me not gaining weight despite me eating far more then i ever have. Have done blood tests and nothing serious seems to come up.

- I often walk around at night, where i live no one does this as it is incredibly dangerous. But i want to get mugged and shot as i don't want my friends and ex to blame themselves (Even though one of them is very much partly at fault)

- I officially think about suicide more than anything else. And lay in bed thinking of it too.

- I cry when i look in the mirror.

- I take 1 hour long showers often, and the water gets cold long before then and i sit under the cold water for a long time.

- I have life crippling tinnitus, it has gotten much worse the past few months due to me getting incredibly drunk and listening to incredibly loud music. I haven't smoked any weed in 3 months though, and it was a decision i made but i miss being distracted from my misery on it.

- A girl asked me to be her boyfriend, i said no as i am still in love with my ex despite her now having a boyfriend herself. 

- There are  two games coming out soon i have been waiting for for years. And i will be too depressed to play them as they are single player.

- I want to die.

That's not all of it but it's all i can think of in my depressive state.

Thanks for being around, this is a great subreddit that helps alot of people and for that you are great. But for people like me it's the last place we can type some parting thoughts. 

Live a great life everyone, i tried my fucking hardest i swear on my life, but no one i know cares. I literally can not take it anymore, and for that i apologize. And i apologize for this posts absurd length. 

Check you in the long grass. I'm writing my last letters and deciding whether i should hang myself or shoot myself. Doesn't matter in the end. 

You won't be hearing from me again. Live great lives people.
