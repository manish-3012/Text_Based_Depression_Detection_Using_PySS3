disappointment to my familyim 14. I canâ€™t do anything right. My parents ask the bare minimum of me. Do well in school, take care of yourself. They even do my laundry. However I srill canâ€™t do a simple fucking thing right. Iâ€™m a disappointment. Iâ€™m so stupid. I do okay in school, but Iâ€™m a fucking slob. I donâ€™t think my parents hate me but theyâ€™re always following me because as a teenager I canâ€™t do anything by myself. Everything would be better without me. I just wanna end my fucking life.
