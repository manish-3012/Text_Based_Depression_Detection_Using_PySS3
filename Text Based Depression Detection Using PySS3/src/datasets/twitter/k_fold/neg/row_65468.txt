I've run out of optionsI've been unemployed since I went back to school a couple years ago. I thought I'd somehow land a decent job after going to school and somehow things would work out, but when I couldn't find work and life in general started getting worse, my social anxiety and agoraphobia took over more than before. I'm at a point where I can't even talk to people. I had one person I thought might help me, but last night I went to talk to him and he started shouting at me right off the bat. I think he thought I needed someone to "put me in my place" but now I just feel a lot worse because I really have nobody left to turn to for help, if anyone even could help. For some background, I've been completely alone, aside from people I saw at work and then at school, for over 5 years, and for the past year since I've been out of school I've only had contact with people I saw looking for work. I don't want to give up, but I just don't see starving out on the street as a better alternative to killing myself in a less painful way. I've been thinking about this constantly and praying to find some way to change things, but now I'm nearly out of time and like I said I've got nobody left to ask for help.


edit: I forgot to mention, I'm losing my home a week from today. That's when I'll have to decide.
