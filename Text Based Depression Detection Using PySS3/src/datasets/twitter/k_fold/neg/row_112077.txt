25/m Depressed and becoming suicidal. Looking for a friend who is also miserable and possibly suicidal.Sometimes people are driven away because they just can't understand what long-term suffering is like from their vantage point. I do understand and I'm offering unconditional friendship if you will just try to do the same in good faith. Someone to be a caring ear for each other, and desire to make the other person's life better if possible. I don't care how funny or witty you are or whether we like the same books/shows etc. No awkward period of judging to "see if we click". If you are in the state I'm in you don't care too much about that superficial stuff. I don't want to commit suicide, despite life pushing me that way.  I just want to feel okay again.

I'm 25/m. I was depressed and isolated before any of this but I had escapism and hope for things getting better. I was making some good progress towards these goals when I decided to get some surgery to improve my appearance, which resulted in brain damage. I'm still trying to get answers for it. It's reduced my ability to think somewhat so please make some allowances... It also seems to have hit me right where it hurts the most, messing up the reward system, making it physically impossible for me to feel much if any enjoyment. I'm still searching for a proper diagnosis and possible treatments. Day to day existence is very bleak... future is worrisome if I can't get help for this. I think that one of the few things I can still get some satisfaction from is helping others though.
