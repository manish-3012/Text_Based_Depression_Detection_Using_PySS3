I feel like no one wants me and never will, and I'm tired of itI'm alone. I have one friend, but every little perceived slight towards me, any little rejection, like saying no to hanging out, it tears me up. No SO. Family I barely speak to.

I've tried 5 different meds, with different dosages and concentrations, and none have worked. I'm in therapy. It helps having someone to talk to once a week, but it doesn't stop the constant loneliness and suicidal thoughts.

I don't think this will get better. People always say it will, or that you never know what could happen and I guess that's true. But it all seems so hopeless. Plenty of people are alone forever. Some people don't find the right person until they're 30, 40, 50, 60. I can't be lonely for that long. 

I've been alone most of my life. I know how to be alone. I know how to do things alone. So it's not one of those things where I need to "find myself" or whatever. I just need someone with me.
