Title is, like life, pointlessTwo days ago it was my 23rd birthday. ~*"happy birthday, man! "*

Thanks for the wishes, those **really** elevate my mood!~*"so, what did you do on such occasion"?* 

Oh, I had plans, but I didn't follow them up. ~*"how come? What happened?"* I couldn't get up of bed lol. ~*i can definitely relate to that!* Who doesnt? We are not normies, are we :p 

~*"what's a normie?"*. You know a fucker that doesn't plan on overdosing on his birthday for example. 

~*"I see you're typing this, so things worked out well in the end"*. I guess so. ~*"fourtermore there is a positive side to what happened to you. There always is!!! "*. Oh gosh, please **enlighten** me

~*"see, if you consider the delta between your lowest moments and the highest, you're find out that you'll experience a bigger spectrum of emotion than a normal person. "*. You assumed the bad experiences just add up to the positive ones, I could argue that they cancel each other. ~"*why the fuck do you always have to be such a pessimist?"*. I see reality for what it is. I'd love to be delusional and have a reason to wake up eveyday... 

~*"so whats the result of our conversation? Are we agreeing to disagree? "*. Our conversation, like both our existences, *is pointless as fuck*, almost as life itself. But I guess It served for me to stop thinking about thinking of darker thoughts for a little. So there's that.
