Suicidal because of an abusive relationship and I need help to get outI moved in with my boyfriend when I lost my job and couldn't afford rent after COVID started here in South Africa. We have no children. He started showing me his true colours a while after I moved in when he started beating and berating me and raping me. I'm tired, amd it's gotten to the point where i am suicidal again, and I'm afraid of him. I want to disappear and not have him know where I am. But because I don't have money, I don't have a plan to get out. My parents are not an option because we are a traditional African family, the house is full of relatives and there is no space for me to sleep or store my things.

I guess what I'm asking is if any redditors could help me out. I found an apartment not in the best of neighbourhoods, but it's better than living with that man and suffering at his hands or dying by my own hand.

I'm not sure about this sub's rules about soliciting money, but I do need it, and if you want to help please PM and I will provide details.

I'm begging you all please, help me or spread the message to contribute if anyone can. Please, I'm afraid of my life at this point.

Please and thank you in advance
