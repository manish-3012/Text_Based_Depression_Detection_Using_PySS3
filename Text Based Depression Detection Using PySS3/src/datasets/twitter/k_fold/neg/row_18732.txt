My thoughts...Sometimes I wonder if the darkness is better than the light. I'm scared to enter it but the light isnt very bright. It's not that I dont smile during the light but it feels the one smile causes others to be in pause. Waiting for the darkness to enter the light but too scared to go alone. 

They say the test is never too hard but it's at a point where I'm too far gone.  It's a scary thought but it plagues my mind throughout the light.
