I don't know why I botherI know that I sound like a bratty teenager, but everyone hates me. My mother is always mad at me for stuff that I didn't do or stuff that I forget to do. I don't ever get a break from this, and I don't feel safe with her because she's always been abusive. I just want a hug! I want someone to hug me and make me feel safe and not always be mad at me! It's been so long since anyone has ever truly showed me some affection and love and get me out of my head! 

I keep daydreaming of a world where I have parents that love me but that end up having a child and not loving me anymore and it already feels that my cousin is the better version of me because that's what she says! She literally said that my cousin is better than me in every way and I can't escape these feelings in my dreams! I know that that's what she truly thinks of me and I hate being a failure and I know that nothing will ever change because I don't deserve love! She will never love me and there is no reason for anyone to love me.
