i'm so happy and i want to dieI got sober a while ago. I'm happy and I'm healthy; I love the people in my life and I love my life. I love everything my future might become. 

I am disgusted, disappointed, and exhausted (at what/whom and why? I sure as hell don't know). There is a pit in the lower part of my chest that is as hard as concrete and it feels like the crushing unity of desolation, loneliness, and hopelessness. I can physically feel it, and all the despair it involves, no matter how well I am doing, or how well I think I am doing.

I have been self harming more and more often, usually when my life is getting better and I get happier. I spent the whole week with people I love and who love me. I spent the whole week doing things that I love and which are good for me. I spent the whole week thinking about what moment would be the right moment to cut my neck, and I spent every moment outside of my house wishing I was back in my bathroom with a razor in my hand. I ran my fingernail across the site that I'm going to cut while I was out with my good friends and i wanted to either get locked up in the psych ward or tear my fucking neck open. I wanted to cry. I don't want to die, but I don't want to live. Everything feels so tasteless and tiring, even though everything is beautiful and exactly how it should be. I feel so powerless with this urge and I know it's going to kill me.

I will not kill myself when I'm in control of myself, but I am not always in control of myself. It's so tiring fighting with myself, and I hate that this is happening when I actually love where I'm at and where I might go. I wrote my suicide notes but I don't want to die. I just feel like I can't fight this anymore
