Why do I exist? I don't knowMany times I wonder, I was a planned and long-awaited daughter, my parents and my brother love me very much, I have no friends but it doesn't bother me, but even so every night before I go to sleep, I feel a great emptiness and sadness melancholic that I tried to ignore all day, there are even times when I don't fall asleep until I cry for a while ... After that I start to think if it makes sense that I'm alive? Does my existence affect someone? What would happen if I die? I really want to die and finally disappear, and the next morning, when I wake up, I have a hard time getting out of bed. This is something that I have been feeling for about 3 years, I enjoyed drawing, I am aware that I am not good at it, but it made me feel free for a moment, now just taking the pencil to draw a circle terrifies me. I really hate myself, I feel hypocritical, after the bath I feel that I am still dirty, as if my unconscious was trying to erase something from me that was rotten. I hate feeling the things I hear so strongly, when someone talks to me about a problem, I feel their pain, anger, if they are happy, I feel their joy if they are angry, I feel their anger. i want to die
