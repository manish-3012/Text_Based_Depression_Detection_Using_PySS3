Done.i've posted here before, when things were tough, but never was i this low. i have nothing going for me, my family are aggravated by everything, i can't hold a serious conversation with them about how i feel, the house is miserable all the time. my friends, act like friends for a day but then completely turn on me, they shout at me, scream at me, isolate me, they are truly horrible to me. they're not true friends. i have nobody to talk to other than one teacher who is really supportive of me but obviously i can't keep bothering her especially not on weekends. 

i think about killing myself every day, ive self harmed and started taking part in reckless behaviour more and more. counselling meds and doctors all have never worked. i'm done. i just wanted someone to hear me out.
