Suicide attemptToday I attempted suicide and took 7 advil. I'm alive but in pain. The reason is because of strict parents. Here;s the story I am legally an adult but living at home. Last night one of my family members caught me on the internet(they don't like me online) but I feel like I have a right to do what I want after all I did nothing wrong. Today they caught me doing the same thing and threatened to tell my dad. I am legally an adult but live in my familys house and go to school. I don't see what the problem is. (I ended up lying about what I was doing(saying I was writing in a virtual diary) (even created proof) and showed it to them they said "thanks for showing me) but I don't know if they believe me
sure I have had issues with being online in the past(bullying) but all my accounts are now private and everybody I talk to I trust. The past in the past. I go online now to try and make a difference in people's lives. I am trying to help people like me but I don't think my parents would understand that. I don't think its right they can try and control my life. And if they take away my internet I really will kill myself. My internet is the reason I am stil alive right now. and helping others helps me 

 Update (now my legs feel cold I'm wearing pants) and a friend of mine told me that could be because of the advil. I stiill have not given up the idea of suicide.
