The people that are â€œtrying to help meâ€ are limiting everythingMy mom called these police mental health people over to our house (Iâ€™m 16) and they basically threatened to take me to the hospital if I donâ€™t stop being depressed or suicidal.(great strategy)

I really want to hurt myself but I know that if I do my mom will find out and tell them so that they take me to the hospital, so that is limiting me to my only other option, suicide. 

Before these idiots came to my house and started calling me every second day, I had three options every-time I felt mad: option one: acting violently towards an object such as punching more holes in my wall. 
Option two: cutting myself or doing another form of self harm depending on how mad I am. 
Option three killing myself.  
The unit my mom called has eliminated the first two options with the threat that they made. 
I have never attempted suicide but I feel like itâ€™s only a matter of time until I do because it is my only option to let out anger. I really wish their was a painless pill I could take that just killed me.
