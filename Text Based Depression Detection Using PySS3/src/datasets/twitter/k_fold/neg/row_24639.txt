I don't know what to do with my lifeim only 19 graduated high school. I still don't know what to do with my life. I keep thinking to my self the list of things that I could do but then the question comes up do I want to do this. then the answer comes up I don't know. I know what I  do not want to do. although then there is still a list that I could do but then I am like meh. It now come to the point that everyone is telling me what I should do and I have thought about them. Although I am still like I do not really know if I want to. honestly I feel like the only way out is the easy way out at this point. too many options no way for me to figure it out after all im just a person that passed high school. Im not important don't have the answer to hunger I don't have the answer a way to convert water to plastic or plastic to water. I am just about done trying to figure it out at this point I am just going to find somewhere that no one will find me and end it cause why keep living if im not even capable of figuring out dos and don'ts.
