When sadness comes crushing all of a suddenSooo.. Here goes
Sometimes I get really sad, and I think of all the bad things in my life. Right now itâ€™s just really overwhelming for me.
I feel sad because I feel quite on my own with my feelings about just ending my life. I work at a pharmacy, and I have been so close to taking strong opioids back home with me and just OD on them. Of course I know this is illegal! This is what has been keeping me from doing it.
Whenever I feel sad every minor inconvenience is a really big deal, and my boyfriend always tells me, that Iâ€™m overreacting (he even told me this, when I had a kidney stone).
He might be right though, but I still have to deal with the feeling of everything being inconvenient and overwhelming.

Right now I think Iâ€™m having trouble with my kidneys again, because thereâ€™s blood in my urine, and my concentration of leukocytes in my urine is quite high too. I wish it was just a bladder infection, but it isnâ€™t, and I have to have more tests done tomorrow. This too is a major issue for me atm... 

Itâ€™s so weird. Sometimes I feel totally opposite of this, but right now everything has just turned into a negative.
