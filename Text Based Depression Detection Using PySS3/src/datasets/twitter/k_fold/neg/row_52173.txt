Concealed DepressionPlease tell me if I am Suicidal or just depressed. 

This is going to be word vomit. 

I want to give up, I know I shouldnâ€™t but I just want to.   I am tired of being the happy go lucky person. Nobody would ever look at me and think I am the person with the sad failed suicide scars running from both of my wrists to my upper forearms. I guess in a way I am a lot like my Suicide scars. Hiding from the world. Covered. To ashamed to let it be known that I am such a failure I canâ€™t even take my own life. I am such a fucking joke. Why are people so self absorbed. Nobody cares, nobody cares to ask how you are, how youâ€™re  holding up. Maybe I am just a burden. People only want to talk about there problems. I fucking hate people. If killing myself had no repercussions I would do it in a heartbeat. My family is so proud of me. My Psychiatrist is so proud of me. I am so good at hiding my feelings, I am so good at lying and making up stories I donâ€™t even know who I am at this point. There is this husk of a person I have created, he is amazing. I wish I could be him all the time, so charismatic and care free.. smiling all the time. Behind closed doors though, thatâ€™s when I can be my self, this is when I get away from all of the people, that enjoy the husk. I just want to die, life is meaningless. I am not afraid of death. I embrace it. THERE is no point to being alive, I hate everything. The world is hopeless. Everyone says you have to keep fighting but all I ask myself when i here that is â€œWhyâ€  

Whatâ€™s the easiest way to kill yourself? 
CO poisoning? How do I get it. I am not going to be digging around in my arms looking for that radial artery again lol.
