Any advice for managing/minimizing constant suicidal ideation?I've had daily suicidal ideation for over a decade. It's only in the past year that I've started attempting suicide. Lately my suicidal thoughts have been very persistent. Therapy and psych ward stays haven't helped. I'm feeling very hopeless.
