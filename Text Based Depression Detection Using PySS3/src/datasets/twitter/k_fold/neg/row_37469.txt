I rlly dont know what to do anymore...I'm new here so sorry if this is wrong to post but I just have to let it out... about a year ago I was suicidal because I was lonely and after when people knew about it they started talking to me because the felt bad and I never wanted that... I wanted real friends real people that actually care about me.... now.. they all left.. I have no kne to talk to, nothing to do, stare at my room and cry till I wake up from this bad dream. There is this one person who is popular at my school and she talks to me only if I say something and idk if she rlly cares or not or if she's just using me to tell her friends, it seems like she wants to help but she has all other people to talk to... thats the only human interaction I get.. my parents don't care to talk to me ,im invisible at school no one even know im there, one time I was called absent when I was right there and didn't say anything and they still didn't see me... I'm in pain so much pain, idk anymore
