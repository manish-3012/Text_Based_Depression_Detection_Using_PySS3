I just tried commuting suicideI donâ€™t know how to feel or fucking think. Iâ€™ve been pondering the idea of offing myself for years and tonight I tied a belt on a bannister. I was listening to music and I was just leaning into the belt but my feet were still on the ground. I started to black out and the music sounded distorted and I snapped out of it and stood up. I donâ€™t know what to do or who to talk to please someone fucking help
