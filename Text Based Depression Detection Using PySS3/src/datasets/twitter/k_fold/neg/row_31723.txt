I fucking hate being a cowardConsidered ending it all this morning, so I left my house to do so. But my paranoia won, I went back home, and now my mother is frustrated as hell and wants me to take anxiety meds. 

I donâ€™t want to take meds. I feel that worrying keeps me safe. And if I have to worry myself into suicide in order to protect myself then so be it.

Iâ€™ll have to suffer for another six months or more until I can buy SOMETHING that is guaranteed to kill me, and fast enough. When that time comes, I wonâ€™t be a coward.
