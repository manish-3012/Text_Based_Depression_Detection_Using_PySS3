I gave up on life 5 years ago because Iâ€™m UglyIâ€™m  male, aged 30 (look younger) 182cm tall (1cm under 6ft) skinny af lanky with long legs etc, pale with a receding hairline and a kissless virgin (never touched a girl or even had more than a few words spoken to me by one)  So yea in the looks department itâ€™s over. I never leave the house and havnt since 2015. Between 2012-2015 I had a bar job,I had girls like me and I wasnâ€™t ugly then facially I had a pleasant baby face, with clear skin nice hair and I never was insecure a lot. I got older and ugly. I met some amazing people but also some horrors. Horrible women whoâ€™d call me ugly and treat me like shit for it and these were the staff and managers I worked with. The good looking guys could do no wrong and when they fucked up it was pinned on me so many times by a fat ugly overweight bitch. I know  that sounds mean but it isnâ€™t if you knew how she treated me to the good looking dudes. It was horrific 


 In the end I got fed up and left and havnt left the house since to let ageing hit me like a train.

â—¾ï¸(Before I had that job I had a job advisor for 6 months and she was the same, I was very quiet but also really polite and respectful never complained a word tried really hard to get a job with a good attitude and it got me nowhere, she was still snotty and bitchy with me and would totally ignore me if I asked her advice when I needed it.  but yet youâ€™d see other guys who could be aggressive and disrespectful but because they were hunky/manly and attractive sheâ€™d open up easily to them and be very nice with them and help them no problem. (She treated me differently because Iâ€™m Ugly. I never got over it ) This gave me trust issues) I had a crush on her too so that our cherry on top of cake with that)


 I do go out to work at football stadiums as a steward and thatâ€™s the same, women staring me down because Iâ€™m skinny like itâ€™s my  fault theyâ€™re fat. Other guys I work with staring at me with a â€˜wtf is thatâ€™ face and overweight short girls calling me a â€˜Mingâ€™ (whatever that means) itâ€™s great when say for example an older male will pass conversation to me and be very friendly and I think â€˜itâ€™s nice when someone looks past what I look likeâ€™. Itâ€™s funny how I succumbed to judging peopleâ€™s niceness to how they judge me on my looks or not. but there isnâ€™t many like that about. I eat to gain weight my face goes fat and rounder but thinner I feel better. Still hidoeus nevertheless. A comment on here once I asked about my hair one comment said â€˜heâ€™s clearly balding and hidoeus btwâ€™ and it got upvoted 17 times. I drink whiskey every night watching cartoons  and Iâ€™m starting to get chest pains. 

Also the only girl who ever liked me was in 2014 at work and She was gorgeous too. You should of seen her Instagram at the time it was fire. 
She worked in the bar with me. I was 24 then. I looked nice then. You should see me now itâ€™s depressing. Waking up every Morning crying through sleepy half shut eyes 

I basically live upstairs watching Netflix everyday and smoking weed in a house waiting to die while seeing other guys my age or younger/older have looks on their side and a life to go with it. Funny how most of them are cocky as hell and very arrogant and the girls love it. I have a friend whos like that heâ€™s cocky as hell and thinks every girls he walks past fancies him and you wouldnâ€™t believe how the girls love that persona on him too. 

Itâ€™s not about getting Girls for me, but I could care less about not getting sex tbh etc (even tho girls where I live are horrible and snotty unless youre a Chad) itâ€™s juts the restricted life I have because Iâ€™m ugly and seeing good looking dudes treated better even when theyâ€™re complete cocky arrogant assoles. 

Lookism man

Now I have a really bad incurable skin condition and my face looks worse than ever 

Just wants the nightmare to be over 


***I enjoy being asleep so much that I wanna die***
