IdkI should be so happy right now, but Iâ€™m not. Why canâ€™t I just have fun like my friends can? Why do I always feel so alone in crowded rooms and why do I always exclude myself on purpose? Why canâ€™t I just hang out with multiple people without genuinely wanting to kill myself every single time? People are just so much. I just want to cut everyone off and not think about them ever again. Or just not think in general. God I think so much. I hate thinking. The worst part is that my friends love me so much. Why do people love me so much? I donâ€™t even do anything. Sometimes I wish I was that kid that disappears into the background. But Iâ€™m not good at being her. I mean Iâ€™m partially really good at being her, until I make friends. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because I feel bad for dying. Thereâ€™s nothing keeping me going. Even though I love my close ones dearly, thereâ€™s just nothing in this life for me. Nothing makes me happy. Nothing makes me feel anything really. I just want to lock myself in my room and never talk to anyone ever again. That would be nice. Maybe I should just disappear for a while. Self made mental ward. But I get to keep my goddamn shoelaces. Itâ€™s a miracle I havenâ€™t cut myself in a while. I think I will again. I just crave it I guess. My arm is itching and I scratch it but it just doesnâ€™t do the same. This isnâ€™t a dumb metaphor itâ€™s actually like that. Maybe this year is the year I finally end it all. I donâ€™t think it will be, since Iâ€™m a huge pussy and I really canâ€™t do that to people. But a girl can dream I guess. What a sad thing to look forward too. I should be looking forward to the weekend with my girlfriend, our six month anniversary. Or to hanging out with my friends whom Iâ€™m literally with right now. I think I may start doing drugs and drinking too. Iâ€™ve been avoiding it for eighteen years now. I donâ€™t know how long I can hold it out anymore. I just donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. I really canâ€™t keep going like this. Iâ€™ve been like this for longer then I can remember. Itâ€™s so hard. Itâ€™s so fucking hard. Maybe this world just isnâ€™t for me. Thatâ€™s okay right? This society just isnâ€™t for me, and Iâ€™m so sick of trying to change it to be for everyone. Itâ€™s so tiring. Everything is so tiring. Waking up every morning is so tiring. I donâ€™t know what I can do to make life less tiring anymore. I just donâ€™t. I donâ€™t even want to die, I just donâ€™t want to wake up every morning anymore. I just donâ€™t want to have to think. I just want to be thoughtless and happy. Thatâ€™s all I want.
