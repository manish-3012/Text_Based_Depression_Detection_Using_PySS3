This is the second time I tried to kill myself let's see if it works.I just downed a lot of mouthwash which I know is not going to kill me but I also swallowed some Ibuprofen as well that might kill me. sorry that I failed you guys I don't want to die I just want the pain to stop I tried everything other than this I can't take it anymore I know this is selfish and I'm really sorry to everyone around me I just can't anymore. This is not a suicide note I won't die from this but it's the closest thing to death I can get. I almost got into a car crash on the way to church and I have never cared less about my life before I kinda wished It did hit me so I have a reason to die so early in life so my family won't blame themselves.
