Still doubting that I have depression 14M2 people from reddit told me that Iâ€™m depressed but honestly I still donâ€™t think itâ€™s true. I have days where Iâ€™m fine and ask myself if I really am fine and just faking it or if I just distracted myself for the whole day. But I noticed how everyday at some point, I would tell myself how it would be better to die at that moment. Today while on the backseat of the car going home from vacation I was thinking about how Iâ€™d like it if an accident happened and killed me before falling asleep. I stopped caring about my family. Basically everyday, I think of dying and killing myself at some point in the day. The answer seems obvious but I still think that Iâ€™m faking it to make excuses just to be lazy. And on the outside I look like Iâ€™m doing completely fine but in the inside Iâ€™m a mess. For hours that Iâ€™m fine feel like invalidates my depression. Then I would return to my cycle of doubt and sorrow. Iâ€™m confused of whether Iâ€™m just lazy or just like this because I have moments where Iâ€™m feeling completely okay but still have suicidal and depressing thoughts. I donâ€™t even know how a normal person even think anymore. Am I just being lazy and using it as an excuse? I want to know because I need to find out if I just need to stop this habit if Iâ€™m lazy or start seeking professional help if Iâ€™m depressed.
