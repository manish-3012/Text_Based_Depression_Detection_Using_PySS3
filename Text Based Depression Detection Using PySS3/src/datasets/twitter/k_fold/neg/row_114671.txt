If you have someone that you care about, specially if you have kids, PLEASE, reconsider and seek all help immediately.So hi, I'm not interested in commiting suicide ever, but it's a big subject in my life. My grandmother (54) did it 12 years ago, and her daughter, my mother(42), tried last month.

To be clear, my point it's not "oh, poor me, look what I'm going through", truly. I'm trying to tell (from my point of view) what happened to my family after my grandmother ended her life.

 When my grandma did it, I was 12yo, and was really close to her. Didn't get it at all why someone would do it. But my mom was never the same after that day. She blamed herself constantly, for not seeing something different, and not being able to help her mom. So she got really depressed. Didn't leave the bed, and cried all day everyday, for years. I was a kid, and started hating my grandma for what she did, because of what it did to my mother. Our family was a total mess after that. My mother has two siblings, and both tried suicide in these last 12 years. I'm not very familiar with every reason, since I was young at the time and they didn't share with me, but I know that was a big part of it. Her younger brother was the one who found their mother, and was the most traumatized one. It fucked him up for life. It fucked all of them for life.

Well, fast forward 12 years, when my mother (who seemed better these past years, but didn't talked about her feelings with anyone either, and refused therapy, even tho I asked her constantly to do it) hang herself, in the middle of the afternoon. My father had left the house to go grocery shopping, BUT, forgot his mask and came back super fast. And then found her, cut the rope, did CPR, and rushed to the hospital. She was in the ICU for 2 weeks, and the doctors said she wouldn't wake up, and if she did, she would vegetate for the rest of her life. But, she did woke up, and then started talking, and remembered us, and for some kind of miracle, was still all there. But she has tremors, strong ones, and in the beginning almost couldn't move. I was in the hospital with her, after she woke up, and she told me so many times she wished she was dead, I can't even count. She absolutely didn't care anymore.

I cared for my mother like I would for a baby, for a while. And learned on her, since I'm 23yo and never had a baby around. Learned to change her, feed her, turn her, clean her, and so on. When she left the hospital, we went back to their house, and then I taught my dad how to do some of this things with her. In the couple of weeks she was in the ICU, I stayed with him (I don't live with them since I was 18, me and him used to fight a lot) and found out things about her that I never knew. It's like I didn't know her. She never got better, she just pretend around me and others. To this day, we can't say anything about grandma. She never processed the death of her mother.

Anyway, since my grandmother died, she used to tell me she would never do the same, no matter what, because she knew how much it hurt, and how much it messed with her. But I think the pain was too much to handle, idk. When she came back, she refused to do any treatment, not wanting to do therapy, and kept saying she wished she was dead constantly. So we considered commiting her for specialized treatment for a while, and she freaked out, saying she wasn't crazy, and we were abandoning her (ironic huh) and we didn't love her, and that wasn't necessary because she was fine, and she would hate us if we did it. It didn't look like her anymore. But then again, seems like I never really knew her.

My dad, as most of us, not even remotely prepared for this, got scared of doing that, and thought he could help her alone. It's was a shit show. After a lot of conversations between us, I tried to convince him (and her) that she needs treatment, she isn't ok, and it won't magically get better. Physically, the improvements so far are remarkable. She's walking, feeding herself, even writing a bit, even with the tremors. But honestly, scares the crap out of me that she would do it again any day now. My dad is on 'suicide watch' 24/7 now.

She started going to therapy, and doing the treatments. She say it's getting better, and I hope it's true.

Anyway, after this long story, that still leaves me in the middle of fucking nowhere, I just wanted to say, to EVERYONE one who consider doing this as a form of scape, but specially the ones with children (grown or not) please ask for help. Try everything first. It may be the ultimate escape for you, but it's the beginning of hell for someone else, and someone you may care about very deeply. Some people just can't move on from this. My mom is one of this people.

So many people admire their mother, and their grandmother, and are inspired by them. Unfortunately, my mom did got inspired by hers. One of my greatest fears is to be like them when it comes to emotions, and my personality is very similar to theirs, and it's scary as hell. I'm inspired to be different, to break this chain, almost like a curse. I'm the only granddaughter who was old enough to understand a little what was going on, and I still have so many nightmares about it, 12 years later. The last month was hell on earth, and I'm well aware it's just the beginning. But I'm getting a chance to help my mother, or at least try. She didn't get that with hers, and she never recovered from this.

And just to be clear, I'm in no way saying that it's great to do it if you don't have kids. I'm sure your life could be way better in the future, and you do have people who care about you, and would help you if they get the chance. So ask for it. Don't give up on your life, please. It truly can be better than this.

And for those who have children, please know that for them, your end will be just the beginning of a world of pain. It's a lot of shit to deal with too. And it's not the kind of thing that gets better with time, for a lot of people.

For all the ones in a similar situation as mine or my mother's, I'm truly sorry you are going through this.

And for the ones considering suicide, I truly hope all of you get better, and feel better soon, and I hope you can be happier than you are right now, and see it very soon in your life.


Love, Bia.
