HeartbrokenHey everyone, I've been thinking long and hard about death all week.  I had my heart smashed into pieces last week and had more trouble getting over it that I did meth.  Not one to ever reach out for help but always one to offer it, I guess I'm gonna be okay but since I'm in that state of mind of heartbroken and dead inside but looking forward any way I figured I should offer help to anyone not quite there yet.

So if you're crushed by the one you loved and thinking about those dark thoughts; talk to me.  I'm obviously "a little" suicidal myself so I'm not promising I'll fix your head since I'm broke as fuck but I'd be happy to talk to anyone about that love that wasn't returned.
