I wrote this to a friend of mine who is, not really any longer a friend. So I suppose i should just put it here.I am not hopeful. I know that I will fall asleep again and wake up in a couple of hours scared and alone. I will get up and be stressed. I will go to school and be in pain and alone. I don't think they believe that I'm in pain. Something else ridiculous will happen too. Yesterday I had some really huge guy push me around, I was so terrified. That look in his eyes. Nobody did anything. I don't think you were right when you said I had grit. I get everything from those around me and without them I am hopeless. I know I will get up tomorrow and feel the same way and when I go to sleep I will wake up scared and crying like I have every night for over a week and a half. I've never had so many nightmares before.  Probably related to that concussion but whatever I tried talking to my parents but they do not give a single fuck. They were just kinda like if they continue for another week we will see. I am just tired, alone and hopeless. I do not belong anywhere or belong with anyone. I just am alone and tired.

For the context of the middle part I am 6' 3" or 6' 4" and 210lbs or so.
