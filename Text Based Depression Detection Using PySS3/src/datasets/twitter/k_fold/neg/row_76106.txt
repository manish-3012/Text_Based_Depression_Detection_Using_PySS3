Should i kill myself?I ask because i have a disability, autism. Andm anly autist are unemployed and on welfare. Many of them are atleast one in the lifetime homeless. I don't even have a decent education.  Thats the reason i want to commit suicide, dont want to end up homeless, don't want to end up on welfare or in a shitty job, dont want to end up poor. But because i'm disabled i will have no other choice i think. And don't tell me life is great, life isn't great when you can'0t life a normal life, when you know you will always be poor, in the worst case even homeless. Why is suicide in this situation wrong?
