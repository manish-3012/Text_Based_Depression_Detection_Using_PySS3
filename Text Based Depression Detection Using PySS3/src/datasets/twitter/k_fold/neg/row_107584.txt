My fight is over. Best of luck to everyone on this page.
In 30 minutes I am going to hang myself. It has taken me years to find the courage. I have had  this planned for 8 years.  I am lonely. I have failed everyone I know. I am a disappointment and I'm reminded of it everyday. I've tried to hang in there but I can't take it anymore. Words can't describe how I feel right now. I don't even know what to say. My mind is made and I'm going through with this. Apologies for rambling. Stay safe everyone. Take care of each other and support one another in this life. One small action could save someone's life. Goodbye.
