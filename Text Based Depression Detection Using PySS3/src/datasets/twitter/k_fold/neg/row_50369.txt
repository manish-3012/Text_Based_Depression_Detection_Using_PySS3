I tried to buy a gun last weekI tried to buy a gun last week, but things didn't go as expected, so I bailed.  I have everything planned out so no one will know where I've gone and there will be no body to recover, but I'm too chicken shit to actually get this last part.  I hear too many stories (especially in this sub recently) about people having to go to the hospital in/voluntarily, getting police and authorities and everyone else involved, and that is the part that scares me the most.   Not dying, not disappearing, but *failing* and then being worse off than before because of it.  Fuck, even dying seems like it's too difficult.
