It's not meSo my mom has had depressive tendencies since she was young. She had a sad childhood of abuse and foster homes. I have noticed as I've grown up that she always uses alcohol to try and heal herself but it just makes it worse. She dated this guy for the past 4 years, and it was quite tumultuous. I told her she could find someone else thousands of times, and I've ALWAYS listened to her talk and talk about their issues. She hasn't had a job since 2001 and also has a knee injury (which I think she uses as a bad excuse to not do anything sometimes). Her boyfriend and her seem to be broken up for good now (finally) but she can't stop calling him or making me text him if he doesn't answer. She doesn't have anywhere to live because I am living with my friends in a month and she is being kicked out because the current situation with her landlords is that she can live there with a child (which I'm not anymore, because I turned 19) or if I'm in school (which isn't an option for me right now, financially). She thinks there is no life without her boyfriend and she isn't trying to find somewhere else to go. She said if nothing gets better by the middle of summer, she's going to kill herself definitely. I told her not to be stupid, and that I'd be an orphan practically (I don't know where my dad is). I have tried calling the police on occasions where she was in a drunken rage and they have done nothing. They once put her in a hospital because her boyfriend called them and she was saying suicidal things, and I was at work, so I had to leave work to get her out. I wish I left her there sometimes. She says I never listen to her, and that I'm leaving her and that she is alone all the time. I can't live with her because she causes me all this stress, and I have tried my best to talk to her. I feel like I have been her mother for the past 5 years. I just really don't want her to kill herself. I don't really know where else to post this. Any advice?
