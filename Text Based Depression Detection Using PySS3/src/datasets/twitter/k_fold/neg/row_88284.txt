high school shouldnâ€™t be like this.how the hell did it end up like this? Iâ€™m almost finished high school for fucks sake and I never would have thought Iâ€™d feel like this again. Feelings that I only had when my ex boyfriend abused me and raped me to no end and the loneliness and avoiding schoolwork and shit like this. I donâ€™t understand, I thought it could only get better. I thought my shitty episodes would get better and better.

I would feel this way every other day when I was with him, and for the year after that Iâ€™d have them every two weeks. I havenâ€™t had one in such a long time. How the fuck did I feel like this so often and not go through with killing myself? 

Who wouldâ€™ve thought school could make me feel pressured and stressed enough to bring back these episodes haha. And high school at that. If I kill myself, who the fuck is going to work on my groupâ€™s competition robot? Whoâ€™s going to be there when my boyfriend needs reassurance for his stress? Fuck. 

Why am I feeling this way? 

-Ap Physics

-Ap Computer Science

-I havenâ€™t hung out properly with my two friends since last March. I couldnâ€™t sleep all night looking over my phone and seeing that we used to document our adventures and now we barely have time outside of school to see each other let alone go on an adventure 

-Iâ€™m so FUCKING ENVIOUS OF THESE KIDS THAT ARE THE SAME AGE AS ME WHO DONT STUDY AND JUST KEEP HAVING FUN FUCK

-My fucking marks this year will determine my university admission, and I really want my average to be at least 90% but thatâ€™s clearly not happening because Iâ€™m here writing stupid irrelevant jumble when I could be studying 

-why the fuck am I not studying 

-holy fucking shit I just want ONE day to spend with my friends. PLEASE. Sure, we have holidays. Too bad those holidays are spent doing projects, or my friends have to do filming for their media course or I have to work on my competition robot for my mechatronics course. 

-I havenâ€™t had a single proper date with my boyfriend in such a goddamn long time. Two months? Fuck. It makes me so sad because I barely get to see him anymore. I miss napping during the day with him and hearing him snore in my arms. nowadays anytime we see each other we just relieve each otherâ€™s stress because we donâ€™t have time to do anything else. I remember we used to watch movies almost every week the few months after we met. We havenâ€™t watched a movie since the summertime, around July. We keep planning, but something always ends up coming up, and then the movie is out of theatres. 

-I miss having hobbies outside of school so much. I made a cheesecake for my friendâ€™s birthday tomorrow and I forgot how much I loved cooking. I havenâ€™t made anything proper since the summer when Iâ€™d cook me and my boyfriend a meal every lunch. I miss playing pc games. I miss oil painting. 

-jesus fucking christ I want to spend time with my friends, I want to spend time with my boyfriend, I want to be able to play games again. I havenâ€™t touched my fucking computer in months to play games. Iâ€™m in HIGH SCHOOL. this is nothing like high school musical haha. 

Iâ€™m not stressed. Iâ€™m just really confused as to why Iâ€™m having one of these episodes of despair even after Iâ€™ve gotten over everything. These episodes of guilt tripping myself into not committing suicide. 


I know that people would think â€œhigh school doesnâ€™t matter, marks donâ€™t matter in the long runâ€ because so many people have said that to me when I posted on my main about something less detailed. They matter RIGHT NOW to me. If they didnâ€™t matter in the long run why do people who fail courses end up working retail or fast food for the rest of their lives? 

Fuck I just need some sort of support. My two closest friends are feeling the exact same way, so why would I put this baggage on them? My boyfriend is stressed about university applications and gets off work at 11pm, and I donâ€™t want him to go to school for 6 hours, go to work for 7 hours just to come home to his girlfriend complaining and not supporting him. I need to support my friends and boyfriend because thatâ€™s what they always think I can provide. Iâ€™m not planning to change that. 

If you somehow made it here I appreciate it so much. Thanks for reading.
