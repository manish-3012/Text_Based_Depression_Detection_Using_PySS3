I will not eat for a long time. If Iâ€™m not happy while Iâ€™m skinny Iâ€™ll go.Iâ€™m so tired of this life. Iâ€™m 16 and so unhappy, I have been that for a long ass time, and no one seems to be out there to help me. I obviously canâ€™t help myself, otherwise I wouldâ€™ve done it a long time ago. I know people are gonna think â€œoh you have such a long life ahead of youâ€ and stuff, but Iâ€™m done suffering. Iâ€™ve grown really tired of it, and if thatâ€™s life, I donâ€™t really want to live.

Iâ€™m really unhappy in my body so Iâ€™ll give life a last chance and become really skinny. Thatâ€™ll mean I wonâ€™t eat for days. Iâ€™ll wait to eat once Iâ€™m skinny enough. If Iâ€™m still not happy then, Iâ€™ll probably take my own life. Itâ€™ll probably take a week or two not eating anything, ofc still staying hydrated.

Well, Iâ€™m giving life one last shot.
