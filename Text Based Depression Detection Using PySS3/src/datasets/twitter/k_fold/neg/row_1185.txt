During short episodes of dissociation, I always question life to the point of suicidal thoughts.I guess, even out of dissociation, I still think too deeply about life. There are some things that make this apparent world feel so fake, it disgusts me.

Yet I'm very scared of death, because I do not know what to believe. In this world, I'm simply another mentally ill human being hardly capable of emotion and appreciation. What does my existence contribute to? I'm empty and unmotivated, I could just sleep all day and stay in my happy little fantasy land, hoping I die in real life and stay there.

Of course, this is just one of my many issues, but I don't see a point in explaining.
