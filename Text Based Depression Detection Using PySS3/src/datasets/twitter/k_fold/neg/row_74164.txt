Thereâ€™s literally no point. Help?Iâ€™m in college and Iâ€™m failing my math class for the second time with no hope of redeeming myself

My GPA is going to go way down and I canâ€™t do anything and Iâ€™m going to lose my financial aid which is the only thing keeping me in college

All my dreams are dead. I wanted to travel one day. I wonâ€™t be able to do that if Iâ€™m homeless and on the streets because I work at McDonaldâ€™s flipping burgers because thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m good for

Iâ€™m passing all my other classes but this semester was supposed to save my GPA but thereâ€™s no way to fix me failing math and failing life subsequently

I just need to die. Can anyone help? I donâ€™t know if anyone can help. I donâ€™t want to die. I just wish I could achieve my dreams.

Everything hurts and Iâ€™m in so much pain.
