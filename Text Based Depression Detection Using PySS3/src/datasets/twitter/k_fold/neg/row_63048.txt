Jobs keep rejecting meI have been trying to get a job for 4 years and FINALLY I just got a call back from someone interested in an interview. I went to the interview and completely messed it up. It didn't even take them a week to decide, they rejected me within a day with a generic rejection letter. I'm already really suicidal and this just made it worse. I'm visiting family but im selfish and I cant take it anymore. Im going to kill myself
