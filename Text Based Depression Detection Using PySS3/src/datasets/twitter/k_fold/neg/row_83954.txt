How do I tell my mom?For me, suicidal thoughts have always been kind of numbing. Sometimes, Iâ€™ll feel nothing at all, but I have the desire to not exist. I know that suicide isnâ€™t the answer. Trust me. I just canâ€™t shake them. I think I have undiagnosed depression and anxiety... but how do I bring this up to my mom? Iâ€™ve been having periods where I want to die since I was in the 8th grade (college freshman now) but itâ€™s gotten so bad recently that Iâ€™ve flunked out of a class. Iâ€™m used to being a straight A student, so this feeling of failure is only making things worse. I just canâ€™t force myself to get out of bed and go to class. I come up with excuses for staying in a pitch black room all day... but I know that isnâ€™t healthy. I just donâ€™t know how to start a conversation with my mom or how to get help, and Iâ€™m scaring myself because Iâ€™m beginning to legitimately consider suicide as a way out. I just need help getting help.
