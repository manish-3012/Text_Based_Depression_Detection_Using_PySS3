Regret, missed opportunities and being a disappointmentSo I guess life hasn't gone that great. It could have been so much worse and in many respects I'm incredibly lucky; I have a loving family, a girlfriend, reasonable financial security (at least as financially secure as a 21 year old can be), and I have half decent job prospects with my education. But on the other hand I really can't take any more of this. The defining feature of the past 7 years has been mental illness, be it depression, paranoia/psychosis, anxiety or social withdrawal. I have no close friends really, I mean I have my girlfriend but she has so so so many more friends and problems to deal with. In the end I think people will probably feel a hint of relief when I die, because they will no longer have the burden of having to help me day after day. I just feel like every step of my life I've missed out on opportunities, everything from being a 9 year old too scared to go round to my friend's house (he had an older brother with loads of creepy toys - yeah it's pathetic I know), to being 15 and feeling too depressed to go on holiday with my family, to now being about to graduate from uni having made no friends and barely scraping through. I just know if I carry on I'm going to look back on a life spent dreaming away and disappointing the (very few) people who ever got close to me. 

I'm not going to do anything right now, but I can't really envisage a realistic way out of this, and can't stop thinking about just ending it all and not existing anymore. Anyone please please help me
