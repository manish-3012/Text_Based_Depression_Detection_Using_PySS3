GoodbyeGoodbye world, nobody cares about me, Iâ€™m a piss In the wind. If you say you care, youâ€™re lying and you know. Iâ€™m a useless nobody who will never accomplish anything. I am just going to leech off of my parents forever. I hate myself for being so useless. There is so much self hatred in me that any normal person would literally explode. Although now that I think about, this suicidal ideation is probably just a mood swing. I get mood swings a lot, like every minute is a new mood, which sucks because I can never be in one mood for a specific situation. Goodbye.
