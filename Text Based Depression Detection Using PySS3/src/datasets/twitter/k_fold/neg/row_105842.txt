I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself.First off, Iâ€™m on mobile so thereâ€™s my formatting disclaimer. 

I posted here before but deleted it. Iâ€™m back again. Iâ€™ve been going to therapy. Iâ€™ve been talking to people. But I still canâ€™t shake the desire to fucking end my shit. I even got $100 so I can go to the gun store tomorrow and pick up a weapon. Iâ€™m looking up logistics for after my death, like how to handle my student loans and credit card debt. Iâ€™m taking notes and starting to write a will. I have been fighting and trying for so fucking long. Iâ€™m exhausted. I donâ€™t know if I have anymore fight in me. Knowing that I could be done with all of this tomorrow is filling me with an excitement I havenâ€™t felt in so long. 

Iâ€™m so tired of living in pain. Iâ€™m tired of faking happiness every day. Iâ€™m tired of trying to date and always getting ghosted. Iâ€™m tired of finding reasons to get out of bed every day. I am just. so. tired. I want everything to stop. I want to stop feeling. I want to stop hurting. I just want it all to stop. And I have so many people that I could talk to, but I donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to be convinced to change my mind. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I need to be gone. I need to stop living. Not a single person wouldnâ€™t be able to bounce back. The world keeps turning no matter what. Iâ€™m not needed here. Iâ€™m just wasting space, and taking up resources that could be given to others. I canâ€™t wait to finally pull the trigger and be done with all of this.
