Anyone there?is anyone down to chat privately? Iâ€™ve been feeling incredibly depressed the last couple of weeks and started feeling suicidal again. I felt the same way for 3-4 years and I tried to OD on pills 2 years ago but nothing happened. I got better after being on anti depressants and seeing a therapist but these feelings from before are starting to come back up.
