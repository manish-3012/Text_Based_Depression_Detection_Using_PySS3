At the train station nowYesterday I had the strong feeling to just end it, but the bus to the station didn't come. Today I grabbed a bike and rode there. Am just watching the timing of the trains that could end it and where I should be.

I'll probably chicken out, but I'm trying to really push myself this time. Not a single day have I woken up and wanted to go trough that day.

Not that I believe that people here will change anything, as years and almost decades of 'help' have resulted in literally nothing.

My dad fully believes my problems started since I was 4 and his screaming and whatever shit he says is just something on the side. I should just demand to get pills that make me better and he tried everything he could. Except for maybe trying to be a decent emotional support.

No one will probably even read this, as there are dozens of posts without anyone ever reading them. That's the world. The idea of helping is there, but people don't want to do that. The world sucks in so many ways. A true shithole. And it will only get worse as value is put into money and power, instead of people.

You are nothing. You are only worthwhile to others as far as their benefit is concerned. Parents pretend that getting a child changes everything, but will never even contemplate that their behaviour is just as shitty as every person that isn't your parent.

For anyone contemplating it. Just remember: when you're gone, they'll start to show that they care. So in reality, they don't. They just care about their feelings. And when you kill yourself, only then do they need to ease their own feelings. Only then do they pretend yo care. Because there is nothing easier than pretending to care about something that never will be and which will never talk back.
