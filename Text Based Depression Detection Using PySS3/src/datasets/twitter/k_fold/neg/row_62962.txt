I've been having the bad thoughts...Need some advice about what to doHello all, I am a 21 year old female who is graduating in a month, and I've just been diagnosed as bipolar with psychotic features as well. I don't know if anyone can relate to this, but I've been feeling very strange lately. When i'm depressed , I feel like there is this inner force that drives me to want to kill myself. All I can do is think about is killing myself, and ways to do it and all the things I need to get done before I die.

I've had 2 different plans and I already got the materials I needed for one of them. But the weird thing is at times I get temporary relief from depression, and during these times I don't really desire death as much. I think about it, and I don't mind the thought of it, but I don't feel as strong of a drive as when I'm depressed. But when I'm depressed, manic, and when I get in mixed states, I get completely obsessed with killing myself. I don't really know what to do. I'm seeing a psychiatrist and a therapist, but the last time I disclosed information like this I got sent to the hospital. Do you think the hospital would benefit me? I'm sorry for all the rambling, thanks for just reading and any advice at all would be much appreciated.
