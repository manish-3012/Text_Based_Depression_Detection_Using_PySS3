Portland suicidalI posted about a month ago, about flying to Portland jumping from a bridge. I cancelled my ticket weeks ago. I'm still here, but now I know it was wrong to change my plans. I should've followed through. I gave into "hope," and I regret it.

Life will never get any better, only worse. I'm going through with my original plan.
