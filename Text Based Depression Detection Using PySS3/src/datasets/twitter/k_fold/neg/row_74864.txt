I'm under to much stress I'm scared to go to school and I feel like everything is hopeless. I can't handle this all in one week my gf left me for another guy and my friends all threaten to kill me if they see me for something I didn't do. I keep pretending I'm sick so I don't have to go and I don't know what to do anymore I have no one in my life anymore. I can't trust anyone cause I live in a foster home and they'll just give me a ton of problems to. I'm scared I don't want to live anymore I don't know what to do
