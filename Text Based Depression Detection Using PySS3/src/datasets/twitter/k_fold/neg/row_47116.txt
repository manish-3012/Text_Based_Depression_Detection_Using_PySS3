I just want to be done.I'm sick, I can't work, I depend on the help of others and I constantly feel like a burden to everyone I love.  I'm constantly thinking of suicide... not a day goes by where it doesn't cross my mind atleast 10 times. I think about how easy it would be for me to get super fucked up on edibles and drive my car into a wall going 90 mph. I just want to stop hurting... stop dealing with bullshit and feel like nothingness. I'm so empty and lonely all the time. I can barely leave my bed. I think my husband is starting to not love me anymore and I fear we will be breaking up within the soon future. I don't blame him because who wants to be married to someone whos sick all the time? Not only that but we're young he should be able to be with some cutie that isnt puking constantly. I wouldn't want to touch me with a 10 ft pole so. Im also in a living condition that I jusy.. really want no part of. Anyways I basically dont want to be here anymore.


Whoever is reading this... stay safe don't do anything stupid.
