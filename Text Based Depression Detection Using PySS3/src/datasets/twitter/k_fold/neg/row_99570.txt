Can't go on much more.My whole life I've been crippled by anxiety and depression or some form of illness. I was in hospital at age 6 because i wouldn't eat. They put me in a ward with a girl getting force fed because of anorexia. I started eating but I've always been underweight. I got bullied terribly in primary school i started bullying people because it stopped them bullying me. They used me to do the most horrible things. Eventually in high school even that wasn't enough they stuck chewing gum in my hair and beat me constantly. I moved schools and there i met friends from a very bad background. They where nice and never bullied i guess they knew a bit about what pain was. It was the happiest time of my life. Though i was in pain i did all kinds of crazy stuff did drugs, got in fights, met girls. Eventually though my depression and anxiety came back i just couldn't shake the feeling one day they'd all just abandon me and it'd happen again. The weed didn't help, somebody tried to take my eye out with a key and another school jumped up and down on my head leaving me half dead.

I've never been right since then. I couldn't party anymore i couldn't smoke weed. I lost all my friends they couldn't understand i was mentally ill. I left school at 17 and became agoraphobic it's been 7 years...

I've been to college the last 4 but i have nothing, no friends nothing. I'm 23 a virgin, no friends studying to help people but i can't.

I just can't go on. 7 years of no human contact outside of work. It's pathetic i'm disgusted by myself. I can't even look at myself in the mirror without wanting to die. I just can't do this anymore.  I leave the house i'm terrified i stay in and i'm going crazy with loneliness.

It's horrible i'm becoming bitter and angry. I've met people over the years with depression and anxiety and i'm genuinely hate it. They all talk about how hard it is, which i'm sure it is. But yet they talk about all the raves and parties they go to all there friends. It's like great they opened up about how hard there life is. But at the same time i'm supposed to feel better about them having so much life. I'm dead, i died already. If i could go back i wouldn't have made it past 17.

Idiot i always said it'd get better. 12, wait till 16 you'll have a life then, 17-20 it's coming. 20-25... Yeah i'm not going anymore. F that.
