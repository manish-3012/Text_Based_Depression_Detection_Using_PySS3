Telling someone I'm suicidal?I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, but if not, sorry.

People always say that if you're feeling suicidal, tell someone. I want to tell my friend about what I'm thinking, but I don't know how to go about it. We're best friends but we're both the type to deal with things on our own, and we rarely talk about deeply personal things such as this. I also don't know what I hope to accomplish by telling them, I just feel like someone should know.

So how do you go about talking about suicidal thoughts with someone who you know well but doesn't know this side of you? I don't want to burden them or make them feel awkward, but I haven't talked to anyone about this for years.
