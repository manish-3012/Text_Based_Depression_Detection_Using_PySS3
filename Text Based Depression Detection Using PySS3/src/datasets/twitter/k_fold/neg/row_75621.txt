Birthdays are hardIt's my birthday today. I tried to kill myself unsuccessfully last night. I'm 24 today.

I could put my suicide on childhood trauma, financial and academic worries, the awareness that I'll have lifelong mental health issues.

But at the end of the day it's the experience of now which I wish would cease. Being is too painful. There's a constant pressure in my head.

I'm still in hospital. They might discharge me tomorrow. Even if I tell them I'm suicidal they probably still will which would be good cos I want to leave and do it on my own terms. I'm tired of hospital and I can't go back to my life. I'm sorry.

Edit: coming to hospital has messed my life up. I've missed too much at University I'll have to defer the year. I might have to move back in with my family in another country since I'm not coping alone. I tried my best but I think I'm done.
