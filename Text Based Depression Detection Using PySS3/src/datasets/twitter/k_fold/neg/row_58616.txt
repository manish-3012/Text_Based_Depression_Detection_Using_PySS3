The world has given me one option and that is too kill my selfThe world and the people within it has punished me with eternal loneliness, even though I've done nothing wrong to anyone. I'm a great guy, funny, handsome but other people don't care about that for some reason. They'd rather ignore me and let me rot alone, fighting this never ending battle of whether I should kill my self or not. As the title says I don't want to die or kill my self, but it's clearly the only option I have left, I can't keep going on with this boring miserable life surrounded by shit people in a shit town. Nothing interesting Happens in my life, nothing at all interests me. NOTHING! The only upside of this life is that I get to wake up with a perfect body unlike 98% of people on Earth. I also suffer with social anxiety because of how other people treated me a few years back, I'm actually a really outgoing guy, but the experience I went through has scarred my brain and it doesn't know how to recover. I've been doomed from the start and it's all your fault! I don't deserve this, you do.
