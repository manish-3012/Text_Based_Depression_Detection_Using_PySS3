I can't do it anymoreI quit. All I do is lay in bed all day. All I do is lay in fucking bed. I'm so close to losing it. All my "friends" don't care. One of my friends only ever yells at me, and the other never talks to me. The one who never talks to me has also stolen every single girlfriend I've ever had away. Not that they were 'mine'. But I was theirs. And he just took them away. He would tell them I'm gay, out he'd pretend to be me and insult them. Then he'd jump in. I don't know where this is going. I'm just going to fucking end it. I love you mom and dad, and my two pups at home.
