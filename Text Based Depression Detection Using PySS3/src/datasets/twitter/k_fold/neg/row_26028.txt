Walked by the hardware store, having to resist the urge to buy a rope and hook to hang myselfI am in pretty desperate need.  I wrote another note but the short summary is I had a penis fracture about 2 years ago that left me with chronic pain.  I broke up with my gf about 6 months ago and have been trying to just get through all of this.  The pain of the breakup as well as the physical pain from my injury are just starting to become overwhelming.  I am starting to feel the pain is just too much to handle and the thought of death is starting to feel more like a relief than a fear.

Will someone please talk me out of doing this.  I have such a strong urge to go and buy this rope and start to learn what I need to do to make this work.  I simply can't cope with what's going on anymore.
