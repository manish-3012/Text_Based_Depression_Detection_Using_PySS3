I didn't expect to still be hereI really thought today was the day. I've felt so low for the last month. Yesterday I knew I'd have the opportunity today and I decided I'd do it. Suddenly I felt calm and optimistic. But in the end I didn't do it. I tied the rope and I must have spent three hours sat there looking at it. I felt calm, but I guess I'm just not quite there yet.

I'm still here but so are my problems. I've been hit hard this year with three huge issues. My health is bad at the moment and that makes everything ten times harder. Work is toxic and my boss is unsupportive and I'm thinking of just quitting. And then I have a serious legal issue hanging over me which may or may not turn into something.

It's all just too much and it feels like I'm delaying the inevitable.
