Torn apartMy gf (we were almost 3 years together) broke up with me. She still loves me and cares a lot about me. I'm so torn apart I really want to kill myself. I don't want to live like this. But I know if I kill myself she'll suffer even more then I did. So I can't but I really want to. wtf am I supposed to do? I know heartbreak is a shitty reason for suicide. If she didn't give a flying fuck I would've been gone by now.
