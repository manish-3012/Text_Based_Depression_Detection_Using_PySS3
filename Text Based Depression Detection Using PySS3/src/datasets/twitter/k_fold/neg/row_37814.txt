HateI hate you. Yeah, you. You stupid sycophants with your freeze dried advice and your pathetic attempts to try and relate to me.

 If I died right now, you wouldn't even realize. I could be on Mars for all you know. I'd just be a body on the mountain of corpses before me.

You probably have some "philosophy" you try to live by. Something that makes you a tad more interesting at parties. Buddhism-lite. Christianity when it suits you. Atheism as an excuse.You have no clue what the future holds, and all it does is help you fall asleep at night.

I hate myself. I hate looking in mirrors. I've been told I'm worthless by people who should never have a negative thought against me. I have no talents, nothing that gives me happiness.

Putting people down helps.

I've been in college for almost four years and I've got nothing to show for it. I'm a sophomore by hours. LOOK AT MY FAILURES

I hate my girlfriend. She's never had to drop a class. She never failed a test so HANDEDLY that your professor makes a comment about it in class SHES NEVER HAD HER OWN FATHER TELL HER HOW SHE FILLS HIM WITH DISGUST

It's all a joke 

goddamn it I tried I tried to be better I wanted to be proud of myself like I was

you dont know me. Think about how many people walk by you in a day.  You cant help any of them with your fucking cat photos or your "meditations" or whatever BULLSHIT you tell people

My father would be happy. He'd see it as if he was cutting his losses; he'd be able to make all the money back that i wasted

I don't give a shit anymore 

Thursday. I always said I'd die on a Thursday
