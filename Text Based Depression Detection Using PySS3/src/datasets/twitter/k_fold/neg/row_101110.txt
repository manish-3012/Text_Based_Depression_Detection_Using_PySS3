Felony charges after my attempt 6 months ago.. 6 months later.. I'm in an even darker placeI've struggled for a long time with fantasizing over not existing. I do not know where it stems from. It can come, and it and go. At times it becomes so bad and the ball rolling so hard in the direction of death, I am saddened knowing it is already too late.

I have tried ssris. Snris. Maois. Tryciclics. Lithium. Benzos. Bipolar meds. Raising testosterone levels. Fuck all of that stuff.

I don't necessarily know where these thoughts stem from. I've had 3 serious attempts in my life 

The last I was profusely bleeding from a self inflicted knife wound to my kneck (corotid) girlfriend called 911. SWAT showed up. Shot me twice . Had consumed a gallon of alcohol, 50 aspirin, 100 1mg Clonazepam, on top of the knife wound and bullets. 
Came to naked on a cell floor. I truly believe I may now be in hell, and did in fact die that day. Maybe fall down some fucking rabbit hole or something.. branched into some new universe or reality and dead in the last. I'm not sure.

I somehow lived. was held in solitary for 37 weeks and convicted of multiple charges one of them a felony..  it is a crime in the United States to make an attempt on your life. I was never hostile towards my girlfriend or officers. One of the charges related to domestic violence and hnlawful use of a weapon, in that by cutting my own neck open (along with the other stuff) around my partner I am a woman abuser, and only looking to traumatize her.

Held.in maximum security as well. Talk about salt over a raw wound.

I took a shit deal because I was going to be successful with one of my many many dozen of attempts in a cell. The only good thing about it is it allowed me to get off booze. That's also the worst part about it.

And now, I'm still breathing, still in the same place I was the day I  describing many months ago. I have been in hell since then. Shocked that i am here. Questioning whether I even am.

As a felon I am now constrained even further. Yess this really happened. I hate my country and the judicial system. 

Jail? It should've been psych. 

I actually have a trust fund (I'm 34) and have earned enough to retire now on a comodrtsble 150k a year. I have no debt and flat own my 4200sq ft home. And that figure will go up as I age. I am able to date women who are not only attractive but have serious careers going for them. But to me, neither of these things changes or fix the way I feel inside and the sometimes and often unwanted, intrusive suicidal ideations.

I almost pulled it off again tonight. I'm choosing to post here rather than try again and at the same time wondering why I'm doing that 

I am alone because I have created that reality for myself..I want to be totally isolated, but I want company at the same time. I am perplexed by this.

Not sure how this thing goes, new to Reddit always known of it. Ultimately I want to live, the problem is far too often I do not, and a serious attempt happens. I will say criminalizing my last one has been my worst nightmare. I can't believe it.

Maybe I'll try shock therapy. Ketamine treatments. Run PET scans. 

After my hospital recovery and being moved to a cell I ate my own feces hoping to go into septic shock . That didn't work. I took my head to a concrete wall several dozen times until my head was split open I knocked myself unconscious and bleed out all over a jail floor in the nude. Woke up alive with medical and LEO staff around. Somehow.

I worry that a 38 to the skull would richocet at this point and harm an innocent neighbor. Really I believe this.

I just want to be happy. Even if it is just here and there. I do want to live , but I don't equally. One will override the other and I either make it through the day or end up in a hospital in ICU, or jail . Justice.
