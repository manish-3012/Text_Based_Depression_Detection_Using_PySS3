Please.Darkness starts to seep in as my walls break, the walls that have kept me sane these past few years. Truth is i'm so damn tired. I'm drowning in insecurities, anger, envy, sadness. What once made me happy does no justice for me anymore. What once were my goals seem unreachable now.

I want to live. I do. But that thought wavers when everyday i'm finding it harder to see a reason for me to keep living. I feel that i'm just a nuisance to everyone.
