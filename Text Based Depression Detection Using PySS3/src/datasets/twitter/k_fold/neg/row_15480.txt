Y'all I just wanna fucking dieI can't bring myself to do it because it'll devastate my dad. My mom died when I was a kid and my dad practically raised me. But god I'm so tired of this routine and it's only ever going to get worse and worse, I don't want to slave away at a corporation for the next 40 years, I don't want to have to fight off my anxiety every waking minute, I'm so tired of hating myself and of always seeing how truly pointless and stupid everything is. I hate how brain-dead I feel when I'm actively involved in society but I also hate the realization of the absurdity of everything when I'm alone. I don't even WANT to be normal and happy. I just wish I was never born.
