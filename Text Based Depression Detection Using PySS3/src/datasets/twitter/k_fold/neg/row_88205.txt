I cant go on like this. It hurtsIts been four years since my suicide attempt, and I told myself that day: "Why not five more years, see if anything changes." And I turned back into the self isolated creep. Every day, after every interaction, I can only think; What is wrong with you, you dumb fat PoS. I push people away, then I get sad that Im lonely. 

Its sickening really. Well, I am obviously a defect human, doing stupid stuff is a part of it. My time is nearing its end, I dont want to live in agony anymore, I just want the pain in my chest to go away..
