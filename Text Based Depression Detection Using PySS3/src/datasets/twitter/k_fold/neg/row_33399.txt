Why is suicide such a bad thing?I know the arguments against suicide: its a rough time, look for things to make you happy, you have a lot of potential, etc, etc. But what if someone just wants to end it just because that's what they want. Why does anyone have the right to stop them? Personally I find it a little insulting for people that want to end their lives and cant do so easily. They have to do it in painful ways with the possibility of a failed attempt and getting brain damage or live with the stigma of being a suicidal person. Luckily I dont have to work so hard to get the appropriate materials to end my life easily but it just pisses me off to read about people that have to hang themselves or other horrible methods. 

Look I know its going to hurt my family but at this point I feel dead inside no matter who I'm with and I dont think I should be on this planet just because it will cause a little less hardship on other people. 

Anyway I'd love to hear you opinions on this. I dont really want to talk about my situation, thats not the point of this post so I will not respond to those types of comments. I've posted before that I'm not asking for help but I am genuinely curious what you all think.
