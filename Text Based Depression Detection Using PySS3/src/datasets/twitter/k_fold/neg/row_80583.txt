I [22 M] have been seeing my fiancÃ© [23 F] for about a year now, and she told me she plans on killing herself within 5 years.Removed from /r/relationships so though I'd ask here.

I was talking to my fiancÃ© last night about kids, where we'd like to live, etc. She told me she doesn't think she'll be alive by then, that she will have committed suicide. I asked her to elaborate. She told me she's been dealing with severe depression for almost 12 years now, and the sudden death of her best friend a year ago pushed her mental health to its limits. The shittyness of the world also seems to affect her mental health. She has traveled a fair bit and the stuff she's seen further depressed her.


This has come up before, but I didn't know it meant she was counting on killing herself within a 5 year period. I asked why she said yes to my proposal if she didn't plan to live beyond that, she said something along the lines of life is short. I take her seriously because beyond the consistent depression she's had for years, the sudden death of her childhood best friend last summer destroyed her, and I believe it makes her think her life is worthless. 

My reaction to this was to tell her I'm here for her, in her corner, etc. I basically think I should plan on supporting her unconditionally.

**TL;DR:** FiancÃ© thinks she'll kill herself within 5 years because of chronic severe depression. I want a long, fulfilling life with her.

How do I approach this?
