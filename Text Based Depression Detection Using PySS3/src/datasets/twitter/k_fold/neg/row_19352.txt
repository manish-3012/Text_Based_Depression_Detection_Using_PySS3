Inside looking out.Sitting here while the world around me goes on as if my mind is at war with itself is a torture i cant really discribe.
Listening to my wife and daughter talk and laugh as i sit here dying inside is torture.
Robin Williams made is 63 years, how did he make it so long?
I am 45, thats 18 more years...
I am sorry to vent but i have no other outlet. 
Gets harder everyday.
