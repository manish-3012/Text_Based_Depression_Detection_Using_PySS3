"Are you suicidal"How do I answer that honestly? I have daily suicidal thoughts and feelings of wanting to hurt myself. I had a freak out at a "mental health recovery college" and wanted to go home(and they let me) but had to give me a risk assessment asking if I had thoughts of suicide and self harm which I did but how do I say yes to that.. Its a very valuable question... Also my brain does this thing when someone comes I to my space with a question like that I go numb and there is nothing but moments when I leave it all comes back... Makes it extremely hard to seek help.. Maybe I'm just to damaged.
