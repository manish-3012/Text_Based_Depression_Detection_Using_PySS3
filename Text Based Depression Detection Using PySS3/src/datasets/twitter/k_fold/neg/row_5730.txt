Beaten, abused and alone. 26mMy childhood was hell. I've been attempting suicide on/off for 18 years. Every time I try to move forward in life, people around me just try to tear me down. I've got permanent injuries in my jaw and I've never met anyone who's even tried to be there for me. I guess I'm just posting here in the vain hope of not feeling alone for a little while before I head to a VAD-legal country to end my suffering.
