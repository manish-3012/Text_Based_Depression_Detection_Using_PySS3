Please talk to someone verbally when you're in need, or join my discord support group serverHi, Just thought about making a support group on discord, please feel free to join, and come and talk to me or others that may or may not join. I swear on the cosmos to never judge you on your beliefs or actions, never say annoying bullshit stuff like "there there, chin up, everything will be fine" when I have no idea what I'm talking about, and will try to the best of my ability that others do the same.
