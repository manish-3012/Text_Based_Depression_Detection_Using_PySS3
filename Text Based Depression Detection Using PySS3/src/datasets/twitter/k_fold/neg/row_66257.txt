Eh.I don't know anymore. I don't know what I'm looking forward to. The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is I don't have a place where family could stumble upon my body. I guess if I was desperate enough I'd overcome my driver's anxiety for one day and just... go somewhere but. How would I even do it? I guess it's just too much of a hassle to find the best way. 

So I just work 40 hours a week to pay off my student loan, think about buying a house after, and realizing my depression will eventually get the best of me and I won't clean/be too tired to shop for food and eat/enjoy myself any way. After that tho? Just work until I retire? If I ever can? If I don't fuck up and get despondent and get fired like in the past? 

I wish I could kill myself but I feel like someone would catch me like last time. The hospital they sent me too was worse than dying. I desperately want to just disappear. I don't feel like getting help again because psychiatrists are always booked and I've never found a psychologist that doesn't make myself feel pitiful and worse. It's already a drag to push myself to work. I just sit here, stare at the wall after work and hope the area I live in explodes. All I know is if I can work up the energy to swallow a bunch of pills while alone and they are available, I would. (I'm pretty sure shit in my cabinet would put me in the hospital with damage... not actually end it...) I'm just done with living. I want life to stop.
