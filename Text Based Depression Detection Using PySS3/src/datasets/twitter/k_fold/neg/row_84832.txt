I always hated my life, but at 15 was the worst so I set a deadlineI don't want to talk about my life a lot but I must say it wasn't enjoyable I know People have had it worse than me and they endure it but im not really strong I give up easily

Well the point for a few things that happened at 15 I tried to kill myself and my family well my mom was horrible angry at me she slaped me a few times and said I was Ungrateful for the life she gave me and "what would my friends think of me" mr brother didn't care and said that if i do it o should do it dar form his room and my dad just told me that I can't do it till im 18 because I he can go to jail since im a minor and the police would think he was abusing me

So I set a dealine that if by 20 I still didn't have a single person I can consider a friend I would do it, the thing is  im 18 the time keeps going and I don't know what to do im not really sad as I was before but I don't feel happy at all I live as if life was dragging me around

The only love I have felt is in the form a Pet can give so I learned to love animals a lot but I still feel empty i don't know what to do im starting college in a few months and I feel like is my last chance to make friends but being the way I am and how I look keeps me form doing anything I don't even feels sad anymore but I don't wanna go feeling like I didn't tried hard enough
