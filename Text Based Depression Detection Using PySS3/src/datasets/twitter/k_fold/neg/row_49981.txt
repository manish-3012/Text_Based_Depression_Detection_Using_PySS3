My addiction broke another relationshipI was in love with this girl.Damn, she was amazing. It was the first time someone made me feel like I truly didnâ€™t need drugs. 
I ended up telling her about my addiction and how I wanted to get better. She didnâ€™t take very well. I donâ€™t blame her.
Itâ€™s not the first time my addiction cut a relationship. 

For quite some time I was depressed, I was addicted to drugs, but I always believed I had at least SOME value.Iâ€™m not ugly, Iâ€™m funny, I try to care about people and animals. Iâ€™m a loving partner in my relationships.Iâ€™m always trying to make people feel good about themselves. I always thought I had some worth, even if it was small.

Over the past months, I donâ€™t believe it anymore. Iâ€™m finally worthless.My addiction robbed everything I had.EVERYTHING.
My family doesnâ€™t like me.My exes hate me.  My friends avoid me. Even my sister, which I spent my whole life trying to take care of, now see me as a loser.Itâ€™s been over a week since she talked to me, or even looked at my face. 
I have no job anymore, failing in college, Iâ€™m fat, depressed, maniac. I disappear for days on end. My mom feels so sad for me. I used to be her little bright boy. Today I literally had to hear my mom getting in my face and yelling that I am a coward, a liar, a druggie. She was one of the few people left that still tried to help me. I have run out of people.I have no friends anymore, no one . They canâ€™t be near me, they canâ€™t help me anymore.

I think Iâ€™m getting to the end of the line.There is nothing more left. Thatâ€™s it, I wasted my whole life.Everything my mom build for me, everything people invested in me is gone. 
Iâ€™m nothing.Iâ€™m worthless. And itâ€™s all because of my actions.Iâ€™m just suffering the consequences for the shitty person I was.
