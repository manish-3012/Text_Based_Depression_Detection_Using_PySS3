What is the pointEven if by some miracle I get healthy and happy or even just capable of leaving my fucking house this has ruined me. It took everything away and pushed me into a bottomless pit. Even if I went back to exactly how I was before which I can't even remember at this point I'd have to fight for years to achieve even the most basic things. My life is ruined, seemingly permanently. I can't hit rock bottom because there is no bottom to this hole. I wouldn't want to continue even if I got healthy. Everything is shit and I've lost everything I care about. Just waiting around to die.
