I need advice SW, I think my mom might be suicidalShe's the only one I have left. My father died almost two years ago and left us in big financial debts, not his fault though, mistakes were made in the past and that man worked his ass off 'till the last minute to keep everything relatively normal. He was always in charge of finances too, and now my mom has to be the one to take care of things, even though I offer help, things are pretty simple: bills, credit payments, gas, school ect. Nothing more, nothing less. 

It's gotten difficult though. We're trying to sell the house because there's so much money needed in general maintenance, and it all started breaking down at the same time, we just don't have enough money for everything. She's getting more and more anxious and edgy lately, saying how we won't make it, how we'll soon have nothing to eat, how we'll freeze to death. The truth is, we have a big family that would be more then glad to help, but my mom won't even hear about it because they've helped us enough in the past. I tried telling a few relatives about my fears, but they just say "it's not that serious, it'll pass, let it go" but I can't. I know I'm partly to blame, I got broken up with by a long term boyfriend and have been going through hell, talking and crying to my mom for the past few months. She's been too depressed lately, constantly yelling and berating me and I'm scared. She always says when she starts crying that "she's old and alone now, her life is over anyway, and the only thing that has her going is taking care of me and my sister". My sister is almost a married woman, I'm 21 and in school, and the only reason I haven't moved out is her, but I can't stay home forever. I tried staying calm and supportive but I'm the kind of person who can't stand constant sadness, I just can't, so I get depressed too every now and then, I feel I'm doing the opposite of helping. I've talked to her but she assures me she's OK.

I don't know what to do, it might just be healthy sadness and anger in the situation we're in and I'm exaggerating, but then again it might be more than that. Any advice on what to do, how to act? Thank you for reading.
