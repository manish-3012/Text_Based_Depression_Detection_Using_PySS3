i overdosed on tylenolyesterday i took 4000-4500 mg of tylenol (i canâ€™t remember exactly how much) impulsively as a suicide attempt. iâ€™m now regretting it and feeling terrible about what i did. iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts in the past but i never acted on them until now.  
yesterday i was very fatigued and had abdominal pain, along with reduced appetite and nausea. today i feel a little better, but i still have abdominal pain and i believe my legs and stomach are swollen. iâ€™m trying to drink 3-4 liters of water today so i can possibly filter it out of my system. 
iâ€™m a 15 year old girl and iâ€™m at a normal weight.  am i gonna be fine?? iâ€™m scared to tell my parents
