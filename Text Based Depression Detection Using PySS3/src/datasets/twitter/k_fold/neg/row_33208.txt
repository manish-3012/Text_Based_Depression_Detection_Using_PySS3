I wrote my suicide note today.The day started out okay, and I (f) really had no intention to kill myself this morning. The day went really well actually, until late at night. My partner (f) reminded me today that my attitude makes everything â€œnot worthwhileâ€ and I realised that all Iâ€™ve ever done my whole life is caused people pain. She told me this over a minor squabble over what movie to watch, and I just realised that my life is worth nothing. 

While she dozed to a post Xmas day movie, I read a pro-suicide website Iâ€™ve been visiting since 2007 and decided on a method. Usually visiting the sit calms my nerves and I realise that I donâ€™t actually want to die... but today was the last straw. Today, reading the site made me want to go through with it, and then typed out my suicide note: 

Thereâ€™s not one person Iâ€™ve ever made happy. I used to think I wanted just one person to love me, but now Iâ€™ve realised that nobody can even bring themselves to not hate me. 

Iâ€™m not being dramatic when I say that I ruin everything. Iâ€™m told this constantly now, and I was told it as a child as far back as I can remember. I ruined almost every day as a child, and canâ€™t remember one happy moment. As an adult. I continue to bring misery to those closest to me. 

I would love to just set everyone free from the situations the find themselves stuck in with me. My death can only serve to unlock happiness for everyone who knows me and the monster that I am.
