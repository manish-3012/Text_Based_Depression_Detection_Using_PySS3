I'm not okay.I've lived with depression pretty much my whole life, and in the past 8 or so years anxiety has been a problem for me too. Before I left the house for work this morning I was already feel both pretty bad.

I ended up putting on my fake practiced customer service face and made it through the work day. Then I got home and it got worse. I went to pay a couple bills, and the first thing I see before paying any bills is that my credit card is over drawn by a couple hundred dollars. Between having to make a payment on my card, and the bill I was actually going to pay, I'm completely out of money. I just got paid, I don't get paid for two weeks, and I will be out of town for a work trip on pay day without direct deposit, so I'm completely broke, have bills that are due before my next pay check, and my next pay check will get to me late.

My credit card has been a blessing and a curse for me. The only reason I'm under a mountain of credit card debt is because I was in a bad place and needed to use it or not have a place to live or food. I'm glad I had it when I needed it, but it's so impossible to get out from under. 

I don't know how I'm going to survive the next two weeks. I'm at the lowest point I've been at in a very long time. I know everyone has money issues, and no one wants to hear about mine. I can only take so much for so long. I've been under crippling debt for over a decade now. Every time I start to get under it something else comes up. I'll start getting my bills down a bit then my car dies. Oh, there goes another couple thousand. A family member dies, and I get some inheritance, I can make a huge payment towards getting out of debt. Oh, my car dies again. All of that money I got goes to buying a replacement. 

Money isn't my only problem, but it's the one that's likely to break the camels back today.
