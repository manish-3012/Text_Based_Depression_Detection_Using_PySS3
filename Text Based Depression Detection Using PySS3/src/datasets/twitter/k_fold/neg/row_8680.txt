i came so very close to ending it alli remember this so vividly. this was months ago, before the pandemic or anything.

i just got home, was still in my school clothes, still wearing my shoes. my dad was in the garage, working on something. i won't go into details, but i came literally one move away from killing myself. if i made that one, slight movement, i could have done it. i could have made it all go away. i literally got an intense feeling in my body, knowing how close i was to dying.

but i heard my dad make some loud noise from the garage and i thought about it. and i remembered suddenly when my brother got sick, and how sad my dad was because my brother inherited it from him. i remembered how i was sitting in the living room and i heard him say to my mom, really sadly, "I'm sorry." and i remember how my mom told me later about how he cried.

never before or since have i heard or seen my dad cry.

and i kept thinking about how he would hear a noise and walk in and see me dead and i thought how *fucked up* that would be to do to my dad, to make him see his daughter dead in the kitchen and i stopped and ran up to my room and pushed it out of my head because i had homework to do and i couldn't keep thinking about it.

part of me hates myself for backing out when i was so close to ending it all and going to Heaven or wherever the souls go when they die. but part of me still feels like i made the right decision, even now, when i still want to die so badly because at least i didn't traumatize my dad. and then another part of me isn't even sure if it matters because i'll probably kill myself some other time anyway.

i don't know what i'm even doing, i just had to get this into words instead of holding it in.
