passively suicidal stateI'm pretty much constantly passively suicidal and have been for a number months; it's related to difficult life circumstances &amp; thus I can't see things changes anytime soon.  I don't even know how to talk to anyone about it anymore - people only care if you're at an acute risk.  Talking about it doesn't help either &amp; even if a conversation makes me feel a little better it's only for a moment but nothing's changed and post-conversation I'm left feeling even more empty &amp; that person will go back to their regular life &amp; it'll be another few weeks or so again before someone checks in on me. I don't have a regular life to go to. I just exist in this pit of pain that people occasionally acknowledge but don't understand. I also can't keep talking about being passively suicidal with the few people I trust as the topic's been exhausted and it doesn't serve for anything except to make me worry about alienating people through constantly burdening them. They can't relate, they can't advise and this just makes me feel even more lonely. I'm just so tired, the pain exists as a constant feature that I can't cope with; I feel like something has to change either I die or things improve yet I just remain in this state of despair. I don't know how to do it. I don't want to do it. I don't want to die and I don't want my current circumstances to extend into a continued living of this existence. I don't know how to continue on but at the same time know I'll have to &amp; I feel so trapped. I'm not really sure why I'm writing this, I guess I want to feel less alone right now.
