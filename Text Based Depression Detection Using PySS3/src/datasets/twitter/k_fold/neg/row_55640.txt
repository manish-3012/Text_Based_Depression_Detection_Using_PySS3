Tired and Found Solace in Suicidal ThoughtsThis isn't really new to me. I imagine killing myself in different ways. I don't have a concrete plan but the outline kind of goes like this. Buy a gun, drive far away and walk into a forest and find a nice spot to return my body to the earth. Here are some problems; I fail or quit at everything I attempt. I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happy. I don't trust anyone because I always think of the evil in everybody. My mind goes on autopilot whenever I talk to people in person and I hate touching other people and when other people touch me. There are more than that but I think you get the idea.                I probably have a mental disorder other than depression. I never have gone to therapy or take medication for anything. I don't know what I want, maybe someone here can say something that might help me.
