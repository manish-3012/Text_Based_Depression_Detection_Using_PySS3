I'm honestly not a good person and don't enjoy being alive. My death shouldn't be a tragic thing at allI'm gonna need people to stop loving me. The only reason I have neither killed myself nor told my family/friends about the awful shit I've done is because I'm not trying to hurt them. But on a personal level I don't really enjoy existing and would prefer to not do it anymore. It's not even like I'm an asset to society where you could make the egalitarian argument that the benefit of me living is greater than my own pain. This whole situation is ass
