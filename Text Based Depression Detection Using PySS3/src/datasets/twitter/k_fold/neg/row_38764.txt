When I kill myself I want people to see itI want to jump off a bridge in front of people or say shoot myself. I feel invisible, unacknowledged, misunderstood. This is my way of saying "fuck you" to the world and finally getting some honest attention. All I am is a person that wears a mask and pretends to be okay. I don't care who I hurt, cause no one cares about me. In fact, I want to hurt people. Maybe then people will wake the fuck up and realize we're going south and have been for a long time. This world is so fucked up it's beyond repair. It's fucked up by design and there is no hope for it. There will always be suffering, and the universe and humanity will always be so cold and callous that it doesn't give a jack shit if you die and suffer horribly. This is a free for all. People who are happy don't care about those who aren't. I mean absolutely nothing. You mean absolutely nothing. Having a heart, having emotions, is just a surefire way to drive yourself crazy. The universe and nature is the antithesis of our sense of morality. Maybe psychopaths exist because it's actually better to not give a single shit about anyone but yourself.
