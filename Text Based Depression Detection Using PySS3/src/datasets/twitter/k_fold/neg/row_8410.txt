Iâ€™m probably gonna kill myself soon.I canâ€™t do this anymore. Even when I try, my brain wonâ€™t stop antagonising me. Everything hurts. I feel sick and tired. I canâ€™t see how any of this could get better. The fact of the matter is for some people, it just doesnâ€™t. And Iâ€™m one of those people.
