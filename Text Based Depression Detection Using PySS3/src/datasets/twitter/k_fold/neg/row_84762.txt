RantJust ranting - no one needs to waste time reading this. 

I believe I am one of those people who just can't get a good deal in life. Everything was stacked against me. Things only go from bad to worse. And all my possibilities are just bad ones - if this was not personal, I would marvel at how imaginative life is at screwing me. 

I am in my 30s now. I was once young too. I have seriously wanted to die since I was about 11 or 12. Held on. And on. And on. Naively I hoped that things would 'get better'. 

There's no hope. My life is over. I am not one of those people who can turn things around in their 30s. Like most people in my position, I'm tired, fed up, and hopeless, having persevered for 2 decades and having achieved nothing. 

I really wish I could kill myself. I wish I had no responsibility towards my family. If only I hadn't waited this long, if I had known in my teens or 20s that I would end up like this, so many 'if only's.
