It's not that my life is bad or anything like that(I explain in the post)(English is not my native language so the structure of the post my be a bit janky, I'm sorry for that)

Like I say in the title, its not like my life is bad. To be honest my life is pretty good. I am in one of the top universities of the world, I have some really cool as friends, I am not a loner, I hang out with people and all that. I recently met a girl that I like and I am going to see this weekend, so like I am not a loner that has nobody for support. 

But for some reason I just feel like hurting myself just for the "fun" of it. Actually, its more like I have no reason at all for hurting myself sometimes. It's really weird to explain. Anyhow, what I am trying to say, is that I really want to kill myself sometimes, for no reason at all or just "for the fun of it". You know, sometimes I wonder, what is on the other side(if anything) which is really weird coming from me, since I am a strong atheist and do not believe in any sort of higher power whatsoever. 

The worst thing is that I don't understand why I want to kill myself and that is the most annoying thing of it all. I really don't know why I am posting this, it's the same kind of impulse that I have whenever I hurt myself or contemplate suicide. So yea, I don't really know what's going on bros
