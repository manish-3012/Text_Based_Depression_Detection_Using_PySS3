Mom suicidalI havenâ€™t slept and I canâ€™t eat. I canâ€™t sleep because she will kill herself. I canâ€™t eat because I have to eat away from her because of her nausea. So if I eat or sleep that will be her time to harm herself. She told me she would.

Iâ€™m hungry and exhausted. Iâ€™ve taken little short naps throughout the past few days but itâ€™s not enough.

Sheâ€™s praying for death. We have a lot of medicines that she could OD on, including insulin. I threw away all sharp objects.

But sheâ€™s miserable.
