I just want to finish itI am experiencing it again. Anxious, depressed, lost all desires, can't find the purpose of living any more. 

I've been in hospital twice this year already. I will make sure it works this time. 

There is nothing in the world I cherish anymore. I just need a way out. 

Thank you all.
