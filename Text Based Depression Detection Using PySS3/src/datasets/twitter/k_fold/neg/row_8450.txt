Iâ€™m killing myself today.To list out all the ways in which life has been cruel to me is pointless. Itâ€™s simply time for me to go. I tried my hardest to make things better, but they merely changed in their cruelty. Iâ€™m too weak for this life. Iâ€™m not cut out for it. 

I wrote out all my letters to old friends. No point in writing to my family. They donâ€™t give a shit while Iâ€™m alive, much less dead. 

I tried to kill myself when I was 16. It failed, obviously. Thought about it everyday the 7 years since. Itâ€™s my time. 

Goodbye everyone.
