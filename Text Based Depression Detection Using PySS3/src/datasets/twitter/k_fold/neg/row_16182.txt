Can't find a job, draining my girlfriend dryAs title says. Moved in with my girlfriend about 4 months ago. Moved to a different part of the country, and as I have very little in the way of qualifications (some level 3 IT qualifications) I knew it would be hard to find work, especially as I don't drive (id intended to learn whenever I got a job and the money together) its proving fucking impossible to find one and I'm draining my girlfriend emotionally and financially. I don't want her to have to support me. I want to share everything with her but how can I? I am at my wits end and just feeling very frustrated and disheartened. Never been this low. I know noone will read this, kind of just ranting.
