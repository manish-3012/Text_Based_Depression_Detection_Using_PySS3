Just wishing I was dead. Like every other day.Suicide is on my mind nearly every moment it seems. So yes I've posted here before. Losing the only person I've ever loved has sent me spiraling. 3 years wasted almost 9 months ago and it's not getting any easier. Getting old with nothing to show for it. The usual. All I do is go to school and sit at home alone. School is the only thing keeping me going. I'm older than most of my classmates so no real opportunities for friendship or relationships there. I figure I'll get my degree then do the deed so at least I'll have accomplished something before I pass. By the time I'm what mid thirties still alone whats the point. I'd rather die than grow old on my own thats too bleak.
