only 3% of suicide attempts by overdose are successfulPlease note im not trying give you instructions of how to kill yourself but explaining the most effective and painless methods should you attempt it. Im writing this to try to put you off suicide becasue the reality is the methods are pretty grim and not very succesful.

Im telling you this as a fellow human being who wants the best for everyone else even if that means a painless death if there are no other options left. So please dont try and commit suicide by overdose, it wont work all it will do is cause you a lot of pain and more suffering and could lead to persistent pain. Most pills used for overdoses such as tylenol, paracetamol and other prescription drugs no longer contain the lethal chemicals that could once kill you if you took them in large quantities. If you take an entire bottle of these pills and even lots of alcohol with them your body will just vomit most if it up before it absorbs it and you will probably be sent to hospital for a while and be fine a few weeks later.

Wrist cutting as a suicide method is only 5-7.5% lethal and should not be attempted if you're looking for a effective suicide.

The most effective suicide method is a shotgun blast to the roof of the mouth which has a 99% lethality rate. I havent heard of anyone who has survived shooting themself in the roof of the mouth with any calibre gun at all. Other effective methods are jumping from great heights, cyanide poisoning and being hit by a train. But like i said please dont try any these im writing this to try and dishearten you from doing this.
