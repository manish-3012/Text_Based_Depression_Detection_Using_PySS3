I am very closeI should start. I have an extremely loving family. My mom is the greatest thing in my life. She is the only reason I am still alive right now. I never want to make her cry. Second, my ex-friend/ex best friend/love of my life is the second reason I am still alive. I have great friends also. 

I hate using the word depression. I feel like itâ€™s tossed around a lot with not a lot of meaning behind it. But I am extremely depressed. There is not really a reason why, itâ€™s just I am depressed and I donâ€™t want to be alive. I been living with this my whole life. I donâ€™t care if I wake up in the morning. I just donâ€™t want to be here. 

I am going to get help. I already started looking at therapists near me. But the one year anniversary of my dads death is in a few days. I really not sure how I will be. I tried killing myself twice this year already.

I am barely holding on. 

I have told no one about how I been. I have been bottling it up for years. Pretending I am happy all the time. I have told one person exactly how I feel and been. She is the one getting me to go to a therapist. It just sucks, I canâ€™t get a win in life right now. But I am going to keep trying. The only thing in life I want right now is not to wake up alone. I want someone I love next to me. But itâ€™s impossible to have someone when I hate myself. I am by no means unhealthy or unfit. I am doing everything physically to look attractive. I am coming onto year 9 now and every girl has said no to me. No one has given me a chance. So that is part of the reason I been so low the past few years. My dads death hasnâ€™t helped, it was a long 5 year battle with cancer. I spent everyday with him during that time and I loved him so much. I miss him. He always gave me good advice and was a good wingman with women. He always tried to set me up with girls. 

Previous I said my ex-friend/ex-friend/best friend/love of my life. She is amazing but unfortunately she doesnâ€™t have the same feeling towards me and that sucks. Itâ€™s fine. It happens. But my mental health is crap. It is destroying my friendship with her. I am in love with her. But she loves me only as a friend. I ended up having a long talk with her. We came to an understanding, ended up saying we canâ€™t be friends anymore or for now. I need to fix my brain before I can go back on trying to be just friends with her. It is a lot of stress on me trying not to be in love with someone. We used to talk ever day and do a morning FaceTime and bedtime FaceTime no matter what. We still talk, we care about each other a lot. It is actually the most special and amazing friendship. But I ruining that. I wish things could work out between us but it wonâ€™t. This is more complicated than you can imagine. Very stressful. 

I canâ€™t stop crying, almost every second of the day when I am alone, any amount of time, I cry.

I want to start telling my friends where I am at with my mental health before itâ€™s to late. I need a big push to also go see a therapist. 

I canâ€™t sleep at night and itâ€™s affecting my work. 

I really need help. I donâ€™t want to end up on the news. But I canâ€™t stop myself if I get another bad low.
