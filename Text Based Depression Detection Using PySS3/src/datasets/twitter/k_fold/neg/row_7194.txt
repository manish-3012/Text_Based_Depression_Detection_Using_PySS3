aliceI feel like nothingâ€™s real it seems like I have all the time in the world and then I blink and itâ€™s all gone Iâ€™m turning seventeen in a day and just the thought makes me want to cry Iâ€™ve lost so much to myself and I tell myself that I want to change that Itâ€™s all going to be okay and yet I donâ€™t do anything about anything maybe I donâ€™t want it enough maybe I donâ€™t want to get better and maybe itâ€™s all a lie I lost three years of my life to a stupid mistake and I wish I could go back I wish I could start my life all over again and that I could do all the right things and Iâ€™m sad all the time and Iâ€™m lonely and I know nothings going to change and I need someone but Iâ€™m such a bad person I donâ€™t deserve anything and I hate myself every second of everyday and I want everything to go away I want time to stop I want to do everything and nothing and Iâ€™m stupid and selfish and a waste of space and I donâ€™t want to be here anymore I want to be a memory tucked away in a box on the highest shelf of the closet my brain is so fucked up and itâ€™s never going to be okay and when I think about getting older itâ€™s just a blank because Iâ€™ve been set on the idea that Iâ€™m going to kill myself before Iâ€™m thirty and Iâ€™m so confused and scared because itâ€™s like I closed my eyes and woke up three years later and I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s going on or what to do
