Just spent 3 hours trying to convince someone not to end their life todayDonâ€™t even know if it worked. I feel like a fucking hypocrite. Iâ€™m counting down the days myself. Why am I such a hypocrite? I feel like nothing will keep me alive if things turn out the way I fear. Why should I end my life but not some kid?

Iâ€™m confused. I wonder what I see in this kid that I donâ€™t see in myself. Why should he keep trying, but not I?
