My mom is pushing me to the brink of suicide, yet fucking again.Iâ€™m 13F and I want to kill myself so bad. Iâ€™ve been dealing with these suicidal thoughts since I was 7, and started slowly getting over my other mental health issues when my dad lost custody of me at age 10. But no, my mom decides she will come in and fuck it all up. Iâ€™m so fucking sick of it. Sheâ€™s a fucking carbon copy of him if not worse. The yelling, screaming, narcissism, belittling and guilt tripping. The weight she puts on my shoulders, sheâ€™s the reason why over the last 2 years my suicidal thoughts have increased and I think about ending it all atleast 4x a week. Sheâ€™s the fucking reason and she doesnâ€™t even care. Sheâ€™s a weak pathetic lazy bitch who doesnâ€™t do SHIT. Iâ€™m the one who grocery shops, IM the one who cooks, IM the one who is forced to clean the entire house for hours as she gets to sit and watch TV doing nothing. She is no fucking parent. I feel like her fucking parent, I even have to clean her room and make her bed. What kind of lazy stupid shit is that? I have FUCKING NO ONE. NO ONE. No friends due to her pulling me out and putting me in homeschooling SOLELY so I have to do all her work and chores. No other family members (no seriously, no one.). I cannot fucking take it anymore, I told her about all this tonight, the suicidal thoughts and EVERYTHING and you know what her bitchass did? She laughed. She rolled her eyes and laughed. And then tried to guilt trip me. Now im sitting in bed, crying my eyes out seriously considering putting an end to it all tonight. I donâ€™t know anymore. God I need help but no ones there. Iâ€™ve called the suicide hotline and it doesnâ€™t help.
