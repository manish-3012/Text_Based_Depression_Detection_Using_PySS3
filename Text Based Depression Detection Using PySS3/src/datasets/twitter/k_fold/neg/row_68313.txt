Help. I feel trapped. I don't want to die. But I have to kill myself.I am in so much emotional pain right now. 3 months out of work. The last job prospect I had failed because of a failed background check.  My ex broke up with me 3 months ago. I have no family. No friends. My son died years ago. I have no money and I'm living in my friend's garage with roaches and bottles of smuggled liquor. I used to think I was smart and intelligent but everyone is so much brighter than me. 

I checked my first ex's Facebook page and saw his son was born 4 months ago and he's so happy. Everyone who's ever left me is happy and I feel like trash. I'm needy but I can't help but need help. I just want to NOT EXIST. 

Help me kill myself as painlessly as possible. Is there even a way?
