Is it normal to become suicidal over society?Not much to say beyond that. Just that for the past half-decade, I've stopped thinking my own life has any importance or that life in general has importance, and made a failed attempt to off myself two years ago. I see plenty of people unhappy about it, but can't really find people who have used it as motivation to take their own life since they know there's no future now.
