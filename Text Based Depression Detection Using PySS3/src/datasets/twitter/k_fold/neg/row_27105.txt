Is it really enough to just exist?Iâ€™ve grappled with my mental health for over a decade, none of this is new to me. Iâ€™ve been hospitalized twice, seen 3 therapists long-term, several others for single visits, 4 psychiatrists, been on 3 kinds of medications, and yet I still canâ€™t figure out how to function in this world. I tried to kill myself a few months ago, and got a while afterwards I really was getting better, but like always, I just crash back down again and ruin everything. 

I have always hated being in school, and I was forced to leave college a year ago, and I got a shitty job at a cafe. I spent those months doing drugs every weekend and not accomplishing any of the things I said I would if I didnâ€™t have school. I became so depressed that one day I didnâ€™t have any clean pants to wear, so I just didnâ€™t go to work and never went back. I decided to try to go back to school. A month after getting back full time I tried to kill myself. I got treatment, dropped some classes, made it to this semester. I was really doing it for about a month: going to class, going to work, seeing friends, working out. Then suddenly I couldnâ€™t do it. Couldnâ€™t get out of bed again, couldnâ€™t do any work. And now itâ€™s too late. Iâ€™ve flunked out and canâ€™t continue my degree. 

I feel crushed. I donâ€™t know what I thought was going to happen. My parents have sunk thousands of dollars into my education and Iâ€™ve just wasted it. My boyfriend has ambitious plans of buying houses, retiring early, but I will never make any money, and I just feel like a burden to him, a burden to my family. 

I see things posted all around like â€œitâ€™s okay if all you did today was surviveâ€ but is it? I can already feel the rage and resentment of the â€œwhy couldnâ€™t you just do it?? Everyone has to work. Everyone just wants to sleep all the time but they donâ€™t!â€. I know. But how am I supposed to do all these things when I donâ€™t want any of it. I donâ€™t even want to be alive, how can I want to succeed enough to graduate from college or find a good job? I just donâ€™t want to participate in this world. I am so tired of trying. I donâ€™t believe Iâ€™ll get better, and I donâ€™t even really want to die, I just feel like I should want to die for being a failure. Like it would be more honorable to be in agony and kill myself than it would be to just be at peace. I feel like if it wasnâ€™t for all the lofty expectations other people place on me I would be okay. I really donâ€™t want much. Why is it my job to make someone else happy or proud? I do not want friends or money or fameâ€”all I want is to be left alone, and yet somehow that is the most shameful choice I can make. I just feel paralyzed.
