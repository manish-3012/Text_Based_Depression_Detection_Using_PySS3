How can life get better if it's never been that way in the first place..?I've never been ok. Never been normal. How am I supposed to turn everything around when my direction has always been down? I hate my life and I hate myself, I want freedom. I've had more than enough of this perpetual suffocation, desperation has been my story for the past five years. The time before that was not worth going through.

I have \~40 days until I can attempt. I NEED to get this right. I can't stand existing anymore, I hope that I die properly. If it's one thing I can get in "life" please let it be my death.
