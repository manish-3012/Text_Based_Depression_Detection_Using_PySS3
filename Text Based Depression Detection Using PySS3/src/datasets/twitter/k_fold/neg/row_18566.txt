I have no oneI wish I could talk to someone who actually cares what I have to say. I can feel my mental health deteriorating by the day. I don't know how much longer I have or what's going to trigger it. I've served in the army. So I have va benefits and a rating  but they don't help much.  I'm at a lost I've been pacing around my room for hours wondering what went wrong. I'm a good guy. Really nice so I don't understand the karma aspect of it. I've tried God multiple times can't seem to find him..... I don't know where to go from here. I am alone.
