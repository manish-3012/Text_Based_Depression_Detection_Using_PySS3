Planned on cutting my wrists just now, until I read statistics.I was finally ready to end it all. I just feel so fucking empty and I just don't have the strength to carry on anymore. I got everything ready, but wanted to check what was the best way to do it, and saw that the mortality rate is approximately 6 % and usually just leaves you with a scar. People (friends and family) would probably think it's just for attention seeking or whatever, and I just don't want to be a pity case. I'm so sad that I couldn't pull through and feel like such a failure.
