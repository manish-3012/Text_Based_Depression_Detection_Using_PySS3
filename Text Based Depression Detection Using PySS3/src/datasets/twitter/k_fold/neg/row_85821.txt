idk what to do anymore..i really can't do it anymore. my life is going so downhill. like i literally wanna die all the time now. i have no friends, my family stresses me out so much. i just want to be happy. i want good grades, i want to be skinny, i want to have actual friends i can count on. i miss having people there for me. god it's getting so bad.. i never thought i would be back at this point.
