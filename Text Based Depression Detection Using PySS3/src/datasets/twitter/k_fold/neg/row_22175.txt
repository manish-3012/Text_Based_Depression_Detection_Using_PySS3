I should have just jumped off the parking garage a year agoA year ago, I went to a LAN party. When it was done, I packed my stuff into my car and I looked over the edge at the ongoing construction at the bottom. I was just in a really bad mental state then and I still am now. I shouldâ€™ve just jumped. No one cares. The best friend I ever had (online) had left me 3 months later and has never contacted me since. Everyone just hates me. Everyone treats me awful. Iâ€™ve never had any irl friends and dates and everyone else I see has those. It just pisses me off and pains me to have everyone ruin my life. I shouldâ€™ve just jumped off that dumb parking garage when I had the chance.
