Were is the beauty in life anymore?The world is in chaos and I believe these protests stem deeper than the loss of George Floyd... that video is burned into my head. That cops eyes... they were empty... that was evil. I've always had a really dark view of the world... it makes me feel so sick to think about how bad this world is. I was at the protests in Baltimore and for 12 miles it was such a beautiful and peaceful experience... then the other group came in and next thing I know I look over and a woman is screaming faggot at the top of her lungs and tells the cop she is going to tell his mom he likes men.... this world is hopeless.... I'm hopeless.... I shouldn't be here.... I feel so sick... I don't know how to go through life anymore... this is hell.
