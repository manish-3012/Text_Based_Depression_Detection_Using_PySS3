Why does everyone always say that if youâ€™re feeling depressed/suicidal, that you should tell someone but when you do, people say â€œyouâ€™re just looking for attentionâ€?Isnâ€™t â€œattentionâ€ that cry for help youâ€™re looking for? Why do people chastise you for it? What are you suppose to do if you canâ€™t seek counsel in whatever it is thatâ€™s tormenting you?
