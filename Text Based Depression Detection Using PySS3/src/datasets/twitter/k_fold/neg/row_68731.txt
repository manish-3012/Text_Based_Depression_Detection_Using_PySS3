Dying a FailureUniversity has beaten me down and made me want to die so badly. I wasn't depressed before coming to college. Depression stole so many things from my life leaving me an empty shell of a person. I can't enjoy any of my hobbies, I can't do well in classes, I can't make friends. I'm a failure and even though I know that my grades don't define my worth as a human being, I know that I'm worthless and I've given up hope. If I don't graduate, I'm going to kill myself without a doubt.
