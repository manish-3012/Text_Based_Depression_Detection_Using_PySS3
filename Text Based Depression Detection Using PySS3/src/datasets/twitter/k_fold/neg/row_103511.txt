I donâ€™t know if there is anything else besides family holding me backIâ€™ve never found love or affection in my 15 years of life. Never came close, I canâ€™t do good in school, I have nothing to look forward to. Iâ€™ve lost all credibility in life. I have no one to turn to. I think Iâ€™m to scared to do it because of fear of hurting my family after I do so. Iâ€™ve been shut out all my life and have no where to go. Stay safe everyone
