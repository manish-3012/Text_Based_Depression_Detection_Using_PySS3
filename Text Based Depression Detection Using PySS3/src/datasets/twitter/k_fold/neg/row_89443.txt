I feel empty and invisible.I am scared. I have no friends and everyone but my boyfriend seems to hate me. No matter what I try it seem to have no one around most of the time. I've given up. I have nothing. I'm useless. No one wants me around. 

The longer I'm here the more I feel like this. Like nothing.
