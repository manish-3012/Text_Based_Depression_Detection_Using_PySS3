My lense is unfocusing. My life is the picture.My lense is the friends I use to have, the conversations I was in, the accomplishments I achieved. That lense moving away, unfocusing the picture it once displayed clearly. My picture is being blurred. It's loosing life. My friends were really never there for me when I was in desperate need of them, so I resorted to skype. Yes, skype. I added one, random person, and now I have a web of over 300 people. When my lense draws near to my picture, I realize these 300 individuals aren't friends, they are people. I cannot see them in real life. My other friends turned out to really be there when I didn't need them. Now that I realize that I regret the last five or so years of my life. I shut myself in, and as an extravert this is odd. Very odd. My parents shoved me into counselng during the fourth year, which didn't help at all. On the fifth year I met a girl. However she moved away last month. 
I'm lonely. So lonely. About to say fuck the picture and give up. I have abandoned my friends, it's my fault they won't take me back. What's the purpose in our lives as humans? What's the point in this picture? One out of 7,000,000,000, right? What does it matter if I live?
