Ready for it all to endJust got caught for my second DUI. I don't think i can handle the consequences or the shame. I have a loving wife and two beautiful children. That's the only reason i haven't taken my own life already. But i can't talk to them on how i feel inside. I see easy death everywhere i go. Razor blades at work to slit my wrists, drown myself in a toilet, or roll my truck off a cliff. I don't know anymore. Just ready for it all to end...
