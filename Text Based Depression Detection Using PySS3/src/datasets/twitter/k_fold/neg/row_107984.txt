Why am I here?My mom says it was a miracle that Iâ€™m here while she was on birth control, it truly was an accident thought, if it worked like she wanted it to I would never have been here with so much pain. Why do people try to look for the positives when itâ€™s just facts? I shouldâ€™ve never been born and thatâ€™s the sad truth. Iâ€™m falling back into the pit I tried so hard to get out of. And Iâ€™m drowning in tears but yet no one notices. Iâ€™m dying slowly. Until Iâ€™m dead everyone will just keep ignoring me.
