Life sucks for everyone?I really donâ€™t do things like this normally but lately life has become less and less appealing to me. im normally someone who tries to deal with all my emotions myself as i try not to bore anyone with my life. iâ€™m a kid whoâ€™s parents force them to do all honors classes and extracurricular activities and on top of that i just started a new job i was forced to get. The stress of life and overthinking on every little thing just gets sooo very unbearable at times i canâ€™t take it anymore. iâ€™ve been getting less and less sleep everyday because of my mind continuously circling around bad memories. i understand life for everyone is hard and people have it worse than me but gosh life is so unbearable
