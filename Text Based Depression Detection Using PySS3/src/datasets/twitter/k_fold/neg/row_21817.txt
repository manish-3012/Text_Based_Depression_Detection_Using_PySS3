Today I had a party at my place (a small studio with 3 chairs) and accidentally posted a pic of my (male) friend sitting on my bed, which is right next to the beer pong table, on my story.My boyfriend (long distance-ish) saw it while I was having a panic attack due to the amount of ppl that ended up in my apt and I was trying to call him for help but then he told me that I ruined his night.  I felt so alone and like such a burden even tho I had all these ppl around me and repeatedly tried to ask him to just talk but he was just treating me like how I felt was an overreaction for his attention. I have never felt so alone and so many negative thoughts about myself have been released by my depressive floodgates. I couldnâ€™t stop myself from cutting and I kept asking him if he could just call me so I could hear his voice and calm down so I could stop harming myself but he refused and I have never wanted to kill myself more. Heâ€™s the only person I go to when I have episodes cuz no one else knows how truly depressed I am and now I feel like I have no one when Iâ€™m at lowest.
