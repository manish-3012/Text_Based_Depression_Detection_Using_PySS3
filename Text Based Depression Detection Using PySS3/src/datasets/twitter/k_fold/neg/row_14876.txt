Anyone watch the anime Orange?Watching the anime Orange. Iâ€™m on ep 7. I relate to Kakeru very hard. Fuck I wish I had friends who cared about me so much. I hardly get a response when I reach out to them about feeling suicidal let alone get asked if I actually wanna die. I donâ€™t blame them, I understand fiction from reality but this anime just hits a little too close to home
