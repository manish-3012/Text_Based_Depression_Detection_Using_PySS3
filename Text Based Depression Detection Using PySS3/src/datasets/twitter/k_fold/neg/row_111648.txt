Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m suicidal or something else?For a tiny bit of background, Iâ€™m in my first year of college and itâ€™s been very hard. Had a few self harm incidents, was in the health center for a few days, breakdowns, anxiety attacks, one week long depressive episode where I missed a shit ton of class (which made stress worse). Part of it was my fault because I wasnâ€™t taking my meds consistently (and lying to my mom saying that I was), but even now that Iâ€™m back on track (for two weeks now!) I still feel â€œoffâ€ a lot of times. 

I kinda just want to go away for a bit, but Iâ€™m not sure what that means. Being dead sounds nice in some moments, but not in others. I just feel empty? Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I can only see my counselor once every two weeks so I feel lonely most of the time.
