Feeling Lost and Wanting to Die[F 21] This is a throwaway account.  Iâ€™m tired of feeling lost and want to die. I donâ€™t know who I am or what I want to do in this world. I feel like a square peg in a circle here. Iâ€™m in my first year of college, Iâ€™m autistic, and have reading comprehension problems. I was originally majoring in psychology. Ever since I was 16, I wanted to become a Clinical Psychologist. This semester I scheduled intro to psychology 2, intro to biology, statistics, and the first year seminar. When I scheduled the classes, I didnâ€™t realize how much of a overload it will be, and how much my reading comprehension sucks. I struggled to keep with the psychology reading while doing everything else; we had to read 100 pages for each psychology exam. So I ended up withdrawing out of the class last Friday. Now I feel lost and donâ€™t know what to major in anymore. I donâ€™t want to drop out of college because I have nothing else to do with my life. Lately, the feeling of wanting to kill myself has been stronger. The thought of dying actually gives me a pleasant feeling. If it werenâ€™t for the high botched suicide rate and also having parents, I would try to kill myself.
