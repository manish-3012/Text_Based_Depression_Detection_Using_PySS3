So I've decided I'm definitely going to kill myself. So I have posted here a few times asking for advice.

But, I've decided, I'm doing it. My plan was to come home today and spend today and tomorrow writing out suicide notes, but my dog chewed through my power cord, killing my laptop.

So once I get a new charger (about 3 days from now) I plan on sitting down and writing out the notes. After that, I am going to a certain building, it's very tall, and I would have access to the roof, and I am jumping. I'm excited. I can't wait to feel that moment of peace, knowing all the pain will soon be gone, as I free fall many stories to my death. 

There have been two factors keeping me from doing it thus far.

1) My girlfriend. I love her, and I honestly was very close to suicide before she came into my life 3 years ago. But, I've come to realize that I am a complete piece of shit, and all I'm doing is holding her back. She deserves so much more than me. I know it will hurt her at first, but she's young, she'll find someone way better, and realize what I did was for the best.

2) Fear. My deepest fear is that SOMETHING happens when you die. I try very hard to convince myself that when you die you lose all memory and conscious. But, I fear that we remain conscious, in some black eternal void. But today I had a breakthrough: it doesn't matter. I'm going to die within 30 years anyways. Why prolong it? Death is inevitable, why suffer more?

So I just want to say thank you guys for trying to help me. But, it just wasn't quite enough. You guys seemed to really care, but my desire to die has vastly outweighed my necessity to live.

So long ;)
