Interested in your inputI guess if this would be anything it's the part left of me that is scared shitless asking for help. Ok, I'll get straight to the points no bs. I don't want to live anymore. 

For the last 6 years or so depression has just broke that down person I once was. I really just don't like who I am..to the way I look to the way I'm socially awkward  and I've always had great friends to talk to this about but 3 weeks ago but my best friend who's been like a brother ever since we were kids committed suicide. I feel just worst I've ever felt because I could have helped him but my mind was so bogged down with how I wanted to end it soon also it blinded myself to what my friend was feeling. We were talking all normally through text up until the day I thought things were fine I know I couldn't have known but I just should have called in person or something.. 

Anyway here I am 3 weeks later it's been day in and day out trying not to scream at work with anger, grief. Nothing will ever bring back my friend you have your great friends in life but he was the one I could tell everything to, laugh about everything to and now he's gone. I just see no way out. Talking is not going to bring him back and talking is not going to stop my other problem of hating and feeling so insignificant to everyone else. I've been through the whole antidepressant thing and they are not for me. So what am I living for? I don't have anything I want to live for anymore. My notes are written Im ready to go tonight. So why am I even typing this? I don't know but if it's for anything it's to tell you to love the ones around you before it's too late. Don't let this happen to you.The feeling is not something I'd wish on anyone.
