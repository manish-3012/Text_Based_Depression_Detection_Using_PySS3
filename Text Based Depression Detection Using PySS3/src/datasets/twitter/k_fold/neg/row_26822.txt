Every good thing I have turns badMy brother was the best person Iâ€™ve ever known. He died of cancer.

My family loves me. Home life is toxic and my father is abusive. Iâ€™ve also been abused by my brother.

I got into a good college. Iâ€™m failing out. 

I got a boyfriend who I love and who loves me too. He slid into some girls dms to comment on their sexual tik toks. 

I donâ€™t have anything at all left. Iâ€™m so done. So so done.
