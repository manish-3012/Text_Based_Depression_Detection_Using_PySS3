I feel like Iâ€™m readyI have been feeling very down in the dumps these past few months. I am so sick and tired of manic episodes and the depression that comes after. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

Quitting law school still gets to me even if it has been almost a month since. I donâ€™t like facing my family, with my aunt always updating me about what my cousins and friends are doing. She would always share stories about the success of my peers and other family members, leaving me feeling like a complete shit. I try to smile still and engage in the conversation every now and then. But itâ€™s exhausting. 

Getting up to work is a choreâ€”getting up in itself is a chore. I donâ€™t like my job. I feel like Iâ€™m just sticking around because my family thinks Iâ€™m happy in it and that they think Iâ€™m good at it. Iâ€™m neither. Iâ€™m so tired at work and I am already underperforming. 

I donâ€™t have people I can talk to about this. My friends think Iâ€™m okay, saying that Iâ€™m just stressed. My family doesnâ€™t believe in mental health. My sister tells me that only I could fix myself but I donâ€™t fckn know where to start. 

But tonight, I laughed and hung out with my family. For a moment, I felt happy. I looked at my them and Iâ€™m very very thankful but I think Iâ€™m ready to go now.
