Iraq vet and lost sense in moving forward.Hello, in 28, alone, veteran, and in debt to my parents. It all started when I was in High school, specifically freshman - Senior year. I didn't do well academically, had a GPA of 3.1, the science grades took it down a lot. My parents, specifically my dad, would make a list of things I owe and they've spent on me since grammar school. Each year they send me a paper saying that I owe ~$30,500. This included after school activities, tutoring, oral and medical treatments, auto &amp; car, phone, etc. If I don't pay, they will sue. At end they say that "I'm not worth the money" also "I wish I could spend on something better than you". Join the Marines after high school because I didn't get accepted into any good colleges and that I could get support after. During my time in Iraq (2009-2011) I got no contact from home, parents didn't even bother sending me letters or calling me. I remember when Christmas came, we got to go home for 3 months. I went home, and I knew I am not welcomed, when my parents are not home just to get my stuff and leave. I remember getting my car and lived in motels or with friends for the rest of the time, spending most on my salary on McDonalds food, cigarettes, and gas. This was the time when my PTSD started coming, I would be more agitated, sad, mixed emotions. Now I live alone, in college, and they keep sending the letter telling me what I owe, I hang it up on the fridge so when I look at it I realize how much of a disappointment I am. I currently work in 3 jobs, working at a marble counter company on weekdays, working blue collar on weekends, meanwhile I take nightshifts doing security. and attending classes. I'm miserable, and I want to end it, I am hungry, bills are piling up, all I feel is hate.
