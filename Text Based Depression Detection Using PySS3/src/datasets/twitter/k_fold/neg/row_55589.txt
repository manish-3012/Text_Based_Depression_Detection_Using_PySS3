Ppl tell mewhy it's a bad idea &amp; why I shouldn't. Truth is...it probably is a good idea &amp; even if some ppl like me it doesn't matter b/c I'm not doing anyone any good. Except my kid. I should be here for them prbly. But that clock is ticking &amp; if I don't have anything else, then why not.
