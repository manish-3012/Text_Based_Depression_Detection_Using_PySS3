I have so many reasons to do it, but I canâ€™t bring myself to act on it. I feel like a coward.This is my throwaway account. But like I said, I have so many reasons to commit suicide. Iâ€™ve got a physical disability that has ruined my chances at a normal life. I get chronic migraines. Iâ€™m narcoleptic. Iâ€™ve been severely depressed since I was 10. Iâ€™m suffering mentally and physically. Iâ€™m a sexual assault survivor. I went through a physically and emotionally abusive relationship at 14 that Iâ€™m still haunted by, almost five years later. My best friend is dead already, and by killing myself I could see him again. My mother is emotionally abusive. She constantly threatens to throw me out and tells me that Iâ€™ll never make it and that Iâ€™m a failure. My father is never home. My sister is the favorite child.

Iâ€™ve already tried to kill myself at least four times unsuccessfully. Iâ€™ve tried overdosing, mixing medications while overdosing to induce serotonin syndrome, cutting myself, and exposure to the elements (hypothermia). I could drive my car into a light pole, or a river. I could hang myself. I could start my car in the garage and keep the garage door shut. I could jump into traffic, or off a building. It would be easy. I would stop hurting. I would see Michael again. But thereâ€™s something holding me back like I donâ€™t deserve to stop suffering.
