I Really Don't Like ComplimentsI first need to say, I feel bad making this post because it sounds disrespectful to the good intentions of my friends. I don't like it when people say that I'll make it through tough times, or how I'm competent or how they're proud of me. For some reason it makes me way more panicked, uncomfertable and angry than when someone tells me that I should kill myself. 

I don't even know possibly why this stresses me out, but every time someone tries to help me out with words of praise or hopefulness, it just makes everything worse.
