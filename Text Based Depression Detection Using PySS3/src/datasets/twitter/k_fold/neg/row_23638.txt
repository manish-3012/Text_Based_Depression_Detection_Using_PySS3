Living alone with bpd{english is not my first language}

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. 
I was diagnosed with BPD. I live in a different city from my parents and I only told my mother about this. She only said that I shouldnâ€™t take my meds because I could get addicted. I take sleeping pills every night, I still take my meds and go to my psychologist and psychiatrist. However, Iâ€™m only a student and I have a part time job but Iâ€™m running out of money. I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to tell my dad about this because heâ€™ll want me to go back living with him and my mom, but they are super abusive. 
I donâ€™t like going to college anymore, I donâ€™t feel anything at all about nothing. I just want to die. I feel a burden to my boyfriend and I wish he was with somebody else, but this thought also hurta me??? I just donâ€™t know... I donâ€™t know...
