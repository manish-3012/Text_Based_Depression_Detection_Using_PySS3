It feels really bad, not havin the power to end itMy life objectively sucks. I wanna end it, I just can't because I don't want my family to suffer because of me. I can't find happiness, Ive been through a lot and to get over these things Ill have to get through a lot again...I just don't have the power and Im too scared, and I wanna end it. 
Im not afraid of the fact that Ill never get my conscience back, or the pain. Im afraid that I might cause a heart atack when Ill be discovered dead.
