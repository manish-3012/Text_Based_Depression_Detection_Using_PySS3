It gets worse. So much worse.I notice most posts here seem to be college age kids struggling. Not to downplay that. I get it. For me though, 13 years since those days,  I've entered a whole new level of hell. Lost the only girl who's ever wanted me 8 years ago and have been alone since. Not like single. Like alone. No friends, no family. No contact. My job requires no relationships or interactions with the same people more than once. And only for a minute or two. And they treat me like shit. I'm addicted. I'm broken. I'm sick. I have physical imperfections that people stare at in public. I'm weak. I'm tired. I'm confused. 8 long years. Alone. But finally, finally, I found a gun. No pain.
