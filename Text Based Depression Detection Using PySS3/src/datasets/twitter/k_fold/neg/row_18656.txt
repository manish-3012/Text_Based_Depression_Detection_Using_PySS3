Suicide hotline is a joke, already spent $2k on psych ward... have a therapist, psychiatrist... nothing is working...I just got home from a 12 hour day teaching. My AC is out. Its 88F in my house. I had a repairman on his way, paid for by the landlord, and my husband cancelled it because he says the AC is working. 

I have a screaming 4-year-old and her friend here.  My daughter is screaming because she stopped eating regular food years ago. She wants sprinkles for dinner. I make her and her friend a very kid friendly plate of pizza, carrots, hummus, peanut butter crackers, and a few sprinkles on top of apples slices. But that was wrong of me. She is screaming that she hates me again.

I have to gather the strength to care for the 14 chickens we have... and the dog... and the cat...  and the hamster... my husband refuses to care for these animals because he is sick of them and "doesnt care if they die."   We have the chickens because his childhood friend's husband was murdered and she asked if we would care for them. We have the dog because his sister said she isn't home enough and asked if we would care for him. 

I am going to continue working for another hour or so on the pets, then I guess go to sleep in a house (that certainly doesnt have AC working) and try and sleep in 90F degree weather. I wont sleep. I will get up at 5:30am and go back to work as a teacher, where I am paid $23k a year. Then I have a huge parent meeting lasting until 9pm. So 15 hour work day?

I dont want to be here. I see no way out. I can, and will move, though if rent prices and teaching have taught me anything... I am not educated enough to make money to live on my own. 

So, sure, I'll work towards leaving my family and moving somewhere better for my mental health... but I can't afford anywhere... so really what am I working towards?

I see only one way out. Seems like a better choice every day.
