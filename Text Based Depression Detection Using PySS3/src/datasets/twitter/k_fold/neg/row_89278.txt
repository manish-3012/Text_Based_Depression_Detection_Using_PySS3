I have a countdown timer to my sister's wedding.Because any day after that, can be the day.  I don't have to be here anymore.  No more pain of being alone.  No more unemployability.  No more crippling anxiety.  No more feeling like a zombie from medications.  No more watching other people move on and away.  No more pretending to be happy for the happiness of others.  No more waking up wondering what new insult life has for me today.  Most importantly: No. More.
