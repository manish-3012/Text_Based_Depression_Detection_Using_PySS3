Am 15 and thinking about suicideUm I am a freshman in high school and just to clarify nothing is going on at my house that makes me want to die. Itâ€™s mostly because I really donâ€™t have any friends my anxiety gets the best of me not allowing me to make friends with anyone the only thing that keptâ€™s me going (well this might sound weird but) is  anime and Video games. But lately the two have not been working for me I think I might Hurt myself idk I just need someone to talk to.
