I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.My friend still wants to kill themselves. Theyâ€™ve been hospitalized, put on medication, the whole nine yards. Put in a psych unit. Everything. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t help themâ€”hell, I want to fucking kill myself. Of course, I havenâ€™t been in a serious enough situation to where Iâ€™ve been hospitalized or anything, but thereâ€™s nothing to say when they say that the only consequence was going to the unit. Not going to lie but that kind of stung. Like I want to die myself, yes, but I also understand what Iâ€™d be missing out on. Iâ€™d never get to walk down the aisle. Iâ€™d never get to prove my dumbass mother wrong for telling me Iâ€™d never get into a good college, Iâ€™d never get to prove MYSELF wrong. I understand what itâ€™s like to want to kill yourself, but I donâ€™t get what itâ€™s like to think that people wouldnâ€™t be affected. Personally, I know people would be bothered by it. Sometimes thatâ€™s what stops me. I donâ€™t want to bring other people down with me. But my friend doesnâ€™t think that way I guess. They think if they leave their family with money that everything will be alright. But thatâ€™s completely fuckign wrong. Especially for me. Iâ€™d miss them endlessly. Itâ€™s selfish for me to want them to stay, but I donâ€™t care at this point. I really donâ€™t know what to do. What am I, a suicidal person, supposed to say to help another suicidal person to tell them to NOT KILL THEMSELVES? Iâ€™m so fed up with myself if I was a good friend Iâ€™d just know how to help.
