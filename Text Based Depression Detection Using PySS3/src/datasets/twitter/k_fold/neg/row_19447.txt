Girlfriend broke up with me and then started fucking my best friend.Title. I'm 15. My girlfriend of a year and a half broke up with me last Thursday, and then I find out she's been trading nudes and planned to have sex with my best friend. When confronted she said to the same friend "he has no right to be mad at me, my sex life isn't his business". Which I get, I mean we're not together anymore, but I bet she'd be pretty upset if I broke up with her and then started doing the same with *her* best friend. Ever since the breakup I've been really insecure and vulnerable, and this was like shoving a knife into my heart and twisting it around. I can't even describe the pain. Right now I'm really just in need of a confidence booster, because I'm really falling into a pit here. Any advice, opinions on the matter, please, even if you think im at fault here please tell me, i don't really have a lot more people in my life than the friend in question so i don't have anybody to talk to about it.
