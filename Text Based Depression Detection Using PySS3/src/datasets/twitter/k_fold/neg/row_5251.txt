I was planning on doing it on May.But I can't bear my life any longer.
In May my life insurance will complete the required time of subscription to cover suicide, and I was going to wait until then so I don't leave any debts for anyone. But I can't wait anymore.
In my life, there is only one person I actually care about. Let's call her C. C has been my friend for about ten years, and I've been in love with her for five. Of course, I've never told her how I feel, given the fact that I'm really, really ugly, but I'm sure she is aware. C is the only person I will write a letter to, saying my goodbyes. 
I don't want to fucking die, I've got dreams I would like to see coming true, like having a job as a comic book artist, but none of that matters if I'm alone. I just can't take the loneliness anymore. 
C is the only person who could reach me right now, and I can't talk to her about THIS. I would just become weak in her eyes, and I don't want to burden her with the knowledge of what I intend to do.
I swear, if I believed there was any chance at all things would get better, I would stay. But that's not the case.
