qhi, iâ€™ve been clean for 8 months and my dad died a few weeks ago. iâ€™ve been getting really bad again and i havenâ€™t relapsed yet but suicide is constantly on my mind. i know if i killed myself it would hurt my family and friends so i guess my question is how would i ask one of my friends if she would be willing to check in on me every now and then? i feel like iâ€™m gonna snap and just take a bottle of tylenol and i donâ€™t wanna open up to anyone but i donâ€™t know what to do?
