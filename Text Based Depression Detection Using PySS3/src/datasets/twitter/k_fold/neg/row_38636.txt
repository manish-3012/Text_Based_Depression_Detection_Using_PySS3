I think it's time for me to go.I think it's time for me to remove myself from this world. 

I have failed at everything I've set out to do, squandered every opportunity I've ever been given. I graduated high school and was admitted into a university, but I failed my two classes last semester and have been subsequently suspended. I lost my job. I have no money and $1,800 in credit card debt.

I have hidden these horrible details of my life from my family for some time now; this has all happened within the course of a month. But I told my father about these things today and he, understandably, blew up. Then, he hung up on me. He doesn't want to talk to me. But it makes sense. I wouldn't want to talk to me right now either. 

The shame is unbearable, the hopelessness ever-present. I don't see how I can come back from this. I've hurt so many people due to my choices. I'm a hinderance, a problem that can't be solved, and it seems now that the best thing to do is to take myself out of this world. I don't deserve to be in it and I have contributed nothing to it.

There is a bottle of diphenhydramine next to me. There are about 80 or so caplets inside. There is also a train track that runs through town. I am contemplating using one option or the other to solve this dilemma.

I don't want to do this. But I see no other option because I'm an awful, worthless person.
