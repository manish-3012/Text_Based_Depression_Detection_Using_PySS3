I think I'm doneI posted on here once before, but there was a glimpse of hope. My brother came back, and are alright toying with my emotions and making me hate myself. It's been a really tough few weeks and my girlfriend and I have had some conflict and we only keep hurting eachother, but I keep ducking up and doing the fucking worst things and on top of it all my girlfriend wants a "break" i.e. Leave her alone for a while. I've had my heartbroken tho way before(not with her) I've been left and cheated, I've actually never broken up with anyone. She keeps saying it's not like that and she just needs a little space. I'm with her in bed right now, she's asleep. I've got a knife, I think I'm done.
