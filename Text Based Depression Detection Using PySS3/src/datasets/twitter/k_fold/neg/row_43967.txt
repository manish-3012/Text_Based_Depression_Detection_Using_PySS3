Really might go donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll say bye so I am hereIâ€™ve not been well when corona hit, moved in with my mother, and she just did this to look good then kick me out

Another post explains how I lost my mind once

Have both types of herpes 

Canâ€™t think straight anymore

How fucked up can a life be. I used to not think that but Iâ€™ve always been and now always will be that girl

29 single quarantine isnâ€™t fast bc Iâ€™ve lived my life isolated 

Iâ€™m trying so hard to get a better job than just this part time but when thereâ€™s free time I think of my choice to go. Itâ€™s like it fits. Itâ€™s now like it would be so beautiful for my life. Like the right thing now

Wouldnâ€™t it be cool tho? If I met all the best souls if I did.
