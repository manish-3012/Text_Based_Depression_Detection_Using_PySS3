How long will paracetamol stay in system?I've just taken 7 500mg paracetamol caplets about half an hour ago- I passed out before I could complete it so unfortunately it won't kill me. I am going for a blood test for different reasons at 10:30am tomorrow, will they still be able to detect this in my bloods??
