Thank you, I'm going to finally do it.As of recent I've spent a lot of time on this sub reading thriugh, but a certain type of posts gave me hope and happiness. There's people who have killed themselves here who are now just accounts never to be touched again or to be remembered, and to those people I thank them. I am going to buy a gun off the streets and I'm finally going to kill myself, I've tried before but have either chickened out or failed at ODing. I will have the strength when the time comes and I can't thank this sub enough for making me feel not so alone.
