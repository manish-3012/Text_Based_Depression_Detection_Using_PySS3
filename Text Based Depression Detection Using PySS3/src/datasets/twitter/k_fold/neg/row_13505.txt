Why is it that one little thing always drags me back down?I was actually thinking I was having a good day today, I did better than I thought on my History exam, had a relaxing early afternoon and I was going to and hang out with my boyfriend. Half an hour before I was meant to meet with him, he messages me and says he can't and he has other plans. I was so upset about this. Most people would probably think I am over reacting but I was actually planning to surprise him and take him out for lunch, my treat. I'm staring to get really busy with exams and will be for another week and in two weeks today, i'm going to Japan. So really, I don't have much time left to spend with him. So I got pretty upset about this and naturally go back to thoughts about me wanting to hurt/kill myself. I always go back to thinking it's my fault but is it my fault?

tldr; Going to surprise boyfriend by taking him out for lunch, told me he had other plans half an hour before we were going to meet. Can't spend much time with him as I have exams and going overseas soon (hence surprise lunch) and now I feel like hurting/killing myself

Sorry for the long tldr
