Drinking and smoking myself into oblivionSorry, thinking venting might help. Have social anxiety and have struggled for so long. Just turned 30 and have been depressed for most my life but have always thought I can't do anything because I really don't want to hurt my friends and family, but it's getting so tiring I'm scared, I really don't want to hurt anyone. Started on anti-depressants almost 2 months ago but not helping. Doc gave me a card to call to arrange a psychotherapist, but I called them almost a year ago, more for my anxiety than depression, but got told it was a 3 month wait so didn't call them back, and it's such a hard conversation and my anxiety makes it hard to call people. I'm actually hoping I have throat cancer (unlikely, but had a sore throat for a couple months and my dad had it, and I've smoked and drunk alot excessively recently). And I'm spiralling, my social anxiety makes every day such a struggle and haven't had a relationship since I was 15 and I'm so lonely. Pathetic I know. Have really good friends but it's not the same. Ended up having sex with one of my closest friends, twice, and he's a guy and I'm not even gay, pretty sure he isn't either so not really sure how or why, just a release I guess. But every day for the past few months I've been looking at the knife in my kitchen and thinking I want it to be over, and I really don't want to hurt anyone but I'm scared because I'm feeling so tired and worn out. Sorry
