My brain is breaking down, and there is no help.A few years ago, I developed issues with not being able to remember words, but the past two months this issue has gotten a million times worse. I can barely form sentences when speaking or writing. It takes me an hour to type a post like this even. I have been trying to write a thank you card to someone for weeks. Every time I start to write it, I cannot come up with the words, so I say fuck it and give up. I have gone to many doctors for this problem, and all they can tell me is that there is nothing wrong on my MRI or my bloodwork. I've been having nonstop panic attacks throughout every day because there are so many areas of my life that this issue impacts. Before, my neighbor asked me to go with her to run an errand, so I did and then I had a panic attack as soon as I got home because I made such an idiot of myself trying to engage in conversation with her and not being able to form coherent sentences. Then I had another panic attack because my dad asked me to help him with his resume and I could not do it because I could not come up with the words. I used to be really good at writing resumes and things like essays. I scored 99th percentile on the writing portion of the GRE. Now if I had to take that test again, I would have a panic attack in the exam room because I would struggle with just the first sentence.

I do not know what to do. No one would be able to help me if I went to the ER, they would just tell me the usual stuff that my bloodwork is normal and I don't have a brain tumor blah blah.

I think I am going crazy. I can't live like this. Every moment is torture. I feel like the only escape is death.
