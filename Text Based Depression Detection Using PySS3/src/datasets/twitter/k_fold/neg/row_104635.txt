Remind me.Iâ€™ve decided that I canâ€™t commit suicide while my mom is alive. Seeing how sheâ€™s handled the natural death of her father and my brotherâ€™s divorce- it would kill her. If Iâ€™m going to let her down by killing myself, I will at least spare her surviving me. The question now is how to live with the pain. My depression and sorrow are a physical pain. It cripples me. Can someone remind me to take it one day at a time? Can someone remind me that there is more to life than the emptiness I feel? Can someone remind me what it feels like to be still and at peace?
