whateverLost my truck driving job, wife is pregnant with 3rd kid.  I have chronic back pain so no chance of a laborer job and I live in a tiny town with no good prospects during a pandemic. Life is one sick joke. There is literally no reason to be alive as a man if I cant win any bread. No gov't programs to find a new job either. I'm pretty sure there is no god or gods. Looking forward to a dirt nap. Growing up as a kid you buy into those fantasies that life is going to work out for you if you work really hard. It doesn't.
