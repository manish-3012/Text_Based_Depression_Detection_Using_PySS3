Its been a year but I am back to where I wasI literally can't take my life anymore. In the last month, I lost my girlfriend who I would give anything to when she wouldn't do anything for me. At the end of all that she dumped me. On top of that, I moved to college and feel more isolated then ever. I am wasting my life studying shit that doesn't matter. Nobody cares about the music I am making either. Everyone acts like it is a joke when I work my fucking ass off at it and I eant nothing more than to do it for the rest of my life. I enjoyed life after years of being miserable. I felt like things changed for the better finally and now IT HAS BEEN RIPPED FROM ME! I AM SO TIRED OF FIGHTING EVERYDAY JUST TO LOSE MORE OF MYSELF EVERYDAY. I don't have anyone to talk to like I used to either. I just want to give up again. There's no point.
