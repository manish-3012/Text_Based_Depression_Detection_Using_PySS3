my parents are emotional/verbally/psychologically abusive, but I have nobody else to live withMy parents tell me what a worthless piece of shit I am and how depressed people are evil and they forbid me from seeing my friends. I'm 21, but my parents have decided to stop paying for college. I've asked every single friend and family member to give me a place to stay, but they've all turned me down. I don't have any working experience, so I don't have money to get my own place. Is there any way to escape from them?
