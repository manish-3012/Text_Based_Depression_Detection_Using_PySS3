I need ways to deal with my girlfriend attempting suicide and harming herself.I'll try and keep this neat and clean grammar and formatting wise but I can't promise anything. 
**Backstory :**
I'm in college with my girlfriend who I've been dating for about eleven months. A couple of months into the relationship she must have trusted me enough because she told me about how she has depression and anxiety and that she attempted suicide, I didn't realize the severity of it back then because I can't remember feeling worried or sick. Over the months it became less of an issue because I told her to tell her parents about it and then it seemed to be smooth sailing until about a month ago.

**Current Times:**

About a month ago she had the worst week I've ever seen and its hit me like a train, I care about this girl, I want to quite possibly spend the rest of my life with her and I would be so fucking distraught if she followed through one day or found a way to properly commit suicide. In this worst week she started cutting herself on her arms with about 6 cuts with a razor so her parents hid them, she then found them again and cut herself on the other arm. Her parents took her to a group therapy where it didn't help but they gave her the highest dosage of anti-depressants and magnesium (something along the lines of she didn't have enough of something, I can't remember) and those made her worse. I came to her house two weeks ago and she came out her front door with her leg covered in blood and I didn't know how to react, I hugged her and then realised she was bleeding so I grabbed some tissue to help (This is no way helped) and luckily her Mum heard her crying and came downstairs and wiped away all the blood with a towel to find that she had about 8-10 bad cuts on her leg. A day ago I was at her house and she was in a happy mood and she was putting away a razor that I let her use in the shower so she could shave and then I watched her put it in the draw and then I thought nothing of it, early this morning she cut herself on both her ankles with that same razor and I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm always trying to be with her and to support her by hugging her, telling her everything is going to be okay. I've been told by her therapist that I'm one of the three things keeping her alive (the other two are her sister and her self-harming) but I don't know what to do anymore, I don't want to break up with her or take a break because I wouldn't want to get out of bed or do anything. I don't want anyone to listen to me in real life that has offered me support because I don't want to unload this onto. I just need help guys on how to cope with this because shes got cuts everywhere on her arms and legs and now her ankles and I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry about the formatting and stuff and I've relayed everything that I can remember at this point. I don't know if this subreddit requires proof or anything but if there's any way for me to do that I'd be happy to comply.
