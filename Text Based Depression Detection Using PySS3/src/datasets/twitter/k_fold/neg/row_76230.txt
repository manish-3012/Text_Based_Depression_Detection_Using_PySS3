Can't stop loathing myself, need someone to listen.Last summer, I cheated on my girlfriend of 6 months.  It lasted about two weeks, and I honestly have nothing to say for myself.  I was abroad and I lost my mind.  She made the first approach but I didn't fight it as much as I should have.  I confessed everything when I came back, and she was furious with me but stayed with me.  It was a rocky 8 months where she didn't trust me, and we were always scared of running into the 3rd person on campus (she goes to our college) and igniting all that anger and hate all over again.  Eventually she couldn't handle it and left me.  We stayed good friends, still talking, and still almost being in a relationship, but that has since stopped, her putting her distance from me.  Throughout this entire time, I've always hated myself.  I think about it everyday.  How I destroyed one of the best relationships I've ever had, and ruined someone who cared so much for me and gave me so much.  I don't know how to stop hating myself and loathing myself.  I know that I have to forgive myself but I'm not sure how.  I have no one to talk to that's been in the same position.  I'm ashamed to tell other people, and the people I've told don't know how to help me.  I'm a good person that made a really terrible mistake and I feel like it's pushing my life off it's rails.  I can imagine what my life had been like if I just pushed back that one moment, and it drives me crazy and I feel like I can't control myself when that happens.  I feel like I'm living in the wrong parallel universe and I want to get out.  What can I do?
