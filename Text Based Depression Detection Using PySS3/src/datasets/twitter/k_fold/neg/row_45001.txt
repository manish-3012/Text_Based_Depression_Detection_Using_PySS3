I wish my last attempt had workedI was on a hotline today and ended up talking about my last attempt in 2015. Poorly planned and executed of course. But I'm staring at the ceiling right now wishing it had worked. I can't think of anything since then that I'm truly thankful to have experienced. But I can think of the hole I'm in now and how much I wish I could disappear
