I'm done.Reddit. I feel like I'm done. I'm in so much emotional pain that it physically hurts. I've thought more and more about suicide in the past few days, and the thought relieves my pain.

I know being dead is, well, dead. But I'm in so much pain that that thought is being clouded. I just need something, I don't know, to cheer me up or get my mind off of it.

I don;t know what to type to explain why I feel like this. I'm 18 years old, and about 14 of those years have been nothing but abuse (sexual and physical), lies, and some rape thrown in there too.

I don't want to sleep, I don't want to eat, I don't want to move, I don't want to think, I just want relief. I have no one to turn to. I'm not looking for a therapist, I don't want one right now. I don't want to be drugged up.
