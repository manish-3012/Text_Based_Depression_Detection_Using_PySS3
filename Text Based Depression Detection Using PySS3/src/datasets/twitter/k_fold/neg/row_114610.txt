My dad can't appreciate anything I doWhatever I do, he never seems to appreciate it, weird right? why do i want validation from the one person i treuly hate in this world, maybe because he's my dad? maybe it's cause deep down i do want to make him feel proud? and sometimes i do just want to dissappear so that he doesnt have t continuosly scold me for my next fuck up. I dont know...I guess i'll just masturbate and go to sleep for a while. its all i can do

worthless
