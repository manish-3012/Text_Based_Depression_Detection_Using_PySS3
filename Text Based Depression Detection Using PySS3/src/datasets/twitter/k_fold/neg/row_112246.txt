What do people live for??I'm a recent grad and in my first job. How do people get up everyday willingly to do something they don't fully enjoy. I get it if you have to support a family or people rely on you. But, if you are just living for yourself and your own happiness how does everyone just continue. I don't hate my line of work, but I don't love it. I can't fill the void where I feel like I need to have a sense of purpose and anything I do just feels like delaying the inevitable. I can't shake this idea its causing me to go absolutely insane. I've been through countless therapists and am on a bunch of different medications. I can't get past purpose.
