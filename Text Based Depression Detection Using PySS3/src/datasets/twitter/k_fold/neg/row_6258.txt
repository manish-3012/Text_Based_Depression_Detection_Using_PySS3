Why do I keep ending up back here?Between the ages of 14 and 17 I tried to commit suicide twice, I was never able to get help her therapy so I had to deal with it on my own. I began to strongly advocate against anyone ever committing suicide and gave my perspective as someone who'd grown past it and wanted to show others they can too.

I feel like such a liar, I haven't gotten past it at all. I'm 23 now, most of teenage years were spent trying to pick up the pieces of my mental health so I've just kind of become a burnout, despite how much I loved it I had to drop put of college due to life issues and now I'm too indebted to go back even if I wanted to.

No matter how much I feel like I'm no longer the suicidal guy, no matter how much I don't feel like the one who used to harm themselves I seem to always find myself right back here.

It seems like everytime I find a shred of hope I'm confronted with even more issues that just snuff out the potential of happiness. I feel like I'm cursed to walk with this dark shadow over my head and despite how beautiful I think this world is, and how much I love some of the people over come across that I'd just be better off the end everything and finally rest. 

I don't know if I'll actually do it, I don't know what to make of any of this and I'm not really expecting any advice or even a response to this (thought that would be great) I guess I'm just sick of holding this feeling in and I just want to say it somewhere because hopefully it'll take the this weight off of my heart.
