thoughts of a dying historianFirst of all i would like to apologize for my English. I started to learn English about 7 months before.

I'm 17, living in a shitty third world country

I was raised in a middle class family, i got 1 brother and 1 sister. My parents are not in love but their fighting is not excessive enough to drive me into a depression or separate our family..

Due to stupid education system in my country i can only enroll into geography, history, public relations, journalism, communication, archeology and advertisement faculties in my country. 4 or 5 years before i thought that this won't be a problem for me because i am 'literally' in love with history, to become the best in this area (about 2 years before) i even started to learn ancient greek, i read and read and read to learn...

I got social anxiety, i'm not fat but but my face is not symmetric,  had no gf, no best friend etc. but i'm cool with that because of my ideal to become academic to learn enough money to have a life with honor i do not care. I enrolled for university exams and i did well, i got 2 more exams next weeks probably i will not able to enroll in the best university but i will get a cool one that is for sure.

But than i realized that im too naive. We all know academic job market, moreover i'm from a shitty third world country which got worst academic job market than USA. Like i said before, the only thing i want is earning enough money to have a life with honor so i do not care about workplace, i can even work in Afghanistan ! But anyway i'm jobless and here is more this year education system in my country has been changed, that means it will be really difficult to enroll to a good university.

I got not work, my family (like they did before) tells me that they love me and i can always live in their home. I know that they love me but i fell very ashamed, i fell like i'm consuming their righteous money like a leech, i'm looking for a work for 3 months but i couldn't find. 

Since the last week I'm contemplating a painless suicide to rescue my family from myself. I can produce benefit for no one i fell like i am the residue of this f*cking life.
