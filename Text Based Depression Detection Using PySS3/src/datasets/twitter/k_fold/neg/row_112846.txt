my decisionI need to stop writing this, just gonna post it.

I'm going to kill myself.

I'm going to fall.

I'm going to do it after seeing my mental health counselor early next week.

It's better that I die.

This isn't my first time planning my end.  I faced a decision when I turned 20 to either kill myself or take action on my transgender feelings which had been plaguing me sinceâ€¦ about as long as I can remember.  I went into it knowing damn near everything about the process, having researched it extensively.  I've tried keeping my expectations low knowing how unreasonable expectations can cause problems.

I'm 24 now.  I was on hormones for most of the last four years, making little progress.  At this point I can't even afford them.  I've been taking my expired spironolactone in a desperate attempt to keep my testosterone down.  I don't believe it possible for me to come to terms with my body.

I pick my skin severely, mostly on my right arm, stomach, face, and legs from torso to knees.  This started in high school, which was quite stressful.  I mostly pick in the bathroom, which has been a constant source of stress as long as I can remember.  I have issues pooping, or, well, wiping.  I wipe until I feel clean, inspecting the toilet paper after each wipe.  Typically the toilet paper is blooded by the time I'm done wiping.  Family and friends have noticed this behavior, at one point friends made it a unit of time measurement in school.  I've given this an awful lot of attention throughout my life, developing as efficient a system as I could to minimize it's impact.  I use exactly two pieces of toilet paper per wipe, wrapped around three fingers twice, if it's not terribly messy you can fold it again after the first wipe for a second.  Spitting on the toilet paper also does wonders (for the baby wipes folks or whoever).  I'm sorry about the detail.

I'm incredibly bothered by farting, I make every effort to fart on a toilet.

I have many friends who are wonderful and genuinely care for me.  I can't talk to any of them about any of my problems.  I can't burden them.  I hate to burden anyone.  I'm scared if I don't kill myself I'll end up burdening the people I care about more and more.  I can't allow that possibility.

I've been seeing a counselor person since I was planning on killing myself last, some months ago.  I was talked into going to an emergency room by a suicide hotline.  Misinformed that they wouldn't be able to hold me against my will.  Once I was informed I did everything in my power to fight it.  I don't feel there's any coming back from that point.  I am terrified of loosing control of my life.  With the intervention of some friends they settled on getting me into an outpatient program with a promise that I wouldn't kill myself in the interim.

I don't feel the counselor has helped, or the doctor I've been seeing for meds.  I've never believed much in medication.  They initially had me on citalopram, which has apparently shown efficacy in treating dermatillomania.  I didn't feel that was helping, and didn't particularly enjoy the side effects.  They now have me on lamotrigine.

I hate myself for all the stupid decisions I've made.  From 18 to 23 I've been employed as a web developer, offered an internship with the school district following a programming class which was largely PHP and moving on to better jobs after that.  I was making more than my parents, I had money saved, I felt secure in that aspect of my life.

Then I lost my job.  I wasn't fired, the company ran into financial trouble.  I was told to get onto unemployment by my boss, and I started it the day after.  I didn't collect on any of it for the next 9 months, burning through my savings instead because of my obsession with not wanting to be one of those people who exploits the system.  I was just stupid.  I've been stupid a lot.

I've held a few jobs that didn't last long since then.  It's been very hard finding work.  I wasn't able to handle the stress of my last developer job.  I've completely lost faith in myself as a programmer.

While I hold no love for myself, I've done everything I could for others, to the best of my abilities.  I've been doing an older neighbors laundry for a long time because she has trouble, I've tried to not let her pay me, but she insists.  She is wonderful.  She is concerned for me and frustrated by my behavior, which is entirely reasonable.  This is why I can't share with people, it just hurts them more.

I never know what to fucking say.  I've never shared this much before.  It's not like I haven't tried to get over thisâ€¦ I know I'm weakâ€¦ but I'm not entirely without hope, or I wouldn't post here in the first place.  (and I like the idea of leaving at least my own written account of myself somewhere, however much not touched on.)

I'm sorry.  Please don't feel pressured to respond.
