It's time to cut the rope.I think it's time. I've held on to it for months now, never wanting to get rid of it. I can't say I'm better. I can't say I won't do it in the future. I can't say killing myself is wrong. But it's time. What is the necessary sacrifice in order to live my life the way I want? The answer seems to be the rope that I chose to end my life with. 

Thank you to everyone on this sub who has helped me out over the months. I don't think I'll leave yet; I owe it to you all who helped me to stay here. Maybe I can help another person out, or at least give them solace as they leave. 

Stay strong my friends.
