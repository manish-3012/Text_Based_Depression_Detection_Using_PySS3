Police never took the AR-15They arrested me for some armed burglary and grand theft charges at 19. I was fucking stupid and I HATE MYSELF I fucking HATE felons. Felons need to die. Felon suicide is the correct answer, a criminal needs death because a result of death is reincarnation. I will be rebirthed in a new life minus felonies. I CANT WAIT FOR MY NEW LIFE!!! Iâ€™m really excited! Iâ€™m 20, but by forfeiting my remainder of my life I will be soon to be rebirthed and I will be able to be a police officer like I always wanted to.

Felons canâ€™t be cops or even work at FedEx as a slave, but next life will be better itâ€™ll be amazing! Iâ€™ll be able to follow all my dreams! I canâ€™t follow any dreams sadly this life I lost my full ride scholarship, college admission and canâ€™t get a job now. I am a liability NOT a person, felons are NEVER to be considered human beings they must be sentenced to death. Before I go to court I will be issuing the death penalty for myself and will safe the universe the trouble of me continuing the life. Human beings take a LARGE amount of resources like food and water and it is limited.

Next life I PROMISE I wonâ€™t be a felon. Iâ€™m doing the right thing by dying now. I canâ€™t wait to do the right thing next life. Iâ€™ll get my full ride again next life and get my PHD or Masters, but this life will be terminated ASAP. The police never knew I had an AR-15, and Iâ€™m out on bond right now. I still have it. Iâ€™m going to be using it now. I canâ€™t continue the existence. Felons die because suicide is the next step for criminals.
