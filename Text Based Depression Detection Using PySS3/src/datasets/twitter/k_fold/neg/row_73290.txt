I don't know where else to go.I am going through a very tough time very suddenly.  I haven't taken my antidepressants in days.  I felt hurt and alone and abandoned and I just took 6 325mg percocet just to make the pain stop, and that was all i had to take.  I feel myself fading and shaking and now i'm scared.  I've never been suicidal before and i don't know if I took enough to really be concerned.  do i have toget myself to an er? i'm shaking and my heart is racing.

The only reason i'm posting here and not just going is i really hate attentiona dn don't want to make a scene in front of my roommates
