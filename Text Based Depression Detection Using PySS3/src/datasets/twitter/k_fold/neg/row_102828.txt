I have "everything going for me" and yet I seem to consistently ruin it all.I'm in this program where I'm preaccepted to med school. Girls have offered themselves to me. I was popular, I had friends. I just did everything in my power to ruin it. No one likes me anymore, I just don't get happy from anything. I want to die. It would make everything so easy. It would tear up my parents but I just can't deal with this shit anymore. I hate everything. 

My friends hang out w me bc they know im super depressed and don't want me to off myself. I want to off myself. We only matter if we are useful and good at something. I'm tired of people's pity. I'm tired of everything. 

Honestly, I want to talk about suicide with someone that won't "take it the wrong way". Like if i told one of my friends, theyd act all uncomfortable and start trying to be as nice as possible. I just want someone that I can talk about suicide with, and have them treat me like a normal person. Not some random person on reddit, someone in my life. 

Tl;dr: how do i talk to the people in my life about suicide without them freaking out or treating me like more of a pariah than I already am?
