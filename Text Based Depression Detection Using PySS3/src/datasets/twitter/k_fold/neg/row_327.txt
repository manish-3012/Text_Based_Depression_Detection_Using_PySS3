I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™m truly lost here. Iâ€™m a 27 year old Dad with 2 kids. Iâ€™m married, but Iâ€™m not sure for how much longer. Tonight was the breaking point. I donâ€™t even know what happened. My wife found out I followed some cosplay (letâ€™s be honest, lewd) models on Instagram and freaked out on me. She blew up. Threw everything within arms reach at me, including a terra-cotta pot filled with a cactus and a sharpening steel. The steel missed me and went through the tempered glass door. This was all in front of my kids. She left and I have no idea where she went. I feel like a fucking failure. Sheâ€™s right. I am a piece of shit. Honestly the only reason I still had a family was because of my paycheck. If my boys werenâ€™t sleeping in their room right now, Iâ€™d just call it quits and end it. I need fucking help.
