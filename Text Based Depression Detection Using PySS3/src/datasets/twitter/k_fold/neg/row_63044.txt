Once I graduate I'm probably just going to kill myself.Right now a few friends of mind are basically my only lifeline I have right now. They don't know about my suicidal urges or anything but they're legitimately the only people that have kept me around even if they don't know it or not.

They all have plans after highschool graduation that will basically tear us apart. I'm never going to try and make them change their mind or plans, and I'm never going to guilt them into staying around, I'll just let it happen and just end it a few months after graduation.



I have no plans, no passions, no ambitions, I don't want to do anything. I struggle greatly to enjoy life at all. I used to be a huge and avid gamer but I haven't even launched Steam in about two weeks simply because I get literally no joy whatsoever from playing games anymore. 

Talking with my friends and laughing with them was probably one of the only things really keeping me around. And once we part and go our own separate ways I don't really think I want to stick around. I have no inherent value for life, I don't have anything else to stay around for. I don't want to waste my parent's support and attention having them help me get through college or anything, so I might as well do it quickly. I'll probably wait around a few months to make sure I'm not a recent memory or anything to my friends, I don't want to traumatize them or anything, I'd rather not make them feel bad. I'd rather just have them think it was something else they never knew about.
