I want to cut or attempt to kill myself again.I hate this world, my personality and mental disorders aren't compatible with it. It's all bad and I want to die. I have a method, though I'm not sure it would work. I'm so confused, my family was abusive growing up and even though some have changed I don't trust anyone in my life. I'm so lonely because I have no friends and I want it all to just end. 

This world is hell, literally nothing makes sense, it's all madness and chaos. I'm tired of this. I want out.
