I wish I was worthy of your loveWhen we first met and I saw your face.. I knew then and there that you were special. I remember being blown away by your bright green eyes and following you around the nerd store. My heart was racing and I couldn't get that dumb smile off my face. Fast forward to a couple years later.. our life is so beautiful. We quit smoking together and we decided to take our health more seriously. You enrolled in college and I'm so goddamn proud of you. I just wish I deserved this life with you and your love.. but I'm afraid there is no amount of self improvement that can help me. You're always there holding me when I have my breakdowns... you bring me back when I've dissociated so much I don't know what is real. You've pulled me out of a bathtub covered in my own blood.. yet this morning you tell me I'm such an amazing girlfriend.. I don't know what you see in me angel.. but I do know you deserve better.. and I don't know how much longer I can hold on.. I love you and I'm really trying to fight for life.. but my brain won't be quiet.. its never quiet.
