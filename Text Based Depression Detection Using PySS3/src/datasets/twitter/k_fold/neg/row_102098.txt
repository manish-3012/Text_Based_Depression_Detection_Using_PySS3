giving up even more woo hooi dont know why i cant stop feeling like this. i thought i got better. listening to my boyfriend go on about what hes doing and how happy he is makes things even worse. maybe im better off alone so nobody has to deal with this but me. but even if i was alone things wouldnt get better and im too scared to die. i already tried and failed. i just dont want to be here. anyone have any positive things to do to ease this? instead of me relying on bad stuff to take my mind off it.
