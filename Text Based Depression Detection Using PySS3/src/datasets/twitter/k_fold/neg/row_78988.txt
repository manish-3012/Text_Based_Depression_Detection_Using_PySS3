I'm not doing so great. I need to die. There's nothing in this world worth continuing to suffer like this forI'm in a very bad place. I went on a vacation by myself last week thinking doing something like that which I've never done before would help me in some way. Instead, I just felt lonely and suicidal the entire time and I thought maybe I'd meet people and forget about all the shitty things that have happened to me lately, but I didnâ€™t have a single conversation with *anyone* that lasted longer than 2 minutes in a busy, lively tourist town. Since coming back from the vacation I've felt even worse than I did before. Went back to an old habit I've been trying to shake of social media stalking people which just made everything worse realizing that everyone else is happy and thriving and surrounded by love and affection and constant attention. All I do is give and give and give, yet I get nothing at all from anyone. I'm bitter and heartbroken and fucked up. Have tried therapy through Talkspace and the therapist I'm paired with is not even remotely helping me, just spewing clichÃ©s and generic bullshit.

I genuinely, deeply, from the bottom of my heart hate myself and don't think a person like me has any reason to continue being alive. I can't think of a single thing that makes me happy or that's worth holding on for.
