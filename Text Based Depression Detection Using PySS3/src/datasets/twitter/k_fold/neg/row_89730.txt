Feels like Iâ€™m faking being happy.I feel fake and awful. I hate having to keep my annoyingly chipper attitude. I wanna go back to looking depressed so no one would bother me. Now I feel shitty and I canâ€™t stop being happy because people will think Iâ€™m faking it. I just want to die. The only way people would realize that Iâ€™m sad is if I died, and not because I look sad every day. Might as well pretend to be happy until I kill myself (soon).
