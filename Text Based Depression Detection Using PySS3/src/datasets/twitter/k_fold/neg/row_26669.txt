I donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymoreEverything seems downhill from here. Every single major goal Iâ€™ve had in life has either failed or is failing before my eyes. I feel like i peaked in high school and my peak was pitiful. I canâ€™t seem to even get a job that I can be content with. I would go back to school but Iâ€™ve ruined my academic record and even if I were to get accepted, I have problems dealing with authority figures.

 Iâ€™ve lost all my closest friends because Iâ€™m a parasite who leeches off of others to even try and get things done. The only way Iâ€™ve come even close to accomplishing goals is by exploiting people until they despise me. I donâ€™t even want to, but itâ€™s the only way I havenâ€™t completely failed before.

 My family are the only people who care about me and honestly thatâ€™s the only reason I havenâ€™t pulled the trigger yet. Honestly, it irritates me that they are the only ones holding me back. I just donâ€™t want my Mom or Grandma to hurt themselves because of me.
