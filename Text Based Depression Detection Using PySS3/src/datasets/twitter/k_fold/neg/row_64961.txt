Guess I'm backA while ago I posted on this subreddit. After that everything went slightly uphill. I mean it wasn't the best period of time but still, I felt decent. But I just fell deep. 

I'm 19 years old, live at my parents house, I don't have a study, I don't have work, I don't have a girlfriend, haven't had one in a long time and I have 4 friends. 

I feel lonely alot and I don't know what to do against it. I suck at communicating with people, I suck at making people happy and I continuingly dissapoint everyone around me. I'm really weak and I'm 99% certain something is wrong me, like brain stuff perhaps adhd or add, but I never got tested.

I don't feel like living anymore because I did something horrible just now. My mom and I were having the 5-6th argument of the day and I totally flipped. I'm a really calm guy, never hit anyone but I grabbed my mom by the troath after she said some vulnerable spots. I don't know what is happening to me. I even said that I would cheer when she would die.

I am so close to kill myself because I lost where I stand for. Not sure if correct English but idc. All I'm hoping for is that this life is over because everytime I slightly get up I get hit to the ground.

Everytime I slightly look to the future I get scared because I know I will fail becaues I lack all the lifeskills. I've been destructive in every relationship I've been in and scared of commitment. I'm just done with everything around me and mostly with myself...
