Going to kill myself soonI have nothing to live for. I'm fat, and ugly, I have no talents to speak of, I failed out of university twice and ended up having to move back in with my parents because I couldn't find a job. I still can't find a job. My girlfriend of 6 years cheated on me in the middle of all of this shit going on, so now I'm single with a crippling distrust of people. I have all of 2 online friends and no IRL ones. I'm on the spectrum, and also have anxiety and depression, and honestly the chances of me ever making anything of myself is zero. 

I was okay with most of this a few months ago, honestly. I didn't care if I would spend the rest of my life working some crappy, dead-end job, with no degree and no real money to my name because I thought I had somebody who loved me, who I was going to marry one day, and that was enough. But I was wrong. She didn't love me, she doesn't even care. I have nothing. And just to top things off, my cat has gone missing, he's been gone for a while now and I just can't handle any of this anymore. 

I don't want to get better. I don't want to pick myself up and try again. I'm a failure, I'll always be a failure. I don't need to keep living this miserable life just to prove that to myself. So I've started boxing up all of my stuff. It's kind of funny. I used to be a hoarder who couldn't bring myself to give anything away, but now I feel nothing while I box up the books I used to love so much and the little sentimental knick-knacks that my girlfriend had given me. I'm going to donate everything tomorrow and toss whatever's left. And then I'll just die. 

Idk why I'm even posting here. I don't want help. I guess I just wanted somebody to listen for once. So thanks for reading.
