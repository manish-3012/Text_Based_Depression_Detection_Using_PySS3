Where did I go wrongI used to be happy, life used to have meaning, now itâ€™s just unending misery, nothing ever goes as fucking planned, anything that happens makes me mad for some reason, and when Iâ€™m starting to feel better life just hits me in the face , whenever I plan something life uses some random unblockable event to change it, nothing ever goes right, everything I do is wrong , life is bad, life is painful, I want out, I want it to end, I just want the pain the sadness and the anger to end, please what should I do...
