Shitty family situationFor years my mental state has been getting increasingly worse due to a number of reasons, the fact I have anxiety and spending time with my friends in high school helped me cope with it but after school ended it was impossible to stay in touch with these people leading to me becoming more and more isolated over time, I fell in love with a girl yet she was way too good for me and likely would want another guy leading to me telling her I only want a friend, it may sound cliche but this girl was important to me, I could be depressed or enraged yet she could make me feel at peace just by being around her, and yet despite all the issues Iâ€™ve had my family doesnâ€™t seem to be very helpful as they never took my mental health very seriously, always denying that I had mental issues or giving such pitiful advice that if they did nothing it wouldâ€™ve been exactly the same, now at this point I really could care less if I got stabbed or shot tomorrow, frankly that would be nothing compared to feeling like your friends and someone your heart desires are better off without you
