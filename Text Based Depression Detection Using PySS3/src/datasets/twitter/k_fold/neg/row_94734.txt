Someone help (TW)So for the past week Iâ€™ve been dealing with a friend whoâ€™s been seriously considering suicide and theyâ€™ve been self harming. I used to self harm a lot and I havenâ€™t done it in months. But then talking about it has triggered me. I donâ€™t know what to do, because lately Iâ€™ve just wanted to cut so deep that I genuinely bleed out and die. I donâ€™t know how to deal with it all. Iâ€™m scared of talking to my friends because they always say the same thing. I donâ€™t know if I should just slowly push everyone away that way Iâ€™m not triggered or put up with it then eventually relapse. Someone please help
