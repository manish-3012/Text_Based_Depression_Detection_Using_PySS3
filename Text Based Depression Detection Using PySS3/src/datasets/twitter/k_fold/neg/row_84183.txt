Going to hopefully end myself tonightDon't want to be in this world anymore. Because I do some drugs my family look down on me and think I'm a piece of shit junkie nobody. they always say to me I won't be shit then tell me to get good grades and study and bullshit and think that makes up for it, I didn't think that at 15 years id be writing this. I was off of drugs with one of those vapes and then they take that away from me as if that fucking helps me. What's worse in my dad does the exact same shit I do and keeps making the same excuse (you're not an adult yet) Bullshit. I just wish I could speak to god and have him forgive me for my sins.
