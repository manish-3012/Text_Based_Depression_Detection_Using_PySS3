I can't trust peopleAnd it's going to lead to my death. 

My wife is talking to a guy on Facebook, thanking him for being "supportive"... Supportive of what? What couldn't she bring to me, her husband to support her through?!?!

This is how my ex wife started cheating on me... How the hell can I trust these people?!?

I literally want to track him down - kill him, then myself. Screw the world....

Hell, I may have taken too many pills tonight to try and get some sleep... I may not wake up tomorrow... Oh well, I've had a shitty 43 years on this planet, doesn't fucking matter to me.

Maybe I should take more pills. They are just sitting right there... What the big deal? She l ready talking to this guy who is obviously filling a hole I couldn't fill for my wife cause I'm obviously a crappy husband. She can run off with him. 

FUCK IT ALL. I'm not sure I even care anymore.
