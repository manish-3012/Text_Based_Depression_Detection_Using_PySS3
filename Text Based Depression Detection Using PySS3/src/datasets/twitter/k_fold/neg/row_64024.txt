Nothing worth living for anymoreI'm done with trying to go on. I'm a Paramedic and work has been hell lately. So many bad calls. I have constant nightmares, depressed, no energy, and lost all interest in everything. Even worse I wont have work in the city I live in soon and have to move away from where I've grown up if I want to make a living. I've lost my friends because I cant handle going out and they cant handle my depression. I recently dealt with a medical issue and was given some more bad news that despite surgery I'm still sick. Then today the guy I was seeing ended it because he doesnt have a enough time for me and his kids. I know everyone keeps saying things will get better but it's been years and not a single thing has ever got better. I plan on hanging myself the next set of days off because no one is going to check in on me until i dont show up to work. Theres nothing worth living for anymore. I work and hang out by myself despite trying to socialize but I'm done with trying.
