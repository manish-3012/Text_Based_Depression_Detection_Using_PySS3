Inpatient vs. Outpatient ProgramsI have a plan with some level of failure and I was wondering what inpatient and outpatient programs are like for those who failed to commit suicide.  Are they actually effective in convincing people living is better than dying or is simply a place to learn to lie? How do they treat you in an inpatient facility and what do you need to do in outpatient ones?
