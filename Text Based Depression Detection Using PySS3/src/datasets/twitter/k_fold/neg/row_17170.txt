Do I deserve to live?I want to start by saying that I'm a piece of shit garbage person, so if you're not prepared to learn of the terrible, shitty things I've done, you should leave now. I'm a little worried I'm just going to get a bunch of people saying I should kill myself, but I need to get this off my chest somewhere and I can't think of anywhere else. So here goes: 

A couple months ago, my fiance left me. I definitely deserved it, but now I'm struggling to view myself as someone who's worth keeping alive. We started dating and it was magical, I truly loved her the whole time we were together and still do. After some time (probably around a year together) I was extremely drunk at a party and ended up making out with her best friend, she came to pick me up and as soon as I got to the car I began bawling and told her what happened. Several months after that, I ended up drunk at a friend's house and there was some girl there equally drunk and I had my hand between her legs for a while. This time I didn't tell her for a few weeks because I felt I deserved the guilt and the shame, but ended up telling her because I couldn't keep it from her any longer.  Then another couple months later, my brother and his girlfriend were over and he passed out drunk. The girls and I were pretty hammered and started fooling around. We were on our way to the bedroom at which point my fiance started to feel sick and went into the bathroom to vomit (the bathroom is directly across the hall from the bedroom and both doors were open). I then began to drunkenly have sex with the other girl, but stopped when I realized my fiance wasn't there anymore. These are all probably my worst moments ever, but they're all my mind can ever seem to reach. 

I'm not religious in any sense of the word, I'd probably be termed best as a hopeful agnostic. But I'd like some outside thoughts. Is redemption possible? Or have I doomed myself to be this terrible person until my life ends, or I end it?
