Iâ€™m so fucking tired of trying everything.Iâ€™ve tried so many times to make posts like this on my main but end up deleting them minutes after. Iâ€™m tired of not being heard of having no one to talk to. Iâ€™m tired of the constant throbbing in my head. Iâ€™m tired of it all. 

Iâ€™m tired of the loop of memories everyday reminding me of my long term childhood abuse from my brother and my father. Iâ€™m tired of thinking about the absence of my mother in my life because of my fathers abuse, the few memories I have of the divorce, the few terrible memories. 

Iâ€™m tired of keeping everything in the house at bay while my dad is in jail now, him calling me and begging for me to testify for him when he gets out. Iâ€™m tired of taking care of everyone around me, Iâ€™m tired of fucking up time and time again with my girlfriend no matter what I do. Iâ€™m tired of dealing with my PTSD, my depression, and knowing Iâ€™m on the spectrum but not being properly diagnosed. Iâ€™m tired of not being able to properly articulate myself because I shut down, canâ€™t function if I think too long on something bad, or just now knowing how to properly express myself and construct sentences. Iâ€™m so tired. I tried to kill myself a couple nights ago, trying to down as much melatonin as I could, downing pills, seeing as sometimes that could be fatal. 

I didnâ€™t have the balls to commit to my choice so I forced myself to throw up at 4 AM, regretting my choice now. I wish I wouldâ€™ve just lied there and let it happen. Let myself slip away. Iâ€™m tired of growing up and feeling I was never good enough, being told I was stupid and dumb and anything and that I would never been enough. Letting that and everything else affect my relationship, my life, how I function and process everything. 

Iâ€™m so tired. I wish genuinely I could just die in my sleep. God I hope I could tonight. Iâ€™m so so so tired
