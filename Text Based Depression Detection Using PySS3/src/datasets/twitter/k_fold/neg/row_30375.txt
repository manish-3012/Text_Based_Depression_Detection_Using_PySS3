It's getting bad again.Long story very short, two years ago I was incredibly depressed and tried to commit suicide. This made me quit studying at uni for a year to do good for myself. After getting a job and starting at uni again this autumn, I've done incredibly good. My depression just "vanished" like that, I got an awesome new set of friends, I stopped smoking weed and I became social again.

This spring things went to shit again for unknown reasons, which is reflected in the grades I recieved for 2 out of my 3 courses at uni. I got 2 E's and 1 C. I'm usually a C to B person on everything I do, and those grades just makes me feel worthless because I'm no longer able to do an exchange, and I'm forced to take up those subjects again. Already I feel like I've failed completely in life.

Including this, is that I'm a 20 year old gay man. I've no problems with being gay at all, so that's not the "core" issue. The issue is that I feel incredibly lonely by being so. I've never had a boyfriend, I've never had sex, I've never experienced anything romantic. And for some reason, even though I really want to experience anything like that, I am really afraid to even try because I feel incredibly ugly. I feel incredibly worthless. And I feel like I'm a burden, a freak to my friends and family and that things would be better if I'm just gone.
