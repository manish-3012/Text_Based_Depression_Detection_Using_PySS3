Why does everyone keep telling me to express how I feel when I donâ€™t know myself?Iâ€™m just so tired.

I canâ€™t look in the least sad, or else Iâ€™ll get the usual â€œjust say how you feelâ€, â€œsharing it will make it betterâ€, and stuff. No. I wonâ€™t share, I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t know the words.

Iâ€™m just exhausted, why should I bother? Wouldnâ€™t it be better if I just disappeared? I just donâ€™t understand why i should keep enduring the painful task living is.

Love? Never worked for me.
Family? I just disappoint them anyway.
Friends? I just annoy them with my whining.

They always say I should express how Iâ€™m feeling, so they can support me or whatever, but it doesnâ€™t even matter how many times I say I donâ€™t know how I feel. Itâ€™s something I canâ€™t describe, at least not accurately, I hate when you ask me to elaborate. I try to no avail.

Doing stuff is tiring, not doing it exhausts me too. I want to get up and do shit, but at the same time I donâ€™t find the will to do so. Iâ€™d like to go out and enjoy normal things like everyone does, but Iâ€™d rather stay inside.

I tried a few times to end it, but I just canâ€™t do it. Iâ€™m not even good enough to do it. Iâ€™ve been SH free for almost a year now, and yet I miss so badly the euphoria of my blood running through my arms. I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™ve made it this far.

Just... end this... please...

I just donâ€™t know anymore
