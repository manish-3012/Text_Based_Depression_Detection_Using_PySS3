I'm only 22 but feel like my life is over. So alone and hopeless, really considering shooting myselfHi I am 22 in Western Canada.

I dont want to go into huge detail but ive never had a real friend, ive been dealing with severe self hatred my entire life. Now I am very isolated, I work up north in the bush for weeks straight, 12 hour days. Literally the only people i talk to is my coworker (who treats me like shit), food service workers and my family over text who live in Eastern canada.

I am so exhausted and hopeless with work. I want therapy so bad but the HR girl still hasnt given me my benefits. Otherwise I can not afford it. Even then, i am never home to actually get therapy.

I really feel stuck where i am. I have zero little hope for a good friend, girlfriend, job, self esteem etc. I am so exhausted from work and my mental health. I dont see a way to fix things. I have a shotgun and Im thinking of driving outside of the city and shooting myself in the head.

I really wish I was not the shitty person I am and i could go back in time and make different decisions. And man I miss my family. 

Any advice? Thank you
