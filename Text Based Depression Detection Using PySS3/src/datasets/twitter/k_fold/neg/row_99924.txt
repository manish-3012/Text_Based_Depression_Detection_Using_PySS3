Thoughts opinions advice criticism welcomeIâ€™m lonely and need help

Hello everyone. Itâ€™s my first time making a reddit post. I am 24 and suffer from severe depression. It runs in both sides of my family.

Anyway, I think my mental state has been getting worse and worse lately. Iâ€™ve always had thoughts about suicide but nowadays itâ€™s all I think about. I even make plans sometimes. I wish I was in California. Iâ€™d take a walk, get high, and jump of the Golden Gate Bridge.

But the thing is i canâ€™t do it. I canâ€™t leave my mom behind. I donâ€™t want to hurt her. 

I have no friends and I am not super close to my family. Nowadays I cry multiple times a day and I have no one to talk to. I feel pathetic. Iâ€™m even crying as I write this.

I donâ€™t want to kill myself because I canâ€™t do that to my mom, and I donâ€™t imagine Iâ€™ll die of natural causes anytime soon. Iâ€™m just in a state of misery. I donâ€™t know what to do. I canâ€™t afford therapy and my antidepressants never work so I stopped taking them a few weeks ago.

I canâ€™t make friends. I think I might be on the spectrum or something. I donâ€™t know though. I have no one to talk to and Iâ€™m just so lonely.  I havenâ€™t been to a good doctor since I was like fifteen so I wonder is it just depression? Sometimes I think I might be bipolar too or even schizophrenic but Iâ€™m not an expert. 

I never feel like myself anymore. I am just sad pathetic person living in my body. Nothing brings me happiness and I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Some days are awful, some are tolerable, but overall itâ€™s getting worse

Anytime I try and reach out to people I overwhelm them and they stop talking to me. Iâ€™ve been self destructive and pushing people away.  I canâ€™t even do my school work anymore and Iâ€™m swamped with work I need to do

My girlfriend and I broke up a few months ago and sheâ€™s living a happy life. She told all her friends (people I thought liked me) that I am suicidal (even though I never wanted people to know). Even though people know this no one has reached out to me. No one asked how I felt about the break up no one asked how I am no one cares that Iâ€™m quarantined. No one cares about me. 

I recently hacked into one of her accounts. I know I shouldnâ€™t have itâ€™s an invasion of privacy and a dick move. But I was reading her messages with her friends and all they say is fuck him (me) and that Iâ€™m a piece of shit. I know Iâ€™m not the perfect person but I didnâ€™t think I was that bad. I canâ€™t see all the messages cause itâ€™s only one social media account out of many. She said in the messages that I wasted five years of her life. To me those were the best five years of my life. I never meant to be a bad person. 

People always talk about mental health awareness and acceptance but when they see an example of it they just label me as a jerk or something. Anytime my ex tweets that sheâ€™s sad or something she gets like a dozen replies telling her sheâ€™s loved and supported and her friends are there for her. But why not me? Am I that bad of a person? 

My entire existence meant nothing to her. She moved on. Sheâ€™s talking to other guys. She even is getting with her ex again. How am I supposed to live knowing the person who knows me better than anyone on this planet doesnâ€™t love me or care about me. I meant nothing. She already replaced me. 

I am sorry for overwhelming you reddit. I just have no one to talk to.
