I have nobody to talk to and I feel dead.I don't know why I'm posting this. I don't have anybody in my life I can talk to and maybe I just want someone to acknowledge my existence. Maybe it sounds weird, maybe not, but I feel like talking to someone anonymously online is more genuine than in person because face to face the person has to pretend to care about you or acknowledge you.

I've had a drug problem for a few years but I've been clean for a number of months now, and while everyone says it slowly gets better, I've been slowly getting worse.  I seem to have the worst luck these past few years, even more so now that I'm clean ironically enough. I can't speak to my parents and I have no friends, through my own fault. 

I left college a year before getting a degree because I was failing all my classes. I wake up feeling terrible and hopeless and so tired, and it just gets worse throughout the day. My therapist likes to talk about himself for 55 minutes of our hour session, but I can't change him right now. 

I have no money, but I'm interviewing for a job that looks promising, that I'm worried about because I'm afraid I'll mess it up. I've felt like this for years, years before starting using drugs even, and I can't foresee it getting better. Every day is the same and I feel like I've been a zombie on auto-pilot for the majority of the last decade.

Even if nobody responds to this I just wanted to type it out because I've never said any of this before and I just feel really terrible right now.
