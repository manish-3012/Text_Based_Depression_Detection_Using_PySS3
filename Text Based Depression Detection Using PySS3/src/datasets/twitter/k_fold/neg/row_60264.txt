Hopefully I can get some adviceSo Iâ€™ve had issues with my best friend for the past 2 or 3 weeks or so and as a guy with anxiety and anger issues, I canâ€™t take. I start breaking down in school crying and getting mad, my other friends donâ€™t know how to help. This kid was always my best friend we were so close and now I donâ€™t know how to move on. I just need things to go back to the way they were. He hangs out with everyone else that is my friend so it is awkward and he is always giving me bad looks. If anyone here can help me that would be great. I canâ€™t let things go. I have ocd. Itâ€™s hard for me. Iâ€™ve cut my wrist everyday for the past week. Itâ€™s not healthy according to everyone which I get but then they say I do it for attention. Nobody understands. I just want to end it all
