To leave notes or notSo one of the biggest struggles I'm having is leaving notes (honestly, I'm trying to avoid suicide, but I'm afraid it's going to be a losing battle, so I set delayed emails every week, the shut them off if I survive the week and set it for another day, just in case). 

I don't want anyone to blame themselves, and I want them to understand rather than be blindsided, but idk if a note helps anyone, since the people who would get notes would already know why I did it.

The trickiest to decide on is my ex-gf. I want to be clear that she's  not to blame (well, she is essentially but that's not her fault) She's effectively out of my life, so she probably could go on blissfully unaware. But there's a chance she could hear about it (there's a court case between us, I'm not sure if the court would notify her. My best friend also hates her, and while I don't think he'd say anything to her, I'm not positive. We also have mutual friends who might say something, but I doubt it). I also find writing her letter the most cathartic. It feels like I need to let her know somethings that have been weighing me down (our relationship was very emotionally hurtful to me, and she needs to learn some lessons if she wants to have successfull relationships in the future,  but it was also the only time period in my life I was legitimately happy, so I want to thank her for that.)

tl;dr: suicide notes, thoughtful? Or selfish?
