Please HelpFor the past year, Iâ€™ve been telling myself Iâ€™m inadequate and a failure. Nothing has worked. Self positivity is a joke. I seem like Iâ€™m happy on the surface but Iâ€™ve been bottling up emotions all of my life and this was the year they all surfaced. The fact that I have no self esteem or confidence doesnâ€™t help. Today was the first day I considered doing it. I want to get better but it seems like things are just going to get more down hill. Please help.
