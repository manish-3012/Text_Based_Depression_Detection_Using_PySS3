What if I never get better19F, I've been suffering from depression and anxiety since I was 11. I've attempted suicide twice in the past year. I wanna try again.
I keep thinking I'm getting better, but every time my mood always takes a colossal drop and puts me back to square one again. I'm so scared, what if I never get better? I do everything trying to get better, I exercise, try and eat decently, I take medication and I've tried to stop self harming, but I just keep getting worse again after I think I've improved.
If I never get better I'll just keep being a burden to my friends and loved ones. I don't want my boyfriend to be tied down to someone like me, I love him so much but my sadness must be a pressure and a burden and if I can't improve even for him, the person I love most in the world, what can I do?
Now I keep thinking everything might be better if I was just out of the picture. I don't know. My head hurts. Sorry if it doesn't make much sense
