I'm useless and want to die.I'm useless to any and everyone. I don't want to be here anymore.. I'm tired of everything. I can't kill myself. I can't please my girlfriend. ED at 20 years old. Poor, always struggling, just tired. Don't believe in religious stuff but I do pray for death to come my way. Get shot, car accident, just quick and painless. Take me away from this shithole of a thing I've been given called life. I just can't anymore... I love my people but I AM NOT ok. I'm not... I just want to die and not feel anything anymore.
