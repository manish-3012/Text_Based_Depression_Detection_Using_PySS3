Truth is, I'm already deadI am 25, about four months away from 26. I've died countless times over the last four years of my life, trying to fight against my.mental illness in the face of constant symptoms and a family who(back then, better now) kept giving me.shit for things I had to do to literally survive my own mind. 

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from a new habit in the last year and a half - I haven't trusted most of.the thoughts from my head because otherwise I would die. I can't afford to trust my.brain, because it wants me to do nothing with my life, it wants to live as a lifeless zombie even as things crumble, my parents grow older and I remain someone who still hasn't scrambled together enough life skills to stand on his own feet, despite putting in the fucking effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

Depression, social anxiety and generalized anxiety, comorbid with or resultant of porn addiction. I got on fluoxetine and axepta last August and it hasn't made a lick of difference. Just like when I got on Amisulpride when 14, had a parent who was falsely told I had schizofuckingphrenia and  that I needed said meds, and all they did was [numb.me](https://numb.me) for four years.

&amp;#x200B;

Why did I take that long? Oh, emotions aren't a thing my family does or teaches very well, see? I'm the youngest of three kids. And also the most trusting. A fact which was abused twice - first to get me to see a doctor without me knowing on the pretext he was there to see my writing and then later to say not feeling things was fucking, normal, because my parents have been surviving with anxiety/depression for their entire lives. How? Oh, its 'easy', its a fucking interconnected social web full of high functioning anxious and depressed tools. Tools is a harsh word and label, kindly allow me to use it for now, they aren't the ones reading this.

It helps when you live in a third world fucked up the arse society, because then your shit gets normalized real quick. So you still end up with human relationships, and those here generally will know how fucking important that shit is.

&amp;#x200B;

Me? Oh, I ended up basically autistic socially due to constant isolation from.between 14-21 and now, and now at 25 am trying to get my BA in economics in a college filled with ah, 'normals', who are all capable of socializing. Well, all is a generalization, that's false. But point is they get accepted enough. Connected enough. They are going to college. They are...growing. And leaving me.behind, as I sit here post-relapse that occurred about a couple of hours ago. As I sit feeling like its time to die, because I've tried too fucking long noe, and learned far too little in recompense, because of a brain that just couldn't fucking focus.

&amp;#x200B;

And because there's no point without connection, why get back up? Here's how the vicious cycle works - fuck up w/ porn or other choices &gt; increased depression/anxiety &gt; people get wrong signals &gt; people run away from me &gt; creates resentment in me or apathy/crippling loneliness and sadness that itself is a self fulfilling prophecy and has to be fixed first every fucking time. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've learned near enough nothing, and have insane aspirations for the financial situation my family is in - no earning parents(savings can only last so long) - my goals are to become a masters in clinical psychology and then a psychodrama therapist, plus a writer/actor. I'm deadly serious about this.

&amp;#x200B;

Writing/acting help me stay alive. I feel me when I do.them. I am not a goof actor, my first try was when I was 22, I haven't studied it near enough nor have much practical experience, far from a shot in the dark, its.more like throwing a dart in a dark warehouse stacked with haystacks hoping it will magifuckingcally hit the bullsye some six hundred feet beyond. I don't do distance well, I don'[t.care](https://t.care) if that's accurate or not.

&amp;#x200B;

I tried to get so many things done by the time I was 25. My biggest obstacle ended up being a lack of support. And noe that they've finally seen their fucking mistakes and the anger and self destruction they set off in Mr, its too late, I seem to have hurt my brain enough via enough consistent sleep deprivation that I can barely focus anymore. I'm functionally dead, living based on automatic circuitry. This isn't life. This is a program being executed by a biological machine, the project of some mediocre second year BA In Universe Creations students in some fourth dimension, man just couldn't give enough of a shit to make this life more interesting. C grade suits im just fucking fine.

&amp;#x200B;

....

Look.

I'm dead.

I know I'm nothing without people. Understand I'm not dismissing individuality, I just know what's important in life, meditation taught me what things mattered to Mr enough for that.

And right now I'm fucking up with some of.the most wonderful young adults I could've had the honor of meeting in my life, people whose like I've never had in my life. I'm crying now that I've reached this point in writing this. I was numb till now. This is what's killing me most. For the first time in my life I felt connection, I felt relations, and I'm failing every last one of them.and losing them because how the fuck would they understand? How would they comprehend my levels of sheer social incompetence? The amount of constant self fulfilling prophecies I still fall prey to despite therapy? I am losing them and have no one to blame but myself, and I've no more strength left to keep going.

&amp;#x200B;

I was attacked for trying to survive, for trying to learn how to stand on my own two feet. I was given constant mixed messages and never received the help I needed, evenwhen I presented answers on a silver platter.

&amp;#x200B;

I have an addiction that at least for me kills my drive and many other things.

&amp;#x200B;

I have...you know by now, how much do you...no, you don't want me to, you are just reading, sorry, thank you for reading. I wonder how you are stranger, truly I do. I've no friends. Or at least I have lived constantly feeling I don't, I've tried and I think made 'connections' quite a bit in the last four years, yet here in this position even as I know  that its the reason I ultimately decide to die - I still feel like I have no connections - which I know can't be factually true with every one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

People, I'm tired. My problems are largely invisible, borne of isolation and sheer lack of learning and a brain that executes distraction with the same efficiency the Nazis used in persecuting and killing the Jews. Is it offensive to use that [term.here](https://term.here)? I mean to be accurate, not a racist arse. Its funny how much like.a white male I sound, consider I'm in fact fucking Indian. A fair skinned lad, but my dick is brown I assure you. I stand out and don't seem like it though.

&amp;#x200B;

...the only thing that keeps me going is Doom2016. Yeah. That glorious dumb thing. Not playing it. Its spirit. 

"They will be rage, brutal, without mercy

But you

You will be worse

Rip and tear

Until it is done" 

I see it through the lens of neuroplasticity

And in terms of seeing my symptoms

And fighting them with the same relentlessness the doom marine does, BFG division on loop whenever I'm trying to be productive. One of the few things that works. 

&amp;#x200B;

...well, I've...rambled quite a bit. Gone from tangent to sideline to roller coaster to abyssal web. Let me.bring this to an end with some structure.

&amp;#x200B;

I feel lifeless. For one reason or the other I've felt so for the ten years of my life. My childhood was rife with bullying, my adolescence mired by the mistakes of supposed adults and misinformation, and the first half of my supposed adulthood has been filled with constant attempts to move upward fraught with consistent failure.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm tired. I actually gave a shit. I actually tried. There were results. Just not enough to get to the point where I have a job and can survive on my own. Just not enough that I have a social web to hang out with,which really isn't helped my me having a smart ass cynical persona that is very prone to channeling comedians even when I'm social. All in a repressed ass society. I am a lgtbtq supportive, feminist, straight man, in a society where it would technically be normal for me to want the date the 18-19 year olds around me - and yet I seem to be one of three people who fucking doesn't because we are just about informed enough to know why that's a bad idea, and in my case because I just collectively slot them into younger siblings. They are giant babies, definitely ones more competent and professional than Mr at a soon enough point, doesn't mean I'll just forget what they were like when I first them. Hell, I find myself getting insecure and depressed over them surpassing me now, so that's fucking fun. Am I gonna repeat the resentments the adults around Mr gave me for the simple act of daring to grow and improve? I genuinely hope I'm dead before that happens. I would consider that a win. At least I won't pass that hurt, that conditioning on in that case.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm possibly going to repeat my year in college and will be stuck with even younger people next year. And like I said, I am losing these people, because I just don't manage to go to college every day. My attendance is too low. I will be disbarred soon enough.

&amp;#x200B;

...

I don't know what's ahead. Except me dying soon. But until then, I'll just go ahead and do my leftover assignments, BFG division on repeat. Just write, write, write. Wait for the inevitable suicidal ideation and sheer emptiness to return. 

&amp;#x200B;

Another day lost. Another phase of time I cannot get back. And consequence always comes to bear.

&amp;#x200B;

Tell me, is it really so bad I tried? Its not, right? It ain't. I know.

&amp;#x200B;

I died. I'm dead. This isn't lived. I've never really lived. I don't know what you fuckers mean by 'life' or relationships, forget girlfriends, I've barely had friends and human connection in general. Fucking Lovecraft was probably more social than me,the racist arse prick.

And yet I know enough to know connections are what matter. I almost wish I didn't know the source of my problems, paradoxically it would make survival easier right now.

&amp;#x200B;

...I'm dead. 

...its 1:28 am right now. Listening to the Next Right Thing. From frozen. 

I...am gonna be writing through the night. I'll go to college. If I'm going to die, let it at least come in the wake of an event where I public ally break down due to social anxiety and depression in college. Let me at least know I didn't give up and avoid before NY final moments. Maybe some psychology student will gain insight from it to help someone in the future. 

&amp;#x200B;

I am dead. I know I'm losing them. I already miss them. I wish I had connected with them all so much, I doubt they would believe me if I said so, but I mean it, so hard. I miss their innocence, their kindness, the normality they gave me a taste of INA life devoid of it. My first real chance to establish something so intrinsically important to me but I fucked it up. And how could I tell them? Tell them any of this? Unaware as they are. It would be manipulative. I want to. I want them to know what I'm going through, but more than that, I want to protect them from this, because they aren't equipped enough to handle it, and I will not repeat the mistakes done to me. 

&amp;#x200B;

Stories are all I've had, and all I want to dedicate my life to. Whether in writing, in acting, in play/script/screen writing, or...stories of the human condition. Of a human being becoming some kind of symbol.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm dead.

&amp;#x200B;

But if I'm to physically die and fade from this world, I'll make sure it is done with these ideals in mind. Heavy handed and ridiculous in.the nature of our world though they may be. How else can society change? How else can we move forward?

&amp;#x200B;

I will put forth what mindless effort I can...I will rip and tear, until it is done, either with me dead from a high rise jump, or...surviving, I guess, day in and out, and having learned to live and work.

&amp;#x200B;

If for whatever reason you read this...thank you. 

Please.

Don't tear down those around you willing to out in effort. You don't know why they are doing it. Please don't.

And if you are doing it yourself.

Please stop.

Take it from me. There are enough who will do it. Give yourself better. Don't internalize their messages and say those things to yourself.

&amp;#x200B;

Please don't end up dead like me. Don't kill your inner better half. They deserve better. Please. Please. Please.

&amp;#x200B;

I AM.BEGGING YOU. FUCKING PLEASE, ARE YOU GETTING THIS GODDAMN YOU?! PLEASE. PLEASE.
