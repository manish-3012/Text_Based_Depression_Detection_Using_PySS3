Im beginning to feel that trying to kill myself on my birthday might be too long of a wait.Its happening again. All over again. Just because I was late for class. Im so dissapointed, yet I don't know what I had expected. I hope I can wait until my birthday in december, but im not sure I can. People on here keep saying give it another chance, Im sure things will change. Nothing has. Same father. Same mindset. Same everything. I hate being here. I don't like stepping on the floor. I don't like seeing myself in the mirror. Because my reflection is still there. I want to go to sleep forever. The feeling of being asleep and unconcious is amazing. Not feeling anything. I just want to be left alone to rot in the corner of somewhere noone will find me in. I wish no longer to exist. I just want to pop and begone. Be done with it. Have no memory of what happened to me before or what happened to me after. Only that in that very moment, I no longer exist, and that despite bringing grief to my loved ones, I will no longer feel pain.
