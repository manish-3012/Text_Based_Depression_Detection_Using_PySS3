I fail at everything.I ****ing fail at everything i try to do i falied half of my GCSE exams with a d or e only passed maths with a c everyone of my family keeps telling me im so smart my whole life they have called me gifted and that i can do anything well i can't all i do now is set unrealistic goals like going to college.
I have failed college 3 times now and they won't let me back anymore i tried going on this program that was supposed to help people like me but i stopped attending i have thrown away every chance given to me and now i cant even go to the ****ing shop without needing to get the hell out instantly i leave the house less than twice a month because what's the ****in point? i just go to the shops and sometimes breakdown in the middle of an isle in front of all these ****ing snotty nosed ******* people that laugh and glare well **** em **** all people, people are *******s. i can't even talk to my friends i listen to all their ****ing problems but no one listens to mine my family is always to busy my friends are always to busy or just don't listen so i just lie in bed all day talking to no one on this stupid ****ing computer alone. i lie in bed all ****ing day im going to die from a blood clot any day now and so ****ing what i am proof that some people can't be saved some people are destined to die hating themselves and everyone around them i've seen over 10 ****ing counselors or phscologists whats the ****ing difference all of them just sit there and expect me to talk about my life well i dont know what to ****ing say the first 4 ****s had no idea what was going on because my Biological mother just wanted more money for herself by getting my diagnosed with something that could get me disability money scumbag ***** and where was my father in all of this you may ask? **** knows while that ***** drunk herself into a stupor and made me hold her hand while she puked he was ****in no where to be seen all i wanted to do was go to bed at 2 am but no i had to stay with you because u were being sick due to 2 bottles of vodka and i had to be the adult at 9 years old well guess i know why i don't ****ing sleep now that and when i do i wake up screaming from the same ****ing nightmares over and over and over every ****ing time..


all my life i have had no idea what i wanted to do with it no hobbies no job ideas i just drifted through high school then because i couldnt get into school anymore i had to go to the special kids school with classes of 5 people and basically learnt nothing for my entire highschool education so even if i did know what i wanted to do how the **** could i even start to get there i get a new idea every ****ing week but they last no longer than a week and then i realise im not cut out for it just like every****ing thing else try to write fantasy and i realise i can barely spell and have never read a book in my life but hey for some ****in reason i wanted to write fantasy and i tried but it was so generic and **** i have no creative thoughts im destined to be a ****ing drone all my life and work in a shop or something for 50 years or untill i kill myself due to hating my ****ing life i can just about manage to take basic orders from a smarter person without getting confused because my brain is so slow its like i have ****ing down syndrome half the time i cant find some words and i stutter a lot but not due to nervousness its because i just lose my trail of thought all the ****ing time and it takes me ages to find the word i wanted it takes me ages to grasp the most basic of concepts because my brain is so slow at processing information.
after the fantasy writing i tried to make youtube videos just because i liked video editing but then once again i realised i had no good ideas and no one wants to listen to my stupid spacker voice. then i tried to learn to code and it makes me want to die i thought this would be fun because games are the only thing i spend my time on and i love indie games maybe i could be an indie dev and make small games for the pc well **** no i cant even grasp the basics of html let alone something like java its so ****ing complecated and i just cant grasp any of it i tried going over the bits i could understand over and over just so i could remember them but i cant i go over and over daily and it just goes in my head and out again i just cant keep the information in there.

the worst thing of this is i actually have dreams things i want to do but i cant do them i will never be able to do them i want to move to canada i want to go on a roadtrip across all of america that lasts over a month and eat loads of food i want people to know my ****ing name more than anything i want that i want to be loved by many i want the world to think damn i wish i was as good at something as sarutak i want meaning in this pointless ****ing existence even if im only remembered for a 100 years i just want to be rememberd i want to be able to say on my death bed people knew me the world might remember me i want to be rich and famous and just give all my money away just because i can i want to go on adventures and climb mountains i want to live i want to feel what it means to be alive not stuck in this ****ing bed all week but i can't even get out the door i just stand looking at it and eventually walk away thinking maybe tommorow but tommorow never comes and i just say the same thing each day 

i never let anyone in trust issues i guess and instead i ***** and moan to random people on the internet because hey who you gonna tell and what does it matter il never know the person you do. we all die in this universe we are so small we are nothing the entire planet is nothing in comparison to the vastness that is the entire universe we will never do anything that will be remembered forever so how can you all go on about your lives? doesnt it drive you insane how do you not think about it all the time how? it's on my mind constantly we as a species are so pointless why are we even here by all rights we ****ing shouldnt be there is no logical purpose of our existence it drives me insane every action i do is pointless nothing matters in the grand scheme of things we are a speck of dust i dont do anything every day because why should i in 20 years or less il die of a heart attack anyway and then i will cease to be everything i have ever been snuffed out in an instant i cant wrap my head around that either how can we just die the idea of nothingness is terrifying.

Everyone i know is out being happy with girlriends, familys, work or whatever all my friends know how to drive and i cant even remember anything they teach me there driving lesson money is wasted because i just cant remember what im taught they are all getting sex left right and center and then they brag about it as if it makes you more of a man? everything i say they somehow make into a joke of when you have sex youl know what i mean or something how will that make a difference i know what an orgasm feels like how will having one inside a person make me a whole new person? answer it ****in wont sure id love to get laid but its not on my list of most important things you ****ing freaks. hell i dont understand the idea of a relationship i dont know how they work i want to i get infatuated with people but its a pointless thought yay we are going out now what. every woman or man ive been attracted to anyway has just said im too weak and timid well i cant help it i cant be confident and outgoing and the leader of a relationship hell a relationship would just make me more paranoid id ruin it by acusing them of cheating with no rational reason to think it. i get paranoid when im alone at night its why i rarely sleep im always scared people will break in and kill me in my sleep and im still deathly afraid of the dark like when i have the house to myself for a weekend whenever i go upstairs i check every room twice behind curtains,chairs, under tables,beds incase theres someone underneath then i have to keep checking the doors are locked and even then il get in bed hear the tiniest thing and be almost in tears thinking im about to die which confuses the **** out of me. Why am i so scared of death? all this **** that goes on in my head every day and i am scared of death? it makes no sense.

i just want people to love me but i dont know how and i dont know how to get a job i like i dont think its even possible i just want the world to know my name and im getting tired now...
