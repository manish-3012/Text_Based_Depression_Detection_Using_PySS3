how do i help someone who considers suicide all the 
time and is at tipping point?a person i know has been considering suicide for years and i want to help them. i've told them i'll always do whatever i can to help them if they want to do it even if it just means giving them somewhere to stay away from their real life and escape their problems, but they seem adamant that they have no reason to live. is there anything i can do or is it just hoping they never actually do it? they say the only reason they dont do it because they dont want to upset their mother but they dont feel like living any more. im concered all itll take is one thing to happen and theyll do it.

:(
