I hate this world, That's it I have decided to leave.When I was 5 my dad abused me. My mother ran away from home when I was 3. I beard 2 years of constant abuse. (although my memories are hazy but I still remember some dreadful moments) Then my dear mother took me back she married one guy and then another dragging me with her when I turned 13 she started pressuring me. That resulted me distancing myself from everyone. When I asked why she took me back she said that I was only a cover for her to do the things she wanted to do. She became abusive but not physically. She destroyed me from inside. Saying I was ugly piece of shit and that no man will love me. Thant people only talk to me because of her and i can never become anything. I tried to suicide once thinking she will care for me. She became more abusive saying I was never wanted she wanted a boy and that I will be never needed. I am tired now I have had it. I just wanna leave now that's it. Probably tonight. Wanted to let everything out before leaving.
