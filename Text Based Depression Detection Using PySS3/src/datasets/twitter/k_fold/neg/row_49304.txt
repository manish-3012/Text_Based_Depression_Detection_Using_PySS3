I can't be alone anymoreIf this goes on any longer I don't think I'll be able to go on. I can't even get motivated because of this lonliness. So I might end up just killing myself because it's just disappointment after disappointment in my life. Nothing will ever get better and no one's gonna come and give me a hug and cuddle with me and be there for me. So I'm done.
