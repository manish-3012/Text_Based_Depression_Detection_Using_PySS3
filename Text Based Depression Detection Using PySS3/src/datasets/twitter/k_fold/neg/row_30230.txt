I just wanna jump out the windowMy mother is treating me like the worst kid, for one time not being completely open. All the times I am open to her, all the times I watch my little sister, buy things for my mom, seem to be just gone. I can't do this, for real. I just want to die, cause till now, my mom was the only one being there for me, but after this, I don't know what to do. There is nothing left for me, when this keeps up. She is not fair to me and not talking about this open, but is mad at me for doing it just like she did. This night, might be the last of my life
