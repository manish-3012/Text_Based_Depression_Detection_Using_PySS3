new to this/ pls helpfirstly I wld like to apologise if this is needlessly wordy &amp; also for any grammatical mistakes or wtv.

hi so some context, Iâ€™m a 20 year old singaporean male currently serving my national service (aka mandatory army signing up thingy), and I do not have any mainstream (Iâ€™m vry sry if this is the wrong term) issues I.E financial, family etc.


so like the thing thatâ€™s bugging me is, I have consistently felt like dying for the past 3 months or so, like itâ€™s kinda sporadic whereby I cld go the entire day being happy before suddenly being like â€˜wow, I rlly wna dieâ€™.
I wouldnâ€™t rlly say that Iâ€™m rlly set on dying bc I havenâ€™t rlly thought abt how to die or anything like that, but Iâ€™m afraid that this might escalate soon &amp; i rlly hope that someone who has or is gg through this cld share their own experiences.

also Iâ€™m new to this thingy, so Iâ€™m rlly sry if I do not reply after this initial post, or at least until I figure out how to use reddit, tks for all the help received.
