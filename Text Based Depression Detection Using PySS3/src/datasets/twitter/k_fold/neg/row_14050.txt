Never thought I'd be here, and I might not need to be, but I think I need helpI'm not gonna go through the whole story, cause its a lot. To put it shortly, 3 years ago my mom moved with me for college. She and my dad had a fight and that caused this. Its been 3 years, and now I cannot take it. I still have 1 more year and then 4 more for pharmacy school. 

I think I am going crazy. I am going mental. She keeps wanting to move there, but then doesn't, because my dad can't make a damn decision. I'm scared that I'm going to start cutting myself, or that I am going to hurt myself in other ways. I don't know what to do. 

Can anyone tell me I'm not crazy? That I'm going to be fine. Cause I don't know anymore.
