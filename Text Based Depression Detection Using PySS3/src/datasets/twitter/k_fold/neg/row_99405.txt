Just figured out why I can't form relationshipsWent on a family vacation because honestly how many opportunities will there be? I wanted to make them happy by saying yes this once. Almost two weeks and I really couldn't carry on a conversation with any of them. On the last night at the last dinner, again couldn't say anything and was thinking about what would happen if I jumped off the ship. 

I am just pain inside. What's the point of talking to anyone when you are a horror inside. Everyone with depression knows how to pretend. We know how to hope we will make the connection we need. But the person I was or could have been is dead. Suicide is permissible if only because it's a misdiagnosis- misunderstood by the normal and the living. Maybe I'll have another sip of vodka or I'll just go to sleep. When my chance comes I have to remember I'm not killing anyone, I'm already dead; really I already died. I'm thankful th body lived on enough to say it's last goodbyes. The person you knew never had a chance. Fucking faggot died a long time ago. Maybe next time it will work out.
