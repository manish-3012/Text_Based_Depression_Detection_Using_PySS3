really strugglinghi, im a 15 year old boy, over the past few months I've realised I'm not happy in a lot of my relationships, I've come to the conclusion that my main two friend groups make me really unhappy. one group is a group of guys that are excessively toxic and i struggle to get a word in with them without being insulted and finding myself mimicking this behaviour around them to defend myself, which makes me feel hypocritical as is, so I decided I should cut them out of my life, my other group is a group of girls that come across as supportive and kind, however they regularly hold things I've done to upset them in the past against me, and i know that's my fault, I've hurt people and i really try to redeem myself by apologising and doing whatever I can to support them whenever possible but i just don't belong with people that I've hurt so much, so I've decided to leave their group as well. After this i have no one, I don't have anybody i can talk to to help myself, and I can't help but feel that i don't deserve help, I've screwed myself over by being a hurtful person in the past and i don't know what to do, I'm sorry if this was difficult to understand, I'm awful at articulating my thoughts but I'm struggling a lot, I've been so sad for so long, any advice would help, thank you.
