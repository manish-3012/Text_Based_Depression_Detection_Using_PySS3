everyone left me, again.trusted someone for the first time in years, exposed my insides to them and they ran away with the excuse that they needed some time to themselves. everyone else has left me and even though I still have some family that love me, it just isn't the same. I gave and took too much, and now it hasnt stopped hurting. I know it'll probably get better, theyll probably come back or I'll find someone else, but fuck. the pain just won't seem to leave this time around. I'm always pissed off lately and it's exhausting to be angry and to push it down. I just wanna stop existing. I don't know how to fix this.
