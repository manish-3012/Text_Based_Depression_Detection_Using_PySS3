I'm mooddyToday I was playing some league while listening to some good music, thus i got slightly happy, then my father comes and I expect some wholesome history but no it's just another lecture about how I have to beat my depression I swear to you he'd ranted for about 5 solid minutes without me looking or speaking to him, he d go and go forever , he's not helpful bc he states the obvious , that I need a job and do something with my life like if I didn't know that already.

Tldr : I don't want to die I just want my healthy brain back so I can resume my life
