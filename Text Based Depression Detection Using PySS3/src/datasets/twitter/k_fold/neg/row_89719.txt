if you're a suicide prevention volunteer, i have a question: is it common for volunteers to seek out high-risk individuals and talk to them in public or in school, without them knowing they're a volunteer? or is there anything similar like this?Edit: i'm asking this because, recently, a woman has been talking to me during lunch. i usually sit alone against a wall, but this is out of preference so i can get some semi-alone time during the day. Anyways, she doesn't go to my school (high school) and wears a "visitor" sticker. i believe she's finished school. she first approached me out of nowhere, asked to sit with me, and then began asking questions about my life (siblings, hobbies, pets, etc.) she's always smiling and happy and thinks everything i do is interesting in one way or another. at first i thought she was just a friendly visitor with some free time, but as the days of her visiting grew, i became suspicious. after three or four times we've talked, she asked for my number she doesn't show up every day and she has other people she talks with as well. have i been placed on some sort of watchlist, and she's a volunteer who talks to me to distract me from bad thoughts/suicide, or is she just a friendly person i met through odd circumstances? I'm also a female, so i doubt she's trying to flirt with me and if she is, then it's not going to get her anywhere considering i'm not a lesbian
