It's suicidal feelings relapse dayIâ€™m not doing okay.


In January I had a bit of a nervous breakdown. It was a bad year. My cat died, I was sexually assaulted and spiraled/started acting out, my grandmother died, my long-term boyfriend left me on my birthday (I was being a terrible girlfriend, partly caused by the after-effects of the assault. The rest was my just being an idiot though.), change of birth control (and depression/listlessness) caused a 30lb weight gain in about two months, my parents divorced, I had to move back in to take care of my brother and my unhinging father (who at one point held my mother hostage for a week through a campaign of suicide threats/sleep deprivation campaign/etc), the guy had sorta started seeing decided to become a girl (good for her in becoming who she wanted to be tho'!), and I was suddenly now flunking out of my last semester of university.


So that January I snapped and stopped eating for almost two weeks, only starting again after realizing that starvation was not an effective way to commit suicide. It would become obvious after a while and Iâ€™d most likely end up hospitalized. 


In addition, there were a lot of odds and ends that would need to be taken care of first: 

* The most basic would be to preplan burial arrangements, have them in place, and have enough money saved in order to cover that and any miscellaneous expenses.
* Notes/letters would need to be written. Iâ€™d like to write (60+) letters to family members, close friends, and people who made a difference in my life. Rather than focusing on my personal reasons for suicide, the letters would about the reasons why they are so utterly amazing and fantastic. These would take a long time since they will need to be perfect. There also would need to be the easier, template letters to ex-lovers, things along the lines of â€œThis notice is to inform you that _____ _ ______ has died. Please destroy any surviving correspondence.â€ Instead of email correspondence, Iâ€™ve always made an effort to create art and write letters. There are many embarrassing or more steamy ones that just would not want ever turning up to family, etc.
* My youngest sibling is very disabled and will, when heâ€™s a bit older, transition into a group home (which would also require more time. He would need to be happily settled for about two years before could consider carrying anything out). He already has a very good community around him of family members and support. That said, a line of care would need to be devised, making sure that there is always someone to check on him and make sure he is receiving the proper care.
* How to do it had been decided a few years earlier. So that part was not really an issue at all.
* Iâ€™m also working through a list of about 117 rather silly things (ranging from train hopping to elaborate magician tricks to pretend to be time travelers) I would like to accomplish. That is progressing steadily.


Totally crazy, I know. Suicide is now postponed for at least three years. Maybe by then Iâ€™ll have changed my mind. Who knows? It's a long time. In case I donâ€™t though, it would do to be prepared. So have cheerfully been putting aside savings each month and working on the details, mostly the letters and list items. 


Since January, Iâ€™ve mostly gotten my life together. Barely squeaked by but still managed to graduate, moved out, have a steady fulltime job, working on losing the weight gained, and make sure that have limited contact with family. There are swing dancing lessons, craft days, sudden disco dance parties, road trips to beautiful places, etc. Today has been particularly hard though and really just want to drink household cleaners. Every bit of me feels weary and exhausted about existing. Which is a new sort of depression, really. The world is beautiful and fantastic and marvelous and I want it to always exist. Just not with me. I'm not going to do it today, but still feel really down.

I'm not really sure what intended to ask. Sorry. Thank you for putting up with all that text though!
