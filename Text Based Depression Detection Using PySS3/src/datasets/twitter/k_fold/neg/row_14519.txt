Worried About Pen PalI have been talking to a pen pal for almost a year now. We talk daily, but lately her responses got kind of short. I also noticed she has been liking a lot of posts by an Instagram page that seems to be glorifying depression and suicide.

I know this person feels rather isolated and I am frankly worried. She even posted a meme to her profile that jokes about "when she's dead". I didn't find it funny in any way.

Is this a cry for help? How can I deal with this, all the way from the other side of the world? 

Do I just ask her about this? Will that even get an honest answer?
