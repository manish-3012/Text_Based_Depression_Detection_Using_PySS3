My worst fearThe thought of suicide doesn't scare me, but I'm terrified of the possibility of surviving. It's bad enough to put my loved ones through my suicide, but forcing them to care for me in the aftermath of a failed attempt feels even worse.

Also, I'm a trans man who FINALLY just started testosterone, and what if I'm forced to stop hormone replacement therapy because some idiot making medical decisions on my behalf thinks testosterone is what made me suicidal? I've been depressed for 11 years and suicidal for 10. It's not the hormones. It's me.

I can't imagine going on, thinking of how my life is currently. I'm in the middle of mandatory training for a job I hate; I dread going to work and spend all day depressed and irritated and bitter. I don't have the temperament for my profession, but everyone in my life loves my profession and tells me how I have the gifts for itâ€¦but I don't agree. It's painful to imagine going back to work tomorrow morning. I don't want to. But if I don't go, I lose the job, and everyone will know I'm a failure. And I don't have a solid method to kill myself--and solid methods are the only methods I'm willing to take, because like I said, my worst fear is surviving an attempt. So I'm at a loss. I don't know what the fuck to do.
