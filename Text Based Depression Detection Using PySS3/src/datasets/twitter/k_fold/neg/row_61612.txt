Everything is just too much workWorking to pay bills and expenses. Having to continuously shop for things I need. Having to not only eat food, but make nutritious choices so my body doesnâ€™t feel any worse than it already does or so I donâ€™t become ugly, even though Iâ€™m getting uglier every day that passes. Having to do things like maintain my hygiene. Feeling lonely but then feeling like I have to put on an act to meet and keep new people in my life. Trying to make myself heard and recognized and respected in my professional life. Stressing myself out to no end to get a degree for a job that I know Iâ€™m going to get tired of eventually and will want to quit (because I never finish anything anymore and I hate myself for it) but also fearing not â€œmoving forwardâ€ in life because  Iâ€™m fucking 23 and already feel â€œbehindâ€ my peers who have just graduated or started their families, and meanwhile I recently learned I canâ€™t have children and changed into a major that set me back 3-4 more YEARS and thousands of dollars in tuition. And for what? So I can continue to struggle through life? So people can continue to use me and ignore me and the world can continue to crumble around me? I donâ€™t want to fucking do it anymore. I didnâ€™t get a choice about doing it or not. And I wish more than anything that my husband or mom or grandma wouldnâ€™t be destroyed if I checked out, or that my dogs wouldnâ€™t wonder what happened to me or why the household is sad. But Iâ€™m also angry that I have to live for other people. I donâ€™t think I can do it anymore, but also Iâ€™m afraid of making an attempt and not succeeding and then things getting exponentially worse and horrifically embarrassing for me.
