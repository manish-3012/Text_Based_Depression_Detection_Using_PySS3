Passing Suicidal Thought?I have never seriously considered suicide before, and I am mostly content with my life as it is, I also have no known mental health problems.

Earlier I was watching a shortfilm about suicide(careful, it's graphic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZqkMWGc0js). About an hour or so afterwards, I suddenly had this strong urge and felt like killing myself was a good idea. I then looked around my room for about 10 seconds to find something to kill myself with before snapping out of it.

After going out for a while I feel completely fine albeit slightly shaken. Does anyone know why this happened to me?
