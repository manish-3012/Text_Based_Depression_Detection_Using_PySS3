Stuck in the downward spiral again... no way out this time.Over the past 5-6 years I've lost just about everything that mattered to me. My parents both died. I moved across the country with my husband and so I am no longer near any of my other family. I left my husband because he cheated on me multiple times and finally put his hands on me. Due to my depression, I have been destroying myself professionally. I have no money, no health insurance. Gonna lose my apartment soon because I can't make rent. And I don't have anyone to talk to about this.

I have been on meds for over a year now. Doesn't seem to really be working all that well.

I actually tried calling the suicide helpline tonight and the guy was completely useless. I would say something and all he would respond with was, "Yeah?" 

Okay, that's my story... 

EDIT: First of all, thanks to everyone who made thoughtful and helpful comments. I appreciate them very much.

Second, a big part of my problem is that I feel like I've dug myself into such a huge hole that I can't get out of it. Basically, my motivation is completely in the shitter. I see all of these great suggestions and advice, and I know a *normal* person would be like, "Cool, I'll give that a shot!" but all I can think is, "Yah, sounds great, but I can't do it."

I mean at this point I'm having a *good* day if I take a shower.
