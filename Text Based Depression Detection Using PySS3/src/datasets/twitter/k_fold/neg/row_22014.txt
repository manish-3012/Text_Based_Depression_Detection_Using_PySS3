I need advice on how to help an bipolar girlfriend.Hey there. I just posted [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/BipolarReddit/comments/3chfm4/girlfriend_is_bipolar_im_trying_to_support_her_as/) over in /r/BipolarReddit and I thought I might be able to get some help from you fine folks. 

I'll paste it here.

I realize this is long, but please bear with me. 

I'm dating a woman who we'll call G. We've got a lot of history, going back 13 years sixth grade. We were best friends early on, but by high school we were in love. We tried to date, I fucked some things up, and we didn't talk for a few years after that. We met back up after she got out of a long term relationship and we tried to make it work again. Our lives weren't aligned right, and she ended up moving over a thousand miles away to get engaged to a dude we'll call F. Within months of moving away, her relationship with F deteriorates into mere cohabitation. She is totally alone, with no friends around her and a fiance who is essentially a spineless manchild. Two years pass, she slowly loses her mind and winds up in the mental hospital. After weeks of treatment, day-long group therapy sessions, and medication, she is able to return to live with F. She's still very, very vulnerable and extremely unstable. Totally disassociated and basically a husk of a human being. She starts looking for friends, meets a dude online, we'll call X, they meet up (with F's permission) and she thinks she might like him. F tells G to meet him again and see how she feels. X rapes G. F admits that he knew that X was a creeper. G realizes that she's in a totally broken relationship with a man who doesn't give a fuck about her wellbeing. The engagement is off, the relationship is over. All the while, me and G have been talking off and on. We realize that we both have that same great chemistry, and that all the things she sought in other relationships were based around what she had first found in me. I do my best to help her through her difficulties. She books a flight home. We meet up and find that we're still in love. 

I do realize what I'm getting myself into.

She's still fried, though, after what happened with X and her crumbling family situation. She had been seeing a therapist regularly and taking Prozac while she was living with F. She still needs to move her stuff back home, which I intend to help her with at the end of the month. Her BPD is a major factor in her fluctuating moods, and she's using it as an excuse to push me away, claiming that it is for my own good. She doesn't want to burden me with her pain. She feels alright one day and the next she'll begin a days-long descent into the depths of despair. Suicide has been on the table, as I have recently discovered. She is currently unable to see a therapist because she's still just visiting and without insurance and her prescription of prozac dried up a few weeks ago. 

TL;DR: **Highschool sweetheart and I maintained a friendship for over a decade, she has some serious shit happen to her, and now she's moving back home to get a new start on life, with me. Her BPD is making her miserable, and I want to do the best I can to help her cope.**

Other notes:

* We're both broke, more or less, but I'm picking up as many hours as I can in order to help pay for her therapist and medication when we find it. How can we save money on therapy and/or medication?

* Because she only got a few therapy sessions in before she visited home, she never really got to process being raped by X. What can I do to help her through this? I feel like my hands are tied by by the fact that I am so removed from what happened. Are there therapists that specialize in this?

* She tells me that she doesn't want to burden me with her problems, which only creates more strife by keeping me out of the loop. How can I assure her that I am here for her, even if it means suffering or having to know about her pain, for her well-being?

* She says that prozac kept away her deepest depressive periods at the expense of her manic highs. Is this true for most people who take this medication? Are there other medications that help even people out without making them into a emotionally inert zombie?

I do realize this is a wall of text. I did my best to trim it down. I thank you for any and all responses you might have, and I will answer whatever questions you have.
