I think I'm going to do it tomorrowI don't know. I'm 21 years old and I've been having suicidal thoughts for about six months now. I own a house with my girlfriend. We fight a lot. I don't have much in common with her. 

No job. I can't seem to keep one. Money has been the biggest problem in my life. I know that I only have myself to blame for that. I really wish that I went to school. I even had a good scholarship. But of course I couldn't take advantage of that. I worked shitty jobs, and we bought a shitty house. Now here I am.

There's reasons for this post that I don't care to explain. But I don't know. I feel like I can't do anything to improve my life right now. My car has gone to the shit so even if I get a job, how will I get there? I don't know. I think I'm done trying.
