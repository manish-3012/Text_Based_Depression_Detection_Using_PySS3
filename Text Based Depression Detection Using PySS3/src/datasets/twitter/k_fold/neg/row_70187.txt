I'm just so lonelyLosing my younger brother to suicide was bad enough. Having my long term gf (who was there for me when he died) cheat on me was bad enough. Having my mom pretty much lose her mind was bad enough. But because I stupidly treated every girl I met after the breakup as a hookup, I've become so fucking lonely.

I mean Jesus Christ, my life has turned into THIS in just two years. I only really have one friend that I see once a month. My depression makes it hard to get myself out there. I also miss my fucking ex after what she did to me. So fucking much.

I'm lonely to the point where living has almost no pros for me.
