I have to stay alive for tonight at leastugh. im a ballet teacher at a local studio and i have exactly one child in my class. so i guess im not killing myself tonight even though i want to really really badly. that little girl wants to learn to dance and i need to be there for her, its not her fault her teacher is a suicidal mess nor does she need to know about it. 

i lost my one support system a few days ago and now i guess i need to post on reddit to get any kind of help. i dont want to burden or trigger my friends because most of them struggle with the exact same things. i started self harming again too which is just fucking dandy, can't wait to have mutilated ass legs in a couple weeks i guess. but i mean on the bright side i got an appointment with a therapist, but her name is "Dr. Slaughter" so that's uh. comforting. i guess.

working with kids genuinely brightens up my life, so im excited to start working again. maybe ill have some purpose in my life again? ive been missing that purpose for a very long time and have been struggling really really badly. i hope working with my students helps. i really do. i know im gonna kill myself one day, but today is not that day.
