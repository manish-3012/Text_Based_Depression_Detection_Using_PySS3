I think Iâ€™m doneSo this may not make much sense but I think I am finally completely done. Trying to keep myself together has gotten too much and I canâ€™t do it anymore.

The most fucked up part is that there is nothing actually wrong with my life that I can point to and say â€œthis is the problem, this is why I feel so badâ€ I just fucking hurt so much for no reason and I donâ€™t want my eventually breakdown and fucking mess of my life to have to affect people any more than it already has. 

I honestly think it would be better off for everyone I know if I didnâ€™t exist anymore. I am very very close to taking a bunch of pills, I have them next to me, the only thing really stopping me is that I am not sure it will actually kill me or if I will just fuck my life up even more.
