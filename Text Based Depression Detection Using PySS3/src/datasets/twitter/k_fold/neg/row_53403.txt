I am losing itI dont know how much longer I can avoid killing myself. My health has deteriorated massively, I still cant get o er the woman I loved she left me in February and every day still feels like the first. I dont want to hurt my friends or family but why do I have to suffer so long just so they don't.  No woman will want me I'm getting closer to death anyway, I should be happy I've outlived my inital diagnosis but that just means I get to suffer longer. 
  I have always tries to be fair and help those I care for never treated a friend or girlfriend with anything but respect and care. Yet here I am alone never good enough for anyone. What's the point why do I live? Why am I such a coward and a failure why can't I die?
