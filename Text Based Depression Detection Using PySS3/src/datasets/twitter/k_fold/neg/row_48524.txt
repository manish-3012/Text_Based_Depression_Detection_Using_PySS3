I think I have to go nowEverything in my life has culminated to this moment. Filled with grief, and despair, and regret. Feel like this was inevitable. Nothing is real. Nothing as been real to begin with. I have to attachment to myself. To my identity anymore. Something happened today and I donâ€™t think I could ever deal with it. Asked for help everywhere, but everything went wrong. Everything has. Been going wrong. Maybe if I wake up this has all just been just a very very bad dream. Drank so much to mull the pain and I feel oh so very sick I want to throw up. About to hang myself and take some pills to make it easier. So sorry everyone. I like to think we have some shared experience. Iâ€™m you, youâ€™re me, Iâ€™m everyone and  everything Iâ€™ve ever wrong. So maybe that makes it easier. This is so hard. I  I want to go so bad.

If this has really been all, and somehow Iâ€™m wrong about the multi verse and now everything exists, truly I am sorry to my family. To my sisters, brother, pets, I truly am. If itâ€™s any consolation I think Iâ€™ve been crazy for the longest time. Iâ€™m sorry. I love you all
