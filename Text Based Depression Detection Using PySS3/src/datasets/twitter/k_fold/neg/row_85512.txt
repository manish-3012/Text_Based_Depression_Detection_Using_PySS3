Today Iâ€™m 22Today is my birthday. Most people are excited about their birthday. For I just feel depressed. All I think about is the night before I left Oregon. That night I was sitting in a hotel in bend with my AR in my mouth loaded with the safety off. Everyday I wake up wishing I pulled that trigger. That was back in August I think all happiness has left me. I feel emotionless and have lost all sex drive. I donâ€™t see myself going far on life and I definitely donâ€™t see myself living much longer. I donâ€™t see the point. Everybody has abandoned me and all I do is drink. Itâ€™s the only thing that fills the void. I donâ€™t feel wanted anymore.i feel useless and not worthy of a happy life
