help no optionsMy service dog has been stolen and my brother won't give back my registered firearm. I have no quality or fulfillment in life. I've spent all morning sharpening a knife and i don't have it within myself to slice my wrist. If anyone would like to help me in my life please call or text 2539851116 or email jjj10nfl@gmail.com I'll pay.
