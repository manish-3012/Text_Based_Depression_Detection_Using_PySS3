Fucking shit this is hardI haven't been diagnosed with anything, nor have I talked to anyone about the door that had been going with me, I took a couple tests from my college and they all said I have this that whatever. Bullshit bullshit bullshit. I've made a thousand posts like this and everyone says oh just talk to someone it'll solve all your problems I'M NOT FUCKING DOING THAT. I do not care about my own life enough to go through the mental and psychological obstacle course to do that. I don't give a fuck. I might have a gig this weekend dog sitting and I might be able to go buy a gun. So unless someone gives me a magical cure that's what I'm doing. I'm 18 male in college if any one gives a shit about that extra information.
