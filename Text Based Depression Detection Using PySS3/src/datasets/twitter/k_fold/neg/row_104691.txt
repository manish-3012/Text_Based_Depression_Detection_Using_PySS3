I live near a farmYou might be thinking what the fuck does that have to do with anything? Well at the risk of giving anyone else the idea I'll tell you. Don't farmers keep guns? I live in the uk so it's not easy to get your hands on one. I'm thinking of getting a job there just so I can use the gun on myself, it seems the best solution. Jumping off a building? Might survive. Hanging around a dangerous area in the hope of being killed? Wouldn't give the pitiful excuse for human excrement the satisfaction. Making a pact with someone else? Wouldn't want to talk someone else into doing something like that. We're all truly alone. I just want to free my consciousness from this body, this life.
