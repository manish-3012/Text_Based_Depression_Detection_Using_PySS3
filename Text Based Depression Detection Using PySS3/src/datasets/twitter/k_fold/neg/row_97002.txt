Did something I regret. Got cyber bullied, bullied, and ignored. I can't get it out of my head...I'm not sure if this is the right place for this, but I'll write anyway. A few months before summer, I did something I completely regret. In school, I was surrounded by assholes who just thought of their money, bragged, and humiliated whoever wasn't in on the "new trends." Whatever the fuck that means. You see, I've always felt a lot different from others. I don't see the point in the competition that is fashion. I don't see the point in ranking one another based off of what we wear. I have always felt like I was myself, but it wasn't a good thing. I had true friends, though. Three, that is. One day, I felt strange. Like, I needed to do something. I opened my eyes, and did the thing I am to depressed to even think about. Ever since, things changed. They had security cameras outside of the building where *it* happened. They only knew who had been in and out of the building. I was part of the group of suspects. I had never been in trouble or been in the Principal's Office, so no one could possibly imagine it was me. I fessed up via email. I changed the story and made it sound *way* more innocent and harmless. They believed. All the fucking staff believed me. I thought that was it, but everyone else knew I lied. I knew I lied. I started getting bullied. Harshly bullied. I couldn't walk anywhere without hearing behind me that I was the guy who did *the thing.* I got cyber bullied and got told to go kill myself, or so it felt. I've felt depressed ever since. I don't find enjoyment in many things, or at least not as much as I used to, I can't ever cry a single tear. I have to forcefully make myself cry. I have now moved away, but I still feel horrible for what I did. I get memories of getting the worst names and being treated like absolute garbage. I haven't felt many different emotions lately, just regret. I don't know what to do. I keep thinking it will have a negative effect on my future. Like, I've fucked up my whole life already. I have made a grave mistake, and I know it. I have fucked up, and I know it. I don't feel many things anymore, and I know it. I feel depressed, and I know it. Is there something I can do? I've given up a lot of hope. Hopefully, someone read this whole thing. It feels good to let someone else know. Other humans. I hope you guys are good with not knowing what I did. But for the really curious, please respectfully message and I will get it off my chest,,, hopefully.
