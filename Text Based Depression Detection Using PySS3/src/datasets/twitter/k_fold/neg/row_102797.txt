Pretty Much at the EdgeI hate myself because I am fat and have either ADD or some type of learning disability that makes it impossible for me to be competent at basic things. Every time I ever try to do something, I am laughed at. I have other physical problems and donâ€™t have or want any friends. I donâ€™t even want friends because they will only bother me or make fun of me. I donâ€™t want good people because they will only be disappointed or unserved by associating with me.

The only reason I have not killed my self is the fear of God sending me to hell, but I hate God and tell him that every day. God will one day send me to hell for not loving him because I never will. I just want to win. That is really all I want out of life. If I get that, God can send me to hell, and I wonâ€™t care until I get there. By winning I mean just having a good life, good job, fiends etc. I also care about looking after and building my family. I should not be depressed, but I am because I will only ever be humiliated and hurt because of how my body looks and how my brain is broken. I feel like no matter how much I win, the day will come when I am completely messed over. I will find out that my wife cheated on me and that my kids are not mine (never been married). Stupid people will say, â€œBut wonâ€™t you still love your kids anyway?â€ That would only make it hurt worse you idiot.

Anyway I just flat out hate people and everything they do or say. They just irritate me to no end. Even the good ones do. Anyway, please convince me not to kill my self so I donâ€™t end up in Hell.
