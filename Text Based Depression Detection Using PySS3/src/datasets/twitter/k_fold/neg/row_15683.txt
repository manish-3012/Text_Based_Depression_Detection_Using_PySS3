I canâ€™t ask for helpYour whole life youâ€™re told by certain people â€œyou can tell me anythingâ€. Others will tell you itâ€™s brave to reach out. To not be ashamed of asking for help; after all, everybody hurts sometimes.

I canâ€™t though. Iâ€™ve done terrible things, things that plague my mind all day. Shame, regret, guilt. I constantly worry what people will think of me if they knew what Iâ€™ve done. The hamster wheel never stops. I guess itâ€™s a good thing in a way, as these feelings are a constant reminder to be a better person.

But every night, I cry. All day my face is numb with this constant worry, that Iâ€™m not worthy, worthy of all the things Iâ€™ve ever wanted. Secrets Iâ€™ll have to keep forever. Not even to a professional.

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can keep it up. I just donâ€™t know what to do.
