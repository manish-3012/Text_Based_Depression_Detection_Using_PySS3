I've come to the conclusion that I absolutely hate living.And it scares me. I went from thinking about it to only being scared of what happens when you die and worrying for my family. I feel like if they were gone I'd off myself immediately. Because of that I'm 90% sure I'll kill myself eventually anyway, because everyone dies. Living just terrifies me. Everything about life is a fucking joke. You work like a mule until all you can do is sit in a diaper and be afraid of everything. From falling to cancer to strokes. You work then wither away. What the hell is the point? I don't want that life. I don't want ANY life. I'm graduating college and from here on out everything goes downhill. I will slowly lose everything I love until I'm alone. The anxiety and depression in itself has doubled in the past year. I literally suffer every day. I'm trapped inside myself. And I do it all because I care about how other people feel. Fuck it all. Maybe one day I finally wont care anymore.
