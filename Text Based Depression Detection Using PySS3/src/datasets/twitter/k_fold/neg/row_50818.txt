advice: alcohol + depression, first psychotic episode.Okay, so I thought maybe I can find some answers here. I've had depression for a while now, I turn for help 3 years ago when I failed Art school and I wanted to kill myself, I was 24 at the time. I've had a mild history of self-harming when I was a teenager, and I haven't hurt myself since....until last night. 

I been having a problem with alcohol, I have a favorite cheap 20 dollar vodka bottle I like to buy when I feel like I haven't had a drink in a while, hook up my ps4, and play some online gaming while the room spins and I lose control a little, normally a day of drinking is premeditated when no one is around, and when I have a day off. Recovery is also timed properly, drinking a few gallons of water before hitting the bed to recover the next day. 

Last night, I went into an angry psychotic fit, I have had this happened to me before but nothing of this magnitude. 
I drank to the point where I was wobbly. I was happy at first jumping around then I started to hit my head, and yell real loud. I left a small bruise in my forehead from hitting against the wall, I also grabbed my dog's leach and started choking myself followed by more yelling and screaming, often saying things like "you are nothing". I hit my face and head with whatever I could find, including my hands. 
Although I have had history of self-harming I was carefully cutting myself in the arm, this time I stabbed myself in the arm with an exacto knife, and I bleed, a lot. I got my pants soaked, and dripped into the carpet. 

By then my drunkenness had escalated to heavy breathing so I called a friend of mine to instruct me to clean up the mess with the right products. I spent a few hours frantically retracing my steps to where more blood dripped in my house, and covered up the stain on the carpet. I also bagged all of my clothes into a bag and bandaged my arm. 

When he asked what had happened, I lied and said it was an accident. I think he genuinely wanted to believe it. I was playing games with another friend and he believed me as well. 

When my SO got home I had completely decompressed myself, drank a load of water, wrapped myself up in blankets and fell asleep. He came home, smelled the alcohol in my breath. I denied it, he doesn't know about the arm or the stains on the carpet. 

So right now is the next morning and Iâ€™m back to normal at work, like nothing happened. My arm stings from time to time, so does my head. I have to see my therapist on Thursday and to be completely honest Iâ€™m debating telling her what I did, sheâ€™s the sort of therapist that just goes with whatever I tell her, shit open-ended sessions with not a lot of definite answers at the end of it. Sheâ€™s never suggested an AA meeting; she never gives me an honest response as to what I should do. My psychiatrist I see only once a month because of insurance issues, Iâ€™m running out of meds and he still wonâ€™t return my calls. Iâ€™m taking Prozac and a thyroid enhancer, neither of them work at this point, and to take matters into my own hands I stopped taking them for a while and realized I feel worse without them, but definitely not any better, my lack of insurance does put a halt to the medications I can try and Iâ€™m struck in a vicious cycle with the ones Iâ€™m already taking.

I donâ€™t know what I should do, if I should take this seriously, or let the secrecy linger on. Work makes me feel good and I do my job well, no one suspects anything, but I canâ€™t help feeling that every time I donâ€™t have to work I put my life in danger. Iâ€™m a little scared to be honest, I feel alone, and I would like someone to give me advice on what I should do, I feel with age I just lose myself a lot more and I get closer to the brink of killing myself, while I get better at hiding it.
