Cliched titleNot sure where to turn anymore reddit.  A bit about me: 

Came here from the big digg move, and I've loved the site so far.  All you guys are so helpful and supportive.  I'm at an impasse in my life.  I went to college for 2 years, got lazy (found beer) and pretty much dropped out. I decided to join the national guard in hopes of making something of my life. During that time I was really happy, even though I got yelled at and suffered. I had structure in my life for the first time.  After basic, I pretty much had a falling out with the NG.  I went to the first drill, and then stopped going.  It seemed dumb, as all we would do was sit around.  That was about 3 months ago.  Now, I lost my job, my girlfriend, and pretty much am in HUGE debt with AES and FAFSA.  I already deferred, and dont know how much longer I can do it. Its tough finding a job (been applying at every place I see), and I dont know what to do about the military.  My phone just fell in a hottub (dont have the cash to get a new one), so I'm slowly losing contact with everyone in the outside world.


In summary, I dont know what to do. I already owe my parents loads of money from college, so I dont know who to turn to. I'm about to get thrown out on the street. I really dont know what to do.  Please help me.

Edit: I'm 21 years old
