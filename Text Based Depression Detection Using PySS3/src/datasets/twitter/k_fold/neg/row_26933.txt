Is SH something to do with anger issues or depression?Usually when I find myself biting, scratching hitting or cutting myself itâ€™s when a negative emotion overwhelms me like sadness, anger of frustration but Iâ€™m not sure what the SHing could indicate as far as mental health related stuff. Something is telling me the reason I hurt myself is because I canâ€™t take out my anger or pain on other people and I feel like a piece of shit so I take it out on myself. I truly feel like I deserve the pain. Idk I really just fucking hate myself and sometimes I wish I had the courage to slit my wrists but I donâ€™t. The intrusive thoughts and anxiety I get make it 10x worse. Fuck I hate life.
