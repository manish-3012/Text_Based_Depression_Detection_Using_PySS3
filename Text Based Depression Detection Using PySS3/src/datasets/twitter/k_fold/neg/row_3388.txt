Please helpFor the past three months I've been unemployed, dropped out of school, gained 20+ pounds, and moved back to my parents house. I haven't spoken to any of my friends for that time too. I have been so embarrassed of my appearance that I've been avoiding everyone and avoiding going out except when I have to. I have struggled with binge eating for years and feel like I have tried everything out there to stop and I stopped confiding in friends because of my continued failure to quit binge eating and stop gaining weight rapidly. This is one of two times that I have ever felt close to suicidal the other time was almost 10 years ago. I am just so scared I will never stop binge eating and even if I did now I still am overweight now and it will take months then to get back to my normal weight. I don't see a way out and I just could use some advice since I have no one in my life I can talk to.
