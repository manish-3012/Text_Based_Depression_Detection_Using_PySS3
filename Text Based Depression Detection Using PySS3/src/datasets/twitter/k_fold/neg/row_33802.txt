I just want to be doneMy sister goes back home tomorrow. It's making me really damn sad. But that's not the only thing that's got me down, infact it's only a fraction of what I'm feeling. 

I wake up every morning with no ambition for anything. I used to be an ambitious musician who would make good grades, regularly talk with friends and be ambitious to make new ones, and I would cease any opportunity to either make music or play video games or something. Something to make me happy and do something.

I just graduated highschool, I'm sleeping in til 12-2 every day, and all I do with my day is sit at the computer. I try to make music but nothing of worth comes out of my mouth or fingers. When my phone goes off and someone has messaged me, I feel no excitement and sometimes even feel annoyed. When night falls I feel nothing but guilt. Guilt for not talking to my parents as much as I could have, feeling guilt for not inviting my friends out to do something, feeling guilty for not pushing myself forward in my music, hell I even feel guilty for growing older for some reason.

I'm tired of the repetition of shittiness that's been my life for the last few years. I'm tired of feeling this way. I'm tired of being a shitty son, brother, friend, etc. I'm tired of having tears well up in my eyes every fucking night. I just want it to be over.
