"Nothing's wrong" but I want to die every daySo basically info on my current life situation: 16, heading to high school next week, I have friends, a caring family but I'm so fed up with life. I have anxiety and stress about everything that's remotely related to school or work. 

I used to have hobbies that I enjoyed including sports and making youtube videos. Nowadays the only things I enjoy are hanging out with my friends, doing drugs, eating junk food, playing video games and playing netflix. 

I constantly stress and worry about so many things. Mostly it's trying to do okay in school which I do for 2 reasons. Reason one is I want to try and get a good education so maybe I'll one day become something and not be miserable. Reason two is my mom is very strict about doing good in school (go to school, get a job and a wife and pay your taxes-mindset). These 2 reasons are major factors to my stress/anxiety/mental health. 

Right now I'm typing this in my optional maths course my mom made me take because I wasn't outstanding at maths in middle school. I'm here with like 13 other people who are also going to high school and being as socially awkward and anxious as I am, I've just been thinking if I want to die or just wait and see if life will get livable. 

Most of you will probably dismiss this as teen angst and whatnot, that's fine. I genuinely have no idea how I could feel happy and relaxed in life without being some lottery winner who doesn't have to worry about shit. I just need someone or something to vent to sometimes.  Thanks for reading if you made it this far.
