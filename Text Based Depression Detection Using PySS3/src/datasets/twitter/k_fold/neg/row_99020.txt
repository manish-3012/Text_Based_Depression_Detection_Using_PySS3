Hello, folks.I've given myself an expiration date of sorts. At the end of the month, I will either start a new journey or end the current one indefinitely.

I've always (silently) struggled with mental health, even when I was a very young child. Things haven't gotten better in this respect.

We've turned life into some big ruse to find meaning in something which is void of any. It's my belief that only two things matter in this world: (1) that one feels joy in the present and the future-present and (2) nothing else. This doesn't make life meaningful, but at least the ride is worthwhile.

I've never felt joy (except those moments of unprovoked euphoria). For years I held on to the idea that I would find joy in the future-present. I've lost grip on that hope. I think continuing is futile.

But for the alternative path: I could devote myself to philanthropy. This wouldn't make life pleasant for me, but at least it will be worthwhile for others.

I think of myself as a rational person. What are your thoughts?
