drunk againmy alcoholism is actually coming back. i once stopped but now i need to feel somthing other than anxiety and depression. if this is what adult hood was gonna be like i would of ended it before i got out of hs. The pain will only stop when i stop. i think by the end of the week i might do somthing drastic or im just rambling for attention now. but i have been thinking about it a lot lately.
