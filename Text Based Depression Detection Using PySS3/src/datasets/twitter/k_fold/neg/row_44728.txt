Posting again. Don't know why.I doubt I'll kill myself, but I'm having a really hard time with the obsessive intrusive thought. I know no one can help and idk why I keep asking around for it.

Abused (mental, physical, sexual, you name it) growing up, pattern of abusive relationships, severe and disabling mental health issues. Literally no friends, my one friend hung himself to death a few years ago. 

My only family that I'm in contact with is my narcissistic alcoholic druggie mom, my stepdad who molested me daily for years when he woke me up for school, and my brother who has raped two girls and who doesn't interact with me. I have a boyfriend who tells me that I need to get my act together or he's going to leave me and that no one else would tolerate me.

My only anchor right now is my dog, who I've started to imagine euthnizing so he's not left scared and alone without me.

This has been a lifelong struggle and I'm just so tired. I'm almost 40 and I have never known a period of self sufficiency or stability. I can't keep a friend or job, I'm living with my stepdad atm because it's the best I can manage.

I just wish I would die by some means other than suicide because I'm so afraid to do it. I can't make decisions at all anymore. I barely eat or drink, I struggle to even force myself to take my dog out, I've stopped caring about my hygiene or surroundings or people. I just want the pain to stop and never come back.
