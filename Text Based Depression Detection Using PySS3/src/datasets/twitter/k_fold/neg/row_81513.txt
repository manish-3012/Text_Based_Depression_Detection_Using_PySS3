I've done it all, now I want to restI have traveled to places a lot won't go. I have partied many nights away. I've made friends that will answer my calls at 2am. I have ran away from home to be with someone I was in love with. Returned home after it all went to shit and I was left in a coma after a suicide attempt. I have done enough. The only thing i wanna do now is slowly drift away and fade to black. Death, for me, is this long awaited adventure waiting to be conquered. My coffin is my trusty steed that awaits my arrival. I want to die. Maybe i'm drowning in waves of depression, if so I want to swim further in it's depths. The only reason I havent made another attempt at ending my life is because of how many people I have somehow affected. 
As soon as my phone stops ringing, my parents stop nagging, and my sisters stop pestering Im out. Until then I'll live for them. Death is inevitable it can wait for a while
