WhyThis isnâ€™t urgent so donâ€™t worry I just need to vent. Why the fuck am I even doing any of this and how do people just have this magical drive to want to do things? Itâ€™s not just ambitions or goals, I literally donâ€™t have fucking anything that I actually want and Iâ€™m just waiting for night so I can sleep. Like ffs how am I gonna want to keep going when there just isnâ€™t fucking anything! I donâ€™t have shit that I care about besides family. I donâ€™t want anything. How? Why canâ€™t there just be one fucking thing that I actually want to have or do or be or see? Am I just fucked in the brain? How do people do any of this? What the fuck
