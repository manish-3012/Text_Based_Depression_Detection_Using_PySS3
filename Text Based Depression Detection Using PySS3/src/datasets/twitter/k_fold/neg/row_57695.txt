I hate myself...If I had a gun I'd blast myself right now in my drunken stupor.

I hate my life.

I hate everything that I've become.

I'm a failure at work.

I'm a failure when I'm not working.

I'm a failure at the gym.

I'm a failure socially.

Whenever I try to learn something new, I just give up after a few days because I have no natural talent for anything.

I haven't had sex in 5 years.

I've never had a girlfriend.

I have no emotional connection to my family, to my friends, or to my coworkers, i.e. all the people I interact with.

I'm socially awkward. I can't form deep bonds with people.

I cut myself when I was 12 and have lived with the consequences ever since.

I have gyno, i.e. bitch tits, and I feel very ashamed about it.

I got full grey hairs at age 13 and got bullied for it. I've colored my hair ever since but I realize it's a deep trauma that I'll probably never recover from.

I come from a dysfunctional family and had a horrible upbringing. I was taught no values. I was taught no integrity.

I've had horrible LSD trips where I wanted to kill myself which damaged my psyche permanently.

I abused amphetamines for about a year or two and damaged my brain because of it. My working memory and my overal mental abilities are permanently reduced.

I work every day. Go the gym. Come home. Waste the rest of my day on the internet and go to sleep with suicidal thoughts.

I'm socially awkward and every interaction with another human being is a giant struggle.

I've cried myself to sleep for the last week.

I scream in a pillow multiple times a day, every day.

Despite all of the above, I have a huge ego. I'm very judgemental and think I'm better than everyone. How these thoughts can co-exist is beyond me. I'm an insecure narcissist.

Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself right now, because it's all I think about, and I feel that my fantasies will become reality if I'm pushed hard enough.
