Just numb.I haven't posted on reddit very much so I apologise if it's not written right. 

Let's see, 4 days ago I tried unsuccessfully to write a goodbye note to my family. I figured I'd just leave, so they wouldn't have to find me. I know it'll be hard for them and I'm trying so hard to care. I just... Don't. I stayed in bed that day, unable to move. My body was just too heavy. By the end of that day I knew, I don't see a way out. I'm tired, I just don't have the fight left and even if I did I can't live through another fall. 

Anyway, by the end of the day I was sure I was going to disappear in the night. Sat with my husband for the before he goes to sleep tv show. Do any of us sleep? When I looked at him I had this huge since of fear and blurted out my intonations. He just kinda looked at me for a long time, like he was trying to see my pain and couldn't. A look of confusion on his face. 

Now I feel like I trapped myself into life and I hate it. If I do it now I'm a bad person. Why did I do that to myself? I just wish someone would Indiana Jones my heart out of my chest, I already live without it so why does it have to sit there so heavy thumping for nothing.
