I take issue with a lot of what is suggested to help suicidal people1) I do not want to rely heavily on meditating, journaling, and exercise just to make living in the same body as my mind bearable. 

2) I am not looking forward to getting a new job or meeting someone new. In fact, most of the things commonly used to motivate people usually makes me feel more hopeless because I donâ€™t even want those things to begin with. 

3) I donâ€™t have the strength to go on already, why am I being asked to work so hard for a payoff Iâ€™m not even interested in achieving? 

4) I have hobbies that should provide me with limitless ideas and goals... but I neglect them because Iâ€™ve lost interest. This isnâ€™t just limited to hobbies. 

5) Setting a goal to express kindness and empathy is a tall order... I donâ€™t even express kindness and empathy to myself. 

6) If Iâ€™m being honest with myself, my overall contributed value is nearly nothing. I have not made a good employee, student, parent, or any role Iâ€™ve assumed. I think my value is best described as just being present to delay the grief caused by physically losing me. Essentially I am already emotionally lost to most of those connected with me.  

7) you matter... but do you really? I am a realist... Iâ€™m only worth what people can get out of me. I would be replaced pretty quickly in most of my roles. 

8) I have become the most impatient person I know. I spend most of my days waiting for them to be over. I spend most of my minutes criticizing others for doing things that occupy my headspace.

There might be others but this is what I have for now. Time for rest.
