If I were to die what would difference would it make?I finished school, have a "job", and have the ability to pay bills now. What the heck is life supposed to be if all we do is put ourselves into debt to be able to better our so called "lives". Country's an economic mess, cost of education is a fucking joke, heck the professors at my university were a fucking joke. 4 years of my life gone for what? Honestly wish I would get hit by a car if I came all this way for this bullshit.
