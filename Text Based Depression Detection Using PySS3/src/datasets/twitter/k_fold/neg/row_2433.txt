Nothing is stopping meI have no friends, all of them tell me that my depression is fake and that I just want attention, I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, i donâ€™t have anything anymore, I have no reason to keep going, I have no reason to wake up everyday, Iâ€™ve tried committing suicide a handful of times, but it never works out. So, if I ever do it, let this be my goodbye note.
