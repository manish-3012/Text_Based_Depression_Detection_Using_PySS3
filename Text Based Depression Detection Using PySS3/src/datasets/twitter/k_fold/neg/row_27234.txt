Counting pillsI have no reason to be as depressed as I am.  Or maybe not depressed, indifferent to everything.  I'm dragging myself through grad school, and considering this semester (my teachers are incompetent) I don't see the point.  I'm not learning anything.

I have very loving roommates and a fantastic partner.  My parents are always there for me.  I have a roof over my head, and I can pay the bills (even though things can get tight).

Yet all I've thought about recently is how many combinations of my sleeping pills and clonapin I could take to just fall asleep and stop breathing.  Take that with a shot or two and just end it all.  I've tried talking to different counselors, but haven't found anyone.

Suggestions...please...
