Iâ€™m not scared to die anymore (&amp; thank you all for being here)Iâ€™m really coming to terms with it. I wasn't afraid to leave this life- just of possible pain upon exit &amp; what could be the â€œthereafter.â€ 10 more days. All I can think of when I think about it is the quiet... the birds chirping on Earth &amp; the lack of war in my mind. Thank you all for holding a safe space for me to talk. I donâ€™t feel so alone anymore. You guys probably understand me more than anyone else in my life.
