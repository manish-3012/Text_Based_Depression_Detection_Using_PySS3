Well I made it to 23I'm still in my second year of community college, and I'll be done by the end of the summer semester. It's taken almost five years to reach this point, with so many failures in the interim. I promised a friend last year i'd make it to 23 well five days ago I did. Now, I just feel the weight of everything I've tried and failed to do, the person I want/am supposed to be, but i'm not. I've known for awhile that my meds are slowly failing and i plan on getting them switched next week. I guess i'm just tired of fighting and trying to explain to my parents what depression actually means. That my health is more important than school will ever be, but it sucks feeling like a failure. Plus having left my job (boo retail). I'd rather pile on course work, using coursera + college classes and take a break from working, but i don't know how to explain that. Or for that matter how to find that motivating "spark" i had once. Other than to get up exercise and study until it comes back, but well that's hard to start. Leaving seems easier right now than making it to 24. I just needed a distraction from window shopping for things i shouldn't and to vent I suppose. 
Thanks for reading folks.
