Should I tell my best friend that I am planning to kill myself this summer?I don't think I will be leaving behind any goodbye notes or a suicide letter, but I've been thinking that maybe I should tell my best friend. 

I don't think my friend is in the best place mentally either, so I don't know which decision will be the least harmful. 
So maybe telling her will give her a little bit of closure you know? She can ask questions if she has any or we can try and do the things we have been planning to do together before I ain't around anymore. But at the same time it could be worse for her if she tries to stop me (and I don't think there is anything she could say or do that would keep me alive, at least I can't think of anything) but at the end I still end up dead. So maybe she would fault herself for not being able to stop me. 
At the other hand, if I don't tell her I feel like she will always feel like she should have seen it coming or something, you know? And I plan on jumping off a cliff at a certain spot, which isn't really visible so I don't think my body will be found for a couple of weeks or even months, so I don't want her to suffer for months just to find out I have been dead for the whole time.
