My mind feels like a scary place.I just broke up with my boyfriend and I feel like I'm falling apart. I feel like I'm crazy. I feel like my patterns are a burden on my loved ones. I want to want to live. I've been this depressed before, why am I even still around. I see myself dying over and over in my mind. I need help.
