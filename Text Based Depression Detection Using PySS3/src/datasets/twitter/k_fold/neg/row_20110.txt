ShotgunMy girlfriend decided tonight that she no longer wants to be with me, she says she's just trapped in this relationship because she's afraid I'll hurt myself. I broke up with her, and now I'm going to shoot myself to make sure she's not stuck with me anymore. 

Not sure why I'm posting this, maybe just to help convince myself to do it. In any case, please remember: 

 be careful who you love, because even if they don't love you back, you can't change your feelings for them and that might just be your downfall, it was mine.

I love you A, I'll see ya over there.
