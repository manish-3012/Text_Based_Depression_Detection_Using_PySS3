Tried to overdose but hallucinated for 3 days insteadI took everything I could find with rum, got sleeoy but woke up the next day. 

I was delirious in my apartment block, talking to people that weren't there. Spent hours trying to get into a neighbours car because I saw my mum sitting in the drivers seat. The owner for very aggressive and now I understand why.

Waiting for the ambulance now, it's been almost 2 hours (I'm in England)

I guess I just want to spread awareness that failed attempts can really fuck you up
