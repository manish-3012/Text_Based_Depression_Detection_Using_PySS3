I'm starting to believe that some people can't escape suicideI'm at a point where I've realized that, no matter the medication or therapy I receive for my depression, my situation is still what it is, and as long as that's true the best I can hope is to be a little less miserable. The only thing I can really change would make it worse. So, I don't think I'll be able to get away from this ever growing desire to escape all the pain through death. The one thing holding me back is also one of the strongest points of pain. No one can help. I'm alone in the dark, missing my happiness, while also feeling too weak to keep reaching for it. I never thought my depression could be this bad, but once it infects your love, it grows almost invincible, especially when your love makes you both happy and miserable at once. I don't even know if I'll leave this up. I'm just tired of being alone when I'm trying to fight the urge to die.
