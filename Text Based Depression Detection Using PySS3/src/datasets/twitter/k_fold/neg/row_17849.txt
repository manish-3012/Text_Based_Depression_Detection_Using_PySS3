Heart break brings out the worst. I miss you.So preface. My thoughts are scattered and Iâ€™m using the app. I have a boyfriend. Weâ€™ve been together for years 3 the first time and 3 now. Too long. Iâ€™ve been trying to work up the courage to leave him. Iâ€™m trying. 

I had a friend who was close to me. We dated for a few years. He was great. He took care of me and loved me like no one else ever had. I was stupid. I thought I wanted my old(current) boyfriend back. Well itâ€™s been three years. For the last year Iâ€™ve been depressed and unhappy. I still talk to my friend from time to time but recently hes gotten distant. He stopped answering my calls, my texts, everything. He finally told me he was seeing someone. It broke my heart. Iâ€™ve been trying to leave my boyfriend because I know this other man would treat me like I should be. Iâ€™ve been looking for a way out. First I was trying to move, itâ€™s hard. I canâ€™t afford a place alone and I donâ€™t like people enough to want to have a roommate. 

Two weeks ago I got one of my boyfriends pistols and walked around the house with it in my hand. I kept putting it up to my temple. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to pull the trigger. 

Heartbreak is a real killer. I donâ€™t care anymore. I want to be happy with myself and with someone who loves me. 

Thanks for reading and being here whoever you are.
