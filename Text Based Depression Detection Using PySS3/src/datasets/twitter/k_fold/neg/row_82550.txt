feel incapable of going on some kind words would go a long wayi'm a student at university i have exams in 3 days i have done no study and skipped most of my lectures the term before. i'm having an absolute meltdown i've been struggling with depression all throughout my teenage years and have always fantasized about suicide but now i feel it's moving beyond a fantasy and have found myself genuinely consider. ei don't know what to do, i guess i just need someone to tell me that everything will be ok. i'm in my third year of a very difficult degree i've worked so hard on but now i've just thrown that all away as i'm sure to fail or barely pass, i don't fucking knoww. i just want help. i don't know what to do but if i don't calm down osoono i feel like i can't sotp myself from doing it.
