Iâ€™m not choosing to live but Iâ€™m afraid of dyingI donâ€™t want to keep living. Life is just upsetting and is a perpetual source of upsetting events and reasons to die. But every time I look for ways to die Iâ€™m instead met by ways that attempted suicide will end up with me having long term disabilities or brain damage. So my options are to live a life that makes me want to die or to risk taking away my ability to do anything about it and increasing my overall suffering with no benefit. I just want to be happy but it isnâ€™t happening and it looks like it never will. I donâ€™t know what to do.
