Does it even matterAnother throwaway post.  I'll probably delete this one from my history as I've posted on this subreddit before and I can't stop myself from coming back.  I can't get these feelings to leave me alone.  Was good for a little while but here we are again.  Jesus why do I keep thinking this way.  I'm so scared, but I feel like this is just the way it's supposed to be.  I'm sitting up in bed like I always do contemplating shooting myself in the head the next time I go home from college but i am scared that it's not going to be fatal.  I know I'm not allowed to ask about how to kill myself on this subreddit, and it may seem extremely self-explanatory, but I just gotta know where to aim.  I can't make a mistake. It has to go the way I keep planning it.  

God damnit all.  What am I expecting to get out of this post?  I'm just rambling again because I have to get these thoughts out there somehow.  I just want the green light.  Someone please just validate my emotions.  It's easier to believe them if someone else agrees with me.  But that's not going to happen because who in the hell would tell someone to go kill themselves.
