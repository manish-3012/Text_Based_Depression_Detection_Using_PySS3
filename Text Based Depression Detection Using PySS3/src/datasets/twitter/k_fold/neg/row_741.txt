I dont see any future in front of meGot shitty genetics worse than you can imagine ; internet is the only place i can barely socialize , have zero motivation to do anything , ugly and awkward 
Also people hate me before barely know about me , i get hated for no reason ...

One year ago i was doing better , i thought things are finally getting better but no returned to the where i had started . Just shitposting on the internet and begging for the attention i couldnt get in the real life. 
And being depressed and numb all  the day. 

God knows that i still got dreams or hope but no one will accept me , i will always get hated and dumped for no reason .A person speaks me on the first meeting  Ä±t is good but on the second day they will dump me to the oblivion . This is a sick cycle ...

I cant see any hope now , light or anything , they say Ä±t will get better but when ?
If you really want to know how i feel just imagine that 
when you look in the mirror you are seeing your worst sworn enemy and have to live as this person ...
Also i got zero skills as you can imagine 
Just dont be me .
