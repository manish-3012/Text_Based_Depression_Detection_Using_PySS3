OverwhelmedI used to be really good at dealing with my issues and not letting them get on top of me. Recently the pain has been really hard to handle, worst part is I can't even pin-point the source of it so whenever I open up to people and talk about it, it seems like I'm sad for no reason.

My life isn't bad at all but it doesn't change the fact that existing is becoming really exhausting, I just don't want to be doing any of this anymore. The only thing that's keeping me going is the fact that I make music and there is a couple milestones that I have to reach, I'm sitting on a lot of material and I need to release it gradually since it won't have the same impact if it's released all at once. 

My mind is all over the place, I sleep through the days and ignore all my friends. Half the time I don't even know what day it is. Times like this I wish I was completely alone so it wouldn't hurt anyone if I disappeared; don't know whether I should cherish the time I have with the people around me and create good memories for them to remember me by or if I should push them all away and make them hate me so when I'm gone it's not as impactful.
