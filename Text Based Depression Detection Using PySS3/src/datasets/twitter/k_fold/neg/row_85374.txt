I'm wearing too thinI have cancer and my last surgery was 2 days ago. The doctor refused me pain medication out of some weird philosophy so I've been in constant pain. I have a major mental illness that I can't manage. Money is dwindling and because I'm so sick I can't afford to support my family anymore. 

There isn't really any light at the end of the tunnel and I'm so tired. My body and mind are just so tired. I can't live like this anymore.
