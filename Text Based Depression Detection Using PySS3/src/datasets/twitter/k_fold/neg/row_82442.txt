Im going to overdose myself sometime this weekPast few days have been really rough as my parents are constantly fighting and arguing with me. They never loved me, and they never try to understand my mental health issues. They think im just faking it. The doctors and I have tried our best explaining to my parents about my issues, but nope they dont listen, just scold me for being an attention seeker. Nothing in my life is just gonna improve, theres no point continuing with therapy or meds when my whole family is in their way. Well right now I have a huge stash of clonazepam with me, and i will fucking do it if i cant take it anymore and im not gonna give a shit what my family has to say.

Fuck everyone, especially my parents.
