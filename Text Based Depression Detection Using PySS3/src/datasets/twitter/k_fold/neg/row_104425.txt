It was my birthday todayIt's past midnight so it technically isn't anymore.
Except for my parents I was only congratulated by strangers, tho considering I'm posting here it's not like I feel there is much to congratulate anyway.

All my potential was wasted, I haven't achieved anything, I'm at the bottom and there is no top to climb to, even if there was I have given up anyway. Life taught me that effort doesn't pay, I was lied to by society that it does. 

There is such emptiness in me, I even miss my narcissistic ex, if not everything else at least he was equally broken. I am looking at another man sleeping right now and I feel nothing even when I want to and hoped to feel something.

What is the point of a birthday if you don't feel like you are living anyway? Might as well give me condolences. Sometimes I wish my parents weren't there so I can off myself without worrying, hell even dogs get put down when they are suffering but somehow I am selfish for wanting to end a life that was worth nothing and has zero hope of getting better, I'm already 28 and a failure.

I have a shitty job based on manipulation, while I used to be valued for my brain and skillsets. Now I feel like I am worth nothing. I will forever regret trusting the wrong people. I suffer humiliation with a smile, I pretend to be someone I'm not so I would not be a burden for my family, especially since my dad was fired. Tbh I would work for half the pay for double the hours if it was a place I could learn and progress and not a dead end job but this is where I am. Just when I think I've hit the bottom another layer of Hell opens up 

I have nothing, I am no one, I can't relate to anyone around me and the only thing people appreciate about me is the way I look and let's be realistic  even that is about to expire, tho I lived most of my life as an ugly duckling the novelty of looking okayish quickly wore off.

Bah I don't even know, I just want this Sisyphus toiling to stop
