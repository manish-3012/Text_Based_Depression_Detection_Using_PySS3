A vicious cycle.I'm not sure why but my mind keeps going back to dying. Every time I hear people tell me, "It's not an option," I usually think *anything is possible.* I really don't wanna deal with this student loan shit and the stupid financial discussions I have with my mom every month. I've been trying to keep myself strong but with the way my mind works now, I've already come up with a general plan and it scares me shitless bc part of me knows I'm better than this road. I don't really want to give in to depression again but sometimes, it really seems like the best choice for everyone involved at this point...
