Girlfriend (20) Has Suicidal EpisodesHey guys, this is my first time coming to this sub, I'm feeling pretty depressed and broken right now. I just made up after a pretty big fight with my girlfriend, and she talked about voices and reflections telling her to kill herself.

As some background information, I'm a 22 year old male in a long distance relationship with my girlfriend of 6 months (20 years old and a sophomore in college). I'm in California while she's in Pennsylvania for school.

Starting this year, she's hated her school and her friends turned out to not be such good friends, so she feels extremely lonely. As her parents are Asian immigrants, it is hard for her to talk about some sensitive matters such as putting her mental health in front of her immediate academic plans. They would never ever let her take a gap year. She's tried talking to them about dropping out or taking a semester off, but they would say things like "oh, you'll get through it just focus on schoolwork and it'll be alright, college is just another couple years."

I guess when we fight, she feels like the only person who actually understands and loves her isn't there anymore. I have often thought about how this may be unhealthy because she does not have any close friends to rely on.

She has admitted to finding comfort sometimes when overly stressed or sad in making small cuts on her arm. She promised to not do it anymore, but it was silly of me to not realize that this was not a solution to the core problem.

It's really hard because we fought over FaceTime, and she was going crazy, screaming, crying, hyperventilating and gasping for air. She couldn't breathe properly. And she kept saying negative things about how she wants to die, and said she'll probably die by drowning because she's been a swimmer for most of her life. She said her reflection in the mirror was telling her to end it, and voices were screaming in her head to kill herself. I found out she's had episodes like these twice in the past when we fought, but never as bad as today.

It was frustrating to not be able to comfort her in person. The only thing I could do is tell her that I cared and I would be deeply saddened if she were gone, but it's hard for her to believe that after I had been so angry with her just 10 minutes before. It's really sad because our fights are from stupid small things that don't even matter in the end. It's been almost 2 months since we've seen each other, but she is scheduled to fly over in a week and a half, so I tried to get her to look forward to that, so she has some hope to keep fighting on.

She's been crying literally every single day at school this semester, and her mental health is getting worse and worse. She does have self-destructive tendencies under stress, but I do not believe she is in immediate danger of actually carrying it out. 

To be honest, I don't know what I'm looking to achieve in this post. Maybe if anyone has similar situations and could provide tips, or if you could just send some moral support, that'd be great. She has promised to try to get professional help, so I am hoping to turn this around. If you read this whole post, you have my thanks for allowing me to share.
