I'm going to kill myself in 3 yearsI'm sixteen and I'm not in high school, I have severe anxiety and depression and I can't fight through it to go to school. My mom got me an online course but won't do it for some reason. I spend every waking hour watching youtube, tv, and playing video games. I have no useful skills, interesting hobbies, or anything unique. I have four close friends who I see once a month if I'm lucky. I don't get any other contact from people my own age and freak out whenever I see someone even close to my own age. I've become disillusioned with the world and don't see the point anymore. I'm going to make a list of goals for myself to achieve by my 19th birthday. If I don't succeed them all or find happiness somewhere along the way I'm going to kill myself. Right now I don't see any future prospects for myself and I think this is the best option. Sorry if this was rambley or incoherent.
