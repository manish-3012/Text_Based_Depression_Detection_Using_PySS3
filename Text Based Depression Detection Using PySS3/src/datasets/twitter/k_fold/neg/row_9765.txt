Blissful silenceLet me start with i have never been good at grammar or emotions the very thought of having to emotionally connection with people is like trying to learn Chinese from an ikea Manual. Iâ€™m one of the people that only â€œliveâ€ 3-6 months in a year. I simply thought â€œlivingâ€ was a means to an end like if Iâ€™m a good person x and y will happen. I discovered I was wrong, very wrong, so wrong in fact I didnt know if it was worth fixing.i grew up in a household of numbers, if grew up was even the right word. Few quotes have stuck with me as hard as â€œ just be less like yourselfâ€ I remember hearing this and thinking this is great I hate myself so why wonâ€™t I want to be like someone else, so I began forming mask. Ezio himself would be proud, I became what I can only call as a shapeshifter. I could blend in any group and as long I wasnâ€™t myself I was happy, or at least the mask was. You can never truly out run your shadow. I discovered very young what hell is , it isnâ€™t the fire and brimstone people think it is at least not to me. My mind became a prison like knowing every answer but no way to tell anyone. I use to dream of sitting in a Room being interrogated by the best version of me, he made better decisions, treating past relationships better, had the courage to allow people inside. Seeing what I could have been compared to what I am, I only have one word , disappointment. The only thing that brings me any happiness was helping others, my thinking was if I can help others then they wonâ€™t be as useless as I am. But I just furthered the divide I created my own island, my own prison. I have fully accepted that life or death has nothing to do with a beating heart. I died long ago the whispers of a ghost long forgotten in the walls of an empty house. The more I try to help the more I realize I canâ€™t help myself. I yearn for blissful silence
