I am a martyr like Jesus, please crucify meYou can hear the man live live yourself. As he challenges me. How different I am. I am silent. I want him to go, I want him to end my life. My unhappy life. My life is tiring, troubling and a nemion, differently challenging me. You can see what a martyr I am like Jesus. Like God ... Jesus. They also called his villains, scourged, bullied, said ... take the cross, carry it! That's how the Lord Jesus took ... I can also cross, build a big cross for me! I will also carry to CzÄ™stochowa! Build me, please! I will dress like God, like Jesus and wear me and beat me, scourge me like Christ the king of heaven and earth. But later He showed one. You have buried him. You crushed stones so that he could not tear down his grave, that he could not get up, but he showed his strength and power. He came until ... at Mary they went to see His tomb, whether he was lying there, whether stones were there. And what did they see? His headscarf and the grave are empty. The grave is empty and he appeared and said: I am among you! I am among you ... I will be the same. I will not be this Christ, the Lord Jesus, but I will be an ordinary man and he also has me ... God ... God, Jesus, will give me strength and that my grave will open and I will walk among you. You will see me alive and real. Because it will only depend on this man above. And he will help me. He will do it because He sees me getting tired in this world. Like me ... I have poverty, like everything. If they don't dismantle the fences and have a warrant ...
