MiserableI just wanna move to an isolated cave/ off my self so I'll never talk to anyone again. Even though I'll never know what happened to my family, I won't have to go through the grieving process again when they die. I don't want to be in pain and constant fear anymore. Everyday I'm terrified that something horrible will happened to my loved ones, like a car crash or a stroke. What's the point of making it through every day if we all end up dead?
