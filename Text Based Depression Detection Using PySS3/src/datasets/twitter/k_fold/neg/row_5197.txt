What are the conditions for not feeling fine/good about death?If you were to ask me if I wanted to die, I'd say yes. Not that's it's the paramount thing that I desire, it's just that if consider "would I mind sleeping forever?", it doesn't seem like a bad option. If I'm in pain though it becomes the paramount desire.

I don't assume people who live truly and fully are in this kind of situation. So what is it that turns people away from death? Two things that I know are: naivety + a relatively happy life, and guilt over what your death means for others. Neither of these are good ways to be. Naivety = ignorance = a sheltered and limited life. And I can't imagine how it is possible to live truly if your whole life is on a foundation of guilt.

Do you know what sorts of things turn people away from death and towards life?
