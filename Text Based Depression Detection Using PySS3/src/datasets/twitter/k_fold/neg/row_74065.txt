One of the main reason Iâ€™m still here is because Iâ€™m afraid of what there is after.I have read many conflicting opinions around the topic of afterlife. To me the best case scenario is that there is absolutely nothing, no heaven or hell. But it terrifies me thinking that there could be something like hell or reincarnation. Hell, for Christians, is eternal damnation, constant suffering and never ending torment. While reincarnation is a Russian roulette, you could be lucky or unlucky depending of what part of the world you are in and what family. 

Some people believe that we are in a prison planet and there is no escape. We are in a endless cycle of life and death via reincarnation, this because we are ruled by evil aliens who feed off on our negative emotions and suffering. This theory scares me even more, if it is true there is literally not  point in suicide because
we die and we are reborn 1 second later. 

What do you guys think?
