I'm an asshole and deserve to die.This is a throwaway.


You know those neckbeards who are both unattractive and have toxic views about women thay are filled with hypocrisy? The ones Reddit constantly denounces? I'm one of those guys. I don't comment about it, though. I let that resentment towards both myself and others boil inside of me. I look at perfectly nice men with attractive girlfriends and resent him for having a girlfriend when I don't, and her for being attracted to him instead of me. I look at places like /r/gonewild and resent those women for being so sexy and having men wrapped around their finger, while getting all the attention they want, while I'm incredibly unattractive and get nothing. I'm unjustifiably furious at promiscuous women while jerking off to them at the same time. I even get angry at lesbians because there's no way they could be attracted to me. Then again, judging by that criteria, every woman is a lesbian. I claim to be a laid back, liberal kind of guy. But in reality, I'm backwards and filled with resentment for everything and everyone. Similarly, I act tough and cool, but it's all an act, always. And most of the time, I can't even pull that act off. I even get mad at those like me, who make derogatory comments towards women that don't deserve them. Why can't they just keep their fucking mouths shut like me and let that rage simmer inside of them? At least I keep my toxicity to myself. Whatever. Some of us were born as attractive women who get all the attention from the opposite sex they want, and some of us were born as ugly, bitter men that don't contribute anything to society and hate others for having what they don't. I'm an asshole who doesn't deserve to live. I know it. I have a lot more to tell, but no one is going to read or care about this anyway, so what's the point?



To all the women of /r/suicidewatch, I'm sorry I've made your lives worse. I hope you can enjoy your life in spite of me.
