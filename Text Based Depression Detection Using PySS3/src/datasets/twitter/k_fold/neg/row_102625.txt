all i can ever think about is dyingat work, at school, at home, while i'm driving, eating, resting, reading, breathing. it's a fantasy that keeps my head above water. go figure. 
i so desperately wish i didn't have family who would be hurt by my passing so i could finally be free. i'm dizzy with need.
i want out. it's all i can think of.
