It's dark in hereSo, in the last 5 months I've been destroyed. Before that I was in a bad spot and going numb and not keeping myself in check, so the kind of default terrifying person I can be took over, driving everyone around me to call me a monster even tho I've been hurt by them and never once have a actually hurt them (I have the scars and er bills to prove it) so my relationship ended. And was basically convinced by everyone around me that I was a scum of the earth monster. This was right before I took a trip and started to get myself together and was doing a lot better and I was basically thrown into a deeper put than I've ever been it. Now everyone just treats me like shit. Which frankly isn't fair because I've held everyone's hand through all of they're shit and helped them more than they have helped me. And now I got fired from a good job which was one of the few things keeping me, I dunno, worth something ig. And I'm really struggling to get another. And my "friends" keep saying that I'm all over the map so I've tried to only be a good friend, fun, interested in them and completely ignore myself and I get nothing for weeks of effort. 

I'm just fucking tired. I've put a lot of energy into everything that could make my life better and it's gotten me approximately nowhere. People either ignore me saying that I'm not in a good spot or accuse me of lying to get attention. I'm not just freaking out and like I just want to kill myself, this is something I've given a lot of thought to and am still trying to figure out. I know that I really want to. It doesn't feel like I'm alive anymore. It feels like I'm just something that happened to be animate and going through the motions of what it's designed for. I'm utterly numb to everything, to life, to anything. I don't really feel anymore. I'm just tired. The darker side of me is really fucking evil. Part of it wants me to kill myself just so they get the trauma. Leave a note letting them know just how fucking shitty they were to me, the people that constantly preached how much they cared. Make sure they live with the burden of someone else's life for the rest of there's. Which is fucked cause there's a part of me that still really loves them so it's fucking weird. It's fucking dark in my head. The hatred I feel is basically the only thing I'm not numb to, which is obviously a good feeling. And that just makes me want to stop being alive even more. 

So yeah, that's how I feel these days. Not quite sure if suicide is the route yet but it's real fucking tempting.
