I contacted a suicide hotline and it's the best thing I've ever done.So I contacted the suicide hotline while on a long walk to talk to them after taking five oxycodone pills and feeling pretty down and they actually talked and listened to me for 3 hours. 

They asked me questions I would answer and the lady would constantly check in with me to see if I'm ok and asked on a scale of 1 to 10 how I feel because I abused drugs and asked if I was getting home safe or if she needed to call someone to help me, they convinced me to call poison control mid call and to call them back right away. 

The lady even helped me come up with plans on how to become a little happier and gave me information on free therapy businesses. 

I gave her my number so incase I just randomly stop talking it would mean I passed out and she told me she would call 911 for me.

I was afraid because I've heard all these horror stories about suicide hotline but the one I called was so great.

All I'm saying is try... Try and call your suicide hotline even if you're scared, it could help amazingly.

Thanks.
