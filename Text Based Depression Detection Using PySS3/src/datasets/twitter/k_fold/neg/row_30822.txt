I don't know if I can fight back any more.I am sorry Internet.
I don't know if I can take any longer, I have been diagnosed with depression for a year but had episodes before, I have been medicated and lately things were good but I fall back into my old patterns and I skip work 3 days in a row, I think I might be fired, for a good reason, but I am so tired of trying to pick me up.
All day, every day, pretending everything is fine, but in the back of my mind, the thought of ending it all.
I am sorry for dumping this on you anonymous reader, but I don't want to do that to my significant other anymore, she deserves better, she has her own issues.
Wish you all the best.
PS: I am sorry if it is a bad reading english is not my native language.
