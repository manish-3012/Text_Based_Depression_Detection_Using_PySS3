Can't stand being autistic, I don't know what to doI'm 24 and have Asperger's syndrome. I go to college, trying to get a good job, finishing my associates, wanted to go into computer science but I'm so fucking stupid I'll probably fuck that up too. If I'm not in school, I'm working. I don't really have "friends" just acquaintances that come into my life when it's convenient for them. I feel like such a freak, I can't pick up on simple communication cues and never know how to express myself emotionally to people. When people are sad or crying to me and expressing themselves, I never know what to do or say or even feel, I can blame Asperger's all I want but that won't change the fact I feel like I don't belong on the same planet as normal people do. Medication just makes me a robot, so I stopped. People say I'm hilarious but that's not a trait that will get me anywhere in life and it can be hard when I'm usually sarcastic and people just "don't get it". My gf of 5 years cheated on me and hasn't spoken to me since I found out, the one person I felt safe with is now gone from my life. I feel like I'm in some sort of glass room just watching everyone else and no matter what I do I can't break the room due to genetics and my failure of a mind. 

Should I just end it so I can quit ruining people's lives and hating my own? I'd rather hope for a second life where I can actually enjoy being a normal person than continue living as a failure.
