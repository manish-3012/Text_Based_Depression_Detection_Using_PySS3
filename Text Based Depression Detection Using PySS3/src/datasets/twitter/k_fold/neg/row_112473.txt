Found out yesterday girlfriend of four years cheated on me . I have nothing left and seriously considering itI don't know why I am posting this it helps to type I guess. I found out yesterday that girlfriend of four years cheated on me not just once but multiple times with the same guy. He owns a pizza shop about 2 minute walk from her house. 
The details are not important but she is only person I had in my life and now I have no one . I am seriously considering taking every single one of my mothers sleeping tablets because I can't handle the pain much longer. 
Like I said beats me why I am posting her , it's not for attention it just helps a small bit .
