I donâ€™t want to be hereI want to give up

First time posting anything on here, just looking for support. Iâ€™m tired yâ€™all . Really really tired and I donâ€™t want to live anymore. Ive suffered from depression/anxiety/insomnia since my teenage years ( my father still refers to me as â€œ his dark childâ€) but wasnâ€™t diagnosed until I was 18. Im 29 now and Im ready to die. The only thing that keeps me here are my kids. Some days Im convinced they are better off without me and other days I scared of what may happen to them if I do go through with it. If I kill myself, my kids and husband suffer but if I donâ€™t then I continue to suffer. Iâ€™m trapped and I canâ€™t take it anymore. I canâ€™t live like this. My life has always sucked Jan 8th 2020 made everything much worse. My grandfather passed. We were extremely close and absolutely adored him. He died at my hospital (Iâ€™m a RN) , in my ER, with all of my close friends just watching me collapse on the floor and bawl like a damn baby.  Everyday since then, life has just been unbearable . I take my meds, I go to therapy, I do the work but I still I wake up everyday wishing I hadnâ€™t. I just want a bus to hit me or something so I can hug my papa again.
