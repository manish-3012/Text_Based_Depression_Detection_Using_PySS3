Goodbye everyone - taking my stock pile of pills after work todayI just literally can't any longer. I am sitting at my desk at work sobbing. I realized that I haven't accomplished anything since graduating college 3 years ago and I don't even know how that happened. I can't continue to live like this. I hate my job and it feels like a prison that I have to endure 9 hours per day. I can't even kill myself without my job getting in my way - I have to wait until my work day is over so I don't have to be pestered by people wondering where I went. What will they do without their corporate robot?

I want to settle down with someone but I ruin everything because I am too obsessed with seeking short term satisfaction / endorphins from attention from multiple guys. I engage in risky behavior as a means of trying to save my own life yet it is placing me further and further away from my goal of having a family. 

So, what is the fucking point? There is none. I don't even have the energy to write out a suicide note so I suppose it will be easier for my family and friends if I just disappear in quiet.

Only 1 hour and 15 minutes until I can go home and end myself. Wow, the relief is consuming.
