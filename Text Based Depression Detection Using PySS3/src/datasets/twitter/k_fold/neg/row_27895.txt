Friends are supportive!! Iâ€™m so happy about that.Finally told some of my friends that I was planning to leave. I think itâ€™s a testament of how long Iâ€™ve suffered and thought about this that they didnâ€™t argue with me and instead said theyâ€™d support me and be by my side. 

Ah, the end is near, and somehow that mitigates the pain a little.
