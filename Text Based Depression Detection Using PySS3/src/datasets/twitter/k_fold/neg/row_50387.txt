Help me help a friend.hi, I'm not really sure if this is where I should find help, but I'm running out of options. My friend had what could possibly be his worst year ever. He lost his best friends( who now seemingly doesn't care about him anymore ) after he helped them hook up. and its been giving him depression. The feeling of being left out, not being cared for anymore, stuff like that. His parents knew about it, they had a fight and accused him of being gay. recently I've been trying my best to cheer him up. always trying to talk to him. give him games so he can stop thinking about them, but it isnt helping. Today He was supposed to meet up with his former best friend to clear things up, but the girl didnt show up for reasons i dont know about. That pushed him to the edge. We talked a while ago after that incident and he told me he's gonna end his life and he seems really serious about it. He lives far from me so I don't know what to do. He also already talked to me about suicide before, but Ive always been able to talk him out of it, but now seems to be different. I don't know what to do.
