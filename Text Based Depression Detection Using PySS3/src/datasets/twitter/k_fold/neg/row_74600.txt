Today I most likely dieI've been a failure of a man with a nasty nasty porn addiction

I feel like the lowest man to have ever lived. A man that has no libido due to withdrawal symptoms. I feel like crap. 

I want to stop existing due to this withdrawal, I know I don't really want to logically and I would hope I never do something so stupid. I feel like this is temporary, but rn I truly want to die. I bought a rope recently and I have learnt to tie a knot. I don't know why I have but I have. I feel unloved and worthless. My birthday went past 3 days ago and nobody even said anything to me. I have no hope of a better future. I can't see why I should live. 

I want to open the laptop and watch all the messed up stuff I watched to get me to this point. It was wasn't only porn that got me here, but it was my crutch to hide from how much I failed.

I see it as plain as day now.      

I am on day 42 back of quitting , but I want to give up. 

I'm heartbroken, lost, angry, sad and I feel like this may be hopeless. I know nobody will see this but typing this has calmed me down a bit. I'm sorry I rant here every other couple of days, but you all help me so much. I don't feel like I have depression, but I was the most addicted person I'm the world. 

I had withdrawal after 7 days. If my mother saw the things I use to watch I think she would have died from an heart attack. No even worse she'd die for shame. I want to be loved, I want to be a good man.i want to be healthy and financial stable. God blessed me with a wonderful body and good looks but I wasted it all. I was smart and I failed. I would fail and come back home to porn for escape.

I have to stop failing my self.
