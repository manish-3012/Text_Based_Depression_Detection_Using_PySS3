Please help me feel like I still have a chanceSo ever since my husband died 2 years ago and I lost custody of my daughter I've basically given up on life. I never used to drink before but I'm literally drinking myself to death atm....I haven't eaten a meal in probably a week...no more than maybe a piece of chicken or a half a cup of soup a day....I'm homeless staying at a motel because my bf was able to pay it before but no longer after Saturday at 11am....I'm just wasting away....I feel physically and mentally unwell and am seriously considering suicide...I've fucked everything up...fucked up every job interview and now will be on the street within 6 days..I don't know what to do ..I don't really want to die but I don't want to live like this and I don't want to live with the damage I've done to my body in the last 2 years...I'm going to turn 37 in a couple of months and have absolutely nothing to look forward to....the motel I'm at is so disgusting that I'm at the corner laundromat right now washing my BFS work clothes and roaches actually came out of the clothes....I don't know what to do...I have the capability to end it all somewhat peacefully and I think I have to do it before the end of the week....whatever....rant over.
