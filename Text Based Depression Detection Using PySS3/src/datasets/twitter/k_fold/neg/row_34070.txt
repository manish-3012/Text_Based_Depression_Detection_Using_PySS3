unpopular opinion: suicidal people donâ€™t want to hear â€œit gets betterâ€.* life isnâ€™t linear so if it gets better, by that logic it will also get worse at some point. 

* some people (ahem, me) have been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years. for me itâ€™s been nine years; some stories i read on here are anywhere between a year and twenty years. so saying â€˜it gets betterâ€™ is really only half the story. sure, it might get better tomorrow but it might also take 15 years. itâ€™s harrowing to think i might have to live through that many years before i can fully manage my depressive thoughts and stop wanting to die. but false advertising doesnâ€™t make this any better.

* i wonder sometimes if the people saying it will get better have dealt with long depressive episodes and consistent suicidal thoughts themselves. a lot of people try to relate to depression by recalling a time in their life when they were sad, which is a valid experience and make senses if youâ€™re trying to empathize with something you donâ€™t entirely understand. but do you really think that the same advice that helped you through that minute, one-off bout of depression is going to be suitable for people with sustained mental illness? (i.e. - oh you have persistent depressive disorder? yeah i couldnâ€™t stop crying when my cat died either. take a walk to get your mind off it, it will pass)â€¦ itâ€™s a complete mismatch. 

* hearing arbitrary advice like this screams that your intent is not to understand but rather just feel like youâ€™ve helped the situation so you can sleep sound at night. checking the box, if you will. whose feelings have improved following your â€˜it getâ€™s betterâ€™ spiel? only yours? then you see the problem. 

i understand that not everyone knows the right thing to say but sometimes silence is better than nonsense. 

TLDR: with that being said, have any of my fellow *suicidal* folk received advice that actually worked for them or made them change their perspective (even a little)? i would love to hear it.
