I just don't want to wake up any moreAbout two and a half months ago my fiancee of almost five years left me for another man because she felt since she saw this person more often she'd get more attention and love. Everything I did, every decision I made in my life was for her/ us. Without her I feel everything I do is pointless. My parents are divorcing and losing our home, foreclosure is nearly inevitable. A girl I fell really hard for after my fiancee left is being taken to Palestine by her parents and is not coming back to the states. We both fell for each other but were unable to make anything of it. She pulled me out of the biggest depression I'd ever been in, but without her I'm scared and broken. I've started cutting again... I don't have anyone to turn to. All I want is a hug by someone who loves me. Every day I wake up I wish I hadn't. I just don't want to do this any more.
