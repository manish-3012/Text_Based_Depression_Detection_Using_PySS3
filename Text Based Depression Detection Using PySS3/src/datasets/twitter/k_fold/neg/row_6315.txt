suicidal friend hasn't responded for a day, okay to worry/panic?they're always active on social media and even though they're suicidal, we're able to at least have a bit of a good laugh. yesterday we were sending funny gifs back and forth until they stopped replying. i sent mine almost directly after theirs and they never saw it, i just thought 'ah, well they'll get to it soon' and went about with my day, then after a couple hours i assumed they'd fallen asleep since they had a habit of taking naps but i didn't wanna pressure them for a reply so i carried on with what i was doing. night rolls by and i go to sleep hoping to wake with a response but nope. 

you need to understand that i'm not like this with any of my other friends. ever since they told me about their extreme suicidal tendencies and how close they are to ending their life, i started to worry about them a whole lot more. i didn't send them any messages pressuring them to respond, i just left the gif and waited. but then the morning came and still nothing. they hadn't even seen it, they hadn't viewed my story, they hadn't been online. i started to panic. a lot. and i still am.

but then if they were going to kill themselves, they'd tell me. they've said they would, they'd let me know so i can say my final goodbyes so- i just don't know. its almost 8 pm and i still haven't recieved a response, i deleted the gif and sent a meme in its place 3 hours ago but they haven't seen it. 

am i just overreacting and need to give them space or have they..y'know...?

(also, i can't phone their family members or even get into contact with them because i don't know their social medias and/or numbers)
