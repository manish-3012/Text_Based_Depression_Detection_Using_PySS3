April 12th is the big dayI got my plan together and all I have to do is wait until that date. It will be the anniversary of an abortion I was forced to have back in 2005. I'm feeling a lot better. A lot more confident. I'm going to enjoy my last few days. I can't stand to be here another month and I'm going to make sure that I don't make it. Tylenol, cough syrup, tequila, and some bleach should do the job.
