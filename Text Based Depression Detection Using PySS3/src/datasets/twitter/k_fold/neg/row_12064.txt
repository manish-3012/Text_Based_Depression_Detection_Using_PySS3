I just want some sort of outDespite everything, despite every reason not to

my mind is starting to come up w plans again for some sort of exit from all of this

i have no one to share this with.

i donâ€™t have a therapist, i donâ€™t see my dr for another week and i canâ€™t reach her without talking to her stupid assistant first, and my boyfriend just wonâ€™t understand...

i feel so goddamn alone
