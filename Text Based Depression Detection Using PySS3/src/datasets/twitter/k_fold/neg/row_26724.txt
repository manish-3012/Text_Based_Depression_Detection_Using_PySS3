I've been suicidal for a while now, but I'm near my breaking point.The straw that's breaking the camel's back is the fact that EVERYONE WHO I THOUGHT CARED ABOUT WHAT I HAD TO SAY IS NOW TURNING ON ME!!! Fucking hell I can't take this shit hole of a planet anymore. I just want to die and go be with the man that I know is my unconditional friend. Because I was just proven tonight (as it's been proven to me time and time again throughout my life) that at the end of the day, people don't really want to hear from me. They'd rather shut me out than try to understand my experiences. 

I hate this world, I hate school, I hate life, and I just want to be done. I'm so fucking close to hurting myself right now.
