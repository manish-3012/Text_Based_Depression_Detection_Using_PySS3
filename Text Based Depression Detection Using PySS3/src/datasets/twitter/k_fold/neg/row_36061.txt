I'll start writing my farewell letters.Hi everyone, I just wanted to tell to someone that I'll start to write my farewell letters, I think there is no point in trying It anymore, I'm really tired of my Life. The last months had been a torture, I can't express any kind of emotion even when I feel them because of a mental disorder, that make people think I'm a weirdo so they just ignore me when I practically beg for someone to help me. I'm 22, currently at college, I'm choosing wether I give Life a last chance or kill myself, I have considered join the army too, maybe there someone could do the job for me. If I choose to die, I think I'll just go to the sea with a bag full of rocks and I'll drown where no one can see me, that way no one will find my body. I don't want my family to expend a single cent on my funeral, I'm not worth anything.
