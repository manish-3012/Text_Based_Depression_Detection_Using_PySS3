Last tryAfter a few days of sitting on it, I realised that I was genuinely suicidal from November - December last year. Now, every day is a constant struggle to keep sane. I have everything I need...but I don't want to do it. 

Heh, but then again, 
I'm a disappointment to my parents (I still live with them).
I never had a serious relationship with anyone.
I'm pretty solid on not going back to college.
I have no friends.
I trust no one.
I say the stupidest things.
I've gained all the weight I lost from being an exercising vegan/vegetarian (regular eater now). 
I'm pathetic in every level.
I'm pretty creepy.
I'm basically a true wierdo.
I've spent the last few months watching anime, porn, and youtube videos, shutting myself in my room.
I have no interest in anything; I love nothing and no one. 

I wish I had a reason to live. 

It doesn't really matter if I say anything here. All the people with higher reddit karma will get all the attention anyways. I'll give it one more go. If nothing comes from this, I'll just close my account and spend the rest of my days in the real world working in the mornings and coming home to my dusty room watching anime, porn, and youtube videos until I snap (at myself...not at regular people btw).
