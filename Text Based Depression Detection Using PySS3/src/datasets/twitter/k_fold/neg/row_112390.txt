I've become bored with my own painI've been severely depressed since I was about 11. I remember being a really happy younger child with lots of friends, and then I started being the target of a lot of bullying from peers as well as from one particular family member who had a lot of control over my immediate family (she owned "our" house and frequently invoked her ownership when I or my parents were not "acting right"). At the same time, my dad kind of lost interest in being involved in my life at all. I'm guessing that combination of things is what started the depression, but it morphed into something else entirely after a while. I  no longer really know how to interact with people and I feel sort of like a nonperson, like I have no real personality or self. I feel like I've tried on different things, but none of them fit. I used to talk to my few loved ones about how I feel, but I've found that people get very tired of hearing it and that it in fact really hurts other people to hear it, so I try not to overshare. I'm tired of hearing it, too. I'm like everyone else who has had over two decades of this feeling under his or her belt. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of struggling, of rallying and getting knocked back down. I'm in therapy and I've tried many many medications. I have small stretches of improvement. But the depression is still unrelenting, and as I'm beginning to no longer be a young person, I'm thinking more and more that maybe it makes sense to commit suicide. Maybe this isn't going to improve if it hasn't in over 20 years. I can't imagine being able to tolerate it much longer.
