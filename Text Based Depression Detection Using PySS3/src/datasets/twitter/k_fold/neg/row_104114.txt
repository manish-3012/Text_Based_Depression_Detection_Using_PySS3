Happiness is so fragileI was doing well for a few weeks, didn't feel as hopeless and even got some motivation back for school. Just when I thought things were turning around I fail an important test and now my grade is fucked. Jokes on me for getting my hopes up Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

So I'm back in a spiral, I know that I have to get my shit together *now* if I want to pass all my classes, but I just don't see the point as I'm probably gonna fail out anyways.
