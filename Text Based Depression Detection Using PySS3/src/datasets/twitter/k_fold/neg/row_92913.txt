My daughter could have a better life.We are trying to buy a house, but we can't afford it. I'm not working, not helping, not contributing, only draining resources. The apartment complex we live in now is mixed income, meaning that we pay top dollar while others are subsidized, and unfortunately that brings in the few rotten apples that spoil the whole thing. Domestics every night. Broken glass in the parking lot. Property defaced.

She deserves better.

I tried to take a walk today. I thought I could clear my head, she was asleep in the stroller, the sun was shining. But every time I passed a "For Sale" sign I wanted to put on the stroller brakes, kiss her goodbye, and jump into traffic.

Sometimes, I lose my temper with her. I hit the wall and slam a door or two, or handle her more roughly than I should. I never hurt her. But I know she hates me because I can't control my temper. 

My daughter. I never, EVER want her to know this despair, this loneliness, this rock-bottom emptiness that fills my whole body and weighs it down with nothing but tears and anger and a sore back from carrying her all day. I pray every night that she be stronger than me. Kinder. 

Better.

My husband could take her, erase the waste that I produce, and his family would support him and make sure he had a house, food, everything she needed. 

She doesn't need me. She deserves better.
