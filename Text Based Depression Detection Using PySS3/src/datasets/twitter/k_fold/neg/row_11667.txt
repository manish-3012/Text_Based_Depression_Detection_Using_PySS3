I wish killing myself was easierI wish methods were more effective, had a.higher success rate. I Wish it was as easy as taking.a.lot of aspirin and knowing I'm not going to wake up again just like that but it's not that easy. I'm tired of feeling like this I want shit to work lmao it's like there's always a catch to every method. I'm sure I can do something if I try hard enough, of course I can, people die from suicide every day it can't be that hard to do, but.

 Great, productive and loved human beings are taken from the world every day but.for one to make themselves die because they're not that, it must be so hard? Load of BS
