i just canâ€™t do this shit anymoreIâ€™m 16 years old unattractive and fat. I have adhd and terrible anxiety. I just got dumped by someone I felt like I wanted to spend my entire life with. Thatâ€™s not even the problem all I want to do is sleep and cry. Nothing gives me any joy anymore. Iâ€™m a spoiled kid inside of an amazing family and I canâ€™t go for help. Iâ€™ve barely left my room the past 3 years. Iâ€™ve been bullied for my appearance by almost everybody. My last girlfriend made me feel like I actually mattered to someone and I was finally feeling happy. I feel like a selfish bitch for wanting to kill myself. The only thing that has stopped me was my mom and her saying if I killed myself she would have nothing left. This breakup has been killing me inside and she acts like nothing happened. I donâ€™t care about my future. I do online school and have cheated on everything because I have no motivation to do work or try at all. My mom expects at least Bâ€™s yet I have one d and c. I donâ€™t know how to say that I just donâ€™t fucking care and itâ€™s not like it matters Iâ€™ll be dead anyway.
