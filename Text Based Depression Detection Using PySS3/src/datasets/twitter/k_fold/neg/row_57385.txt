I have no futureIâ€™m not sure if this page is going to be helpful to me because I see all these posts with people who feel similarly to me and it does not make me hopeful. I just donâ€™t see the point. Itâ€™s never going to get better. I just wish someone would run me over. Or that assisted suicide wasnâ€™t only available for people who are terminally ill. Or that it was easy to own a gun here though I doubt that Iâ€™d be able to pull the trigger myself. 

People might say that thereâ€™s always a solution to a problem. And sure, maybe. But I just want to be happy and I just donâ€™t see that happening ever. Not with the life it seems Iâ€™m going to lead. Disappointing my parents and maybe not being able to graduate university. And even if I do, at this point I wonâ€™t be accepted to grad school. I donâ€™t want to be stuck doing something I donâ€™t love for the rest of my life. But my mental health, circumstances, bad decisions and just my own self have made it so that I wonâ€™t be able to do something I love. Iâ€™m tired of struggling at school. Iâ€™m tired of working a minimum wage job and struggling to pay the bills. Iâ€™m tired. I hate my body and myself too at this point. Iâ€™m not seeing the end of the struggling... so why keep going.
