I shouldn't have to feel like this, maybe its your actions, maybe its my mental illness talking...I just don't think I can do this anymore, I've had a history with suicidal thoughts before and I;m so sick and tired of them invading every other thought I have. 

I am tired over obsessing over things you enjoy or currently have, just to remember the good ole' days. It hurts me so much, you don't physically how heartbreaking it is to wake up some days. I csan't take it anymore. Some nights it gets to me too much, even to the point where i have to take some Benadryl in order to get a good nights rest.  

I miss you, I am a hollow void. I'm sorry
