I hit a car and now I may get sued and it could ruin my lifeI was driving and I hit a car, It was 100 percent my fault. And their car was barely scratched (mine wasn't). However the lady inside says her neck is hurting really bad and it looks like they may sue me. I'm just 19, and this would probably prevent me from continuing college.  I would be fucked for a long long time. I have been on the verge of suicide a lot and suffer a lot of problems. I deal with tons of shit all the time in life so at this point i'm done. I don't want to live any more, the only hope I had was I get my degree and try to make something out of my life. Now I may not have that and so I really just have nothing. I'm going to go to the creek by my house and hang myself tonight. I'm just in shock in how today has turned out and I guess I came here to vent and tell someone before I did it.
