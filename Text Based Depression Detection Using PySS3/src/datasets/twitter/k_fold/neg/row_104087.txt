Dont know what to do.I am but a young boy, but I consider myself rather mature. Now when I say mature, I don't mean I know everything and everyone around me is silly, but I mean emotionally. All of these people around me are in relationships for 3 days at a time, and don't talk to someone because they don't let them copy homework. I've had a long history trust issues. 
My father left my family when I was about 4, and can not trust a single person that I do not know very well. I can never have a girlfriend cause I do not see the point in relationships as they all will end anyway. I don't have friends because I don't believe they like me or they will take things from me. 
A large part of my life is music. I love classic rock. The Smiths, Blue Oyster Cult, The Clash, The Who, you name it. I've always wanted to preform music myself, but I know I do not have the talent and feel like I'm constantly being mocked by myself.
My main problem right now is my lack of motivation to do anything. I struggle to leave bed, get good grades, do anything really. I'm either incredibly lethargic, or too eccentric and most people are weirded out by this. I used to enjoy writing, Starcraft, and other activities by now I just see no point in anything. 
I feel as if killing myself will alleviate all my struggles and pain, but I feel as if that would hurt the people around me. The few people I did trust ended up leaving me because of my philosophies on goverment structure, my own music, and how I view people. Most of the time I just want to be away from all of this. I don't really get enjoyment from anything anymore.
