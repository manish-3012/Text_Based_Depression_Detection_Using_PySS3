Just a little more pain and thereâ€™ll no hatred anymoreI hate humanity, hate being a part of it. I hate that someone in this world has to bear this much suffering 

Thereâ€™s no free will. Thereâ€™s only fate. I hate being bound by it. Iâ€™m going to break free. Itâ€™ll be painful, but thatâ€™s the only way

People will miss me, probably, but I wonâ€™t miss anyone. Another world is calling for me. Goodbye
