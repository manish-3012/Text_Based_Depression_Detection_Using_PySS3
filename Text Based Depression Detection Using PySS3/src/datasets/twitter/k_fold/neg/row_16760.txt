Is there another section or thread of reddit, which assists users to suicide successfully?I'm not after counselling, just help on the title question. (This isn't a "cry for help" even though some users might insist that it is. Also, you're advising an adult in their 30s, not a child / teenager or someone under\-aged, and I have no dependents / partners, if these details make anyone more willing to advise.)
