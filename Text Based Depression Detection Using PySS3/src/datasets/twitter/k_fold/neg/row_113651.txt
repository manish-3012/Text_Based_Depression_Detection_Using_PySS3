Why not?Not going to get into details unless asked. I'm a 21 year old male, I have no achievements, recently found out that I won't be able to pursue my dream. I have no real friends and my family doesn't really seem to care about me. Was dating my legit dream girl, who abruptly left me for her ex(basically used me), I'm extremely lonely and feel hopeless. I frequently have suicidal thoughts, I think about how I would kill myself and the effects it would have before I go to sleep at night, its oddly very relaxing. Every day that passes, I gravitate towards the idea of suicide, I really can't seem to find a reason not to. Advice or opinions are very welcome.
