My birthday is going to be lameAs usual family is coming out to see me either day before or weekend after but it seems more out of a sense of obligation than love. Idk I'm sad and not looking forward to it and on top of that I don't feel loved by anyone. My only wish, my only desire is to have a loving woman there on my birthday whom I can cuddle with and just feel loved for once in my wretched life. Life, if you can even call it that, has beaten me down so badly that I just sit at home and don't want to socialize with anyone. I'm diabetic ASD and crippling anxiety. For the anxiety for example. There is a woman who broke up with her boyfriend recently but I'm too afraid to ask her out. I don't know why I am typing this out. I'm tired and ready to just give up on everything. What's left except death. I can't stand being alone for so long.  It's eating away at my sanity
