Alternatives to r/SuicideWatchDear r/SuicideWatch, I think this is a truly fantastic place, but there have been times when I've really wanted someone to talk to anonymously but SW wasn't appropriate. Such reasons include:

* **Problems unrelated to suicide**. I'm not sure what the scope of appropriate topics is for SW. Obviously anything related to suicide or serious depression belongs here, but what about other topics which are of concern to the poster but have nothing to do with suicide?
* **Lack of privacy**. Although I can make a throwaway account and be anonymous, every post here is publicly available, so posting a lot of detailed information can be risky.
* **Delayed responses**. I know that there are phone numbers provided for emergencies, but these numbers aren't appropriate for non-emergencies, and do not have the same level of anonymity.

I think it would help me (and hopefully many others) if we built a list of alternative resources for when SW isn't the most appropriate place to go. Such alternatives could include:

* Relevant forums
* Relevant IRC channels
* Relevant Chatrooms
* Relevant subreddits
* Contact details of people willing to provide support

If this has been done before and was successful, or if you think it won't be helpful please let me know.

**tl;dr**: What are some other places to talk anonymously about problems when r/SuicideWatch isn't appropriate?
