I'm done.I have come to realise what a toxic and disgusting person I truly am. I hurt myself, my family, my friends and my partner. I don't deserve to live anymore and I the closest I have ever been to taking the final step. I've planned it. What I'll do, where, all I need is when.

I hate myself and I hate my life. Nobody truly understands what is in my head, I don't even understand.

Whenever I think I've made progress things get so much worse 

I am lost and completely alone.
