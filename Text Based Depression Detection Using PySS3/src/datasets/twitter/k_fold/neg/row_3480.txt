I want to dieI want to kill myself. I do not care about my love ones, or their opinions, or their grief. I don't care about the world enough to buy a plane ticket to Paris or wrestle a bear or build a school for traumatized Nigerian schoolgirls. I hate the place that I live, but I don't think I could find a way to get out. I will problably seek help, even though I can't really afford it.
I just really, really want to die. But I don't know what's stopping me.
