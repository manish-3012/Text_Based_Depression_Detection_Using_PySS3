Feeling empty and disconnected.Iâ€™ve been distracting myself, not working on the root of my problems. I took 3 days off in hopes to find myself and work things out. It didnâ€™t work. 

I feel empty, thinking endlessly about what would happen if I were to be gone. The feeling of darkness wrapping himself around me. Just turning into void. How comforting. I wrote letters then tore them away. I tried, I couldnâ€™t express how I was feeling. In the end, all I could write was â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€. I just want to feel normal.
