Me [25] rollercoaster ride of short successes and major failures. Determined..but feeling worse every day.I want to start off by saying, my life hasnâ€™t been hard by any means. I grew up in a middle class family that, to all exterior views, looked like a close family. Under the exterior has always been an ugly monster of a facade. 

Brief history of me: craniosynastosis at 5mo; operated on by your favorite secretary of housing and urban development; I died on the operating table which led to brain stem damage. Didnâ€™t know this until I was 23. It explained a lot. 

Flash forward, early childhood obesity. Not due to lack of metabolism. Looking back, I was always healthy in that sense (more on this later). This was due to an unhealthy relationship with food. Mental and verbal abuse by my family and poor early childhood food decisions from my parents would eventually make me 400lbs one day. There was some physical abuse back in the day, but none I can explicitly remember the full details of. Nothing sexual.

Grew up awkward in school. Loved to sing, but never got recognition for it. Was always made fun of for being too loud and interjecting by friends..So I got softer. So much softer I caused a permanent rasp and prepubescent crack in my voice at a young age. This, I found out later in life, causes a lot of my problems now as a professional singer. 

Middle school was tough. Best and only friend moved to NY for the time (we were never close again). Multiple trips to fat camp and weight loss programs, an awkward AC/DC trench coat and barrette phase, and a bar mitzvah where more kids attended out of being forced to than actually being my friend. I wasnâ€™t even really in my grand bat mitzvah photo..I was basically smothered out and covered up by assholes. 

High school came, lost a bunch of weight to play football. Had some decent friends for awhile and did lead roles in the school musicals. Captain of JV football. Then I got injured and gained 300lbs. Friends stopped taking me seriously and stopped talking to me. By senior year, the â€œsenior weekâ€ group I put together of my â€œclosest friendsâ€ voted me out. Humiliatingly, when they couldnâ€™t get the hotel shit together like a bunch of idiots, they invited me back to organize shit. Sadly, I did. Was accepted to college and sadly decided to leave music behind; convinced there was no money to be made and facing the pressure of a Jewish family with ridiculous standards.

It was around this time I started dating an insane woman. It was bad from the start. 

College comes around, made some new close friends of my roommates. Gf cheated on me multiple of times. Ruined my freshman year. My grades tanked and my friends left me because I kept going back. She was all I had. 

Sophomore/junior year, decide to audition for my universityâ€™s music program as a singer. Pass and am immediately accepted into the recording tech program. Always had an interest. Spent the next 4 years fucking around, gaining more weight, becoming a pot head, and ultimately, hating myself. I was passing all the recording and singing classes but not the music ones.

Around what would be my senior year had I not switched majors I got an internship at Polk Audio. I was fired when my boss threw me under the bus to save himself and was too lazy to set up my banking and direct deposit with me. He accused me of stealing when extra money got deposited to me without me knowing. Offered to give it back, didnâ€™t matter; â€œtrust had been brokenâ€. I was a fucking intern. 

Flash forward a few years. Mom diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer on my brothers birthday. Survives but is mentally never the same (she wasnâ€™t ok to begin with). Now will never stop talking about breast cancer. Ruining her marriage by never wanting to move on or be happy once in remission. And that takes us up to now.

Two years ago I hated myself so much I got gastric sleeve surgery and went from 400lbs to 170lbs. Actually just had and am recovering from the plastic surgery. Hated myself for making this decision, hate not being able to eat, hate my scars, hate myself as a person and idea even more for what I represent. 

Started dating my current gf around a year post gastric sleeve. I love her, but she always discounts my feelings and treats me like a selfish, immature, *sorry for this* bitch. Read my previous posts in Relationships to get an idea. Right now sheâ€™s in another state partying and drinking without me. I feel wonderful. 

Recently had a brief internship at a tv and film production house as the CEOs assistant, but then got told my job was being replaced and put on hold for another producer ready to go in California where my boss is from. He apparently has more experience; though the point was to teach me was it not? Now on hiatus with that. 

That and my recent gf drama are the least devastating of my conflicts this recent month. Only thing looking up for me at 25 is that Iâ€™m about to start interning at Sirius XM possibly and am really looking forward to it..but I donâ€™t want to get too excited just to get replaced again or let down by crippling disappointment..again. 

TLDR: nothing redeeming about my life. Hate myself in the sense of who I am, how I look and what I represent. Pretty sure my family hates me too. Failure on all levels. I had what most would refer to as a silver spoon and all I had to do was deal with some abuse to use it..Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m not close to the worsts case of events on here, but Iâ€™m pretty close to losing all hope at this point and not seeing much upside to sticking around. People would cry for maybe a week..a few months tops. And then theyâ€™d remember Iâ€™m no longer a financial and emotional drain. And everything can get better..right?
