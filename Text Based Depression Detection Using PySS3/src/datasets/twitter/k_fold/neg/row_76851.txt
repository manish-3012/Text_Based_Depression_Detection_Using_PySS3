Relapsed with S/H todayI was clean for five months. I won't go into detail but I got into a fight today and was just kinda like "screw it no one can tell me what to do" so I just showered and cut myself. What a thought process! I didn't realize how deep I cut until it was too late. No stitches needed though.
I feel suicidal? I guess. I was thinking about how I'm gonna try a bunch to kill myself but my boyfriend made plans with me, so after I guess? I don't wanna overdose again because it's just too painful if you wake up, but I don't have any meds here that could cut it for me really. So hanging it is? I don't have anywhere to tie myself though. I know other things but I won't mention them because this huge sub is just one big trigger warning!
