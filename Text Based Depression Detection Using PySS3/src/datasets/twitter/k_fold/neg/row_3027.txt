I had a really good day but now I want to dieSorry if the layout is weird I'm on my phone

I had a really good day today. I woke up earlier than usual and went bowling with my cousin and it was really fun and I felt really happy and ate subway with her without feeling guilty and went to her dance practice with her but when I got home I felt so, so sad. It's been around five hours since I got home (currently 23:58) and now I'm judt sitting in bed crying because I really want to die. I wsnt to talk to one of my friends but its late and I don't know what to say and lately I've veen having really frequent and bad suicidal thoughts and I don't know if I'll make it througj this year and I'm overthinking now. I don't rven know why I feel like this, especially because I had such a good day. 

Does this happen to others too? Like when you have a really good day and then when you're alone you feel really sad or something?
