Sorry I am a Quintessential Pathetic Piece of ShitI just want to take a knife and stab myself in the throat with it.  I can imagine the blood shooting out of my neck and spilling on the floor.  I fall onto the floor, and a pool of blood forms.  My parents walk down stairs and find my dead lifeless body on the floor.  People at my funeral are giving each other high fives and fist bumping.  "Haha, he's finally dead" they would say.    People at work notice my absence.  Hmmm, where is Languishing4Real they might wonder?  Did he quit? They shrug their shoulders and continue working.

I am a pathetic piece of shit.  I am not even half of a man.  Women want nothing to do with me.  I have no friends.  I wish that a black hole would manifest itself in front of me, and suck me into it.  Everyone thinks that I'm a douche.  I'm a failure at everything that I try.  I am the worst at everything that I do.  I am good for nothing.  I'm second rate.  I should drink so much alcohol that I just pass out into oblivion.

Maybe I should fire up a wood chipper and dive head first into it, or take a chainsaw and take it to my neck.  The loneliness is perpetual.  It will never end because I'm less than everyone.  No one gives a fuck about someone who can't offer them value.
