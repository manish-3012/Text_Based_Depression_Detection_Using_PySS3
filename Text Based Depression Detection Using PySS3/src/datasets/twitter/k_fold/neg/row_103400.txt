I just want to goI was probably only 5 or 6 when I first thought about it. My dad openly hated me from a very young age, I remember him telling me after my little sister was born that he should just kill me, he didn't need me now that he had her. My mom was mostly unaware, and what she did see she would chalk it up to his depression, telling me that "daddy had issues, we had to be patient with him." My little brother was a problem child so most of her attention went to him anyway. I never blamed my mom, she was young and overwhelmed. But I've never really felt wanted or loved, and I only stayed here to try to protect my siblings from what I could already see what a dysfunctional family. I planned to go once I knew the kids were safe and out of that house, but in my early 20s my mom finally found the strength to leave my dad when she found me looking for apartments so I could take my siblings away from them. Then during the divorce, my dad swore he intended to leave her penniless on the street, so my mom became my responsibility too. My sister eventally married a nice guy and they have their 2nd child on the way. My brother is still struggling but I know he'll be okay soon. I promised myself once my mom died and didn't need me anymore, I'd be allowed to go. She's in her 60s, I told myself I'd waited this long, what was another 20 or so years? But now I'm pregnant... 20 weeks along. Too late to terminate, even if I wanted to which I don't, because I know how much my boyfriend always wanted kids (he thought he was sterile). But there goes my plan. I have another person who is going to be relying on me to stay here and support them. But I don't think I'm strong enough anymore, and I'm worried that I'm going to resent my daughter the way my father resented me. The hormones don't help, I know that they're making my hopelessness worse. But god I just want to end it, to not be here anymore. I wish I'd done it when I was younger before life got so much more complicated. Everyone tells you it gets better, but it doesn't, not for all of us. Almost 30 years I've thought about it every day. Even the good days. I just don't want to have to be here anymore. Therapy doesn't help because I can't even talk about these feelings without risking institutionalization. Antidepressants have never worked on me, they made the thoughts even stronger, and I've tried them all. I used to drink and smoke the pain away, but now I'm pregnant, I have no tools left to numb myself. I feel like I'm stuck with myself, stuck here because the world tells me it's wrong to leave. 30 years of pain and sadness and frustration, or trying to do everything right and still suffering. I just want to go, why is that so wrong? I just don't want to be here anymore.
