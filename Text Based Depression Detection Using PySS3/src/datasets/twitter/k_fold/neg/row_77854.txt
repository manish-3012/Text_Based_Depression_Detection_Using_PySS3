I hate the feeling I get from this but I'm better now14 y/o here, this might get deleted, never posted on this sub, but I just want to share this and hope to help at least one person.

I was talking to this friend who was aware of my suicidal thoughts. I told her how I felt jealous about another friend that gets along really well with the girl I like, I got slightly heated. My phone battery was giving me trouble so my phone shut off mid conversation, since I stopped answering, she got incredibly worried and  thought I had taken my life, and from there on it just snowballed to everyone on our friend group. When I was able to charge my phone, I told everyone I was perfectly fine, but the damage had been done, and everyone was still scared that I had commited suicide.

I always thought the people on this group hated me and found me annoying, but the next day at school they were all crying and incredibly worried, keep in mind only one of them knew about my suicidal thoughts, and that made me realize how wrong I was, and I'm happy to say that I'm no longer suicidal. 

As the title says, I feel horrible, because knowing that the way I've gotten rid of my suicial thoughts is having my friends think I'm dead is just not right, so don't wait until this happens to you, just stop now.

**So please, if you think no one cares about you, you're wrong, don't kill yourself.**
