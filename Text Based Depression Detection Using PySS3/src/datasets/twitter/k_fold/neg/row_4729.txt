Drained.Does anybody else ever feel so fucking drained after contemplating in your head with a fucking pistol in your hand, whether or not if this is the time that you want to just fucking die? 

   I feel like I've developed another personality. One minute I'm ok, the next I have a pistol in my mouth ready to go. Like something takes me over and says "lets go home". Is it me, or does anyone else experience this as well?
