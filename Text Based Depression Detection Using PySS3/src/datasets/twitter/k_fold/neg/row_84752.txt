I want to do it todayMy mental health isnâ€™t getting better and Iâ€™ve tried everything. 
My day started with my boyfriend shouting at me telling me how much of an awful person I am. Heâ€™s left the house now. 
I told him I was scared to be alone today because of my mental health and he left anyway. 

I donâ€™t think I could slit my wrists but I think thereâ€™s a way I could hang myself on the stairs. 

Itâ€™s not going to get better for me and I donâ€™t want to stick around hating myself everyday waiting to see if it does.
