I'd rather be dead then have to work.Working is such a mental drain for me, especially in hospitality. When i say to someone "I fucking hate work" and they reply, "Well i hate it too, but you have to do it", it's like, Nah, i can just kill myself. I really don't get how the suicide rate isn't higher. Working is 99% me rationalizing suicide.
