I just want to restI have been trying as hard as I can since I could talk. I just want to stop trying, even if it means I never get to try again. 

I get so much pain and the doctors have left me to deal with a problem they could fix so easily because I'm not in enough pain right now. They are going to let the pain become agony again before they do anything and I don't think I should HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT.
