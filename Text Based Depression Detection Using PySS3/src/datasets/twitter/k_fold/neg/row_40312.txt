ClichÃ©I didn't think I would be one to get extremely suicidal and post here on New Year's Day. After all, it's just another day, right? I feel like I can't go on, I don't want to experience a-whole-nother year on this earth. I'm so uncomfortable in my own body and mind. I hate everything about myself. I haven't felt this bad in a long time, idk what it is about the new year that sparks something. 

Been sober for 9 months and planning to drink tomorrow. Yayy, happy new year.
