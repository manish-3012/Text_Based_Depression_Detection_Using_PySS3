I want to die youngThe thought of living physically hurts me. I am so lost and feel as though no one will/can love me. I get clingy and weak and that pushed everyone away. I really believe there is no hope for me. The year has just been one heartache after the other with my relationship, my university, my health, work, visa status.

The Universe wants me gone and I don't want to fight it anymore.
