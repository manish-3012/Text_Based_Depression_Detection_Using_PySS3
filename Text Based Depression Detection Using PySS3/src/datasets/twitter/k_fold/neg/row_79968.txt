Anyone else increasingly reckless because suicidal?I started shoplifting small things off of supermarkets not bc i need them but bc why not. I also started stealing from work bc why not. I'm not in any way in a position to lose my job and if i do I'll just kill myself. And i tell myself that, like idgaf, if i get caught ill just kill myself

I'm also thinking of buying me a lot of drugs bc if i start abusing them i might die which sounds pretty nice.
