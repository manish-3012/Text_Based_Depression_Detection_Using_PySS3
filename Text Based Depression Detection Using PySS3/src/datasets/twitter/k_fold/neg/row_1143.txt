Everyone always think about the method, the day and the hour they want to commit suicide, but I was just wondering what will you be wearing on your last day, maybe the people who find you will remember more the clothes you'll be wearing instead of the expression in your face (if you still have one)As a traumatic experience, maybe they won't be able to see the exact same outfit without feeling dead inside or passing out for a moment.

I'm not giving more importance to a such materialistic  aspect instead of the real deal wich is mental health. I just wanted to share what I was thinking.
