Had a bit of a breakthroughWith out going into too much detail I will just say that yesterday I was feeling very strange, I was having emotions I hadn't genuinely felt in years.  It was so different I had to think about what I was feeling, I realized that it was hope and excitement about the changes n my life.  This might be corny and cheesy, but I just wanted to share and say that even at our worst hours there is hope, and you WILL get through it, what ever *it* may be.
