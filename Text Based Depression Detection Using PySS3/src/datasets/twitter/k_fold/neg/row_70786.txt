realizing that the rest of my life is just going to be work and pain. not sure I can handle the amount of pain i'm in right now. it's been three solid months of feeling this way and i'm just bored with myself. bored with everything in my head trying to convince me that it might get better. it won't. i'm fucked up and there is SO much baggage that i really will not be able to have a normal life. i've given up trying to make anything better.
