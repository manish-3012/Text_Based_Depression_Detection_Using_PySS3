Four months ill be twenty one and can legally buy a pistol in CA then my time is up.Im done. no point anymore. I have fantastic things going for me. Ive gotten past the many hard times in my life, most on my own. Ive suffered with depression for most of it, and have willed through. but I dont want to struggle my entire life for meaningless things anymore, being late to work, getting sick, eating, sleeping, my existence is unneeded, no family, a plethora of friends but my end will just be blip on their spectrum of life, like it never happened. Ive tried before, tricked a friend to go to the indoor gun range last year, held the AR in my ends, could have been done, easy, BUT THERE WERE little kids and families there. Im trying to end it not scar young kids for life. So to make the reality of this situation a joke to myself until i pull the trigger, like master oogway said "My time has come." in 4 months
