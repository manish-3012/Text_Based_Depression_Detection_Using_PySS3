I think I'm going to do it soon.I'm only 13 but i've seen how cruel this world is what the fuck :( I hate looking like a women. I hate that Homophobes have made me hate being gay. I hate that people cant just accept each other and I hate that in my lifetime change will never happen. I want escape, I'm not to sure but I have stuff I could use as a noose and I have antidepressants but it's scary. I'm just 13, why is the world so cruel. I'm so fucking scared, i used to be scared of killing my self but now I long for it, It's also not easy trying to cope with OCD and DPDR. Fuck my life.
