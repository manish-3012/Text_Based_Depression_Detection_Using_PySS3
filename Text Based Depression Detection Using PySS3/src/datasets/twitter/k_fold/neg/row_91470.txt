Almost readyI've erased all signs of me online, except some old entries which I'm having a hard time getting removed. 

I haven't gotten a gift for my birthday or Christmas in like 7 years and I think I would start balling if someone hugged me. Life sucks, nobody cares about me, never did. Same old story. 

I hope you all the best
