Intrusive suicidal thoughtsI used to struggle with depression and anxiety really bad and would self harm. I've had a suicide attempt in the past as well. Im at a point in my life now where I feel a lot better and Im definitely not depressed anymore, but I get a lot of suicidal thoughts still and its really awful. I think about killing myself every single day but I'm not really sad? Idk what to do. I really thought I was getting better but it kind of seems like I'm going through a downword spiral.
