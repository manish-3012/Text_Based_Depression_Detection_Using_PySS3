Well, I set a deadline again.I'm going to try to fix my shit this semester, and if I can't that's it. I'm out of energy, I'm out of money, and I'm out of goodwill. People will miss me but they're going to have to fucking deal, because I will never be good enough for them anyway and I'm sick of being a burden on my parents. I feel as if I have no other path forward.

I haven't decided on a location yet (I'd like to be far away from my parents), but I think I've figured out my method (which I will not discuss in accordance with Rule 1a).
