I wish I had the guts to finally do itI've been talking about killing myself for years. I tried several times before, but haven't since 2016. Why don't I have the guts to do it now? I'm miserable stuck in a place where I won't be able to get out. I wish I had someone. I'm so alone and can't connect with a single person. I try and they say they are there for me and then they ghost me. I truly deserve to be 6 feet in the ground.
