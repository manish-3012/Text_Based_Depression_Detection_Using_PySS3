"How are you?"I've been lying all damn day to this question. I've said, "fine", "good", "okay." What I really want to say is this:

1) I'm planning my suicide and hoping it appears like an accident.

2) I want to tell you I've been carefully writing a Goodbye book that explains my choice to kill myself and has notes to anyone who was ever important in my life..except you might save me and I can't take that chance

3) I'm not okay, haven't been for over a decade. Sometimes I hold my breath for long periods of time hoping for brain damage or a heart attack to bring me to an early death.

How are you? Post your typical answers then 3 things you would really say.
