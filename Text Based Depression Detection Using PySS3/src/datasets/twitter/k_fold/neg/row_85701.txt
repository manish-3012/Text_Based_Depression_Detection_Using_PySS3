I hate everything about myselfI'm fat and ugly and lazy. I'm not particularly smart or charistmatic  or interesting or creative as much as I try to be. I'm a pussy. I'm scared of everything. Rejection, pain, talking to strangers on the phone. I'm a 27 year-old-virgin. I'm a consumer. I consume, I eat, I buy stuff, but I contribute nothing to anyone. I do just enough for the job I hate to not get fired. God I'm such a pussy. If I weren't so afraid of pain and death and talking to strangers I'd have bought a gun and shot myself in the head already.  Instead I'm going for a slow death. Eating everything in sight til I have a heart attack at 50 like my uncle and grandfather. Probably sooner. I haven't showered in days or brushed my teeth or shaved. I haven't cleaned my room in 2 years. I live in filth. I'm disgusting and I wish I were put down like a sick dog.
