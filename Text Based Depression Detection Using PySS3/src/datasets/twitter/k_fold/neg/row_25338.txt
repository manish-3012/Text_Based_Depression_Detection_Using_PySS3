Canâ€™t take it anymore. Kms tonightDealt with depression most of my life and Iâ€™m finally fuckin done. I canâ€™t do it anymore and I canâ€™t keep living like this. Iâ€™m in a neverending loop of sadness, loneliness and self destruction. No meds work, neither does therapy. Iâ€™m a lowlife bum with no ambitions and I think that itâ€™s my time to go. My 20 years on this planet have been nothing short of shit. I hope you all turn your lives around and feel better.
