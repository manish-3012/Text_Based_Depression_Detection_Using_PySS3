I'm Not Sure if I can do this AnymoreHey everyone, recently my life has been an emotional roller coaster. Currently, I'm a junior at my local university and I've been feeling overwhelmed with the amount of academic work that I have to complete. Last week, I had to assist with putting down one of my sister's pets which was one of the most difficult nights that I had to live through. As for my university, I'm beginning to lose interest in working at the campus radio station because I don't feel happy working there anymore. Furthermore, I'm also feeling overwhelmed working as the social media director for Active Minds at my local university. Ever since then, I've been having thoughts of ending my life, but not to the point where I want to do it. The explanation of why I don't want to leave is because I still see some purpose in my life.

As for my mental health, I see a counselor at my college weekly. While it's great to check in with her, I'm not too sure if I'm making any progress in improving my mental health. I have some friends here on campus and they do care about me, but I don't want to feel like a burden to them. As for my relatives, I'm too scared of telling them what's going on because they may pull me out. Up until now, each day for me gets harder and harder to go through because I routinely think that I am stuck in a rot and I'm never going to escape.

I honestly don't know what to do anymore and I don't want to leave. I want to complete my junior and senior years of college and continue on in my life with my friends and family. I want to be able to live a successful life and I feel as though I am losing my grip on reality. If there is anybody out there that can help me, I would greatly appreciate it. I don't want to leave.
