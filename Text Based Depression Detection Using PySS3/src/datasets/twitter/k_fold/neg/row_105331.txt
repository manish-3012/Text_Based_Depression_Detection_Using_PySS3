I'm just so sad...Guys, why is every day the same?

I'm a senior in high school and literally everything on the outside of my life looks great, but I hate all of it.

The only times I'm "happy" during the day are when I'm joking with my best friend at school or talking with my boyfriend at night. The latter always ends up ruining my already mundane day. Gosh, he doesn't know what he's doing wrong. Talking to him and hearing him misunderstand me reminds me how alone I am. I love him so much, but he's literally killing any semblance of peace I may have had during the day.

I can't look forward to the future. I think about dying every day to escape all of this. Suicide never leaves my mind some days. Everything is only going to get harder and I'm so tired of crying alone in my bed every night. It's always the same. My heart will consistently and slowly build back up during the day, but it always breaks at night. These ups and downs are killing me. I'm just waiting for the day I can buy a gun at this point. I have 3 more long years to get through...
