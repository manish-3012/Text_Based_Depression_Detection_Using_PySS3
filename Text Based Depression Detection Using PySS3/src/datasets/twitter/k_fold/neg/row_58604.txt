Thoughts of suicideIt feels like I'm clawing for some sort of meaning, and there is none. I keep telling myself to just end it already, but it's selfish. I don't know what to do, I feel like I'm spiraling out of control. I tried getting help but all I got were a list of numbers that I'm too reluctant to call. I need help and I don't know where to find it.
