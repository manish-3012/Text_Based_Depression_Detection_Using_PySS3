this loneliness is killing meI'm autistic and I have the most pathetic excuse for social skills. I have no friends "in real life" because I'm incapable of holding conversations with people unless it's about video games (my lifelong special interest.)

I have a very small group of online friends that I'm in a server with on Discord. We all met on a forum that hosts yuri manga. These friends are rarely online so I don't get to talk to them much and it's making me incredibly lonely.

The person I had a crush on ghosted me for a week last year because I was being an attention-seeking piece of trash. She also claimed that I was engaging in self-destructive behaviour because I re-joined a Discord server where someone I had drama with is now an admin.

That person made me realise that I really don't deserve friends, or even happiness. I mess everything up and everyone hates me.

I'll never have real friends. I'll sure as hell will never have a girlfriend either because who would want to date me? No lesbians seem to want anything to do with me. It honestly makes me wish I was straight because at least men have showed some interest in me.

I'm done. I'm so fucking done and I want to stop existing.
