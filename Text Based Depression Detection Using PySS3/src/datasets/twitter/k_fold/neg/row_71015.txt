Why do people expect me to reach out when I want to kill myself?I mean, I'm kind of doing it right now, so please excuse my hypocrisy, but that's not really the point I am trying to get across.  
  
But why does everyone expect me to try talking to someone, calling someone or something like that when I am really suffering? I don't want to talk to *anyone* when I am like that. I just want to be alone in my pain.  
  
There is no one I have to reach out that would really care anyways. Sure I have my family, I'm even lucky enough to have a therapist and a doctor, but I don't feel like they really care. There is more evidence to the contrary. I am just an annoying burden to everyone at this point. I can tell. No one has to say it.  
  
I mean, I'm not going deny that there is probably a part of me that wants help. I just bury it. And I don't feel like I deserve help. I want to kill myself, I need to kill myself, I HAVE to kill myself. Why would I tell someone?! They would only pretend to care and try to stop me from achieving what I need to do.  
  
So when I am feeling horrible what do I do? Nothing. I don't talk to anyone because I don't want or deserve help. So I just feel like crap and cut myself or something like that. Maybe, no, hopefully, one day I will actually try to kill myself for real. I have felt the true urge to end my own life before. It passes because I'm a coward.  
  
I'm sorry if you read this. It became a lot more melodramatic than I intended. It's more of a journal entry at this point anyways so there is no point in posting it to Reddit. I will probably delete this almost immediately.  
  
I'm sorry for burdening your feed with this. I really, unironically am. I'm a piece of shit. I don't know why I'm typing this or let alone posting it. I guess there is still that little piece of me that wants help like I mentioned earlier. But I sure as hell don't deserve it.
