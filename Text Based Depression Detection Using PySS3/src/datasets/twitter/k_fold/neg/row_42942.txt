I might do itYeah Iâ€™m just one of many people here. Nothing special. Not sure why Iâ€™m writing this at all. Iâ€™m alone. Completely alone now. My family hates me. My dad absolutely despises me. Just got off the phone with him before anyone (if anyone sees this) tries to say he doesnâ€™t. Told me he hates me for faking mental illness for attention. I wish I was faking. My best friend/boyfriend cheated on me. Has been for 3 years. I have no one now. Just online friends. Donâ€™t want to bother them. If everyone in my life has no problems leaving me, telling me that they donâ€™t care aboht me then why should I care. I did that. And it got me no where. Iâ€™m done.
