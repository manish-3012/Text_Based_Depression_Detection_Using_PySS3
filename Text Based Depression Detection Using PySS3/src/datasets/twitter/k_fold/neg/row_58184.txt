I no longer have a reason to liveIâ€™m 36 and everything in my life has collapsed. There is no longer anything left. Itâ€™s like I am nothing. There seems to be no reason for me to continue existing. Itâ€™s hard to explain but everything Iâ€™ve tried to do has failed and Iâ€™m left with nothing. Absolutely zero.

I got sober from alcohol and cocaine about 4 years ago and I rode the pink cloud for about 3 months but crashed hard the last 3.5 years. In many ways my depression got worse since getting sober. 

Iâ€™ve been to therapists, taken SSRIâ€™s but it doesnâ€™t help. Last year I went on a terrible gambling spree that ended in bankruptcy. I had to leave my apartment in LA and move in with my grandparents because I ran out of gas, just couldnâ€™t grind out the low paying job, pay the rent, etc...

I was pursuing a writing career since I was 22 and moved to LA 6 years ago after a stint in the military. I havenâ€™t been able to write for 2 years now. I try everyday but am unable to get anything coherent on the page. Like I said Iâ€™m out of gas, nothing in the tank. 

What little faith I had in life is gone. Iâ€™m realizing that much of my adult life this far was built in delusions of grandeur that have now been shattered. Writing was the only reason I had to live. It kept me going. I invested hours a day for years and years doing it. I thought writing was going to save me but it ended up destroying me. I was son singularly focused on writing that I neglected all other aspects of my life. I have no skills other than a useless BFA in writing. I never tried to date since high school and am now a bankrupt, alcoholic, addict living with his grandparents. Any self respecting woman wouldnâ€™t give me the time of day and I completely understand. 

Other than writing the only other joy I had in life was from drinking, drugging and gambling but these addictions are no longer sustainable. The joy was lost a long time ago. Any relapse would be a passive- aggressive suicide attempt. And Iâ€™m on the verge of relapse in the hope that I will die. 

I donâ€™t know what do. Sobriety canâ€™t  save me. Money canâ€™t help me. A job canâ€™t help me. SSRIâ€™s donâ€™t help. A woman canâ€™t save me. 

The realization that I am fatally flawed is terrifying and knowing that my life is doomed weighs on me daily. I want the pain to stop but it only gets worse year by year. Iâ€™m terrified to think how I will feel at 40 or 50 if I make it there. The thought of living like this for another decade or more is unbearable.
