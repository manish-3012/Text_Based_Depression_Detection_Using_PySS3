I donâ€™t knowIâ€™m not in a good space.  Iâ€™ve knowingly been getting worse.  There doesnâ€™t seem to be any way to stop it.  Thereâ€™s no one to talk to.  No friends.  No supportive family.  I canâ€™t seem to catch myself.  Days all run together.  Iâ€™m not moving forward with the rest of the world.  I exist only in an empty stasis, alone in my thoughts.  I canâ€™t wait until itâ€™s over.
