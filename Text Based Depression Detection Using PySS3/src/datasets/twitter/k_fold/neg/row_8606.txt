The guilt of what I did is destroying me inside and I can't live like this anymoreI've been suffering with depression for as long as I can remember now, it has turned me into a pathetic, no good abusive arsehole. My ex girlfriend left me after Christmas with a simple text and nothing more and I don't blame her but the guilt I feel from being abusive mentally and physically to her is eating me alive And i can't live with this, there is nothing I can do to repair the damage I have caused this amazing lady and suicide looks like my only option right now, I know I'm a piece of shit and deserve everything I get I'm not looking for sympathy or someone to tell me not to do it but I just wanted to share a simple message to every man out there.. treat your lady with respect and don't restrict her from following her dreams support her with everything she does and don't make the same mistake as me don't let this illness ruin your life like it has mine,  think before you act on anything. Thank you
