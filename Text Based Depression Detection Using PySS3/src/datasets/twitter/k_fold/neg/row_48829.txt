My friend (not quite girlfriend... complicated, but we're on that path) is depressed and is at times suicidal. She lives far away (another country) and I don't know what to do if things get drastic.She's currently out of the country in college. She has a lot of familial problems, stemming from her parents and other factors... she seems to have some paranoia issues, she refused to come here and post, because she thinks her father can track her anywhere on the internet... and I feel like I'm not really helping her or reaching her. I don't know what to say to help her feel better, but I can't just leave her alone. I don't know how to get her to really open up and get the help she needs. She thinks people from suicide hotlines just want good stories and don't really care about people.

I really hate watching her suffer, especially from afar, but I can't abandon her. I feel useless right now.
