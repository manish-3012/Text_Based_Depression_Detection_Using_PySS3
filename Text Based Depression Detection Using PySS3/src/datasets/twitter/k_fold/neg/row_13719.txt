So exhaustedI really need help. I'm in a really dark place. Three months ago I left an abusive relationship and I can't get over the whole thing, everything he did to me and how it has fucked up my whole life. Every day it's like waking up in the same nightmare. I just can't put up with it anymore. I'm so over living like this and feeling the way I do. Things have really taken a turn this past week and I'm more and more convinced every day that I should kill myself, just get it over with. I'm very close tonight. I'm considering texting a friend but I feel so fucking guilty for putting all of the baggage that I have on everyone and just expecting them to deal with it. At some point I have to realize when it's time. Like when enough is enough. I just can't get through it this time.
