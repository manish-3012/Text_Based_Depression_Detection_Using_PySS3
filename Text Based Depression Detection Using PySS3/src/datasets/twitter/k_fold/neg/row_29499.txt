I am worthless to myselfAs soon as the sun sets I my usual sadness gets 10x worse, almost everyday.
By 0200 I am ready to kill mself, but somehow i powered through until now and just went to sleep.
why is that?/anyone in a similar position?

will start therapy soon, but dont know if I ca hold onlong enough.
