Suicide runs in the family...so why can't my family talk about it?My grandfather took his life after a long struggle with PTSD and depression. My father attempted suicide more than once, but didn't succeed.

...I realize intimately how painful and difficult this topic can be. But.... I cannot fathom how the response to someone having such thoughts can be negative.

I feel like... I learned this lesson of being terrified of speaking openly about my suicidal ideation. Less here, in hopeful anonymity. And awkwardly and less than openly with my therapist.

But... What I wish I had was someone close to me who could just...listen and not judge. Not sob. Not be angry. Not treat it like a clinician.

So I awkwardly find myself here. Trying to vent some of the worst of the thoughts in the hopes of them holding less sway.

I've thought it through to the point of having a plan, but... I've never acted. Because my fear of death and my hope things will improve with my OCD keeps me in check. And because I don't want to hurt my loved ones, seeing how my grandfather's death haunts some of them.

But there are increasing days where hope feels like a willful delusion. And... I don't know what to do.
