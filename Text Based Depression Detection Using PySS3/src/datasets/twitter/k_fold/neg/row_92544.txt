Just want to dieBefore I start this I just want to get my age out of the way. I'm 17, now I know I'm going to be told that I haven't lived my life long enough but honestly, my life is so dull, depressing and boring. 

I've literally completely fucked almost any friendship/relationship I've ever had, and the few people I do have in my life online and irl all have better people than me. More likeable people than me. I try my best to form some kind of closeness but I always get shutdown or they stop talking to me probably in favour of others.

My life is constant depression. Meds, therapy and all of that other stuff will NOT help me and I'm tired of being told that just because it has worked for others that it will work for me because it won't. And to be honest I don't want it to. I want to be over with my life and the only thing that makes it difficult for me to physically do it is my anxiety, which happens to be one of many reasons I want to do it in the first place.

I play games (alone) to try and fill the void inside me while I try and sort my life out and it never works. It's an ongoing battle that has even gotten to the point where my self-doubt even extends to my performance on these fucking games and it adds to my depression.

If you look at my reddit profile you'll notice I barely post or submit and this is because I get anxious of how people will critique my opinions just like they do everywhere else and I'm sure this sounds stupid. I frequently look at anything I've ever posted on reddit, youtube, etc and delete anything that is receiving downvotes or dislikes. My anxiety is that bad to me and whenever I'm thinking of doing something I resist because of fear of other people. Everything I do or say is in fear because I'm constantly under the pressure of what other people will think about me or how it could change what they think of me.

I hate everything about myself. I have a very toxic, negative, and depressing personality but at certain rare times I become somewhat optimistic and funny and love to be around people and I become friends with people when I'm in that state of mind. Then, I quickly return to being depressed because I'm a very sensitive person and the smallest of things make me depressed which lead to me wanting to end my life. A lot of the time people think I'm joking when I get sensitive at these things because they're so fucking small that it seems pathetic to even me, but in the moment they make me really upset or angry.

I'm honestly tired and I live a life where I'm constantly told I'm wrong or someone else is more "right" than me by my parents, friends, random people on games that I play and more to the point where I don't want to even have an opinion anymore. I constantly hurt people both intentionally and unintentionally based on what they do to me. I am a toxic person.

I have no aspirations. There's nothing I want. Anything I could have possibly wanted is no longer something I can attain or something that won't make me happy anymore because it's too late.

I just needed to vent this somewhere because if I talk to anyone else they'll say I'm guilt tripping or looking for attention (they're tired of me being suicidal every second) and I understand that fully. That is another reason I want to just do it. No one will have to deal with my shit anymore because as it stands it's like other people deal with my problems when they probably have things of their own.

I apologise if this post comes across as me looking for sympathy because I really just needed to speak my internal thoughts out for once.
