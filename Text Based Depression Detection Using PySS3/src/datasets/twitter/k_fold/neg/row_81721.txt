Closer to shatteringEveryday just seems to be torture to me. Have been single and alone most of my life, latest stretch has been 12 years without a relationship or intimacy. Living in Los Angeles isn't easy and maybe it's just that I don't know how to hold a conversation as I'm too closed sometimes. I cried myself to sleep the other night after thinking of how I could end it, had a dream the night before that which felt like a premonition to my own death which wasn't pretty. Just had a moment of sadness come out of nowhere earlier. I'm trying my hardest nowadays to even find someone to put me into an embrace and quiet my demons. Not much time left for me I think before it all shatters and ends. It's not easy to fix a shattered figure. When it happens for me, just watch the local news.
