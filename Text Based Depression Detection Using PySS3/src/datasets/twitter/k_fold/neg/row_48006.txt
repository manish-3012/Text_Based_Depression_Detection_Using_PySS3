I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DOI have no idea what's going on in my life. Everything is a mess, my will to live is over. From my childhood I was one of the most optimistic kid, full of vigour just like my dad, but now i have lost it. I am 20 and i don't know what to do where to go. My parents don't believe mental illness is a thing, i don't have any friends either to share this thing with, from last 3 years i am broken to my core. All the people that i know are ahead of me. I have big dreams and goals as well but i am crushed, i have let my parents down. Everybody is sick of me. Why the hell i am even alive?? What's the purpose of all this?
