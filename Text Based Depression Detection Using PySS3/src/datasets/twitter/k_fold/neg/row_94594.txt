Since I can't tell people I know, might as well tell people I don'tI've been planning this for ten years. I set goals for myself, and have achieved all of them. I've gotten my university degrees, paid off all my student debt, gotten a well-paying job, and fulfilled every obligation I have--and I ended up 70 days ahead of schedule. So, yay, go me! I'm proactive!

I don't know if people typically plan so far ahead. But it is incredibly trying to wait for this self-imposed deadline. It's never been a matter of things being too painful or difficult or anything like that. I'm actually rather bored of this, and have no interest in putting up with it for another fifty or sixty or seventy or however many years until that last cheeseburger does me in.

This isn't the sort of thing you can say to somebody you know, but I want to tell people so they aren't surprised. Since people I know personally would, naturally, get in my damn way, this will have to do.
