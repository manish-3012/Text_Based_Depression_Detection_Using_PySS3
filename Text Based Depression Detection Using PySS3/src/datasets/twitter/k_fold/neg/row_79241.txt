Iâ€™m a waste of space, so this is GoodbyeAll in 2020, Both of my dogs died. Watched my stepdad physically abuse my sister and I had to get her to safety. Both my grandma and grandpa are dying right now. Nearly got sexually assaulted, and got diagnosed with bipolar 2 and adhd this year. Iâ€™m so behind in my classes, I physically canâ€™t force myself to do anything. Long story short, Iâ€™m not reacting to any of those things that have happened to me well at all. I know how Iâ€™m reacting is stupid. So many worse things have happened to people and Iâ€™m being a baby because I canâ€™t handle being stressed (these feeling were spurred on by a big deadline tomorrow but have been in me a long time) and I just canâ€™t live here anymore knowing that Iâ€™m failing massively. Iâ€™m too emotional and Iâ€™m a huge burden to my friends and family. I canâ€™t tell anyone about this. I think Iâ€™m just gonna take my whole bottles of Cymbalta and Lamictal and ibuprofen and see what happens. Iâ€™m scared but I know itâ€™s what I need to do tonight.
