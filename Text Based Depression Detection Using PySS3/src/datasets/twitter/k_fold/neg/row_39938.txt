Can't take this anymore.1. I've mistreated my mum, dad and sister. I'm dying on the inside with guilt.
2. Have a degree, I attend interviews, they offer job but cancel in the last minute. I depend on parents even after abusing them verbally.
3. I have no friends ðŸ˜­
4. My plans fail to materialize in the end and it always happens to me ðŸ˜¥

Life really feels like a burden and I've always been a bit unlucky (in things which I can't control), sometimes I just want this suffering to end but I'm too much a coward to kill myself.

Donno what else to say, I spend my days crying for no reason and it really hurts mentally. My parents are worried about me.

I want to end this suffering ðŸ˜¥
