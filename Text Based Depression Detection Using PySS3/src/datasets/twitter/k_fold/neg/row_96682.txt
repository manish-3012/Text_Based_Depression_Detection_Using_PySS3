I feel like no one believes how serious your mental health is unless youâ€™re successful in your suicide attempt..Even if you fail, some people will claim that youâ€™re attention seeking or being over dramatic. But the second youâ€™re gone, the whole energy changes to â€œwe shouldâ€™ve helped moreâ€

I donâ€™t fucking get it. Itâ€™s only when someone is officially 100% GONE that people want to start caring about mental health.

But then I think to myself.. itâ€™s my life, not theirs. Why SHOULD they worry about me anyways? Itâ€™s not their job to make sure Iâ€™m happy or sane.


I hope thereâ€™s a better place out there after all this.
