Downward SpiralEverything is just full of pain and suffering. I wake up every day wanting to be dead because everything I do is meaningless  or full of sadness. Why am I pursuing things that I know will not bring me happiness? because that's life. The things that made me happy are non-existent, i don't  even enjoy my passion anymore. Everything in life is just insufferable to the point there is no purpose to even sustain life on this planet because of it's profound agony. People tell me how much of a horrible person I'am even though I try to do good. I'm a failure and a horrible human.
