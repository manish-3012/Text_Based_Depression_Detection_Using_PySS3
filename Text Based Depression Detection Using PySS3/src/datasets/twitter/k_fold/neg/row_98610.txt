donâ€™t try to o.d at home kidsI never thought I would write something here, but I just tried to kms with clonazepam, and it was the worst thing I ever fucking did, I mean just why did I do that if I already knew it wasnâ€™t gonna work, but I said hey PERHAPS it would, well no. Now Iâ€™m feeling like shit, Iâ€™m dizzy, weak, Iâ€™ve been throwing up the past 1 hour and still feel like shit. U might wonder why did I do that? Well, Iâ€™m tired of life, Iâ€™m 20, unemployed, I quit university, I live w my mom and we donâ€™t get along, I donâ€™t have friends, nobody even likes me so, why the heck live? But Iâ€™m a failure even trying to kms, this isnâ€™t the first time tho, but nobody cares about me so, yea I guess Iâ€™m ok now, but this wonâ€™t be the last time for sure. Thx 4 reading
