23/f with a family history of suicideI've never actually tried or seriously thought about killing myself. But I do have issues with depression and self harm on occasion. My family tree is stained with the darkness of suicide, my mother's father and uncle, my mother, and my uncle. 


I guess I'm just worried that one day, when things aren't going well and I have a weak moment where one cut goes deeper than before it'll cross my mind. Like the scent of an ex lover caressing my memory. 

Saying "hey, plenty of your family have fallen to this sickness. It wouldn't be such a bad way to go."

And it's a really scary thought. As of right now, 6 years after I found my mother I find it completely selfish. But will that change over time. As the sickness sets in. When I have a family and people that depend on me? 

Just needed to get this off my chest. Sorry.
