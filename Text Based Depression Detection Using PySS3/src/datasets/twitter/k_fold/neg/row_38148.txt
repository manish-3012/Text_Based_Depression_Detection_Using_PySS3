When not if.When I kill myself, would a handwritten or digital note (like on my phone) be best. Which would be more reliable as far as being found or recovered by my family? Upon my death would they go through my phone (my family or the police)? Iâ€™m scared of leaving a physical note for fear of it being found before Iâ€™ve done the deed and my family thus intervening. Iâ€™ve handwritten drafts but am now wondering if perhaps writing and keeping it on my phone would be a better idea.
