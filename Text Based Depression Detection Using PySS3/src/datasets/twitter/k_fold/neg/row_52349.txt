Anyone feel like talking doesnâ€™t do shit?Whenever anyone asks how Iâ€™m doing either

1)I just say Iâ€™m fine (something Iâ€™m trying to break out of the habit of)

2)I say nah Iâ€™m feeling shit


The friend/therapist/family member etc then says oh do you want to talk about it?

Recently Iâ€™m finding it doesnâ€™t help me to vent. I just seem to be reminding myself of the reasons I feel depressed and then the conversation has been worthless. The person Iâ€™m talking to will of course try and help but nothing they say makes me feel better.

 â€˜Try going for a run tomorrowâ€™

 â€˜youâ€™re coping really well lately!â€™

 â€˜Id miss you so much if you killed yourselfâ€™

 â€˜donâ€™t let ___ get to youâ€™

 â€˜donâ€™t worry about that youâ€™ll work it outâ€™ 

â€˜things get better believe meâ€™



Nothing that is meant to help is helping me so...

Guess Iâ€™ll die
