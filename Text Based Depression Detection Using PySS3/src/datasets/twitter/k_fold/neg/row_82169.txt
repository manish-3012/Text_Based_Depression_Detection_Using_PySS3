The most beautiful suicideI'm so happy, I haven't smiled in a long time and I got a big smile on my face now that I figured out how I want to go out with the most beautiful song I ever heard in my life. I'm going to cut my veins and bleed out to the song "Giant Leap" by Adam &amp; Daniel Skinner while completely stoned. I seriously wish everyone struggling with depression the very best because depression is the worst feeling I ever went through, especially when no one cares. I'm very happy I found my exit.
