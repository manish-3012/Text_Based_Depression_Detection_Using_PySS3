Iâ€™ve wanted to die so bad today. things will work out but Can I ramble about it with you?I wrote this long post, but I just deleted it. Here are the spark notes. Life has sucked for a long time. Today I felt the need to die much stronger than anytime before. I was inches away. I have a huge headache from stopping myself with all my mental power. Here is the important part...

I want a new start. Itâ€™s not that I want to die itâ€™s that I have felt trapped for so long it feels like the only option. Is it possible can I get away from this life one day. 

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m typing anymore. I have wrote 10 different post across 10 different subreddits just to delete them. I want to write that Iâ€™m in pain. I want to come up with some solution and I want some one to support me for once in the pursuit of my own happiness. I am so desperate. I look though the internet hoping I find some job or situation that can take me far away from all this pain. Iâ€™m trying so hard to not feel this way anymore. Iâ€™m rambling again thatâ€™s why I deleted the other posts. I want a future so bad itâ€™s killing me
