just a rough nightiâ€™ve had a lot of rough nights lately and suicide has always been a passing thought in the back of my mind. something that iâ€™ve considered, but could never go through with out of fear. i grew up in a really verbally, mentally and sexually abusive household. shortly after graduating high school a few years ago, i was basically kicked out of my momâ€™s house because of her boyfriend who hated me for all of my life. within that time i find a boy i fell in love with and got engaged. we were together for 3 years and i genuinely thought it was going to be one of those fairytale endings as lame as that sounds. he cheated on me with a girl he told me not to worry about over and over again. i ended things a few months ago. i just found out he has a new girlfriend tonight and iâ€™m really happy for him. he deserves to find happiness even after what he did to me. but he is claiming that someone messaged him saying i had been cheating on him for months before or relationship ended and blamed everything falling apart on me. telling me all i can do is play the victim and how his mom always thought i was using him to get out of the state i lived in. all which are untrue. he told me how i have no ambition or path in life and i know he said these things to hurt me. but now iâ€™m starting to feel like they are true and everything is starting to feel pointless. suicide is a thought creeping back into my mind and i hate that. i think maybe i just needed to type some of it all out. i donâ€™t know if it helped or not, but iâ€™m trying to seek out some sort of help or distraction to keep death off of my mind.
