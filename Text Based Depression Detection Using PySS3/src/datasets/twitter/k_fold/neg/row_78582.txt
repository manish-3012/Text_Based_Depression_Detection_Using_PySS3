I lost my motivation to live (17/F)I recieved my exam results yesterday, it was very poor and I only qualified for technical school in customer service. I loathe my job as a server, and hence I don't think I'll enjoy my life in customer service.

My parent isn't very supportive of being retaking my exams again as a private candidate because my school kicked me out. However, I do have a dream of making it to politics someday, me entering that school is going to shut all the doors to all reputable law schools. As I think about life, I realized I wasted so much of my life on computer games and failed to developed my soft skills - i didn't even manage my schoolwork well. 

So now here I am typing away on my bed know well that the final nail is going to pushed into the coffin of my dream. I am terribly upset and scared - I think my parent is going to force me back to work if I chose to retake as a private candidate.

Tell me why I should continue living?
