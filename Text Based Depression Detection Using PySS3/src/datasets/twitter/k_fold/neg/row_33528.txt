Not even sure if this is the correct subreddit.I'm not even sure if this is the correct subreddit to post this as I've never really said to myself, YES suicide is the option, suicide is the only way out I must fucking kill myself. I really don't know what replies I expect from random redditors if I do end up getting any at all but it just feels weird. I'm only 15 and I haven't felt genuine happiness in a long time. When I do it's always dependent on someone or something else that's never in my control. Sometimes i just want time to pass quicker, then I remember that after a few more years of studying I'll find a job, work that shit for a few more decades and probably just die, and that's if I'm being optimistic and I don't get hit by a car or die in some tragic accident. Everyone around me is starting to find hobbies that lead to a certain profession/job they enjoy. 

I on the other hand used to love to do a lot of things but have recently started loosing interest in pretty much everything. Even before, after some of the shittiest days of my life I could come back home and play some random game or talk to someone. Don't get me wrong, those games are still here and the people I could talk to still are but It doesn't seem to make me happy anymore. 

As I said - I don't really know what reply to expect, I know motivation won't help, atleast for more than 5 seconds. I will never kill myself - that's for sure - but I still don't know what to do.
