Can't stand this anymoreI am 18 years old. I go to community college, with hopes of transferring to a good state university. I work full time and take about 14 credits. It's too much, I have bad grades. I go to school from 7-3, work from 4-11 or midnight. I have no time for anything. I have to work because I need to pay for the university, parents are paying for CC. I am so fucking stressed, bad grades will not let me transfer. I DONT NEED BIO TO BE A GODDAMN HISTORY TEACHER! Seriously, who makes these fucking requirements? I have no love life, lonely, tired, and stressed all the time. I feel like the sweet relief of death is so inviting. No more worrying, no more deadlines, no more stress. No *nothing*.
