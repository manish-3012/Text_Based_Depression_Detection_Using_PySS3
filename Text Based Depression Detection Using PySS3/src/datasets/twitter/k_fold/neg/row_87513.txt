I feel like killing myself.My best friend was in the military and he just came back today. They let him go because he a heath problems. But all the storys he told me about his experiences i feel like shut garbage amd a loser. He met a lot of people there and im worried he might get rid of me because im to negitive. Plus of you read my post history you can obviously tell how weird and messed up i am. I have a job but not much els. I just feel down and i feel like these voices are telling me that im not strong enough or im just to stupid to do anything and i end up grabbing a knife and having urges to cut myself on my face and chest and arms and stumick. I don't know what to do besides to kill myself.
