Coping strategiesPsych nurse sent me to a room to work on a safety plan. Question 2 is "my coping strategies. The things I will do on my own if I become suicidal again, to help me not act on my thoughts or urges are"...what should I put? What has worked for you? I wrote down "defer, Reddit, exercise" so far.

Calling a friend or crisis line or going to the nearest ER doesn't appeal to me.
