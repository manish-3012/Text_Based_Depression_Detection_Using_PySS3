Debating going to the hospitalIts been weeks now and i cant shake this feeling of emptiness. I cant stop thinking about suicide, even my dreams are about it. Ive been driving recklessly because it is the only way other than self harm that i can feel anything. I want to die. Idk if its bother even going to the hospital. I feel like a hopeless cause. Im a waste and i dont really see the point in trying anymore.
