:((Hi, Iâ€™m a 17 year old girl and Iâ€™m considering taking my life, I canâ€™t deal with this depression anymore Iâ€™m never happy I always cry myself to sleep. Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 10 years old constant in and out of mental health clinics I never got to experience my childhood. Iâ€™m to skinny people call me anorexic and say I have no butt, no hips or anything I admit Iâ€™m thin but Iâ€™m trying my best to gain weight but nothing is working ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­I donâ€™t go out anymore because of my weight Iâ€™m embarrassed and ashamed of myself I donâ€™t deserve to be here. I have nobody I canâ€™t talk to my mum because I donâ€™t want to put any stress on her mental health she has bipolar and bpd even tho she says I can talk to her. I got discharged from the mental health place because Iâ€™m turning 18.  Everyone walks all over me and talks bad about me for no reason this guy on snapchat has really scared me Iâ€™m not going to go into that tho. When I was 7 and on holiday in Cuba a man at a cafe bar thing touched me in a bad way I remember it but I never told anyone ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­all I can remember is sitting on his knee I think he was working there or something Iâ€™m not sure but Yh. I just give up I canâ€™t do this anymore Iâ€™m ugly I have no figure no life. Idk what to do
