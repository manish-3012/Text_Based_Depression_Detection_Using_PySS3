Are you depressed if you wouldnâ€™t mind dying?Lately Iâ€™ve been thinking to myself that life is too much work, you go to school you whole life, then you get a 9-5 job that you do everyday until you hit 68 and retired then do nothing because youâ€™re old so you sit at home and rot until you die, life is basically just work work work, it would be much better if I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about those things you know? But I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m depressed about it, I donâ€™t want to kill myself over it, I just wouldnâ€™t mind if something happened to me and I just died, Iâ€™d be ok with it.
