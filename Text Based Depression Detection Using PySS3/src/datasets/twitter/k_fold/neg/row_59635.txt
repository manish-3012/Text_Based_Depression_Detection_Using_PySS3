cry for help16-F

  iâ€™ve had major depression for the past 5 years now after my momâ€™s boyfriend killed himself, and i donâ€™t see any ways to get help. iâ€™ve tried therapy, iâ€™ve tried meds. i donâ€™t know if iâ€™m being dramatic or not, maybe i am, but i donâ€™t think i have what it takes to make it past this year. iâ€™ve self-harmed, but beyond enjoying the blood i hate scarring my body. it feels like everyone around me doesnâ€™t care. i took two of my prozac. donâ€™t know if iâ€™ll overdose or not. if i do, iâ€™m with family. maybe iâ€™ll live. if i donâ€™t, no one has to know. 

thanks for any advice i get, even if i donâ€™t reply. iâ€™m grateful for any time people waste trying to help me.
