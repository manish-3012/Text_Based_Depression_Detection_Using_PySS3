Why go on?What do you think is the real sense/ reason behind life? 
What would you tell someone who suffers from multiple diseases that are crippling plus depression and anxiety, would be the reason to go on? 
What if that someone doesnt have a bright future, not only due to the diseases but also a learning disabilty (therefore limited job opportunity) and injustice (regarding ethnicity and gender)? 
What if that someone always seems to have bad luck and has never been happy in life? 
Imagen someone who has no will/passion/motivation except fear and is even too scared to kill oneself...
What would you say? 
Thank you for your time ;)
