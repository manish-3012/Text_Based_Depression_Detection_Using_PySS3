Im in the edge to kill myselfDay after day, since my youth, i have feeling and want to kill myself.

My life aways had a lot of problems but even with all that im aways pushing myself, i even graduated as engineer (a little late, with 27y), i started to make my life, even with a severe depression, because i need to protect my parents and brothers. 

After covid all my life went downhill and now im in the edge, i lost my job, all my reserves since march and i cant even pay my dental treatment that im in need.

im really in the edge to kill myself, i dont see any reason to live, i dont see any reason to try anymore, as i said, i have severe depression for more than 20y but now, i.... dont know

Sry, i just needed to speak, im totally alone, i have â€œfriendsâ€ but, i dont know, im death inside, just need to finish the job â€œoutsideâ€
