Sometimes I wish I could just have at least a hug before I try to kill myselfJust a hug. Someone to tell me that itâ€™s ok, that Iâ€™m not as horrible of a person as I think I am, but itâ€™s not ok, and I am a horrible person so thatâ€™s not gonna happen. I try so hard, so fucking hard to not hurt people, to try to make people feel better, to help where I can, to be a friend or anything someone asks of me, but life always finds a way to shit on me. I only wanted a few things out of life, someone to love, someone who loves me and maybe to be happy. I didnâ€™t ask to be born, I didnâ€™t ask for this life. I donâ€™t want it anymore. Someone please end this for me, or Iâ€™ll do it myself.
