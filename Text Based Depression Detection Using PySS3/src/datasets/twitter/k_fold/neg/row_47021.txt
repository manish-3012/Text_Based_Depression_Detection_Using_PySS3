I'm done. This is my endnote.I'm tired of fighting just to live. Every single day. If it's not my parent/roommate, it's my bipolar disorder, the voices in my head, or trying to explain that I'm not insane to my therapist.

I've told myself a thousand times that things can only get better, that I can't do this to my cats,especially the one who doesn't trust anyone else. I feel so fucking guilty for even thinking of doing this to them, but I can't go on like this. I'm exhausted from not sleeping, from schoolwork, from trying to build normal relationships, even from struggling to exist.

My dad keeps trying to talk to me like everything's normal. He knows something's wrong and keeps apologizing, but at this point, it doesn't mean anything. They're hollow words, and he's using them to try to make it so I don't seem angry at him for telling me that I everything that comes out of my mouth is nagging. I'm terrified of actually nagging him to the point where I don't talk to him about my problems anymore, and yet I'm still nagging him. I give up. If I can't say two fucking words without nagging him, why even try?

I'm hurting, I'm miserable, and there's this growing numbness inside of me that tells me I don't have to take it. That there's a way out. The voices have been telling me this for years, and I do my best to ignore them, but maybe they're right. Maybe it's time to make sure the plan is foolproof. The only one who would care is 13 pounds of orange fluff, and even he'd forget pretty quickly.

There's a loaded .357 in my dad's closet. No safe, no lock, and no one would notice until I was long gone. I've been called a coward for trying in the past, and maybe I am. But I'm sick of existing like this. Something has to end, and maybe it's me.
