I feel that it is my duty to improve the state of my countryI was reading Reddit and seeing how British baby boomers and British millennials/gen z compare.

What I got from it is that millennials/gen z have had a pampered life and are entitled while Baby Boomers worked hard and should be respected and don't deserve the hate they get.

I am a teenager and from what I have heard, American teenagers are saints and British teenagers are getting worse. I've heard they are entitled and disgusting and they are ugly sub human scumbags who want to hurt baby boomers.

I feel that it is my duty to protect this country by removing a British teenager from society, by killing myself. The only thing is that, I am too cowardly and now I fear that the innocent baby boomers are paying their way to support a trashy, chavvy anti intellectual teenage scumbag like me.
