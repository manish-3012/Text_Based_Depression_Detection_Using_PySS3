iâ€™m weakiâ€™m weak. iâ€™m pathetic. iâ€™m stupid, and ugly, and worthless. i tried going to a crisis center yesterday but got scared and got them to let me out. i shouldnâ€™t have left.i want to die and i want this suffering to be over with but i keep going to therapy and work and perpetuating this horrible life i live. why. why why why. i donâ€™t want to go to work, but i donâ€™t want to be at home. i feel so alone. i did this to myself. i put off therapy too long and my ex didnâ€™t want to wait any longer. iâ€™m miserable without him. heâ€™s not even gone. we still live together but he wants space and iâ€™m so attached. i depend on him too much. iâ€™m trying to bide time until therapy makes a difference and i can see a psychiatrist but itâ€™s taking so long. waiting is so hard. i want to stop feeling this way. everything would be okay again if he took me back but i know he wonâ€™t. at least not right now. but when? i need to become a person again on my own. i know it. itâ€™s just so hard to be alone with yourself when you hate yourself. i hate myself so much. he was so good to me. he was so amazing and i fucked it up. something so perfect and i couldnâ€™t not fuck it up. iâ€™m pathetic

i want to quit my job but i canâ€™t i have to pay my bills so i can keep being alive and suffer and iâ€™m tired of it. iâ€™m tired of just working to pay bills to live a life i have no enjoyment in living. i donâ€™t want this to be forever but it doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s going to get better. iâ€™m so tired.
