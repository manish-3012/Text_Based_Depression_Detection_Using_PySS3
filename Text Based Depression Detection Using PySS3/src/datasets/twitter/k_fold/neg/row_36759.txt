I donâ€™t want anyone of you to dieI donâ€™t know you, I donâ€™t know everything youâ€™ve been through, but we are here for you. Everyone in this sub. It might not seem like it, but we truly are even those of us, like myself that want to paint the walls with my brains. I try to be there, I canâ€™t always and to be honest I sometimes wish I could. Thatâ€™s why there is actually a lot of us here. For when I canâ€™t be there, or the next person, or that person that just commented sending love and support. Maybe they canâ€™t always be there. But there will be someone trying. So please hang in there and support each other as much as all of you can. Because we do genuinely care.
