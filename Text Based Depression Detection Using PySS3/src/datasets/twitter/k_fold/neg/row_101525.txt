Murdering myself in this weekThis is really it...I can't do this anymore.. I'm fucking done

From tomorrow I will starve myself to near death 
No food no water for 3-5 days as long as i can go
Especially water i will try to dehydrate my body so I can harm my body more
Then at the last days of the week i will overdose on paracetamol and bunch of other pills like diabetes blood sugar control and some expired pills 
I will try to chug as much as I can and then I will try either stab myself as much as I can go for or I will drown myself in water idk which one will do ...I cant shoot myself obviously I got no gun and I can't hang myself (((fat ass&amp;no good rope))) ...
I don't care anymore if all of this painful or not or I might survive or not I will try to murder myself as much as I can I will try over and over again....

Or maybe I will wait some couple of months to see if i can get the coronavirus to save me from all this extra steps ...depends on how SHITTY this life will more get
