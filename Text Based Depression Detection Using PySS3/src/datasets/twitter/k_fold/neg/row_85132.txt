Christmas is coming and I'm still on the edge.It's D-2 days until Christmas. I've been able to do most of what I wanted; I've developed a game, get to know a few people that I like, write and publish articles, etc. December has been great for me so far.

However,

The hurtful feeling of all the mistakes that I did and got me to where I am now (the major fuck up of betraying my now ex's trust which lead me to everything bad that happened, including my allowance getting revoked and I don't have a stable income source anymore) still lingers and pushes me to kill myself on Christmas, midnight.

This year was the worst. I fell into a depressive episode for 3 months prior to December because of my own fault and I'm still recovering. I feel like, even though I was able to get a lot of things done this month, it's not worth trying to live on. I've lost the majority of what made my life meaningful for me and desperately trying to make something that I myself can cling to; I'm trying my best to create my own reason to live this month.

But, it feels like I failed.

No matter how many things I got things done, it doesn't feel worth it to live just to do that. It's not worth going through pain and misery from my past mistake just for the opportunity to do something slightly fun. 

I just want this nightmare to end. I can't enjoy a nightmare. Even nothingness is better than a nightmare that I can't wake up.

I'll end the nightmare that I brought to myself, one way or another.

Perhaps it'll ultimately end with a cut on my wrist.
