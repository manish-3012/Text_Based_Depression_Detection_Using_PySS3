Ghosting on life.When I stopped finding life satisfying I would pack everything into my truck and leave for a new town. I did this 7 times in my early 20â€™s. I had dismissed this as being unhealthy but I later realized it was a coping mechanism. 

Iâ€™ve been in place for 6 years. I am overwhelmed with thoughts of â€˜ghostingâ€™ on my current life. My depression and anxiety have intensified with age. Thereâ€™s nothing particularly bad about where I live and thereâ€™s nothing in particular I will find in other places that will make me happy.

I think about killing myself every day.
