FuckI'm ruining a friends life just by existing. I want to kill myself right now. I want to stop existing so I can stop ruining peoples lives.
She constantly talks about how people who do x and y are freaks, and they're things that I do.
Today, I was talking with another friend about what to do if I need support tomorrow. And we spoke saying I could come to them, and the original friend said "What, am I not reliable enough?" and sounded like she was about to cry.
I'm tired. I'm tired of this. I don't want to exist anymore. I'm tired of constantly dragging her down and making her upset. I'm so done.
I just want to hang myself.
