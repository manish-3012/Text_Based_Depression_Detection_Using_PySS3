Why is it so bad?I don't understand why suicide is so bad. I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and what's the difference between dealing with suicide and some other disease/sickness? If your family member were in a hospital constantly suffering, wouldn't you want to put them out of their misery?

Why do others assume you're okay just because you're physically fine? I think a lot of you know that emotional pain is just as bad as physical pain-- especially when its a constant emotional pain. I feel like there's a little man inside of my chest, whose constantly punching me in the heart. It hurts so much. I can't do it anymore. I just want to be put out of my misery.
