Driving whilst suicidalI'm learning to drive. Sometimes, whilst driving I become so suicidal that I feel like I'm going to lose it any second. I feel like crashing my car. I feel so spiteful and bitter after every bit of constructive, well meaning criticism my instructor gives me. I tend to speed up in dangerous situations and he has to slam the brakes. But I just can't feel sympathy for him. I just hate him and I want to tell him to fuck off and die. Would so willingly crash into a truck too, even with him in the car. I just feel so tired. I just want to curl up and cry somewhere. I just get no desire to live anymore.

I don't know how to deal with this. Perserve to learn or take a break? If persevere how do i keep calm when I'm feeling so bad. I literally have to scream in my head "Don't crash the car. Don't crash the car." I can't take it any longer.
