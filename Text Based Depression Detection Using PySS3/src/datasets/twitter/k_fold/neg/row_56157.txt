Don't know what to do for my s.o.I live with my girlfriend.  Our one year anniversary is in half a month.  She's going to be a lawyer.  Her bar results come back in a month.  She's been saying that she will kill herself if she doesn't pass.  

She has a history of cutting and has been hospitalized and institutionalized once for a suicide attempt.  

I just want to be able to help her.  Should I contact her counselor?  Her best friend?  Her sister?  I think she'd hate me if I did.  I don't want to hurt our relationship.  I love her, and don't want to lose her. 

She takes pills for depression and anxiety - both of which have been getting worse lately.  

She talks about how much she hates her life, how she has no passion for anything, and how she is destined to be unhappy.

This is poisoning our relationship, and is a toxin to my normal, cheerful attitude.  

To be clear, I'm not suicidal, but I think she is, and I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.  Help.
