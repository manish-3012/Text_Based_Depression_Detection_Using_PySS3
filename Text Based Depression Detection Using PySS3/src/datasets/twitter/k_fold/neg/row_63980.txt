Is my roommate suicidal? The other night after studying all day in his room, my roommate, a hilarious and charming guy, "jokingly" got up on a chair and tied a belt around his neck and the ceiling. I immediately got up and he told me to relax. We then exchanged sarcastic/silly reasons not to end his life (he has to do laundry tomorrow, he's too good looking to kill himself, I don't want to wake up to his dead body, etc) 

He put up this antics for about 20 minutes then proceeded to cry before going to sleep. After he got down, he said he just wanted to feel from another perspective, and reassured me he wasn't going to kill himself. I wasn't really worried that he was actually going to kill himself that moment, but I am worried about his mental state. Right now, he's back to his studying. 

What should I do? I know he lost his parents few months ago and he's being more jaded with his major/grades.
