My parents are discussing the recent death of an actor. They are criticising people for not knowing. Little do they know I have thought about it several time and self harmed for the past 2 years.Seriously, as I write this these people are shouting and arguing why he got depressed. Someone is saying career is the reason, someone is saying ego, someone is saying something else. They have continuously criticised him and people around him. 

I just want them to shut the fuck up about it. Like holy fuck you didnâ€™t know him. Stop acting like why you people know. 

Second, just leave him alone. Leave his friends alone. Sometimes it doesnâ€™t show. You donâ€™t realise someone is depressed. I mean your fucking son is depressed you guys donâ€™t know. Why do you assume his friends knew. 

Third, the media is only talking about it and speculating the reasons behind it. Like wtf is wrong with this world. Why do you want to glamorise and then debate about someoneâ€™s depression. He is dead. Leave him alone. Stop trying to mint money out of everything.

Fourth, some fucker who is my friend said if his friend was ever depressed he would know. Funny thing, I am, you donâ€™t fucking know. 

This world is rotten. It disgusts me. It appalls me.
