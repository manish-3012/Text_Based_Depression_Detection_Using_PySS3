I donâ€™t think I can take it much longerI just canâ€™t seem to find peace. It takes so much effort for me to keep living, and I just canâ€™t find any good reasons. Whenever I think of my family, Iâ€™m reminded of how much I put them through and how much better off they would be if i was gone.  Iâ€™ve been hospitalized for trying to kill myself, and I definitely donâ€™t want to go back. I think Iâ€™ll only try again when I have it in me to actually go through with it. Iâ€™ve become disgusted with who I am, how useless I am to everyone around me. Right now, I donâ€™t have any clear methods, but Iâ€™m starting to make a plan. I just donâ€™t want to be in a world where I feel like I donâ€™t belong, where all I am is a nuisance to those around me.
