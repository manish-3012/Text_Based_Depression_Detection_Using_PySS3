I don't know how to fix myselfFor a good while now I have been feeling more and more down for a few months. Mine is on and off and I don't think I can talk to my friends about it I don't think they understand. 

I feel like I am always the butt of the joke I don't think my friends care that much about me 

I keep getting the ideas of suicide and ways to do it but the only reason I'm not doing it because I know the harm it would cause my mom and dad. I just want this to stop
