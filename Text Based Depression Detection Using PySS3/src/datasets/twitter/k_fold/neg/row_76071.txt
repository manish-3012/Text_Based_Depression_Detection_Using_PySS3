Having a mental illness feels like running a race with two broken legs.Living your life with mental illness feels like youâ€™re in a race, but someone breaks both of your legs right at the start. Youâ€™re expected to keep up with everyone else and make it to the finish line, but every time your feet hit the ground itâ€™s excruciating agony. Itâ€™s the most painful at first. Over time your legs start to heal, but itâ€™s very very slow. Nobody else whoâ€™s running beside you understands your pain - their legs arenâ€™t broken. They may talk about being out of breath or wanting some water, but you feel all of those things and the pain of broken legs. You know that you can leave the race and sit down in the grass, and that your pain will disappear. But you also donâ€™t know whatâ€™s ahead of you. 

And thatâ€™s why you have to fight it. Your legs may hurt so, so much. You may never feel like the other runners understand you. But what you donâ€™t know is the race is cutting through gorgeous mountains. And a waterfall. And a field of flowers. You donâ€™t know what youâ€™re missing if you choose to sit out. And those things are worth it. And the longer you keep going, the more you heal, and the easier running will get. 

Letâ€™s all finish the race.
