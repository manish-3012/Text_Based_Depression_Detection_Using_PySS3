itâ€™s getting so hard to claw my way through the dayi guess all things considered, thereâ€™s nothing that horrible in my life. iâ€™ve gotten past the point of hating myself constantly to just thinking about how easy it would be to just end it, i wouldnâ€™t be around afterwards to worry about anything, how great is that. i donâ€™t think i the myself, i hate being alive, there are just too many pressures associated with it and not enough enjoyment.

nothing entertains me, iâ€™m always uninterested after 10 minutes with anything iâ€™m doing. i love my boyfriend but at the same time i struggle to maintain the ability to feel any real attachment to anyone. i watch every minute pass every day waiting until itâ€™s acceptable for me to sleep and trying to find something to distract me.

i know that it would take work to get out of this place, but iâ€™m so confused. if my mind is bad enough to get me here once, how am i ever going to trick it into forgetting the thoughts that got me here before? how am i going to convince myself to work all day at my job and then keep working all night to just stay alive every single day for who knows how long?

of course thereâ€™s more going on, but these are the thoughts iâ€™ve been struggling with in particular lately. i donâ€™t know.
