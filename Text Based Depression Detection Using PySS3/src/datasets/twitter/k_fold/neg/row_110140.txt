bf of two years packed up and left todayim in so much debt and unemployed, my family doesn't care about getting me help because they don't believe in depression, I have no way to get help on my own, I'm 24 years old and a waste of life, if I don't do it, I'm going to have to sleep on my parents couch and deal with my 13 yo sibling and their annoying ass friends, I cannot take that step back in my life to go work a shitty job at Walmart or something why is life like this why why why why why why why why why
