Therapy is trashWas 4 years in therapy and they aaaall gave up on me, because nothing seemed to work. I really tried to tell them everything in detail even tho Iâ€™m not good with words. The only thing I refused to do was medication because I didnâ€˜t want to fake what I feel. Iâ€™m rather being depressed than being high on happy pills 24/7, also Iâ€˜ve seen what that shit did to my dad. ðŸ‘¼ðŸ»

All my therapists didnâ€˜t know what to do no more and their only way in their eyes left was the mediaction which I refused to take so they just locked me up against my will. It was horrible, I felt trapped, isolated from everything, misunderstood as always and was treated like shit. Under all these people who I was told were the same as me I still was getting these looks like I was some sort of psycho. I was ignored and just getting dumb looked at just as always, even though I tried my best. Had therapy once a week with a headshrinker who would do nothing but twist the facts. Great right!! ðŸ¤ 

Luckily I was able to get out because I did some really whack things but it worked, even though they normally wouldnâ€˜t let me. â€œBecause Iâ€™m too dangerous for myself and others around meâ€œ yeah right whatever. That was the only thing I achieved through actually really trying lmao.

Sometimes I imagine how it would be if I was still jailed up in there and it fucking scares me

Was a year ago, donâ€˜t know why Iâ€˜m telling this only now but whatever. Donâ€˜t even know what to say exactly but I just wanted to tell something I never told anybody anywhere. Maybe Iâ€˜m getting hate for this but okay go for it 

Itâ€˜s all a waste of time. :-)
