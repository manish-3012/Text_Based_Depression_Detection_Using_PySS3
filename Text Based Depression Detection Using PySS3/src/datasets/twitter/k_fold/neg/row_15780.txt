Hospital Bills afterI just needed a place to vent as I'm just overwhelmed. Had my ex-fiance back in December get me hospitalized when she saw me staring at my handgun debating on suicide. I was hospitalized against my will, and thrown into a mental health institution. None of this did anything for my depression to make me feel any better, it only made things worse. I had to fake being better to get out of the institution to go to my college finals or risk having my college career screwed up as well.   
The institution alone charged me about 4000 dollars for my stay after insurance, and the hospital bills keep piling up. I've probably paid about 1500 so far, and I just got another bill for about 2000 dollars from the hospital. They won't just send me one bill and the staff is just incompetent when I ask it to be reviewed. Get depressed and suicidal? Better finish the job otherwise the almost 10000 dollars in bills after insurance will give you another reason to be suicidal.
