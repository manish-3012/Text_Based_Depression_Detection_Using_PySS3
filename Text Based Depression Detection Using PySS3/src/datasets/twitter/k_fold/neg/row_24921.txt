I can't take it anymore.I had a great life, but now my life is fucked up, my parents divorced, my grades even got more shit, I lost most of my friends, my dad treats me like a dog, I wanted to escape but I couldnt, I tried to suicide, I tried to jump off, didnt worked, tried to hang myself, and tried to shoot myself, but gun didnt went off, after my dad found out I was going to suicide, things got worse. But I just dont wanna live anymore, I would kill myself when I have the first opportunity.
