my noteI want to start by saying I don't think I'm on the edge.  I'm not ready to go yet, but I've been having a really hard time lately and writing out what my note would be centered me a bit.  Here's what I think I'll leave when my time does run out.

I love you guys so much.
I love everyone, maybe that's why this happened.  Over the past few weeks I've been talking to a lot of people who want to kill themselves, I think I even helped a couple.  
All I want is for everyone to be happy.  Maybe that goal is set up to fail, but I really feel it.  The problem is I can't even make me happy.  I can get a week here, a day there, but it always comes back to just being so fucking sad for no good reason.  I try to be good to people, improve their lives, and that makes me feel valuable.  
How long can you live for other people before your own self collapses?  It took me a lot of years to get to this point.  Years of wanting to kill myself every day.  Imagine that: Talking yourself out of it every fucking day.  Every time you wake up, every time you get in the car, every time you lay down for the night.  It's just too much, it's been like this for six years and I'm so fucking tired.
I'm so sorry you're going to have to go through this, losing a loved one is one of the worst pains there is.  I know I'm hurting you, and I feel terrible about it; but please know I just need to find peace.  
 The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. All my energy, every vibration, every Btu of heat, every particle of light that ever bounced off my face is still here with you.  Not one bit of me is gone, I'm just a bit less orderly.
I love you.

I love you so goddamn much.  Please move past your hurt and find peace
