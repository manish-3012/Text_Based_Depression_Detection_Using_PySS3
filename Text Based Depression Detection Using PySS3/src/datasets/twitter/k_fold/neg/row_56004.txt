I will never have any friendships or relationshipsI am extremely eccentric to other people, causing me some difficulties in forming friendships and relationships with other people. I am too awkward, and I don't have a lot to offer. I barely speak to people, and when I do, I fumble and stumble over my words. 

I am pretty much alone. I have one friend, but we don't talk all that much either. When I see her, we just sit in awkward silence. 

I want to kill myself because I don't see how I can form relationships with all of the issues above. I'm too much of an outcast, and I make people uncomfortable. I have already attempted suicide once before by overdosing. So I don't think I'll try that method again.
