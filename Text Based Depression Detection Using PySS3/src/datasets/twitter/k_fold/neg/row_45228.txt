I miss not wanting to die for a changeI mean I have been suicidal since I was 5-6 years old so obviously itâ€™s hard for me to remember any happy memories but I am scared that I can do it anytime now, thereâ€™s no one to stop me here and I have basically gone emotional-less now and I just think about drinking, smoking or cutting all day.
