There is no pointiâ€™m extremely depressed and have anxiety and and have for years, recently itâ€™s just been getting worse and worse and i donâ€™t know how much more i can take of this, i havenâ€™t been to school in weeks (failed all my classes this semester i have 0 credits) and iâ€™m close to having to go to court due to the amount of absences that i have, Nobody understands how painful it is for me even to wake up in the morning. Everything feels so much different and shittier now and i just canâ€™t keep living like this.
