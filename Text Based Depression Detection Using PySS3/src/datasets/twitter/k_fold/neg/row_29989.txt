CAN I VENT 2 SOMEONE

Gosh I feel like I have a huge cloud that reads â€œANXIETYâ€ above me everywhere I go. Itâ€™s confirmed Iâ€™m a hypochondria sufferer at 17, but Iâ€™ve been since I was a child though not as severe . Thereâ€™s like almost no time of the day that Iâ€™m not thinking about my health to prevent dying or being seriously ill/disabled. I went to the ER yesterday, Seen cardiologists and had bloodwork on different occasions and Iâ€™m sure they missed something. Iâ€™m at my sisters birthday party full of my siblings and nieces and I canâ€™t stop thinking about my heart/circulatory system/ cancer/ deadly infections. House full of pizza, wings, cake and family and I canâ€™t come out of my anxiety shell. I havenâ€™t said a word since Iâ€™ve been here for an hour because my personality before my life was consumed by anxiety is gone. Itâ€™s an ongoing cycle.  

Anxious thoughts ~ Depression from â€œbeing so ill at my ageâ€ ~ I eat for temporary happiness then Anxiety and depression again.
