Been having a hard time lately and thinking about killing myselfI am 18 year old male, I would say that I am good looking(even tho it srsly does not matter at all) , I love lifting weights and playing videogames. I never thought about suicide until recently. I just feel like lockdown made it much worse. I never went out with my friends, I rarely talk to anybody in the gym(not even able to go to gym now) and I try my best to stay away from people as much as possible. Probably the only thing that keeps me alive is game Witcher 3 since I just love that game and my little brother. I play it so much that I cannot fall asleep at night because I cant stop playing it and thinking about it. I think about suicide every single fcking day but I somehow manage  not to do it, I always imagine my family at my funeral and start crying since it would really make a harsh time for them. I usually think about being in imaginary world, having a beautiful girlfriend and living a charmed life. Perhaps I could kill myself to find out if there is something after this fcking cruel life and world. I also have some private issues which I unfortunately cannot fix and never will be, no one even knows about it except me. This could also be a post where you can share your story or thoughts, we are all in this together.
