I'm not sure what to do anymoreI apologize for any mistakes - I'm on mobile.
I'm 29. I thought id either outgrow this or at least be able to handle everything better. But everythjng has gotten only worse - more overwhelming. 
I'm really tÃ¯red. I don't want feel like I should be taking up space anymore. I stopped drinking and have been trying lexapro, Xanax, Ativan... I don't want to feel anything. But even with all of that it's almost as if every emotion is agonizing and I can't shut down.
On top of that I'm in an atmosphere I can't quite escape yet. It's very volatile and every waking moment in on the edge of a panic attack. I don't know what to do, I really don't, and I just want to end everything tonight. 
Things get better, I know they do and have done so in the past, but I just don't think it's worth it anymore.
