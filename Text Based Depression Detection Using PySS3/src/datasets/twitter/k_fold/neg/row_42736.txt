first time Iâ€™ve genuinely feared I might kick the bucketI usually use this sub as a source of venting, but never have I once actually thought I would commit suicide in the near future. I always imagined it would happen in my 20s, but as of lately Iâ€™m thinking it could happen in a few years. Everyday death is getting less and less scary to me. Death was my #1 fear for the longest time but now it doesnâ€™t scare me that much. Iâ€™m afraid as my emotions continue to grow and the more sleep deprived I am Iâ€™ll finally do it one day. And then Iâ€™ll be happy. Nobody is giving me the one thing that could save me, and that one thing is love. I give love but I never receive. Just to feel someone close to me and have them love me would be enough reason to live but it wonâ€™t happen. Not once in a million years.
