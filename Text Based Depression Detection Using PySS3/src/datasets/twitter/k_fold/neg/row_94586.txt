i wanna diei cant really give up a good enough explanation on why i'm writing this, basically I've been depressed for way too long. My friend died a year ago and i haven't been the same since. I've only told one person that i'm depressed and she didn't seem to care. i don't want to tell anyone else that i'm depressed/suicidal. almost every night i cry myself to sleep and every morning i wake up and hope that i get in a car accident or just die in general. i'm a teenager and i know that i have mixed emotions about allot of things but this is just too damn hard to take. the worst part is feeling so alone. all the time, 24/7 i'm so fucking alone. i feel like nobody cares about me. i've already partially written my note. This is such a pathetic cry for help. if i do it..i'm so sorry
