After 7000 hours of gaming, i realised:I'm turning 17 on September 11th.


Who am i? Why am i living? In my childhood everyone cared, now no one cares about me. I have friends, but now since they all have girlfriends and i dont, it's kinda hard.


The school has just recently started, and it help me fight the depression but not that much, because i'm that 'clown' in the class that i make everyone laugh, my math skills are bad (i suck at the math), no one wants to play video games with me anymore, nothing. One way to forget about pain is video games for me, so i play them, but the thing is the pain is still stuck inside of me. I wish someone could kill me when i'm asleep. Or i'm going to do it myself.


Just incase the one whos reading is going to start playing video games 24/7 -- don't. Don't be me. They're like drugs.


I need friends. I need a life. Help me.
