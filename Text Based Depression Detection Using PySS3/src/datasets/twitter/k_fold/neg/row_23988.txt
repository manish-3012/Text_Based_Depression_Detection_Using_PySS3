Need To Vent.I'm tired of investing time into people only for them to backstab me and use me. I'm tired of going on where my family thinks the worst of me. I'm tired. So damn tired. I'm not sorry, I'm not anything. 0. Zero. I'm giving up. My heart can't take it, my family can't take it. I don't want to take it anymore.
