Nothing left for me hereI feel stuck in time. I need help but I feel too afraid to ask. I don't want my friends and family to think I'm different, because I feel I am. I have been thinking about how to end it - using a belt or ibuprofen overdose.

I'm afraid to kill myself. I mean I guess everyone is...but I feel as though I can't do anything right and I don't belong here.

Can someone please tell me how to ask for help - I am afraid of what will happen to me and what others will think of me.

I'm 17.
