What do I do if someone told me they are going to commit suicide tonight?So, the brother of the person that I'm dating just told me that he is going to commit suicide tonight, and said he is pretty ready to do it. I just sent him a message saying to please not do it. He tried to overdose a few days ago, and absolutely refused to call 911 (should mention they live in another state and I dont know their address, so I couldn't call for him). He did eventually throw up the pills though. But what do I do? He doesnt want me to tell anyone, but I should tell the person I'm dating right? What else can I do to prevent him from doing it?..
