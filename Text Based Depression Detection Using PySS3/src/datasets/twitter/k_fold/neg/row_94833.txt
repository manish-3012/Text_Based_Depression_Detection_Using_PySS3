It's 2:40am and I want to die.I can't pinpoint exactly when it started, but my life has been spiraling downhill for the past four years and it's my fault. It started with me not really fessing up about my emotional problems in my freshman year of high school because I was afraid nobody would believe me. I only told my mom and she thought I was making shit up, which is exactly what I thought would happened. The only friend I really confided in kept offering to make me appointments with a doctor to get me help, but I kept declining because in the back of my mind, I thought that I really was just making shit up and doing it for attention. I'm halfway through my senior year now, and I'm about to finish this semester with an E, Ds, and Cs. Up until Junior year I was a straight-A student. I have like three actual friends and I've completely fucked my life up. I was supposed to go to college and become a doctor, but I'm fucked now. Completely fucked. My dad's going to rip me a new asshole when he sees my grades and I'm scared. I can't take any more abuse from him. I don't want to see my mother be disappointed in me. I'm scared and I'm lonely and I don't know what the fuck to do so I'm sitting in my room at quarter to 3 in the morning with a shitty dull knife that I can't even get to draw blood.
