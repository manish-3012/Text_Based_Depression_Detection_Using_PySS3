Friend wants a "suicide buddy"About a month ago friend 1 told me he was suicidal. He said he felt guilty for doing bad things. He wanted to meet up and talk. Due to covid I suggested we meet outdoors. After repeatedly cancelling with me, I asked him again and he said he would pass. He told me his wife was aware of what was going on and he's been seeing a therapist. Since then I have been sending him texts every now and then about a videogame or some show we both know to stay touch. He randomly asked me yesterday if I had been in touch with friend 2. I told him I had, and said that although friend 2 is out of work and sleeps all day, he seems to be in higher spirits these days. Friend 1 says he thinks Friend 2 is depressed. I say I don't know all the details, just that he seems in a better place. Then friend 1 says "I need a suicide buddy". I am so exhausted. If it was a joke, it's not very funny. If he's serious, that is extremely fucked up that you want to drag someone else into suicide with you. I asked him what he meant and said it was really fucked up and asked how would it benefit anyone to have someone to commit suicide with. Now he just doesn't respond. Now I'm feeling guilty because of what I said. But I'm also so tired of the way I'm being treated. Friend 1 has been a pretty fair weather friend, completely dismissing me in times of mental health crisis, and when it's reversed I'm trying to be supportive and I'm losing my patience. I feel like it's really shitty to ghost someone when they are talking about commiting suicide. Like now that he's not responding, this weight lies on me for trying to help. Does anyone have advice?
