Thinking about dyingI think a lot of the people in my life would be better off if I was dead. I know it would hurt them in the short term but I already do that while I'm alive. In the long term they won't have to deal with me. How I annoy them, and upset them, and generally do things wrong. I'm always wrong. Except right now, I think I'm right about this. About thinking I should be dead. Thanks for listening guys.
