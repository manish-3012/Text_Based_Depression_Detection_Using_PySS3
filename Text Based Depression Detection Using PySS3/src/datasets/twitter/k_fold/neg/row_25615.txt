Hmm...Well... Here I am. Unfortunately. I can't say out right that I want to kill myself. Because I don't. I don't want to die. There is so much in this world to see and experience, yet I don't know think its worth getting there. My grades are steadily declining, I told care much about school, but my parents want to go to college, get a job, live a normal life, but that's not what I want. I feel like I don't have any choices in my life, where do I get to decide whether or not I get to do things. However after seeing my parents so dissapointed in me, I feel like shit. I look forward to every weekend, but then end up feeling awful because I can't live up to anyone's expectations. I just don't see what the point in living in this convoluted scheme that someone already laid out for you. I don't see the point in life. I think that suicide won't be that bad.
