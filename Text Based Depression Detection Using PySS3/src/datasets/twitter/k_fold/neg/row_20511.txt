I'm tired of not getting better....I'm so sorry for venting here, you guys. I just really don't have anyone to talk to. I'm so lonely and so so tired. 

My anxiety is going through the roof you guys. I think I've finally had it. I can't sleep, I can't eat, I can't get out of bed, I can't even be bothered to shower or show up to anything anymore. My social life and work is going drown the drain.

I've grown up with crippling anxiety. It has pervaded every aspect of my life. My insecurities make it difficult for me to be vulnerable to people. I just don't trust them. Through reflection, I see how I've positively reinforced this overthinking and over worrying. It always made me over compensate and work extra extra extra hard to please people at work, home, or my peers. But obviously, my insecurities were still there. Regardless of the affirmation that I was receiving from others, it still didn't seem enough and never made me feel better about myself. I still hated myself and I still felt that people would see through me and hate me too. 

I've seen a therapist for 2 years now, almost 3, and we've worked through where all of my anxiety may stem from - a narcissistic mother, a terrible childhood, and a history of rape and sexual abuse. Although talking about it made it clearer to me that all of these insecurities and perceived deficits are all in my head, I can't change how I feel.

I'm so tired. I'm so so sooo so tired. I'm tired of always second guessing and doubting every relationship that I've formed. I can't seem to believe that anyone would really like me or accept me because they don't know who I really am - they don't know how sad I am, they don't know about my sexual abuse, they don't know how much I hate myself.

And I'm just so tired. I just want to die and disappear. Just to finally know who really cares. Just to know how people really feel about me. It's just not getting any better.
