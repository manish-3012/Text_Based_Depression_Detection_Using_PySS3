A time machine won't helpI would say that I'd like to go back in time but that's just not true. There was no time in my life that I can ever recall being happy. I've always been everyone's punching bag. Everyone's joke. The ugly one. The weird one. Not girly enough to hang with the girls. Not attractive enough to get attention from boys. Two manipulative parents who crushed me to my lowest point. Alienating me and destroying my self-esteem. A disgusting and abusive father. A narcissistic, image-obsessed mother. Perfect recipe for a lonely life full of fear and hatred. Fear of rejection. Fear of intimacy. Fear of failure. Hatred for my parents. Hatred for people in general. Hatred for myself. I'm so dead inside, I could be mistaken for a corpse if I sat still long enough. Soon enough, I'll tell my parents all this and sever my jugular right after. Not that they'd care. They'd hurt me physically before they allowed themselves to feel remorse. If I had a time machine, I'd break off a sharp piece and kill myself. I'd have no use for the rest of it.
