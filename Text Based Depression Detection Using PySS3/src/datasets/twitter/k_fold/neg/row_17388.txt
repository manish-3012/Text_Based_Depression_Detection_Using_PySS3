I've already made a post about this but it's gotten worse since then. I'm a terrible freak.I've been having the sexual intrusive thoughts over and over again. And suffering from anxiety and/or OCD often follow. It could be about anyone. There are a lot of pictures of family in my house so it often comes about them. Now, **PLEASE** let me explain that. I don't like or want these thoughts, and I would be a thousand times happier if I didn't have them. But it's always like: "I hope I don't get some unwanted thought about this person," and then one comes. I really don't want to describe the thoughts because they're too horrible for me to even think about.

I could work through these thoughts, that's not what is upsetting me. What upsets me is I've started to wonder if I've actually been bringing these thoughts up deliberately. I hope I haven't, but I can't tell. Like yesterday I was doing something that wasn't sexual, but an image of a parent was in my head, simply because these intrusive thoughts have become such a nuisance that I'm unfortunately always conscious of some new thought occuring. My mind made a connection action I was performing to something slightly dirty, and then another thought came, involving that parent. I hated it, and it freaked me out badly because it felt like I deliberately thought it.

If this doesn't make much sense I'm sorry, but again, I **_really_** don't want to go into detail about this.

Later, I was watching a video on YouTube, and in it a guy makes a joke about his groin, and ai don't know how it got there but that ended turning into some stupid intrusive thought about a person I've never seen in my life. The only logical explanation I can think of is I did it deliberately thought it, which makes me sick.


So now you understand where I'm coming from a little better. If these really were deliberate then what does that say about me? I don't want to be alive to find that out.
