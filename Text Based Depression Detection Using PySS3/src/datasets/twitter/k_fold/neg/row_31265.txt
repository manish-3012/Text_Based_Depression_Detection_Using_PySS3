Just Bottoming Out Once AgainI just don't know what to say or do. Things had really been going pretty good recently for me -- I was working on my severe OCD via behavioural treatment, and I was making some headway with severe social anxiety. I was feeling good enough to start looking for work.

But two days ago I just got so lonely and disappointed with things, I drank too much , once again. I had a liter and a half of wine, and with my medications, once again I flew into a rage. I spent half the night raging at my elderly parents, who let me live with them, and I smashed up the house. Again. I want to get help, and I want to go to the rehab  outpatient program my psychiatrist recommended to me -- but I just don't feel like I deserve to feel better. I really want to die, and I'm just so sorry.
