I have lost the hopeHey guys, first time posting here, so if I'm violating some rule I'm sorry. 

I can't bear it anymore.

I had a hell of a week. On Wednesday, I tried something bad with myself...

I'm at a very complicated situation, I study far away from home, but I receive a scholarship to do so. So, I can't just quit, I need some doctor's letter to attest that I don't have health conditions to continue studying. Covid has fucked my mind, I have just shattered in the past 3-4 months, so, I don't know if I wanna return there, I don't know if I can bear being alone down there. 

And, to complicate more the things, on Friday my ex-gf broke up with me, when I most needed her support (I know I wasn't being so great to her, and she can do it). 

I just don't know if I can continue my life having a lot of pain to bear. I intend to go to a psychiatrist this week, but, if the meds don't solve it, what hope have I? :(
