Iâ€™ll kill myself if Iâ€™m HIV positive.I recently had an encounter with a male. 
I I received anal intercourse and as far as I know it was protected but I didnâ€™t check at the end wether his condom was â€œbrockenâ€ or not. 
Through some stalking I found out he is an ice addict and an escort, he also robbed my wallet that night without me noticing. 
So not much confidence left in the fact that the condom might have been damaged. I reached out to him and harassed him wether he is positive or not and he said he is negative multiple times. Tho I canâ€™t trust him. 
I had a Alere 1/2 4th generation test done on day 19 post exposure and it came back negative. 
I have another test due week 6 and thatâ€™s gonna be conclusive. Iâ€™ve been having dry sore throat since week 2.5 and just started having mild headaches and sinus â€œpressureâ€ end of week 4. 
If my test comes back positive, Iâ€™m going to kill myself right after I get all my affairs in order to make it easier for my family and friends. 

Also I got a girlfriend who i love very much and Iâ€™m avoiding sex with her and donâ€™t let her give me any blowjobs. And if we have sex I do it with a condom without it, I wonâ€™t let my penis go near her vagina. She has been asking questions and the thought of the fact that I cheated on her with another man is killing me. I wish I could go back. 4 years, and 1 misstep is gonna ruin my life. (Remorse)
