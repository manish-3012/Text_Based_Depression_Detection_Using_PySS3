Family problem that can't be solved make me want to end this allI don't know if there are any Asian here.But we all know parents are often demanding , aggressive and I can't take this anymore.The recent series of Hong Kong protest make my father paranoia. Whenever my sister go out and if there happen to be a protest. My father will think she joined the protest.Even my father had no evidence what so ever.And I never like my sister because she is always a bit of cunt . I got bully by her and she always know how to use the advantage of her being a girl to stop me from fighting back. But I kind of still need her right now as the subsidy program of my university tuition fees require her signature . And my father is unreasonable . I need to watch him closely in order to avoid he attack my sister simply my sister disagree with him .And I can't take this shit anymore . These clowns will kill each other eventually but I need to  propone it till I am able to move out . And this shit is getting intense and I can't take the heat no more. I really want to end this all.
