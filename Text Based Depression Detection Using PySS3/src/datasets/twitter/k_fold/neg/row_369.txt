Wrote my final note tonightThought I donâ€™t plan on needing to use it for another few years unless I face a crisis and really need to get out of here. To sum it up:

â€œI failed as a sibling, child, and person. I am so sorry. Since I was little I knew I was stupid and a mistake. I never learned how to talk to others. Always so anxious and felt like I was gonna throw up. The few times I did open up to people it ended badly. Iâ€™ve constantly been the family embarrassment. It never even had to be said sometimes. When there was an event my older and younger siblings would go but Iâ€™d be left home. If mysterious be â€œsickâ€ if people asked where I was. People also mentioned how weird I was and thought I was autistic at one point. Iâ€™m so sorry I failed. The other two are doing well and are good representations for the family. Please forget my existence happened. If I have any pets alive please give them to a good shelter if you donâ€™t want them. Iâ€™m so sorry.â€
