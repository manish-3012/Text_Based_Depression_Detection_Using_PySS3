Why should I hang on any longer? All I feel is pain.So I will keep this as short as possible. I am a 29 year old man. Lately my emotional pain has become too intense to deal with. My whole life I have been very emotional. I would get my feelings hurt very easily, and when others were in pain physical or emotional I would feel for them.

 The past few months have been the hardest time of my life. I am nowhere close to where I want to be at in life, personally or professionally.  I am also dealing with family issues, that are really hard on me. I wish that I could turn down the emotional part of my brain, so that I can function on a normal level. I look at others and they seem to make strategic vs. emotional decisions. I realize that I do suffer from depression, and anxiety, and that is why I in so much pain. I am ready for the pain to end. Life is not for me anymore. I have had many good times on earth, but it is time for my existence to cease. 
 
I wrote my suicide not last night, and it was one of the first times in a while I was able to just focus on the task at hand, and my thoughts were so clear. I scribble down my thoughts so quickly and precisely. 

I am writing this on here as a way of venting out my thoughts, because I have literally no one that will listen to my thoughts. I have isolated myself from everyone, to the point that I have literally no friends anymore. I have a hard time keeping friends, because I am extremely closed off, and do not trust people enough, outside of my immediate family to share intimate parts of my life. I end up sabotaging relationships, both friendships, and romantic by ignoring people to the point that they give up on me.  The thing that hurts is that I feel that I have so much to offer other people, and I genuinely like people, and I am a charitable person. 

Besides writing the suicide note I have not made any plans as of yet.
