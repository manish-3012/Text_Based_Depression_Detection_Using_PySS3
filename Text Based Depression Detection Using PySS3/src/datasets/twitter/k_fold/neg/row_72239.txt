Not hurting myself is a struggle right now.This day was horrible and I don't know why. My depression is unmanageable right now.

I just want to fucking hang myself or something.

I hate my dead end job. I have no friends. All I do is play WoW all day right now when I'm not working because I'm addicted to gaming. Fucking end me.
