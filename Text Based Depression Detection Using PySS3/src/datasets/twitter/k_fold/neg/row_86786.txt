I am tired of with this thing we call LifeI have heard many people say "it gets better". Yeah, sure, it does get better in some regards. But I get so tired of dealing with things. I just want a break. I want to feel happy again, like I belong, but I have dealt with this lost, sad feeling for so many years, I am tired of it.

I hate being around people and pretending I am ok when I am not ok. I see a therapist and that doesn't help. I've tried medication and it only makes me feel crazy.

My highs and lows are destroying me. When my moods are great, the world is great, but when my mood is down, it's really down. And I hate crashing, I hate falling back into this black pit. I am TIRED of arriving back into this darkness. I am TIRED of calling it home. I am TIRED of fighting, trying to make people around me proud so that they will accept me. I am tired of pretending and I am angry. I am sad. I am upset. And I feel so alone all the time. 

I can't see how this actually gets BETTER because I can't deal with it. I can't deal waking up feeling so anxious and afraid, feeling like my entire life is collapsing around me. I can't deal with this dark mood that settles on me. I hate it. I hate it all so much and the worst thing is, it's all I've really known. It's a constant battle of fear and sadness. Of one day feeling happy and the next feeling beaten down and defeated. I am tired and I just don't want to fight anymore...
