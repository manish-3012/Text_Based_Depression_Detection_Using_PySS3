I wish I was more suicidalI just wish life would just fuck off. I really don't want anything anymore. I have no goals or aspirations and I don't enjoy anything life has to offer. I don't understand why can't the suffering stop if I have no interest in playing the game. Why do I have to fucking do something as radical as killing myself in order for it to stop?
