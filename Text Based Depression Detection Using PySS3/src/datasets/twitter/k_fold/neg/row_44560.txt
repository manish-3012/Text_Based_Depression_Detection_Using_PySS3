fuck the teenage dreamiâ€™ve lost so many friends just because they want the â€œteenage experienceâ€. am i the only one to realise that it doesnâ€™t exist? everyone is into drinking, doing drugs and i just donâ€™t want it. i just want my old friends back.

iâ€™ve had a bad childhood with alcohol and drugs. my distant family used to be/are heavy drug users and i just canâ€™t think of my friends like that.

i just want everything to be like how it was back then. i donâ€™t want this.

just fuck everything. fuck the teenage dream. i just want everything to go to hell.
