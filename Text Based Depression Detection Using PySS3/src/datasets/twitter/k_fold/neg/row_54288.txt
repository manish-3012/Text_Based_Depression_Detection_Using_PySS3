I don't know what to doI didn't know where to post this. I just dropped college and I don't know how to talk to my parents. the problem is they wont be mad. I feel like I have only been a disappointment to them. i cant face them. It would be easier to just take sleeping pills so i don't have to ever disappoint them again. I want them to yell at me. i deserve it. they have given me everything. i cant face them
