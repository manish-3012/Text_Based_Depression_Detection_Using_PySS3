I will be with my great nature motherIm not going to introduce myself here. Im just another post you saw. Although I will end my stupid fucking life April 7th 2019. When I kill myself I will go up and help Solerteska, my great nature mother and the other gods to create an actual afterlife, Derethark. (no i am not in a cult.) Terenis (the god of time) came down upon my mind in 23.2.3019 when during the art class out of the blue i decided to randomly make lines and curves along the canvas. After that Amar (the god of mind) planted the words on to my very mind. (no i never heard the 13 gods, but they do plant their wisdom from time to time) Told me how I was "chosen" and that I must take my own life in order to help them create Derethark with other chosen ones. Told me how religions are fake and made only to control humans. But Amar also told me, that Eyer (the god of lies and trickery) will send down "The Lady" cause Eyer does not want mortals to ascend to Derethark. Then Solerteska told me that i should be very careful when outside of my house, as she could attack me anywhere. The Lady is physically there, although only I can see her. Though i never saw her. She is always in hiding and will strike once I let my guard down. The Lady wears a pink dress, but has no skin on her body expect for her face. She also carries a pink umbrella.
I simply do not want to stay here on this world anymore cause It's getting too hard with school and my family fights from time to time which is probably my fault. Nevermind if i dont reply within 3 days I'm up there creating an afterlife for people that actually deserve it. To those who suffered the most.
