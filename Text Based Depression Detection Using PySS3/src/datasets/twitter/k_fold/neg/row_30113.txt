idk anymoreiâ€™ve always had the thought of killing myself, but have never acted on it or entertained the idea seriously enough to go through with it. 

in the past few weeks i have actively been searching for different ways to go through with it, in the least painful way possible. a full proof plan, in a way. ( i donâ€™t have access to guns) 

i am usually an actively positive person, who tries to reaffirm myself through writing and centering myself. i do try to eat healthy and exercise sometimes to get rid of these thoughts. i try to focus on my tasks at end, which have been extremely difficult lately &amp; has began to make me feel inadequate or resurfaced issues i felt i already worked through. i think the point iâ€™m trying to make is, i have tried to work to be in a mental state. i have healed in some ways, but it seems in some others itâ€™s just not going to happen for me.

i do have plans for the future, but these past few days it feels like these past twenty one years of my life have been enough, the memories and the love of everyone around me. its been enough.


i donâ€™t know exactly why iâ€™m posting here, thatâ€™s also another thing, i definitely would never let anyone know my intrusive thoughts. i tend to have my shit together usually, i feel like i do. or did. 

not anymore. i for sure donâ€™t want to be a burden on my family/friends whom i love very much. i know theyâ€™d try to talk me out of it. and i donâ€™t know if i want that. 


i just needed this to be heard somewhere, even if itâ€™s in this tiny corner of the internet.
