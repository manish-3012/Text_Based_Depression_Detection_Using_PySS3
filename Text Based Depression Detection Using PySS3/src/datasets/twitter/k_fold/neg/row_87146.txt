Yay! Not really, but something good happened.. or is it good...So i was suicidal for 2 months after my parents trusted my overly sensitive grandma when she said i yelled at her, and i felt like the only reason they wanted to punish me was bc they hated me. I got social anxiety and i always think everyone hates me so yeah thats fun. Anyway, one day i woke up and, rather than deciding to not commit suicide, i just couldn't imagine wanting to kill myself. I was kind of happy, but not really. I felt kinda empty. Like nothing that happened affected me. It has been half a year and my emotions are still fucked up. I cant feel enough emotion and now im pretty much asexual bc i cant love anyone. I just cant feel normal strength emotions anynore. My brain was like "pfft who gives a shit about emotions, they make u wanna kill urself" then it yeetes everything that make me, me. Idk whats happening, more of a rant than a call for help, but thanks for reading through this
