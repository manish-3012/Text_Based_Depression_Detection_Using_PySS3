I've decided. I'm an asshole but I need to escape.You see, I have a child.  I love her deeply, but I can't be a good mother to her.  I'm not abusive per se, but I'm neglectful.  I can't take care of myself, so I shouldn't be trusted with a child.  If the people around me weren't so neglectful, something would be done, but it won't go on much longer.  I'm barely even present, just zoned out staring at a screen, trying to block out my pain.  Mental and physical pain, as I have a painful bladder condition which I haven't been managing at all.  I suppose it's a form of self-harm.

We've been living with my abusive parents/family for over 2 months now, because I made stupid decisions out of fear, avoidance, depression and basically magical thinking.  I fear that I have serious mental health problems, beyond the depression and anxiety that I've been diagnosed with.  Probably personality disorders or possibly higher functioning autism.  I can't make connections with people at all, I just don't feel that I'm even the same species as most people.  I can't trust.  I feel strange and inadequate.  I'm desperately lonely, and even people (who I feel are) like me, aren't interested in a relationship with me, though I don't blame them.  I'm hardly a catch at the best of times.

Apparently this is in the spectrum of normal, as I've been trying to access mental health services (for this latest episode) for more than a year.  I've been to see several 'gatekeepers' - GP's, community mental health etc.  Tried antidepressants but they don't work anymore (they are how I got through my 20's).  I've been on a waiting list for therapy for almost a year, was sent a letter to say there would be a spot in july, and just today was sent another letter stating possibly november.  I only received this letter because I was distraught at getting no help and spoke to someone, the call ended with me saying that I wasn't going to bother engaging with them anymore, because it only makes me feel worse.  So now I'm off the waiting list entirely.  Every time I speak to someone, they say I have to deal with my problems myself.  They say 'what do you want me/us to do?'  which doesn't help at all, because I have no idea what could be done to help.  And yet, I know that people do get help... so I just don't know.  They are just using doublespeak to say 'go away, we won't help you, stop wasting our time.'  One time I said that exercise/ going to the gym would probably help me but I'm too anxious to do it, and I was told that if I did it, I'd get help.  I feel that they are either useless and negligent or they might have diagnosed me with something and just not have told me.  I have asked them (which was very difficult) but they wouldn't say.  I have thought of requesting my medical notes, but frankly that would take too much effort now, and it hardly matters given the circumstances.  It does piss me off that they will probably diagnose me with BPD after I'm gone.

I've always struggled with mental health problems, since I was a child who cried every day in nursery and infant school.  I was bullied and ostracised for years at school, and by my parents/family as the scapegoat.  I think I might have C-PTSD from that, it was horrific.

However, since my one friendship ended months ago I've spiraled down to the rock bottom I'm now experiencing.  I'm living at my parents house (which is very gross because they're the UK equivalent of trailer trash), sleeping on a sofa bed I bought, not leaving the house at all.  I haven't spoken to any of my family for weeks after I was threatened with a knife by a family member and then scapegoated (this is a normal occurrence).  I'm not sleeping, except from 4am- 7am, and sometimes around 10am-3pm as well.  My daughter is 10 and is going to and from school alone, which is a 1.5 mile walk.  I don't feel that this is acceptable but I can't do anything about it. I do speak on the phone during the commute.  She already sees the early help social services team occasionally through school, but she's angry about having to do so, she told me she just tells them that everything is fine (I haven't told her to say this).

&amp;#x200B;

I have the money to rent a house but my anxiety is so bad that I can't even bring myself to go to viewings, and before I was quite this bad, when I did view houses my application wasn't accepted.  Probably because I'm acting weird out of depression/anxiety.  So I'm doomed, because I will never get any better while living in this situation.  Even if I did manage to get out, I would be living completely shut off (again). Struggling through the most basic 'normal' things because I know nobody, have no support system, and am absolutely unable to acquire or keep any of those things.  I am uncomfortable with any kind of intimacy, and hate even having people in my house, even my daughters friends.

&amp;#x200B;

I have sabotaged everything which could have been good in my life- relationships, jobs, I'm now signed up to complete education, beginning in the next couple of weeks, which is a fantastic opportunity and even affords me financial stability for the next 3 years, but there's no way I can handle the social demands.  I can't even handle the quitting of it, but the upside of this decision is, that I won't have to.  I know its cowardly, but that knowledge is a huge relief.  I don't think I could handle the ground zero of any more failure.

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, and most importantly, I am absolutely contemptible for doing this to my daughter.  I'm not so selfish that I don't know what this will do to her.  Its unforgivable.  Her father (we are 5 years separated and he lives abroad) is not a great parent either- selfish/not very responsible, but he is probably more stable and he's fun... I think she'll have a better life in the long run, and that's the most important thing.

&amp;#x200B;

Aside from feeling like a POS, I feel relieved.  I just need to wait a little to gather some resources, so I have enough time to set my affairs in order and leave things as nice as I can.  Not sure why I felt compelled to write this at all, but it's helped me to get it all out... just need to get through this last bit of pain and I'm free.
