I can't take it anymore...This world is so cold, and I feel so alone... I've tried everything, but I can't seem to find peace... I can't save anyone, not even myself, and it's been such a long, hellish road through time up to this point. I'm so tired, hopeless, and there just doesn't seem to be a future for me. I can't rid myself of all this pain...
