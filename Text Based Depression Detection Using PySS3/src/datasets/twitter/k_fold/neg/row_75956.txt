What happens after you report someone to 911 if they say theyâ€™re going to commit suicide?I had to call 911 for the first time yesterday for a friend who was seriously about to take their life. Luckily the police were able to find them. They texted me saying they were in handcuffs.. Anyone know what happens to a person after theyâ€™re reported for a suicide attempt or has any advice for how to follow up on them? I want to text them and make sure theyâ€™re okay. Iâ€™d see them in person if I could but Iâ€™ve never met them in person.

Thank you for your time and I hope all of you are doing wellâ™¥ï¸
