Iâ€™m having a hard time feeling anythingThese recent times have not been kind to me. I am in a very dark place mentally especially following my last failed attempt. Doing it again has brushed my mind but never really lingered. Itâ€™s really hard for me to wake up and get out of bed everyday because I feel like thereâ€™s no point. Doing the same routine over and over again. I know you guys will tell me to try and do something new but I just donâ€™t have the will and the energy nor the motivation to do it. Currently my mom forced me to stay at my S.Oâ€™s family since I live alone in the city. I half-heartedly agreed since I kinda want to help my self somehow. My relationship between my S.O is currently fine and sheâ€™s been supportive. There are times when itâ€™s hard but thatâ€™s normal. 
The thing is, I realized that I might be more comfortable alone? Not really sure. I feel like Iâ€™m just a burden around here. When I heard the news that I might be sent back to the city, I felt a little happy. 
But tonight Iâ€™m back to my â€œnormalâ€ state. Iâ€™m having a hard time feeling any authentic emotions. Iâ€™m not looking forward to waking up tomorrow anymore.
