Money is worth less and lessAs a kid I would dream about $100 being rich.

As an early teen I thought $1,000 was insane

Into the late teen years I dreamt of having 10.000 in order to pay part of my college. 

In my mid 20â€™s after college I wanted to buy a house and afford what my parents had. I realized that 20,000 doesnâ€™t mean anything anymore. 

By 30 I would love to move out and afford 20% of a down payment (in a 200,000 market place) to avoid Mortgage insurance but that canâ€™t happen on todayâ€™s payment unless you have 40,000 to put down or else pay the mortgage insurance. 

The bottom line is that unless you get lucky you canâ€™t even get close to what your parents had. And itâ€™s only getting harder with each year.
