I'm so tiredTired of being told how much killing myself is going to hurt everyone else...by my own counsellor. I feel selfish enough being suicidal again, i really don't need a medical professional telling me how much i'm upsetting the ones i love. i've tried so hard to ensure my safety for the benefit of others, it just is never enough for my counsellor. i can't win when it comes to her, so i might as well just give up.
