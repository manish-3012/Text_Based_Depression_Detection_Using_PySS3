i tried to kill myself but i was too much of a cowardit's hard to try to type this but ever since i was 7 or 8 i've been struggling with school, anxiety, depression, and shitty toxic parents. last night i tried to stab myself in the chest because i can't stand being alive anymore and i just want to go to sleep forever but i cant even do that because i'm just weak and pathetic and every day feels like hell and i just want the pain to stop
