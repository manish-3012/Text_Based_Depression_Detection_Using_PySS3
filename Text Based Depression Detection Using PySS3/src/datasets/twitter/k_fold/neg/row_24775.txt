A close friend living in Athens, Greece is talking suicidal. I'm international and I need help to help him.I'm not sure if this is right place for it but I'm terrified and desperate. I live in Australia and I'm struggling to find a way to help a suicidal friend in Athens, Greece. I only know he lives in Athens, his first and surname as well as a direct family members name. Using this information is there anything I can do to get him the help he needs?
