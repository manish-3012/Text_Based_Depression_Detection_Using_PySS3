Any 'hotline' help that is not related to phones?I don't know how silly of a question this is, but I really can't make calls. I have severe social phobia and I can't use the phone even on a good day. I'm not doing well. Iâ€™m runing out of coping mechanisms fast. I don't feel like there's anyone who can help me.

I can't afford a therapist right now. And the ones I've seen in the past haven't been able to help me. 

Nobody else is close. My family are a bunch of anxious people and I love them but they simply make matters worse. They panic and then I have to comfort them by pretending Iâ€™m better so they calm down.

I can't make calls... I've gone to the metanoia site so many times it has no effect anymore. Yes, I've waited. This time I've been on a permanent crisis-like state for hours and hours since at least last night and right now everyone in my family left for work and I am afraid.

**Edit:** Thank you everyone. I didn't expect people to be so caring and helpful. At the moment I'm not in imminent danger. I will keep in mind the links and places you posted.
