I am 19 and it feels like iâ€™ve lived such a long lifeâ€œLife just flies byâ€ â€œbetter enjoy it while it lastsâ€ etc are statements born from peopleâ€™s inability to comprehend what itâ€™s like to hate life. 

I really do mean hate, I cannot say any of this has been close to worthwhile and IT IS SO LONG. This level of fatigue and burnout are only things I can imagine an old man of 100+ years can have. I cannot fucking do this for another year let alone 60 more or so.

Theyâ€™ll say that parts of your life will just be a distant memory and thus feel like they just flew by, but no Iâ€™ll remember them due to the constant panic and pain I feel every moment that my brain is not absolutely throttled by fog and confusion. Lucidity is my enemy and I may as well not even be a person for the times I am not experiencing it.

I need this to be over so bad I canâ€™t do it anymore. I couldnâ€™t do it 10 years ago and the time in between has only gotten worse I just canâ€™t
