Feeling trapedHi reddit. I feel stupid posting this because i always end up complaining about the same bullshit. I also know there must be hundreds of people in my situaton.

I feel completely trappd. Im 25 im trans, i work at a dead end job i cant transition in, i have no education, no savings to start, constant anxiety that prevents me from even taking care of myself and a persisten and unending feeling of complete lonliness.

I cant even find reasons to guilt myself into not taking a bottle of asprin and laying down in my bathtub. It used to be a cycle but i think about how i want to die every night and i cant see any way out of this constant torture. 

People say nice things butto me it just doesnt matter anymore. How can i compete with cisgendered girls for anything. Work, relationships, school how can i possibly compete when i have nothing of value to add to anything... 

I have all sorts of contacts and info for crisis lines and safe homes but i dont know how that is supposed to help. I dont want to be in a strange place i dont want to hear my voice on a phone appealing to strangers. 

I dont know how to voice the desperation i feel in day to day life.
