Last word.The only reason why I am posting here is so I can leave some record as to why I took my own life. 

It's been made abundantly clear to me that my depression is an inconvenience to those around me, and (with two notable exceptions) everyone around me is only interested in what I can do for them. I have tried multiple times to get the help and support I feel I need, but it's either too expensive, or has been otherwise made unavailable to me (rent, food, or therapy: pick two). Any free resources require me to take time away from my work, which I can't do without either losing wages or my job.

I have tried reaching out to friends and family. At best they say "man up and deal with it". I've tried looking online for help and have been ignored. (I'm expecting this post to be downvoted to oblivion as well.)

So, I give up. It has been made apparent by an overwhelming majority that I am only liked insofar as I can make others happy. Failing that, I am useless. 

I know that suicide is an incredibly selfish option, but it's about time I did something for myself for a change. 

Thank you for your time.
