I resuscitated my OH after a heroin overdose he did to kill himself and he just said he wish he hadnâ€™t woken up.No suicide note written, I would have never known that was what he wanted to do. I had no idea until just now when he said he was pissed off that he woke up from it. I had no idea. Did I do the wrong thing? I am devastated. Absolutely devastated. How do I cope with this guilt?
