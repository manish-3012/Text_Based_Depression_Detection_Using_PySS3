lost my only friendJust lost the only friend i thought cared about me. They were so kind and caring i thought the friendship was amazing. However turns out they just wanted to be in a relationship and clearly iâ€™m not in the right mental state for that so iâ€™ve lost my only â€œfriendâ€. Iâ€™m so unbelievably sad i donâ€™t know what to do anymore. It seems as if nobody truly cares about how i feel anymore. I know itâ€™s selfish to want someone to care about you but itâ€™s just who I am. I told them iâ€™d try to better myself and stop hurting myself and then we could talk again but i donâ€™t know what to do. In just want to pass away, at least now I know nobody would care :( 
Also i know relationships are good i just really need friends right now iâ€™m not in the right headspace to be in a relationship itâ€™s too much my last partner really messed things up
