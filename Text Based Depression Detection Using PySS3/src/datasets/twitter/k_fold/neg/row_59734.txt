I can't find another way outSomething in me has broken in the past weeks. I look at the person I was a few years ago struggling sure but fighting 
I don't have any fight left. I'm done

 In the last week I have been laid off no fault of my own business was taken over, so even though I have good performance, it's over.
Next day found out I can't have kids (medical reasons)
Told my SO this we were together a year.. after I tell him this he ghosts me for a few days. Then calls and tell me he wants kids ..so unsure we can move forward. 
What do I do. 
Found out also my boss who bought me to this company KNEW THE WHOLE TIME that the restructuring was going to happen. And didn't tell me because she wanted to use me 
How can people be like this. 

I want to end it all. I've always been depressed and off and on in counseling since my twenties. But God help me I don't have the strength anymore to even try.
