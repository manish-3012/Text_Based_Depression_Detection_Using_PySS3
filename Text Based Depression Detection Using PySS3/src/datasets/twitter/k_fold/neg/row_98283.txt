Iâ€™m ready to dieI made a post the other day and I feel completely alone. The person who I have called my soulmate doesnâ€™t want me in his life anymore. I didnâ€™t want to believe it but now I have to come to accept it. I feel like I have nothing left to live for and Iâ€™m better off dead. Iâ€™m leaving for a hotel far away from my house soon and this is my opportunity to end it all. I donâ€™t have a reason to live anymore because he was my reason. Without him, I canâ€™t go on.
