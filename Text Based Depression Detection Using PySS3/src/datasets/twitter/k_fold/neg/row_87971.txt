Do I stand a chance at life anymore?Never worked a job for 7 years or even looked for jobs in that amount of time. Never volunteered anywhere either for that amount of time

Just depend on government monthly money and live at home with parents

I am not enthusiastic about working at any job.  However I would do it just for survival and money only.

I say things exactly the way they are and get straight to the point.

I don't think I stand a chance at any job for being out of work for so long and my enthusiasm.

So forget about showing any enthusiasm for any job interviews or trying to put a fake happy face for any job.

Not up for the task of starting a business either.

Also very introverted person , and most or all jobs don't want these kind of people.

If this is the way it is for me , wonder if I should just end it , the moment I run out of money?

Unfortunately I don't think I am meant for this life... everyone else might be , but not me...
