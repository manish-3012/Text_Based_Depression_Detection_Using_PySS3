It's hard guys, it really isDays like today fucking suck. I have an idea on how to end it all if the time comes but I feel like I'm slowly giving up.

I can't hold a job because of my anxiety, whenever I have an interview I mentally tense up and I can't muster the courage to get up and go so I always skip them. When I force myself to go and say I get the job, I quit after a day or two because of the breakdowns I have. I can't do it anymore, I want this pain to end. I recently lost someone really close and genuine to me (breakup) and now I feel so alone. I feel time and patience is running out.
