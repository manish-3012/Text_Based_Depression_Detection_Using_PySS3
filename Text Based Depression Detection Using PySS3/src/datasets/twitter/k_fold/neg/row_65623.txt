I feel like my feeling are an insult to whoever is really struggling with suicidal thoughts.Seems so unreal, why? Why would i have those thought ? Oh right, for attention, for sure. If i tell people how i feel i would be an horrible person for sure, playing with other's feeling is awful. I feel so miserable.

May i ask a question ? How does it feel to be happy ? I'm really curious, its been 17 years and im still not able to know what happiness is. At the moment, i'm laughing at myself for writing such a stupid thing. why, why do i have to fake this, why do i have to feel miserable every fucking time. Am i really this retarded ? What have i done bad ? I don't know, so i must be faking for attention, right ? And there i am losing to my feeling and really seeking attention.

If only i could never wake up. That would probably be better for everyone. Even if it would change nothing.
