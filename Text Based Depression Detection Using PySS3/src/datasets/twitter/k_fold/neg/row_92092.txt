I don't knowI don't know who I am anymore. 

I feel nothing.

I'm split in two. I let everything build up and I let it all out on one drunken night out. I've not been the same since. Something broke in me then. I've only told two people about it. I don't remember much, just such intense emotions.

I'm empty. No thoughts on my mind save for this stream of text. I can't imagine the future, I can barely remember what I did this morning. 

I know that when I wake up tomorrow morning I'll be okay. But right now I just want to give up, sleep and not wake up. Each day is the same. I'm so fucking tired. 

I just wish I allow myself to open up to someone. I wish I would just stop pretending that I am strong and that I don't need help.
