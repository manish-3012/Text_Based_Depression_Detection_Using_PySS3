I'm thinking about taking my life?Life isn't worth living. I'm tired of being me. I get bullied everyday everywhere I go by family and people I don't even know. It's weird. I've never fit in or had friends. Nobody likes me. I can't leave the house or get a job due to anxiety and bullying. I don't know what else to do. I tried reaching out to my family and professionals for help but they didn't seem to care. I wish I was someone else so I wouldn't have to go through this. I hate myself.
