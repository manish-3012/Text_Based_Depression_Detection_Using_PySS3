ThreatsMy previous post explained how ym life was going, and i opened up to my crush about it. Big mistake. She said if i killed myself, she would too. I dont know what to do to make this stop. It hurts everywhere, and every day is getting worse and worse. Everyone and everything feels fake. I cant even end it because of the guilt and fear. I hate myself. I want help, but im too much of a fucking pussy to open up and get it. I cant handle this anymore. Im breaking. Im extremely lonely, and can somebody just help me, anybody.
