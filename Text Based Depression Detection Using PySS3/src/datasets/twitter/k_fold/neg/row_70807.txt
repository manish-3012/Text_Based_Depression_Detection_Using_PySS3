Right back at square one. Can I just die already? :(A few weeks ago I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2rq4a7/ive_become_terrified_of_the_future_and_wish_death/). Things just continued to go south. The issue with that new coworker that I thought I had turned out to be trivial, it was all in my head. I was still to ashamed to approach her to apologize for my faux pas. What didn't help was that last Friday was my last day of work, because business was supposedly too slow to keep me on and would let me know by March how soon I'd be able to return. But my parents, who themselves are business owners, know a bit about hiring and laying off, both believe that I've been laid off completely, that I will not be able to return to my job in March. Period. So I sent off an email to my career counselor on Monday but never heard back.

I also posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2t4goh/i_want_to_die_i_finally_have_a_better_chance_of/), which went completely unnoticed. Considering I'm really sensitive to perceived negative social interaction, I don't really do well when I feel completely ignored and alienated.

And an appointment with a home-visiting psych worker made me realize that in the end, my issues with my foster home will just never end. Their license ended up being renewed anyway, and the bastards continue to run the ship the exact same shitty way as they always have; with shitty services and abusive and neglectful behavior. And my home visit appointment also made me realize, the state workers never really intended to do anything in the first place. They just blamed me for cherry picking and nit-picking everything in this FH as excuses simply because I am unhappy here.

And my mother, who I thought was a good help, turned out to instead deliberately humiliate me just for doing the things she asked me to do. Now I honestly don't know what to believe about her. I do know I'm already re-gaining my previous perception of her, in that she seems to think of me as a subhuman animal who needs to be kept on leash at all times. The difference now is that I think everyone in my life thinks this way about me. How true this is, I don't know anymore. :(

And my social worker, who I met with a few weeks ago, said it wouldn't be until the end of summer before I would have a chance to move out and find better living situations.

My intense suicide desires have returned stronger than before. I'm seriously considering sneaking out to find a good place to just die already.
