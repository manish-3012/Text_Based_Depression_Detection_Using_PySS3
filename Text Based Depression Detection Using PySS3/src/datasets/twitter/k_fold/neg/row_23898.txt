EnoughIâ€™ve waited forever. But nothing good ever happens. Certainly not for lack of trying. God knows Iâ€™ve tried hard enough. 

Whenever something takes a slightly better turn, some devasting, life-changing, soul-crushing new event would happen. To destroy any grain of progress Iâ€™ve made. To render my hard work absolutely pointless. 

I donâ€™t think I will actually commit suicide (perhaps I shouldnâ€™t have posted here). But I really really wish I could. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because I have elderly and ill parents. I feel like my only purpose on earth is to survive until they pass.
