It's not worth it anymoreFinally, the first real friend I've had in my 37 years just falls into my life. I was so incredibly greatful to have somebody I felt comfortable telling anything and everything to without judgment. 

Now her SO has convinced her to throw me away like everyone else in my life has. I knew nothing even remotely good could last, so I guess I don't know why I tried.

It isn't worth it to live through so much pain. I'm going to spend some time tying things up in my life and then I will join my Marines who should have lived instead of me.
