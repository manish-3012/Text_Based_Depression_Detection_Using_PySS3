I'm so tired and I just to give upI never had a a normal life and I genuinely don't know the meaning of happiness. The words family and friends are just that, words and have no significant value behind it. No matter how hard try, I can never be happy or successful. 

All I want to do is lie down in bed and never get up, I'm just too tried to face the world and people. As long as I do, I wouldn't have to be hurt like so many times before. I'm damaged goods, constantly battered since I was a kid and people enjoy using me as a punching bag.

People who were meant to be the closest to me and be my protectors betrayed me, repeatedly. I get physically and verbally abused by my Islamofacist brother and my parents stood by and let it happen over and over again because as my father put it, he wants to "keep the peace in the house" (two years later he calls me up saying he finally "understands" why I hate my brother). Now, I just put a wall around because I'm too afraid to create connections with anyone but I also want a close bond at the same time.

I'm a good person and I always tried to follow the rules but I'm so sick and tired of life, it's been too difficult for me for too long.

I don't know what else to say, I've been constantly shut down by others and suppressed my feelings, it's so hard to get things off my chest.

I don't know what else to do, I don't have a future, my dreams are broken again.
