Nothing LeftI'm tired and feel like I am beaten. I am in serious financial trouble and can't get my career back on track. I don't know what I did in my life previously to deserve this, but I truly hate waking up every day. 

Problem is I can't figure out a painless way to kill myself. Part of me wants to die in my sleep. Part of me want to go out in a blaze of glory by driving my car at a high rate of speed into an overpass wall.

I am also not sure how my family will react. We have been through great tragedy already. But no one is here for me either. I have no one to talk to. No one to celebrate holidays with. No one to ask for financial help.

I am truly lost.
