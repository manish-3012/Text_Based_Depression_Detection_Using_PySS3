I think today is the dayI donâ€™t really have a proper way to say this so itâ€™d I ramble Iâ€™m sorry. Basically EVERYTHING is going wrong- my classes and my family, my friends and my girlfriend ALL of it is crumbling down. Iâ€™m failing all of my classes since I have no motivation to do any of my fucking classes and I canâ€™t understand any of the work even when I try to do it. My mom fucking and I hate her too and I donâ€™t want to live with her anymore (I guess I just donâ€™t want to live anyways) Iâ€™m actually so stupid and the worst human being ever. My friends seem to be loosing interest in me- they have new, nicer, smarter, prettier friends, and my girlfriend.. Where do I start with her.. I love her- I love her so much. However, sometimes I feel she doesnâ€™t think I love her or that she doesnâ€™t love me back. Iâ€™ve always been very paranoid so take what I say with a grain of salt but I just get the feeling she had me around cus sheâ€™s lonely and has no one else for her. Which, she does have others around her but she told me that she doesnâ€™t care about and I guess Iâ€™ve always beloved her but what if sheâ€™s lying to me? What if she doesnâ€™t care about me? She never refers to be as her girlfriend and weâ€™ve been dating for like a month. Am I an embarrassment to her? I donâ€™t really know anymore- I just get a feeling that she doesnâ€™t actually like me and is just lonely and desperate. I say some things and she interprets it incorrectly and goes on rants on why I donâ€™t care about her and says some, while not mean, unsavory things behind my back to all her â€œfriendsâ€. Sheâ€™s also explicitly told me that she wants to not care about anything and hate everyone so thereâ€™s that. I just feel used. Again Iâ€™m extremely paranoid and if YOU my girlfriend actually for some reason see this now that Iâ€™m not mad at you I just want you to be nicer to me, I know we are both like EXTREMELY mentally ill but you canâ€™t be a jerk to others just because your mentally ill. I know itâ€™s hard and you make mistakes and thatâ€™s ok! But please stop hurting me. Where was I? Ah yes, I think Iâ€™m gonna slit my wrists, itâ€™s gonna hurts but I deserve it- Iâ€™m a bad girlfriend, Iâ€™m dumb and ugly and mean and basically the worst. I just want to die like right now, right now, right now.
