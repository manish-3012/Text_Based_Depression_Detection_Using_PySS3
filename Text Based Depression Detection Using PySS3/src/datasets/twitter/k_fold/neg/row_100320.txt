im so aloneiâ€™m over two hours away from anyone who knows iâ€™m alive at university. no friends, not even anyone who knows my name. i canâ€™t handle being so fucking alone, being so subhuman that i cant even look anyone in the eyes or speak. every day is just panic attacks and drawn out fear. if this is how i am before schoolwork, i know i wonâ€™t make it. please god just let me have a convenient out so i donâ€™t disappoint my family, but if it comes to it, iâ€™ll find my own way. i canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. itâ€™s too much and iâ€™m so so fucking sorry to my boyfriend and friends and family. please god let me finally feel at peace
