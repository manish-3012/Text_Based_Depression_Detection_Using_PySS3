i dunnojust practiced hanging myself, it felt kind of good letting go. i never thought i would actually end my life by myself but im feeling im getting kind of close. i have suicidal thoughts almost every day and feel like a demon has gotten control of my life. everything just seem so superficial, its all an act. i guess ive been on this path for maybe five years now, but this is the closest ive gotten to actually ending it all. mmy body feel like a fucking run down car or something. all my aspirations, inspiration, imagination.. not all of it, but a lot, is gone. its like losing contact with yourself. you have a body but it doesnt feel like yours. i would much rather be a flowing spiritual entity than being trapped in this hunk of bones and flesh. it just seem so pointless? i can like people and girlfriends, but not really love them i guess. i can apreciate them, but not embrace them. there is no getting close. all contacts i have are so far from me, i feel, like, galaxies between. noone really knows me and i dont even really know myself, i dont apreciate myself even. i dunno.. thats just the problem, that i dont know. humanity and earth is great in its ways, horrible in others, but i feel like ive done my part. i know things can change and bla bla bla, but there is also a tipping point when it's gone too far, i feel like im there now. im more with the stars and the universe than with this body.

any input would be nice cause i just feel like im gonna end my life now, and there is this feeling inside me that i shouldnt. peace and love. :)
