My own perspective, if it makes sense to anyone.I can only speak for myself, so I don't know if this resonates with others. For various reasons, I have flip-flopped between being suicidal and not suicidal my entire life. I don't know that I will ever be happy. I also think I'm talking out of my ass right now and I need to vent.

I think that there is a difference between wanting to be dead vs. wishing to never be born. The obvious difference being that one is easily achievable while the other is impossible; but also it is a different perspective. Wishing to be dead is suicidal thinking; wishing to *not exist* isn't exactly the same.  
I've wished I wasn't born for most of my life. I don't think I've wished to die more than once or twice.

After watching the animated movie *Coco*, I learned about the cultural practice of 'multiple' deaths.  
~~First death: when you physically die~~  
~~Second death: when your body is laid to rest~~  
~~Third death: when no one is left alive to remember you~~  

(I found a slightly different version of the first/second death that I prefer, as it is more relevant to me)  
- First death: when you first learn that people *can* die, and you come to face the reality of mortality. ^(Presumably some aspect of our inner child dies in that moment.)  
- Second death: when you physically die / body is laid to rest.  
- Third death: when no one is left alive to remember you.

I have never lost anyone close to me ^(mostly because I've never *had* anyone close to me) but I was a logical child. I don't know when it came to me, but I experienced the first death quite early through sheer logic: science class, maybe? Living things die. It just ... made sense.

In combination with bullying from my brother (and the resultant low self-esteem) and basically having no friends, this has shaped me to self-sabotage so many things about my life.

Yes, I need counseling, I'm sure.  
No, I can't afford it.
