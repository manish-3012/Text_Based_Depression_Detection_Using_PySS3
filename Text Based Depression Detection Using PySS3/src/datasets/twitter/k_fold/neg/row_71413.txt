Not feeling well or living well at allI feel like an idiot.... because I need tutors to help me with english and math. English is my FIRST language..... I don't understand how I could be so idiotic let alone be in GT....

I feel like I'm letting my parents down.. and they've told me countless times that tutors cost a lot of money! I belive them of course but.... I just feel a lot of pressure! I don't think I'm good enough to financially support my family in the future. I'm their only child and their ONLY source of income in the future. So WHY can't I understand such a simple subject. 

I don't have the energy to work on my tutor teachers homework.... every week I have 2 tutors and occasionally a Korean lesson.... i can't take it anymore.

I know I shouldn't be complaining since I'm only a high schooler. People out there in the world have it a lot worse and I understand that. I just can't have the thought of disappointing my parents again. 

I have a 4.31 weighted GPA and yet it's not enough..... it'll never be enough for my parents. I'm in GT classes and I'm starting AP classes but I know it won't be enough.

I know I can't get strait A's and I'll always be a B/A student. I know that I can't accomplish the things that my church members can. I know that I can't get into John's Hopkins even though my parents want me to. I know I won't become a doctor like they'd want me to. 

And i DEFINITELY know that I can't live like this anymore! So why am I still here?
