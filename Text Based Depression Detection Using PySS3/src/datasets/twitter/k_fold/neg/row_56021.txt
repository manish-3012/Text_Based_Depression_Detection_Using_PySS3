I'm tired of this.I've attempted suicide a couple times and ended in the hospital. And I've been hospitalized in the psychiatric unit about 6 times and I have been to 2 different residential's and now I'm seeing a therapist that I used to like but I dont really like talking to her anymore.
Idk what else I can do...I've tried getting help and I've tried talking about it. 
I don't wanna try any more meds or any more therapy type shit.
The last time I was in the hospital they told me that there was nothing they could do for me anymore and that really scared me. 
I've gotten to the point again where I wanna end it.
I dont just want the pain to go away I want my whole existence to go away.
