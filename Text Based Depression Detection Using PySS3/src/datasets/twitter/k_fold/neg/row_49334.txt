I think I stopped caring about everything.for the past month, the only reason I'm still alive is because I made a promise to my girlfriend. She was the only person I let myself get close to, the only person I let myself trust. My family doesn't care, I told my dad about my last Overdose attempt and he just shrugged it off and pretty much told me to man up. She was the only one worried about me when I swallowed a bottle of pills. But now we're fading apart and I'm started to care less and less about that promise. I don't break promises. but I don't want to hold on anymore. I'm done with it all and just want to let go. I'm going home tomorrow back to PA where I have a nice full bottle of Zoloft waiting for me in my room. It might not kill me, even with alcohol, but there is a chance. and I'm willing to take it. I really want to, but I don't want to hurt her. then again, I'm not sure if she even cares about me anymore. She is the only reason I'm alive. she stopped me from putting a bullet through my head 2 months ago. but I don't know. I'm just tired of everything. I thought I had one person, I guess not. its my fault I guess, it always is. I can't let myself get close to people. its easier if no one knows who I am and no one cares for me, so when I make myself disappear, no one will be hurt or take a second look. I'm so done. I want everything to end for me.
