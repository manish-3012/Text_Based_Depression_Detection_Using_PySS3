Thinking and trying to do it are two different things.It's coming back again, the depression and the suicidal thinking. I've been spending this entire day sleeping because I don't want to put in the effort to live today, so sleep is the next best thing to being dead. I've been thinking about how everyone would be better off if i wasnt here, how everyone wouldn't be happy at first but they'd survive probably. I've been thinking about how miserable I am just existing.

I was driving back from eating dinner with a friend and I closed my eyes. It was a long straight stretch of road and it was only for a second or two, but....it still scared me.

I want to die....but I'm scared to do it. And sometimes I wish I wasn't. I wish I had the guts to do it sometimes.
