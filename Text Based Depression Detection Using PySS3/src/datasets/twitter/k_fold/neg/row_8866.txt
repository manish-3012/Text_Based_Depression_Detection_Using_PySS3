So afraid I might just end it all.Recently, I've felt like ending it all due to the amount of fear I'm living with. Every week there seems to be a new fear.

This time around, I'm scared I have a brain tumor, but all the symptoms for a brain tumor are the same as anxiety (except for seizures). If I have a brain tumor I don't know if I should let it kill me. I've been feeling so suicidal due to all my fears of cancer, dementia, Alzheimer's, etc. I just want the fear to stop. I just want to be normal.
