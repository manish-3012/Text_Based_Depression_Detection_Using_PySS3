I can't handle the pressure and lonelinessI want to kill myself so bad, but I'm still too weak. The pressure of college is too powerful, and there's nobody in my life that I can rely on. I literally don't have one reason to wake up. Nobody cares for me, and my family cares for me in all the wrong ways. I just want to die, already. Nobody will ever love me, nor will I anyone.
