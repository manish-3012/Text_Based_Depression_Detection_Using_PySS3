Why not? There isn't shit keeping me here anymore.I just don't have it in me anymore. This life just isn't giving me anything worthwhile anymore. I wish I had more detail to go into, but I just can't pull anything good out of it. I've been praying to some God I don't know. I'm lonely, I'm empty, and all these "people that care" don't actually give half a shit. Kind words from people who just want me around to yak at me with their problems and never actually listen to mine, because how I feel is *obviously* not important.

I don't want to do this shit anymore. Let me rot in some hole in the ground please. I'd gladly take that option. And I plan on it quite shortly. Drive myself as far out of town as a tank of gas will take me, and then let my tired bones rest. I'm done. G'night.
