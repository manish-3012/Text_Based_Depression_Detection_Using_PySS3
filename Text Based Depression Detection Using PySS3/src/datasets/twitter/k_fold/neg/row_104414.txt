Tired of living with parents, craving independence, feel like a nuisance/loserAnyone else here 25 and over, still living with the parents and feel trapped, donâ€™t see a future where you live alone in your own apartment or home because the rent prices are so high. 

I Remember my parents telling me I needed to move out, but now they know about my mental illness they donâ€™t say it but they still feel it. Iâ€™m a nuisance.

I feel tired and life feels meaningless living here, I am 27 and Iâ€™m craving taking care of myself, having privacy, independence. But I donâ€™t see myself moving out any time soon because itâ€™s hard to find a well paid job for my capabilities and rent is so dam high. 

Fuck this human society world we live in. Iâ€™m close to leaving and just taking off somewhere, homelessness seems more fun than living here.
