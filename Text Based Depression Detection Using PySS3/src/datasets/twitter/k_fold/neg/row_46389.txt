Broken since birthFear, anger and the withdrawal have been a part of my life since as long as I can remember. I cannot relate to anyone due to my varying personality disorders, anxiety, adhd, depression, abandonment issues as well as battling the ego and trying to get any type of empathy when deep down I have no love to give, just fear that is propped up by my false sense of ego. Never really had any friends, hated by all. Wish I never existed, that would be saved a lot of people that would rejoice in not seeing my moody, aggresive, self centred negative, petty, small minded twat. I wouldnâ€™t wish this on anyone, having to develop shields and close off since 3, what is the point if one cannot and instinctively maybe doesnâ€™t want to get close to others and is wallowing in nostalgia only because it is in the past and therefore not a threat, I feel like a cold, dead monster, if only I had the courage. There are a lot of good people out there, I am not one of them as I am too self centred and cold.
