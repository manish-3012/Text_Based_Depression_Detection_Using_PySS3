Kill me because I can't do it myselfI'm too cowardly to do the right thing. every time I try, some biological phobia of heights or of death or something stops me, yet I know in my heart I have to die to right all wrong. That this is the only solution. Please, I will offer you money to kill me. If you kill me, your loved ones will return, you will be blessed with optimism and power, and all the darkness of the world will vanish. I'll give you money. I'll travel to you. Just please, kill me because I'm too much of a Goddamn coward to do the right thing. Please just kill me
