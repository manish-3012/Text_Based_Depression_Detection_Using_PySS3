My life seems to be closing down..I flunked my final examinations. I have always been a nice student and my parents expect a lot from me. I think I am going to get a bad grade and my parents will be disappointed.
I can't see the pain and anguish on their faces. I have decided to finish my life..
Light in my life seems to disappear slowly. I am getting depressed day by day. I've stopped eating and have drastically lost weight. I  still have an examination left and can't concentrate. Dying is a better option..
