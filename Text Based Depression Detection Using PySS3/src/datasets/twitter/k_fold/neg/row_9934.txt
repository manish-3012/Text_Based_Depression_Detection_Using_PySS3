Just readI cant message any of my friends or even acquaintances I literally do not want to be here I've felt this way for awhile. 
But through me feeling this way I've pushed people away when I'm literally screaming for help.
I used to have it all together I was cool as fuck, now cant get a job lost all of my close friends pretty much, paranoid and a drug addict.
Been set up by people regarding the former (work that out yourself)
But I cant be here in this space I need to get away even just move country fuckin dome man
Exhausted, I'm suffering right now and I have been on and off for awhile
