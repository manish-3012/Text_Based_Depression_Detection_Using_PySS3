I want to leave something behind before I do itIâ€™m trans, Iâ€™ve got horrific gender dysphoria. Itâ€™s painful. Iâ€™m stuck. Iâ€™m on estrogen but Iâ€™m never going to be a real girl. I tried to find a way, I looked for someone out of the billions that may have changed their sex but now I know no one can right now. I donâ€™t think I want to wait for a potential way with technological and scientific advances. This will definitely sound crazy to some or even many, I believe Iâ€™ve experienced a lot of past lives. The ones I remember are all similar. Iâ€™ve felt a lot of feelings. Not many of them have been good. The only thing Iâ€™m afraid of about death is me being right about my past lives and being put in another life where Iâ€™m trans. I feel very disconnected from the world. I should care about my family and friends more. Iâ€™ve had too many people in other lives that Iâ€™ve loved so much. I donâ€™t know anything for sure. Iâ€™m one of the most logical minded skeptical people youâ€™ll meet and of course Iâ€™ve got all of this crazy stuff. But experiences and feelings sometimes canâ€™t be explained with logic. I might kill myself soon or later. Just know that Iâ€™ve felt this all before and Iâ€™ve learned so much from the suffering in this life. I remember the things I did in the farthest back life I can remember. It was horrible. I was grieving I enjoyed it way too much. Iâ€™ve learned what the right thing to do is and Iâ€™ve learned to love myself. I matter more than anyone else. And I really need to move on already. My ideal scenario is that Iâ€™m just imagining things to help myself feel better about my shitty situation and I just stop existing after death. But I really doubt that due to my past live stuff. Iâ€™ve been telling myself that Iâ€™ll wait for science and tech to get to a point where I can either have a 3D printed female body made for me in the future(theyâ€™re already 3D printing organs so Iâ€™m confident in 30-45 years itâ€™ll all be achievable) or some kind of procedure that would revert my chromosomes and my bodyâ€™s development. Itâ€™s possible and quite likely in potentially the next 20 years even. Iâ€™m just... tired. Iâ€™m exhausted from all of the pain. I just want to move on. Iâ€™m definitely going to sound like a crazy person but whatever Iâ€™m being honest itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m trying to convince you that I have a real imaginary friend so yeah lol.
