I'm sorry, r/suicidewatch.I'm sorry that I wasted so much of your time. I'm sorry that I have nothing better than to bask in attention that other, genuinely pained people need much more.  


I'm sorry that I kept saying that I'm going to kill myself everyday. I've tried once since this account opened and I genuinely will try again but its just I'm too much of a coward to take that last step and it hurts so fucking much.  


God, just see my post history man. Its all just "girls girls girls im no gf pls gurlz." I had a really fucked up childhood, I was raped, bullied all my life for my looks and weight, had to be in psych wards and undergo electroconvulsive (with my mom's permission, in case you're wondering how an under 18 could get that) and I always thought that having a girlfriend would somehow make it at least 1&amp;#37; better. Im not gonna lie, never having had a gf throughout high school and to this day has genuinely added on to my misery, but I'm sure people are just going to say "its not a big deal" anyway.   


Anyway sorry for the tangent. I'm just really sorry for wasting y'alls time. Downvote this post and move on. I wish you all well :)
