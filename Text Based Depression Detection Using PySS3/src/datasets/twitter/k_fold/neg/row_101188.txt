Even after getting high..It's like I can't really escape this feeling. I wanted to get at least somewhat feeling good so I ate some special chocolate and yea it was good for a while. But damn it's flooded back already. The feelings and thoughts that I'm scared I'll act on and see through. Well.. I'm more scared that I'm not scared ill act on it. Ever see wanted, the movie? The only thing I care about lately is the fact that I dont care about anything.. I don't want to live this existence of just trying to find a reason to even live. I'm ghosting through life and wishing I was everyone else but me. The bad thing is if I do kill myself, I know that nobody will actually care.. There's the people who will feel like they Should care and have some fake reaction or they might care that someone they know died but not actually care that IM gone. If that makes since.. Idk I'm kinda rambling and my mind is everywhere. My mother told me years ago she had 2 abortions before me and 1 after me, and since then it's been in my head of why the fuck didn't she abort me.. With how much I'm an apparent disappointment to her and everyone else, why not me. I wish she would've so I wouldn't fuck up everyone else's life. More and more every day I just want to be done with this. Ive never felt so alone in my life and I don't know why I live it anymore. I wish people cared more about me
