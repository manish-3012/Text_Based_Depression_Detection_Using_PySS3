The thought of failure.
The thought of failure 
the fact that I probably won't pass anything this year again
the thought that I am just a hassle for everyone
the thought that life can't get any better
the thought of all the stress I put my mum through
the thought of disappointing my parents by not passing this year at school
The thought that all the money my parents paid for my schooling was for nothing.

I'm really scared right now and I don't what to do.
I've already had counselling for about 2 years and no matter which counselor I'ved had nothing seems to work.
