I feel really messed up, I need help pleaseIâ€™m not feeling great mentally right now, I know I should really just try to hold on for a little longer since I know itâ€™ll get better but Iâ€™m just so tired and I just want to rest, you know? Iâ€™m finding it harder and harder to convince myself to eat and drink water. All I want to do is sleep. I feel terrible. I need help but I donâ€™t know how to get it... I donâ€™t want to put my parents through this again (Iâ€™ve attempted before a few times) and I just donâ€™t know what to do.... high school is so hard right now and I feel like I can barely keep up while my peers seem to be doing so easily... I feel so sick and exhausted....
