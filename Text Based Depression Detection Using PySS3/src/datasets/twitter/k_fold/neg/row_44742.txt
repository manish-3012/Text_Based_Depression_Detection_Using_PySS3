I Still Think About Her Every NightIt's been ten years now since I've been hugged. Or had any physical contact beyond a handshake.
All I want to do is feel loved.

I wish I could go back to all those years ago and be with her. Holding her close. Her holding me in return.

But we weren't meant to be. She wanted to be with someone else. Years together, but she marries him after being away from me for just a few months.

I wish I could go back.
But I've become unlovable. Stagnant. No reason for ambition. Horrendous. 

When I reach out, there's no longer anyone there for me. Quite soon, there'll no longer be me.
