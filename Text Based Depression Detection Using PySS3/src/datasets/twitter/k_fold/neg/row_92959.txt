I just realized it's been ten years...since I had a girlfriend. Summer of 2008. Since then, nothing but failure, false leads, and one weird yearlong thing that should have turned into a relationship but never did (that girl is dating a guy now, yay). 

Honestly the only saving grace is the knowledge that relationships are hard, and sometimes painful, and at least I haven't had to endure any sad and awful breakups in ten years. But I miss everything about it. I miss the sex, I miss the touch, I miss the way she looked at me and the way I looked at her, I miss holding hands, I miss spending my days planning fun things that I knew she'd love, just because I loved her. Life seems meaningless without love. 

I'm going to die alone now, and that makes me more sad than anything else. I'm sorry, mom and dad, that your son delivered nothing, that he was a waste of time.  Sorry friends, that you never got to come to my wedding. Sorry, young me, that I failed you, that I never gave you the chance to look someone in the eyes and declare your everlasting love. Sorry that I've never been good enough for anyone.
