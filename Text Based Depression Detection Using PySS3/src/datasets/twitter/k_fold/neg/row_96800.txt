I don't deserveI'm such an ungrateful brat. I have a good family, amazing friends, and I live in a nice area. But I hate my life, I hate myself, and I cut. I don't deserve to be so ungrateful, I don't deserve to live. I shouldn't feel like this, I should be grateful for what I have, but I still have so much hate. I hate myself, and the hate for myself has leaked onto my life. People have it so much worse than me, but here I am, with my razor. I want to rid the world of a burden. If my parents had a different child and I never existed, then there would be one less unfortunate child out there. But they "love" me, a worthless, fat, ugly, waste of space. I don't want to exist. If I die, I know people will miss me. But if I live everyone will be disappointed in me, because that's all I am: one huge disappointment. I want the world to have one less disappointment, but if I live or die I'm disappointing the prominent people in my life. I wish I didn't exist.
