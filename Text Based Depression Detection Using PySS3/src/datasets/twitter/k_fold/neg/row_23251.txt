40 year old male. Took a pair of scissors and lightly slashed one blade across my wrists.Nothing serious. Superficial wounds like you'd get if you did some serious yard work. I'm not gonna die today, but the welts and beads of blood make me feel calm.    

It wasn't THAT painful. Makes me wonder what I could do if I got a really fresh, sharp exacto blade and drank myself into an oblivion. I don't want to die but more than that - I don't want to deal with life. I've never done this before. I think I'm ready to do it again. I used to want to blow my fucking brains out with a shotgun (more sure), but maybe all I need to do is apply a little more pressure. Don't lightly hack at my wrists, just apply 25&amp;#37; more pressure on each slash and maybe I can open up a few veins and let myself bleed out. Wake up dead and alone and wander around the post-mortal landscape. Or never wake up and then I don't have to deal with reality anymore.
