I don't deserve to live.I'm filth. My family don't care about my feelings, if I'm mad they ignore me. I black out with anger and lash out quickly. I'm constantly moody and angry. I'm the angry stereotypical lesbo. Maybe I just need some dick, I need to probably get raped. You know, I can't get angry or else I'm just a stupid dyke who needs a good dicking to make me feel better.

I took my passport photo today, and since I'm the ugliest person walking, my brother starts laughing at how ugly I am, but when I say I'm ugly, they get mad. I want to throw acid on my face. 

I deserve to die. No one cares about me in the slightest. The mistakes I make are going to be with me forever. I'm never going to escape my past. Never. 

I need to fucking die. Fuck my life.
