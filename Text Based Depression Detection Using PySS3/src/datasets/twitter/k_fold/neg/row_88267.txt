Hey, r/SuicideWatch. I need some advice.I've been feeling really suicidal lately, and I'm not really sure what to do. I've been thinking about it a lot. I keep telling myself that, if I killed myself, my family would be devastated. But the thoughts just won't go away. I'm scared of what my death might cause others. I don't want them to be in pain because of me. I'm trying really hard to stay strong for them. The suicidal thoughts are really scaring me.

Does anyone have any advice they can give me? Or has anyone been in a similar situation?
