I had a meeting for uni today. I spent the hour I should have been there in the foetal position on the floor of a unisex bathroom stall.I'm in the uppermost floor of a library right now. The main reason that's stopping me throwing myself down a few floors and landing neckfirst in the library's atrium is that I know students are studying down there, and I'm not going to wreck their lives and grades through my selfishness.

I don't know how to do it - suicide - if I'm honest. I know I'm useless at just about anything else - a constant calvacade of self sabotage, but it still scares me. The only way that seems easy is a fall - call of the void and all that.
