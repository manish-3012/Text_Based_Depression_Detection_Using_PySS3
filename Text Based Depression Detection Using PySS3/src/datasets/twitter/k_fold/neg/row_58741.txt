I'm the true definition of walking dead.I hate every detail of my life, it is so bad that I can no longer see the point of life. I have ocd, anxiety, depression, ptsd. A few minutes ago I broke up with my girlfriend because I'm going to commit suicide in a few weeks. I told her so many bad things I lied and told her that I don't love her but in fact  I really love her with all my heart.  I'm so tired of overthinking i just wanted her not to worry about me when i die.
