Why is dying so scary?I honestly don't want to live, but being brought up in a judeo Christian society I have fear around death and pain.  I'm not religious, but I had a weird chemical/dmt mindfuck the first time I tried to kill myself where I could choose to live or die and I knew that what ever decision I made would be final and I looked at death and it was this dark void and I looked at life and all of its pain, Loss and misery, which would be certain and I chose certainty over uncertainty and then I came to right as that happened, covered in blood and I rode my bike to the ER.  It was a little traumatic and the effects of compound trauma are again weighing deeply in me.  I want the uncertainty in that dark void.  If I could choose again I'd have chosen death, but the pain I will have to experience to get there again is truly extreme.  I don't want to live through something like that again and be hospitalized again.  Life has just become agonizing and my anxiety is ceaseless.  I can't function and it appears that I am going to starve.  I just want to die quietly.  I wish there was death with dignity for depressed people.  I feel that my disease is in fact terminal.  I wish it would hurry up already.  Dying of nothing is the slowest, most excruciating death there is.  I wish I had cancer.
