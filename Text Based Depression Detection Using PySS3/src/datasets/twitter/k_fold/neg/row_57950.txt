I regret telling my momSo I don't know where else to talk about what happened to me today, so there it is. Sorry for my english.

I've been depressed and suicidal for many years now, but always to keep it secret from my family and friends. But lately I'm under a lot of pressure for different things, and out of nowhere I started to talk to my mom about it, and I don't know, I just couldn't stop talking, a lot of things I repressed for many years, words kinda just came out of me. Sure at first I felt relieved, I hadn't cried for years, I really felt lighter after all this. But now I absolutely regret it, my mom keeps crying, sending me texts and all that, and I know it's just a matter of days before my whole family knows, and start treating me differently. I feel like I fucked my life up for good now, and there is nothing I can do. Right now I know that my mom is at home, really sad, and I fucking regret making her feel like that. I honestly feel worse than before, because not only my life is soon going to be a shitshow, but also because I've had a taste of how devastated my mom would be if I killed myself. I don't know what to do.
