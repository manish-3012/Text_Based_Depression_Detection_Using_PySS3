I hope I'm strong enough to go through with thisGoodbye to the cruelest of worlds 

Had me meet someone who disguised themself as perfect. Then they tore me apart. Ripped me to shreds. Destroyed me. Made me believe they loved me more than anything. But how can you be this cruel to someone you love?

And I paint myself to be the good one. The one who puts in more effort. The one who keeps trying hard to make this work. But I'm just as bad as you. I've manipulated you and worse, I don't even feel guilty about it. 

I don't belong in this world. This universe. I will cease to exist. And I won't feel peace. I won't feel anything. I won't exist.
