Statistically I was supposed to be dead sometime in the last 5 years with CHF. It now the day after and nothing has changed in my life.I look at my patient admittance band http://imgur.com/SzRnQid and think to my self that.  I should be happy that im still alive.  But infact I am not.  Since then all i've known is despair and sadness.  Ive learned that there are more people that leave, instead of those that want to stay.  That people can never love you the same way you love them.  That fighting for that light at the end of the tunnel, that fighting for the littlest glimpse of hope is exhausting.  Last night I was smiling thinking about the bottle of Jamo and The 1911 with golddot hollowpoints that ive kept under my pillow.  It was the first genuine smile ive had in years.  Its effortless to move the 43 muscles in your face to create a smile to throw people off.  Theres nothing behind it.  But When you notice that you are smiling involuntarily.  Then it truly comes from the heart. Im tired, so very tired.  Ive wanted to sleep like this for a while.  It might be today, it might be tomorrow.  Hell It might be a few months from now.  I honestly just felt like getting this out.  Maybe this will get deleted. I really don't care.
