When I'm home aloneIt happens a few times a week. All of my roommates are out at the same time for a few hours and it's just me and the cat. As soon as the door closes I think of ways to end my life. Lately I fixate on the garage. I think about parking my car inside and leaving it running with the windows down. Falling asleep seems like the best way to go for me. I don't like pain as much as when I was younger and prone to self harm. Nowadays drugs pull me away from the noise. Painkillers are the worst for me. Clean and easily lost. Last time I used them I overdosed but kept myself alert. Next time I don't think I'll be able to. I haven't eaten much in the past few days. I don't have enough money to afford food right now and I'm behind on rent. I go to therapy twice a week and I think I need to be in the hospital but I can't get myself to say it to them. I'm afraid of being home alone.
