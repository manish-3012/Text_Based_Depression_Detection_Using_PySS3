Quarantine and ruminatingWith this pandemic and quarantine im beginning to realize how unfufilling my life is. Ive had a lot of time to reflect and that's my conclusion.

I don't really have friends or hobbies, or even something I'm good at. I'm really just a waste of space.

Id do myself and everyone around me a massive favor by offing myself.

As time goes on things are losing meaning. Im less invested in school and can't bring myself to play games or watch something.

I really want to kms tonight. Slowly building up the courage.
