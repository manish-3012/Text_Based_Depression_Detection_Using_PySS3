Stress Is Killing MeI haven't had suicidal thoughts for a long time. Stress is killing me. I feel dumb, because I'm very fortunate. I was lucky to get a well paying job. I am lucky enough to afford school. And I met an amazing woman who is now my wife. It's hard juggling school and work. My work is very fast paced and exhausts me. School suffers too, even though I'm almost done. I work so hard and it all stresses me out and then I cause fights with my wife. She doesn't deserve it. I have everything I wanted but stress hurts my heart and I always feel foggy and I am so quick to get angry. I feel broken. I always hut my wife. Lately we've been fighting every day because of me. I just feel exhausted.
