Perpetual suicidal ideationHey guys. This is my first time on this board. I'm using a throw away account because a post like this could put my career path in jeopardy. I ironically work on a suicide line (which I'd call if my voice wasn't so distinctive) and I'm a psychology student.

I'm tired of feeling alone, not necessarily romantically but in general. All of my relationships feel superficial and fleeting. People struggle to maintain interest while I talk about things I find important. I was sitting in my room for the nth hour last week and the silence caused me to break down into tears. On top of that, I'm so self-aware that I can't stand myself; it's like being unable to take a break from an irritating room mate for 25 years. I dislike myself so much that if I found out I have a lost identical twin, I would choose not to meet him to avoid potentially running into someone so similar to me.

Anyway, my point is that I imagine killing myself at least 15 times per day. It's gotten to the point where it's casual. It's important to note that I have never attempted. I'm so tired of feeling useless, then feeling compound useless for feelng suicidal. I have a good education and my family isn't completely dysfunctional. I'm so angry at myself for feeling this way. I'm just tired of feeling alienated. The notion of a single person considering my well being on their own time is foreign to me. Ugh, that sounds so selfish.

Anyway, I anticipate 99% cookie cutter responses to this (if any, and that's fine), which I can't blame anyone for. I'm just doing this in hopes of reading something novel.
