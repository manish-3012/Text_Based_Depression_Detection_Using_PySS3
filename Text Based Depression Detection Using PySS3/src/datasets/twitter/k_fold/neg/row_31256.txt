Theres time i wish i would of died in that car accident..every night i let out a sigh. that im still here. i have a job. a wife, loving parents. supportive brothers. two dogs that will follow me to the end. yet here i am, thinking everyone would be better off with out me. i had a nasty car accident that i barely escaped death from, i should have died from it. but yet here i am, misarable. Everyday i put on a mask and go to work. i do my job and go home to a wife thats not happy. im not happy shes not happy. nothing i do will fix it. we are having money problems but she doesnt know which makes it harder on me. puts more pressure on me. my credit cards are maxed,barely scrapping by paycheck to paycheck. im tired. tired of fighting a fight im not going to win. every day i think about how i can swallow all the pills that are in my medicine cabinet, or grab a knife, or maybe just go for a drive and drive off a cliff. i think maybe everyone would be happy if im gone. i should not be here. that car accident 4 years ago should of just killed me.
