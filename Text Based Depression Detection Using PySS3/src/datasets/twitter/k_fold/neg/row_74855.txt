Stupid law and stupid people
Yesterday I went to school and I saw from the corner of the eye that the city council is organizing a beer fest

I would give everything for a nice pint of warm brown beer

I asked how much are the prices to the secretary and without even letting me finish speaking: NO STUDENTS ALLOWED 

Ok no problem is because Iâ€™m not 21 I get it i will go home and drink myself to sleep 

The next morning came 
I open my favorite storage of shitty people.... Snapchat 

There were a lot of underage students that night

Why I couldnâ€™t?
Why me?
I just want to rip my heart out and throw it in the trash can

I was always friendly with them 
I gave them everything when I moved out of my old home

And this is the treatment that you give for someone trapped here for a year?

Dead or alive I will go back in italy
