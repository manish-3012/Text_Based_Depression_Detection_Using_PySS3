depression just gets more and more unbearable as i get olderiâ€™m 19. i canâ€™t do this anymore. the only thing stopping me from hanging myself right now is that iâ€™m seeing my favorite band with my best friend in two weeks. otherwise, i lost my job, i have a hard time finding a new one, being able to get someone to love me romantically has been beyond a challenge. iâ€™ve never felt more alone. the thought of going back to school makes me cry every damn time. when i was 12 and i saw my life going to shit bc of my emotions, i thought it was hard as fuck. looking back, it only got harder as i aged. 

iâ€™m tired of being a gay girl who is alone and canâ€™t find love. of being a crybaby who canâ€™t hold a job or go to university. not being able to sleep on the weekends without smoking weed. i open up to my friends about my suicide plans and they just seem to get upset. i donâ€™t want to burden them with that anymore. if i just get it over with, theyâ€™ll be fine after a while.

i think iâ€™m really gonna kill myself in august.
