Anyone else have a hard time seeing the point in life in general?My mind is constantly in a state of thinking "eventually everyone who knows me will die, and even if I somehow become extremely well known around the world, eventually the world will end and everyone who was ever on it will be forgotten" it's just hard for me to see the point in stuff lately
