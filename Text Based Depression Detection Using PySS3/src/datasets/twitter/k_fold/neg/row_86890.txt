I think I'm going to die in a few yearsThe way I've treated my body over the past decade is insane. Not eating enough, constantly smoking joints and cigarettes..

I've been malnourished for at least a decade and I bombarded my lungs with carcinogens. I feel like crap and think I'll get cancer soon. It's soooooooo depressing to live like this. 

I also dumped the cutest girlfriend ever. She hates me now. I explained to her that I realised that I'm going to die in a few years and she just calls me a whiner and a loser and blocks me. Which annoys the shit out of me because I just wanted to make peace before I die. 

What a fucking mess my life is right now.. My past self was a total fucking idiot and now it's waiting for my premature death. FUCK THIS. I HATE MYSELF. I'M GOING TO END IT MYSELF.
