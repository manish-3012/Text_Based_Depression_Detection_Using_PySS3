I think I'm gonna try to drink myself to death tonightI'm sick of trying to understand people and for them to understand me. 
This is my fair well. I've spent so long trying to gain friends and none of them just do what I'd like them to and that fine and all because I know they would like me to do what they want  but theyers not a too and frow in my life anb i can't take it any more. I think this is it! fuck you world! fuck you people fuock you god I hate it all and I want to die! I wish the americaa luck in it's goals what ever they may be. I wish whoever is reading this luck in their life and maybe what ever their goal is because I sure as hell can't figure it out. I'm quarter of a bottle in now and I plan to finish the rest so we'll see f it manages to finnishe me off. Peace out futher fuckers
