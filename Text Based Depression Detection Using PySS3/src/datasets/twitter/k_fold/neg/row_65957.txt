I really just want someone to be afraid of losing meI'm awful and I don't deserve to be missed, and I've accepted that.. but it still hurts when I hear that people cry over the loss of others before they're even gone.. nobody but my dad is even gonna be seriously affected. I'm just sad that even my best will never be good enough.. 
My best friend just told me that her boyfriend cried just thinking about anything happening to her, and I'm really happy that she has that support and love but I feel like I've been patiently waiting long enough. If people care, which I know you're all going to say they do, I just wish they'd show it because it's already almost too late.
