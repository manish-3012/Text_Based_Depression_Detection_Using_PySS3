All I ever wantedAll I ever wanted was to be happy. Just a couple people in my llife who love me. Just to be a little less lonely and share a quiet private life with people who feel glad to be near me. Instead I have nothing and noone. And crippling loneliness, sadness, fear and insecurity. I deserve to be dead because I'm a failure at life. Things will never get better. No one will ever love me - in fact the opposite is true. People hate me no matter what I do. I want it to be over. I'm tired of the pain. I just want it all to be over.
