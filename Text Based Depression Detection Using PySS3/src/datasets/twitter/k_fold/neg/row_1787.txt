Hope a drunk driver mows me down over the holidays. Christmas is cancelled for me, genuinely just wish I'd die in my sleep.Every time I go outside (not much) I actively think about how great it would be if a speeding car just wiped me out, or even if someone just straight up murdered me. I'd happily get stabbed up then die an hour or two later if it meant I'd finally not exist.

I've lived with un-diagnosed bipolar/borderline and it's taken over 10 years to get anywhere near a mental health assessment (NHS so long wait times, it's free tho) and by this point, I feel like the damage is more than done. I don't see how growing up through your formative years without receiving any treatment for your serious mental health problems can be reversed. All I know how to do is be mentally ill, I was never taught how to be an adult, so I'm literally a useless piece of shit.

I hate my family, and my friends are just people I get stoned with. I can't make emotional connections with people. I know some people like me, but I wish they wouldn't cause it would make it infinitely easier to kill myself.

Fuck Christmas. Spending it alone in my bed with any intoxicant I can get my hands on.
