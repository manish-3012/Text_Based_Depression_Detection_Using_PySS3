Gor accepted into uni!Now what? I thought I was going to be happy about it. Yet im not. I was unphased finding out. Still miserable. Still want to die. I know going to uni won't change who I am. Won't help me get better. Idk man. I don't fucking know.
Atleast it stops me from committing suicide, whoever much I want to do it. Like I want to at least see whats going to happen. My hopes are down, but I will still be disappointed.
