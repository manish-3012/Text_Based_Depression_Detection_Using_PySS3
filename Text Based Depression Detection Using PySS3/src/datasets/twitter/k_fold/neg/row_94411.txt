Older man lured me into his van and led me onI was using a website and was bored during quarantine.

Guy pops up.

We talk for 3 hours.

He says let's meet at blank.

I'm like sure.

Okay, tells me about his life.

Wants me to have his kid.

I tell him I am a virgin.

He holds my hand.

He tells me to kiss him.

Then tongue in mouth shit.

Clothes off and coerced into a blowjob.

Drove around for 3 hours.

I was thinking erratically. I looked him up after, searched.

He has a wife, profile taken down.

She's older.

He kept my mask in his fucking van.

He humiliates me that I should brush my hair. He smells like shit.

Tells me he is not 'interested' in me but he was aka he's looking for people closer.

I really want to kill myself.

If god is real he kills himself first.

Context: Before this I quit my therapist

The doctor calls afterwards (because I'm sure he stalks my FB) and knows something's up and schedules a private meeting with me via phone.

I'm ready to kill myself.
