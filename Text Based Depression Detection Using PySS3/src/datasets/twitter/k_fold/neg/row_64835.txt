Itâ€™s just a matter of timeI hate myself. My family sucks. I am completely alone. I canâ€™t be myself. I can manage to do nothing I want to do. Iâ€™ve failed this school year and my family is going to abuse me heavily as usual because of this, probably my mother will make me change school so that I wonâ€™t be able to attend university. And my dream has always been becoming a doctor... I care about studying, but I canâ€™t get things done. I just want to die. I can no longer do my hobbies, because I seem not to be able to do anything anymore. My classmates (so called â€œfriendsâ€) think too differently from me, they just make me lose hope. I donâ€™t like spending time with them.
Everyone think I am just lazy, but I am struggling so much... If anyone knew.
I donâ€™t trust anyone, I canâ€™t open up. I just have literally nobody... I canâ€™t do this. I want to die.
I canâ€™t cut much deep with the knives I have in my house... but once Iâ€™ll figure out how to, I think Iâ€™ll do it... I canâ€™t take it anymore.
I canâ€™t stand being this rubbish person, I canâ€™t stand failing at anything. Itâ€™s also all my fault. Probably Iâ€™m just weak.
I really want this to end... Really.
