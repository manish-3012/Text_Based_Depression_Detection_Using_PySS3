I don't know what to do anymore...I'm kinda disillusioned, really. I'm practically forced to study for a career that I have little or no interest in, even though there's nothing else to do that would yield me that kind of income, so I go along with it anyway. All of my apartmentmates keep teasing me and calling me names, my 'friends' at home do the same. Deafy this deafy that. I can't take it anymore. I've lost whatever will power to continue through all of this shit. To top it off, I don't have any motivation to fix the easy problems, like get a job or do anything valuable with myself. All I do is sit around and mope - wallowing in my own misery as I fail, retake and eventually pass my classes in an endless cycle. I never have privacy and there's always a person watching over my shoulder. I want to be an adult already, but my mindset is too childish still. I can't do anything right. There's no one else to talk to, since none of them take me seriously. I've reasoned everything out, and my only option is to continue the path I've taken, even if it slowly kills me.
