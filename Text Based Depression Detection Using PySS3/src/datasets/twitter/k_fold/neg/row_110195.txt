I don't know if I should keep living.Hey, my name is Robert and I've seen a lot of things in only the 18 years I've been alive, and I'd like some advice.. My first love who I had been with for 6 months broke up with me. Now 6 months may not seem like a lot, but I got to know a great deal about this person. She knew quite a bit about me and we opened our lives to each other. I thought of her almost like a wife.. We had been intimate in every sense and I only grew to love her more and more.


I failed her. I failed her in every sense of the word. While I was at work, her abusive ex found her and raped her.. I didn't know anything about it. When I found her that day, that's when she decided to break up with me.Â 


She had told me he was abusive, but had said she cut contact with him and he never got her. But that was a lie. He took her virginity, and she had taken mine while I was under the impression that I was taking hers. I found out what he did a couple months later, but she wouldn't let me tell anyone. I kept it a secret because she was scared...


I don't know what to do now... She's made her decision and cut off all contact with me, so now I live with the regret of not having taken any action against the man who violated my woman. One might suggest I can move on, but I don't think so. No matter how much time passes, or how much I cry, the painful emotions never cease. I have all these memories that won't go away, and some part of me doesn't want them to... I feel so weak and helpless... I don't know what to do...Â I just want to end it all.. I've fucked up so badly, I feel like I'd be doing the work a favor..
