âœŒï¸Since I have nobody to talk to I might as well talk to myself. All I wanted was to have a family but I failed. Just like everything else Iâ€™ve attempted in my life. Failure after failure. Tragedy after tragedy.  Disappointment after disappointment. I havenâ€™t looked in the mirror in a few days because I genuinely hate myself. I hate myself for who I am. I hate myself for not getting help before l ruined my life and Haileyâ€™s life. I hate myself because Iâ€™m not going to be there everyday to see my beautiful daughter. It doesnâ€™t matter what meds the doctors put me on. Iâ€™m sick. Iâ€™m unfixable. Iâ€™m broken. The amount of sadness and depression that I have in me can not be medicated. It canâ€™t be talked about to any â€œprofessionalâ€. Iâ€™ve held onto these feelings for so long that it has became a part of who I am. I donâ€™t want to leave this world. I want to be here for my family. I want to see my daughter get on the school bus for her first day of school. I want to see my siblings graduate high school. I want to see my friends succeed and live life instead of just existing. And I realized All of these things can be done without me being here. I donâ€™t want anyone to be sad when I go. I want people to be happy. I want people to be relieved. Iâ€™m a cancer to everyone I meet and donâ€™t even realize the damage I create until itâ€™s done. Iâ€™m tired of being a burden to everyone. Iâ€™m tired of disappointing everyone. Iâ€™m tired of being me and I know everyone is tired of me too. I wouldnâ€™t call my death a â€œsuicideâ€. Thatâ€™s a harsh word. This is more of a â€œsacrificeâ€ for peace. Something that I was NEVER able to provide to anyone EVER in my life. Hailey I will always love you. You were nothing but good to me. Please donâ€™t let my death upset you. The time we were together was the best years of my life, but the worst for you. Iâ€™m sorry for everything that I put you through.  To my daughter... I donâ€™t want to go but Daddy is really sick. Iâ€™m not going to get better. I donâ€™t want you growing up hating me because of my sickness. I also donâ€™t want you to hate me because I took myself out. Iâ€™m in a lot of pain. The pain is only going to grow as you get older. When you were born I made it my goal to be there everyday and night for you. Thatâ€™s no longer an option. I will be with you in spirit everywhere you go. Daddy will always be there... My parents... Iâ€™m sorry for underachieving and not being the son you wanted. To all my friends, a lot of you have come and gone. A lot of us grew apart. Iâ€™m sorry you guys have to go through this but Iâ€™m in pain boys. I can only laugh and joke it off for so long before I eventually feel my feelings. I couldnâ€™t have asked for any better friends than you guys. Iâ€™ve slept in all of your houses when times were rough and Iâ€™ll always appreciate yâ€™all. I want everyone to  be happy. Please donâ€™t be mad, please donâ€™t be sad. Be happy Iâ€™m doing something right for once.
