Internet friends, Advice NeedesUpdate at bottom 

I'm depressed, occasionally suicidal and definitely not in a fully healthy mental place. But I'm not the topic of conversation right now. 

I've got a few online friends, whom I talk to and share and help work through issues constantly. We're as close as any irl friends I have. One of these friends is in a very bad mental state. Bulimic, self harming, anxious and absolutely horrified she's gonna be institutionalized because of it. I've helped her work through her rough spots before but...

It's been a day or two since the group's heard from her. There have been periods where she's gone offline before but I don't think this is like the other times. I'm worried, I'm panicky and... I don't know what to do. 

Do I wait a bit longer? Do I spam her or keep asking? I just... im worried. 

Update: She had a hospitalization scare and was a little preoccupied to come online. She's ok now though, and I couldn't be more relieved.
