I tried.........I tried holding my head high. 
I tried making friends, i tried new hobbies, i tried going out more. I even tried by quitting my job and doing something better. I tried to make myself better.....and nothing is really working. 

As i sit here contemplating......perscription bottle in one hand and alcoholic in the next.....i just keep thinking on how i fucked everyone over, how i wasn't a good daughter, sister. Aunt or best friend.......
