I fucked upI don't know if this is the right place to post but I'm so fucked up and I don't know what to do and I don't know if what I did was right.

I'm in high school and I told my school that my best friend was going to commit suicide later this week. She said she was going to kill herself in a few days and already attempted it a few years ago by overdosing. Obviously there's something wrong, she has breakdowns often and has had these thoughts for the past few years. 

Basically, I'm a fucking snitch.

She's going to be watched for the next week. She got interrogated about her life and feelings and as a huge introvert hated all of it. Her family is going to get checked by social services. I fucked everything up for her and I don't know if I should be on my knees apologizing to her or if I should stand my ground and insist I had reason.

Either way I lost her trust forever and I hate myself so fucking much for letting it happen. She was my best friend. Was. I don't know what's going to happen now. She's in a giant shitstorm and fucking hates me and insists that I had no reason to believe she was going to kill herself and I just fucked up big time. I'm at school typing this trying not to cry I just need someone to acknowledge this and ask questions or comment opinions on what I did bc I don't know what's happening and I need something
