Coping after getting betterI started Effexor a few months ago. After starting at 37.5 milligrams, I gradually worked my way up to 150, where my suicidal ideation seemed to almost entirely vanish. 

The thing is, I'm defining "suicidal ideation" as the involuntary, intrusive thoughts of self-annihilation which used to plague me. I no longer (or, rather, very rarely) deal with unwanted images of killing myself, but I still have moments where, on some level, doing so seems rational. These aren't lapses into unfathomable darkness, they're just calculated assessments of my standing in life: I find most things in life exceedingly difficult, I'm probably always going to, and consistent happiness (or even contentedness) seems unattainable. 

These thoughts are usually vague and hypothetical enough to be disassembled by the boilerplate affirmations: I would devastate a lot of people if I did it, I always have the option of indulging some simple pleasure instead of committing the act at any given moment, and things still have a chance of getting better as long as I'm alive.

Still, I feel that there's a capacity in which my ideations are essentially rational. 95% of the time these days, I don't actually want to die, but that's also about the percentage of time that I have no real expectation of happiness.
