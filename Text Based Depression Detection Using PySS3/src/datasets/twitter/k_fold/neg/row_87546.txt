ForceDoes anyone else feel this force compelling them to take actions they don't want to? My case is relatively minor, only self-harmed twice with a pretty blunt razor, but both times I just felt this force to do it for no other reason. Like, if you stopped me on my way to the bathroom and asked me why I was going to cut myself I'd never be able to say. I could list what was making me sad but I couldn't say specifically why that lead to me wanting to self-harm

I have felt it before in less severe ways and it's caused me to send these messages pouring all my negative thoughts out which have really harmed my relationships (my best friend pretty much hates me and only just tolerates me now)

I felt that force again today and I ended up writing a suicide note. Hopefully nobody finds it. I don't have any intentions of comitting suicide yet but I still think about it loads. I'm just worried that when it comes down to it I won't be able to have control over it
