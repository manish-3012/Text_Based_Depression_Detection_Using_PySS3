So I just watched a bird fly towards a cat and waited to be eaten.Birds are fucking smart. They are lucky too in that no one will really give a shit if it dies. Maybe its closest family for a day or two but they gotta focus more on survival and less on being sad. 

It was crazy the bird kept staring at the cat as it slowly walked towards it. When the cat pounced the bird barely flinched. But it still stood there. The cat didnâ€™t go full on kill mode because it noticed me there. The bird fucking hopped closer to the cat and the cat started slapping it with its paw. And like 30 seconds of slapping the cat grabbed it with its mouth and walked away.

I wouldâ€™ve done something if I werenâ€™t in the middle of a pandemic right now. Canâ€™t trust a random ass cat to be hygienic since they are known for hunting mice and small animals which carry lots of diseases and stuff
