Feeling absolutely stuckSo, for some time I had some plans for things I wanted to do in quarantine. I wanted to create a YouTube or a Twitch channel and stream a little bit everyday (mostly for fun), I wanted to start studying a new language, learn some new skills (mostly drawing and sculpting)... etc.

But unfortunately I donâ€™t have any money to afford any of the things I wanted to do, and my parents are only spending on whatâ€™s REALLY necessary. Iâ€™m not in college, so thereâ€™s not even online classes. Everyone around me is doing something, or starting to do something but Iâ€™m just unable to do anything, and the worst part is that for the first time I actually wanted to do something.

All of this is just so soul crushing. These last few months (even before the coronavirus outbreak) my therapist has been really aggressive towards me, and even pointing fingers at me for some things that not always is my fault. I just have no relief.

Before all of this happened I subscribed myself to a course to go back to studying, had a job, and things were starting to get in place. Now Iâ€™m jobless, the course has been cancelled, and I donâ€™t even have nothing to do.

Itâ€™s been a while since I posted on this sub but Iâ€™m doing it again because Iâ€™m really questioning life right now, I canâ€™t see any way out of this.
