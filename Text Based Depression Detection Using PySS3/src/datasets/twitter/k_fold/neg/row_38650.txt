Watching my childhood pictures makes me want to kill myself even moreI look so happy :') I feel envious. how could I be that happy :') 

Plus knowing that I can never go back to that time makes me feel terrible. 

 I've been suicidal for years, but never was brave enough to do it :') ugh I'm tired of myself.

Sorry for the rant :') hope you are doing better than me :')
