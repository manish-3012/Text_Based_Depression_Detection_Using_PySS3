Crying into the void, hoping to hear the cries of others[Made this post in r/Depression](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3e95xs/too_guarded_too_mistrustful_but_i_desperately/). Didn't get much of a response. Maybe I'll get more here.

I cannot live in a world where everyone is as surface-level as they seem. I want to believe that every person is a genius. That everyone has the potential for brilliance, that they can all help humanity become what we are supposed to be. But I have no reason to believe that.

I am a wreck. My emotions are easily unbalanced. I am often wrong about very simple things until they are explained to me. I can't motivate myself to do anything. But I have so, so many *ideas*. Every moment of my life I come up with *ideas*. Ways to optimize boring tasks. Philosophical arguments. Great creative works and entire worlds in my head. Thinking about what I'll do in the future, what I've done in the past, what I'm doing in the present. I want to believe that everyone has the same kind of experience.

There seem to be two possibilities. 

1: I am a modern goddamn Socrates who for some reason is ten times smarter and more aware than the average person, but cannot on my fucking life get through college successfully.

2: *There are other people out there who share this pain*. People who I want to help. People who I want to talk to.

In the case of possibility #1, I might as well just die. This world is never going to be good enough for me. But the longer I live, the more I say and hear, the less likely possibility #2 seems.

This sounds overly dramatic. It's funny in a certain way. But it is authentically how I feel right now. I am revealing myself in a way that I have literally never done before. I hope it pays off.
