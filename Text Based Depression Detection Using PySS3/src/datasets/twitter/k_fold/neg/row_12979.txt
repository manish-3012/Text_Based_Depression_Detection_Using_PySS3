How often is too often ?I'm just wondering how often is too often to be thinking about suicide, I started cutting recently, not super often, but I did tonight, and I've started thinking about it at least once or twice a day. I'm still at the point where I couldn't do it because I think about the damage it'd do to the people in my life, but I catch myself thinking stupid things, like once my parents pass I'll be able to do it. I've had no luck with psychiatrists and I don't like talking to psychologists or therapists because I can't form a bond with them. What should I do.
