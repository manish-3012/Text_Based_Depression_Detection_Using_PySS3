Highschool is making me suicidalHighschool has slowly broken me completely ..I started off fine I had a group of friends and everything was just fine , we would spend time together and I got average grades , life was decent . Then my parents fought daily and I was in the middle of all of it, my mother who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder would beat the everliving shit out of me for no fucking reason and I was left to confide in my father . My parents soon divorced and I had some sort of peace in my life , besides the fact that my grades were getting worse slowly. Fast forward a couple months and my group of friends had been reduced to one person who I considered my closest friend, that didn't last for too long as I was repeatedly told that he thought of me as someone he wasn't all that close too but for some reason I was attached to him. Then I failed maths , and barley scraped by for one semester with absolute dogshit grades and my father progressively starting to get more and more dissapointed in me. The second semester started off with me getting rejected by someone I cared about and the friend mentioned earlier having an issue with me every week ..every fucking week it would be .."someone told me you talked shit about me " and I'd feel like shit because I never said a thing ...then I failed physics and got the lowest grades of my life...now here I am borderline suicidal , depressed and stuck in a friendship with someone who is mad at me every two days for no reason ...plus I'm failing highschool and might have bipolar disorder
