Why its hard for me to seek help.Iâ€™ve thought about this quite a bit these past few days. In the past the only reason I sought help was when my ex broke up with me. Iâ€™ll admit that I donâ€™t blame her: I was not myself, I was manipulative, and overall I just lost myself. I went to therapy because I wanted to get her back. But over time I realized that that was impossible, and so I gradually just lost interest in therapy. 
Over these past couple months Iâ€™ve developed feelings for a friend, who though states that she has some feelings for me as well, doesnâ€™t want to get into anything for reasons I understand.
Iâ€™ve been struggling with loneliness for a while, maybe 6-8 months, and the thought of going to therapy came up again. 

I think the only reason I want therapy in these situations is because I canâ€™t convince myself that living and improving my life for myself is worth it. I feel like I need someone to live for, because I canâ€™t live just for myself.
