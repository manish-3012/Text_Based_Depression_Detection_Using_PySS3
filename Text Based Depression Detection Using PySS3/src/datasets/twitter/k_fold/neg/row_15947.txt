I'm getting discouraged.&gt;This is a poem that I just wrote: 
&gt;This is one of the worst days of my life,
&gt;but one of the best because I'm still alive.
&gt;I always thought things would change.
&gt;I always kept my hopes high, but now it's been eight years,
&gt;and I still want to die. 
&gt;Now I come to question if it really will change, 
&gt;or if I've been told this to keep me slightly alive.
&gt;My heart still is beating, my lungs are still breathing,
&gt;but the numbness of this body won't seem to cease.
&gt;My body's decaying, somewhat already deceased.
&gt;The rest of me won't go.
&gt;The rest of me won't know how to give up on this life
&gt;without help from gravity, surface tension, and a tall bridge.
&gt;
&gt;The worst of this is getting worse. I don't feel worthy of this disease. I have no physical external illness to coincide. It feels that I don't have much of a reason to be so sad, but somehow I am. I feel nearly everyday that I should be better off dead.
