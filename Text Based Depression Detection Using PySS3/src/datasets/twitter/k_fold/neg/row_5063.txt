Nobody would realize it until I do itI always try to talk to my friends about how iâ€™m feeling, who, I should note, I am very grateful to have. They just donâ€™t seem to be grasping the idea of how I feel though. I talk to them for hours about how I seriously consider pulling the plug and they seem to brush it off and forget about it after I tell them about it. I donâ€™t think anyone realizes how ready I am to just end all of this, right here, right now. I feel like if I were to pull the plug, everyone would finally realize how I have been feeling for the past 3 years, and I had just mustered up enough courage to completely drop it all. I often explain how I have no purpose anymore. I have nothing to be continuing for. My family doesnâ€™t care too much about me, I canâ€™t afford professional help (and I am too afraid to ask about it, due to the fact that â€œiâ€™m a teenager and itâ€™s just a phase and iâ€™ll get over itâ€), and I have a bunch of superficial friends who donâ€™t give a single f*ck about whether I live or die. I have 1 friend, and I trust her with everything, although she is severely suicidal and Iâ€™m unsure how the situation with her will play out, which seriously doesnâ€™t help me. I always go to her for everything but at this point I have just stopped because she is already drowning in her own problems by herself. I might add more to this later, but those are just my thoughts right now. Any feedback or comments are appreciated. Thanks.
