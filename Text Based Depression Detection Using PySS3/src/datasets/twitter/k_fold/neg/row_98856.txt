I hate myselfIm failing school and it feels like im failing life. I just dont want to be here anymore. Theres no point. People say that school is the best years of their life and if they are right and it just gets worse from here i will end it. My mum just got the news about me failing english and maths and shes just gonna yell at me. My cat is my only will to live. I love her so much. I dont want to die because she will have a cold bed and she will be sad. Once my cat dies im ending it. Theres just no point anymore. I have autism so im just dumb and i have adhd so i can never concentrate. Triganometry is just so useless. Im never going to use that bullshit. I dont care about school anymore. Im probably going to repeat year 10. I dont want to but thats what my mum want me to do. My dads never in my life cos hes in the navy and had to move to a diferent state. I just wanna be with my cat. No one else give a shit. I talk to my cat about myself. I know she doesnt understand but she listens.
