dear everyone in this world part 1sry guy i just want to post this but im not good at english
if you gonna laugh at. go a head 
there no reason for anyone to read this post anymore
i know that there are no one left in my life(this is one reason why i try to post in english)
no matter how much i try to look around
all friendship i ever has in this life are long gone
im 31 maybe. was born in 1988 last time i have a social life is 10 year ago

back in the day when im on my way to become musician
life are not stop working like nowday
i miss when i still have a chance to play guitar on the stage with band
if you going to tell me why i dont play alone then
im already do that and it does not help me get better anymore
im write and record many song alone
thoese song that no one want to hear
thoese dream are already end

nowday im not listen to music anymore. i dont hate it
it just sad for me. no matter what happiness in there
i just dont like it 

nowday im working in my own factory 
there are no people to meet and talk to here
i dont have family  - my childhood is really bad time
i such a broken kid who got ruin by mental parent
i remember i stop smile at home when i was 13 maybe
i stop dinner/talk or eat anything with my family
i drop from school when i was 16 after that i just become homeless
for 2 year i sleep in the park or sometime at girlfriends apartment

you maybe think i use drug for sure right
yes i was addict but most of drug i use often is marijuana/alcohol/cigarette

i know myself. thoese drug in the pass of life
they never fire my brain anymore
the real reason that i got depression is because of my memory about family
my mother got mental illness (from her elder)
my father such a foster child who give up in his life when grow up
living in that time is really hard. just watch them fight each other
and when my mother go to working - my father are waiting to hit me with everything he had in his hand(he is useless people who never got a real job)

i feel really bad when i have to change my job from musician
and come to live here at my own factory 
i know if i left music = everything end
but what i want in that time is get more money i want to marry the girl i love back then

i spend many year just doing somthing that i dont even know about it
1 year pass
2 year pass
3 year pass
4 year pass.....

the girl that i want to marry her walk away from my life
the only one person i speak with nto waiting for me anymore
there alway someone ready for her i get it

i let her go it sad i cry . i cry till every tear are drying from my eye
i never meet anyone new after that. not even a friends

everyday after that just a loop - wake up/go buy food/eating/shiting/playing video game/jerk off and sleep
over and over never change

i this life i try to commit suicide 3 time

the first when i was 9 year old i try to jump from my parent apartment . 6 floor but i scare and my body just freeze when i see how tall before dead down there

the second when i was 18 . i take pill it call dextro i take around 50 pill lock myself is small room but i wake up 3 day later - nothing change just hungry real bad

the third around 6 month before i post this i try to hang myself in my bedroom

there are no life for me here no social just me alone nothing next
everthing already end long time ago
im just coward who still breathe such a coward who cant hurt myself more
living in the empty house not even a shadow of anyone i want to talk with around here
no memory left no matter how much i look back im my pass life
rarely see myself smile or laugh

now i sad and cry because i dont know why i still live
no reason to do anything more
this is the worst nightmare of being human
mental illness and depression
if i got cancer it just kill my body it better than what i am now

i want to die why im not brave enough to do that
maybe some pack of beer will help me out i guess

this is too late now there are no new life anymore
