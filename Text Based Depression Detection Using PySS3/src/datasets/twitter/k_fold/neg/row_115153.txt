What am i supposed to do?About 7 months ago i told my mom i was suicidal while i had a kitchen knife in my own room sitting at my table. Now again im planning on killing myself. For the past 2 days i have been thinking of "What if i tell my mom that i dont want to live anymore and i want to kill myself? And that i have no intention of 'helping' myself out of this depression and self hatred?"

How in the hell am i supposed to tell my mom who i think thinks that im improving and that im becoming less suicidal that i still want to kill myself and i probably want to kill myself more even after these 7 months?

School is about to start in 2 days and i dont know what to do. I really dont want to go there after not being there for over 2 months now. Its not like i hate to go to school but it makes me really uncomfortable and i really dont want to meet new people.


Im going to leave it at that for now. I will keep posting some more thoughts i have but right now i need sleep. See you tomorrow. For now.
