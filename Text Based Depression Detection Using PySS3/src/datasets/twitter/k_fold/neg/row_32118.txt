Going through with itOver the course of what feels like an eternity but has only been three months.. Ive been through nothing but constant sorrow, guilt and self hatred. To add further to the mix im consumed with jealousy. My wife left me for another man with no signs leading up to the dramatic departure. She has 'fallen in love with him.' She's also extended her departure to involve taking my kids along with and claiming to make her new lover the father of my children. We would've been married 8 years this November. She left me with a massive black hole compiled with outrageous amounts of debt. Divorce papers are not being signed by her which is super confusing. Shes moved on and into a new place. Ive found someone who i think cares for me but whenever I bring up the fact that I'm suicidal or depressed she just cracks a smile and changes subjects faster than a semi shifting gears on a freeway. I feel there is nothing of importance to me anymore, nothing to look forward to but a life of void. I dont feel my self importance anymore. Think ill go out Cobain style with a 20 gauge.
