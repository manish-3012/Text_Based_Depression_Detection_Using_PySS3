I just cut myself for the first time in 6 yearsGoing through a lot of life changes right now 

I was out of the country for the last 3 months and my girlfriend didnâ€™t pick me up like she said she would. Just gave me some can money. I took it maybe too personally and got upset and broke down crying in airport. 

Composed self for Uber home. 

She was yelling at me over text but sheâ€™s really stressed from work. 

I hugged her broke down crying and walked into kitchen she went to sleep. 

I made 3 small cuts on my leg. I think Iâ€™ve got it under control now. The cuts werenâ€™t anywhere as big as the ones I made before. 

Wait line for the suicide hotline text chat donâ€™t think i need to take up call time

Really scared this is going to create more episodes 

Been thinking vividly about killing myself for the past 2 weeks 

What should I do.
