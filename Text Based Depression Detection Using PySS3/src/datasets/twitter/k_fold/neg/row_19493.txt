Ready to Do ItI'm 13 and I've had severe depression (diagnosed) since 4th grade and I'm currently in 8th grade. My depression has been increasing rapidly since then. I survived a stab to my chest in 4th grade, but am ready to do it again. This time I have a gun. I don't want to leave my family behind because I will miss them, but I want to do it. You could say part of me wants to do it, part of me doesn't. I don't know what to do. I don't want to talk to my parents, guidance counselor, or my doctor. I take medicine for depression, OCD, anxiety, but I don't know what to do anymore. I also have aspergers which makes school even harder. I like programming and math, but nobody I know is into that and I just don't want to continue living.
