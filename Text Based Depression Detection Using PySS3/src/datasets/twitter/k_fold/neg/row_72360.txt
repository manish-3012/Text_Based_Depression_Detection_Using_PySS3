Losing hopeMy ex... woah my ex. Made my whole family and friends turn against me to make me seem like I was a villain. I was and am currently in an abusive household and itâ€™s not getting better. I keep on making improvements in my life. But people still refer to me as being a bad person. Even if I change everyday and even if I do positive things in life. People still think of me as the same. I hate my mom for abusing me because it caused me to be a mini her with abusive qualities and I just canâ€™t live my life like that. 

To my ex and past friends Iâ€™m sorry for how toxic Iâ€™ve been in the past. My mom abusing me wasnâ€™t an excuse. Iâ€™ve tried to fix myself in many ways but deep down I canâ€™t get over the awful things I did.

I donâ€™t wanna live anymore. Being a victim of abuse is just so cruel especially when you lose the ones you love over it.

Goodbye.
