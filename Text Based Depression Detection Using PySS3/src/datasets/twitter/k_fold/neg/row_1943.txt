RegretsI've done some shit that I really regret doing. But one of the things I regret the most right now is not catching the bus when I was living alone abroad last year. 

It would have been perfect. I could have gotten n or sn more easily and done it there. It would have taken weeks before anyone could find me. I'm so stupid I should have done it then and there. But I threw myself in church activities and fought against it. Now I'm back in my home country living with my family. I'm worried about the legal stuff when I finally have the guts to order what I need. I just don't want to cause anymore trouble. 

I don't want to miss the window anymore. If I do it this time, I could just ask them to say that I died from covid and no one would bat an eye. Plus no funeral, which is a good thing. I don't really want people to know/talk about me when I finally go. 

I just have one last thing to finish before I start acting on my plans. Then hopefully the quarantine would be over soon, so I can go for one last trip to the ocean.
