Please help, I'm going on 1-year of a mental breakdown and I can't do it anymore.Around this time last year, I had a huge mental breakdown. I'm 18M and I can't get past the idea that I missed out on some mythical "amazing highschool experience." I know it's bullshit but I can't stop think about it.

please, if you have anything that will give me hope that I'm not irreparably "damaged" and doomed to regret please say something, anything helps.
