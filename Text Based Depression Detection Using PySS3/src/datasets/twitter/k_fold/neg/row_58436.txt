iâ€™m exhausted. i just canâ€™t even grasp at the thought of another day.iâ€™m in debt, and about to be more from school. i am in my last semester of college and probably wonâ€™t graduate because of this one math class that i have taken 4 times. my parents are constantly making me feel like a failure and that i owe them for them letting me move back in. i am in a dead end serving job and donâ€™t see any room for growth. i donâ€™t care for my degree field nor see myself succeeding in it. i am so tired. mentally, physically, and emotionally. iâ€™ve become so numb and i donâ€™t care what could happen to me. i just feel like if i were to end it for myself, iâ€™d finally be able to exhale and be free. my only postmortem concern would be my cat, but even he could care less if iâ€™m around.
