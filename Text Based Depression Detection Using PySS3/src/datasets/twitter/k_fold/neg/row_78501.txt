19 years old and donâ€™t think I should continueIâ€™ve recently come out to my best friend about something that means a lot to me and instead of telling me that itâ€™s ok, he was trying to stop me from pursuing it. He said quite harsh things that made me think Iâ€™m just weird and that I donâ€™t deserve to be around and I canâ€™t tell me parents either so I have nobody. 

When I was younger my parents left me, they obviously didnâ€™t think much of me and it seems nobody cares enough for me. 

Why should I keeping going if nobody else thinks Iâ€™m worth it. When ever I say how I feel I get shut out and told Iâ€™m wrong. 

I doubt anyone would miss me and Iâ€™ve self-harmed to help get rid of this feeling. But maybe itâ€™s just time to call it an end and kill myself. Nobody would miss me and frankly I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with the difficulties I have anymore. 

I canâ€™t handle it anymore
