Antidepressants work like shatI'm sick and tired of trying medications. Antidepressants aren't going to make me happy. They either make me too violently ill to feel sad or too stupid to tell the difference. Most days I don't feel any different than before. I don't want to spend the rest of my life hopping on and off medicine with horrible side effects. 

I have wasted my money and future paying a bunch of damn medical bills that were my fault anyway, due to the fact that I couldn't even kill myself right. I have literally ruined everything and caused my parents to get a divorce.

My friends know too well that I am suicidal and have stopped giving a shit for quite some time now. 

Apparently, when everyone says that  "it will get better" or "you will get help" they dont actually know what they are talking about.
