Guess I'm just looking for someone to talk me out of it.Figured I would give this one shot seeing as I can't try it after.  Here's the first and last paragraphs from my suicide note (i cut out the middle since it contains shit i only want some folks to see) "If you are reading this, then whatâ€™s done has been done and cannot be undone.  Iâ€™ve been living in a continued state of decay for what seems an immeasurable amount of time.  That seems almost inaccurate as it seems there has to have once been something of worth for it to decompose.  A flower decomposes because it changes from something that was once beautiful into something that no longer has any beauty.  A rock does not decay.  A more fitting way to put it is Iâ€™ve been weathering away as a stone does under millions of years of erosion.  I cannot remember a time that I felt I had worth and cannot foresee a time in the future of this being proven wrong.  "
"To bring this to a conclusion I feel the end is drawing near for me I canâ€™t stand living another second.  I am nothing.  I lay down in bed motionless for hours unable to catch sleep begging for the room to explode.    I wake up in the morning begging for the roof to cave in.  When I shave I think â€œthis razor would be sharp enough to do itâ€  and when I walk to class I beg for a freight train to crash out of nowhere and mow me down.  I want to scream, I wish I could be helped but my pride would not permit it.  I have hate for nothing and no one in this world, other than myself.  I want it all to end, the only thing that stopped me before was the fear of disappointing the people I leave behind.  But Iâ€™ve reached a point where I can no longer see into myself, I see only murk.  I wish someone could pull me out of this tomb of self loathing and ugliness Iâ€™m trapped in but this wonâ€™t happen so I think it's about time to kill the one man Iâ€™ve ever hated, myself.  "
