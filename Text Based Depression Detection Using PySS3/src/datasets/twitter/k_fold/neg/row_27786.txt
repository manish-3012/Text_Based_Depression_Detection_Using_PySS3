My life is falling apart, I'm on the edge, someone please bring me back to sanity.Got to know depression when I was 14, been my worst enemy since. Up to this day, I am still unsure of what triggered it. Many fucked up things had happened in my life. I've managed to open up to someone about some of them but some are just buried beneath me as I can't seem to open up about it. As times passes, I am able to get over it. But some days, I'd get flashbacks and it fucks me up. 

Just a summary of the many fucked up things that happened in my life:
- I'm adopted, I don't know who my birth parents are
- My dad died when I was 10 
- My mom claims she loves me but tbh, it only feels like she hates me
- Raped when I was 10; this guy whom I used to like tricked me into doing sexual things with him
- Thrown into a juvenile home when I could get away with a probation if my mom signed this legal form but she refused to (I used to shoplift, not because I didn't have money but because I enjoyed the thrill. I was a very problematic teen, still am tbh)

That's all the things I can think of right now. I'm sure there's more. 

Anyways, my depression came back 2 weeks ago and I couldn't take it. I needed some fresh air. I tried sleeping it off, but being in my room made me feel worst. I felt confined to all these negative thoughts haunting me. I hear voices, I was going insane. So I snuck out. I climbed into my neighbor's house and they caught me. The next day, they told my family about it. 

Today, my aunt whom I live with came back from overseas. She talked to me about what I did and told me that she gave up on me. She told me that I will never change. She told me to think about what I want to do with my life and I should just forget about going to college because I'm a mess. She told me that I should live on my own from now.. I didn't say anything to her, because I just don't know and I don't think I will ever know how I can get my feelings across to my family with them understanding. 

You see, I am aware of the damage I've created for both me and my family in the past. But I don't feel like I have ever tried to justified myself to them, simply because I feel that they will never understand. I am diagnosed with depression. I was on meds for a few months, then they stop me from taking them because they didn't want me to be dependent on it. They don't see depression as a big issue. They don't understand how it affects me. They don't understand the impact it has left upon me. They just don't. And will they ever? 

I'm honestly on the edge. I don't fucking know what to do. Give me advice, give me another reason to live, give me a final reason to end it all. 

I just want to go to college, make my family proud and be happy. But I just can't. I keep fucking up. My depression keeps fucking me up. It's eating me slowly.
