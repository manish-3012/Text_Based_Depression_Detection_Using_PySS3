Nothing gets better, it only gets worse.I feel so fucking alone that it's sickening. Depression has become a trend these past few years. Too much to the point where people who are actually suffering choose to do it in silence because some including me hate the stupid fucking stigma around it. I just turned 21 last week, I don't remember ever being truly happy. There's always been this dark cloud above my head that has always prevented me from being happy 

Unfortunately I remember all the abuse, neglect and bullying I have received when I was younger and I wish I didn't. I don't want to be a victim I just want to be normal. I just fucking hate myself. I'm disgusting, a burden and have no social skills. I tried to make friends, get a job but everything just blows up in my face. Even though I want to die I'm too much of a coward to do anything. What's the fucking point of being here if I can't even do anything right? Ffs I'm USELESS! I hate this shit man fuck everything.
