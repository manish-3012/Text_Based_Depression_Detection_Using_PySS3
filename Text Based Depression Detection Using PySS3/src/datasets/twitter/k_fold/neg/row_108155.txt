F13 pych wardI really donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I donâ€™t trust myself when I go thru these episodes. I think Iâ€™m gonna ask for actual help. This is what Iâ€™m gonna say

so i wanted to talk to you because theirs a few things that are very serious and you need to know.
Iâ€™m really not okay. Iâ€™ve been going in and out of depressive episodes for the last few months. I donâ€™t know how to explain the severity, Iâ€™m bad at wording things like this. I love you but I need help. I donâ€™t think therapy is gonna help because if I go Iâ€™d just lie. Iâ€™ve read up before making this consideration. I think I need to go somewhere temporarily where I can get help. Somewhere where I wonâ€™t hurt myself. Iâ€™m so sorry that youâ€™ve been given such a challenging kid. I love you so much and donâ€™t wanna hurt you ever, nobody will help me if I donâ€™t take the first step. I know this may even seem extreme however this is the thing I think may help. Maybe I need meds, maybe I need a stay or two to help me work through it all Iâ€™m not sure. I can never know until I try it. Please donâ€™t downplay it, Iâ€™ve went over this in my head constantly and have realized itâ€™s best to stop it before it got to the level on an attempt. We will have to talk more in the morning but please consider my feelings and how bad itâ€™s getting.
