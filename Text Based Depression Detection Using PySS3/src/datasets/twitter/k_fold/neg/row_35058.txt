i'm killing myself today.i posted here a few days ago, but i only received a few replies and they didn't help. it is my fault for writing too much, so i will keep this post short. i passed my background check for buying a gun (even though i was just hospitalized a month ago for attempting suicide...) and i'm heading to the store in a few hours to make my purchase. i expect to be dead sometime tonight. sorry if i appear to be attention seeking, but this post is my last cry for help.

i would like someone to convince me not to kill myself. i would rather not die, but my mental illness is doing everything it can to make sure i kill myself. i am powerless to it. i have no insurance so my treatment options are few and i spent all my money/credit card balance on supporting my drug addiction. i deserve to die. 

UPDATE: thanks for all the comments and messages... they did help. i bought the gun, but i ended up postponing my suicide for the night. i have pointed the gun to my head several times now to kill myself but i have felt too guilty to pull the trigger... i will make another update later about what i plan to do from here... i am feeling very overwhelmed at the moment. i need to gather my thoughts some more...
