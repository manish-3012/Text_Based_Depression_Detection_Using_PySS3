I can't take it, I hate society.I hate my parents, I hate brown parents.  Forcing me to go to a university I don't want to. I am laying in bed skipping my classing crying thinking of killing myself. I am not cut out for university.  I wasted 3 years. First year I was in business hated switched to computer science sucked at it. I think I am kist burned out from school at this point. I worked soo hard in high school but now I can't do shit. Haven't seen any professional for this. Might just Od on pills at this point.
