At what point are the good times not worth the bad?I'm so fucking conflicted. I know it's going to get better. I know I'm just in a really rough patch in my life. But I honestly can't see the merit in waiting it out until it gets better. 

Life getting better just means it'll be average. I'm not going to life a phenominal life where I don't have to worry about family, money, health. These concerns follow everyone, all the time. Everyone is always stressed and try to convince ourselves that it's worth it. We're not going to be able to do everything we want to do; or even close. 

The more I live the more loss I will see, the more bullshit I will need to deal with, more rough patches in my life that will bring me back to where I am today. 

Those I've talked to about my suicidal thoughts tell me I'm overreacting, I have a good life, this is just a phase...who the fuck am I supposed to turn to when my own mother can't even take me seriously? 

I don't want to die...I just don't want to live. There isn't enough reason now, and it's not going to change in the future.
