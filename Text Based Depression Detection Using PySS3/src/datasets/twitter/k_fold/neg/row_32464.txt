When to step in to a friend threatening suicide?I have a friend with some rather horrible medication conditions that developed in the past few years. One is possibly fatal. All of this has been making them severely depressed the past few weeks, and now suicidal and ready to give up hope.

* They were in a social situation that pushed them to their limits a week ago, and afterwards they took 10 vicodin and drove, hoping to hit something.

* Then tonight, a conversation I had with them via text just blew up. It didn't need to blow up and become something huge but they made it happen. Near the end of the convo they said they were going to take all their meds and end it (the amount of meds they have is *more* than sufficient to do so. They wouldn't text me back they were ok and wouldn't harm themselves for 30 minutes. When I texted their significant other (I was at work and only could do so much) the person threatening suicide intercepted it and claimed their s/o didn't care and that nobody did.

During all this they admitted they threatened suicide to their cousin which was news to me. This is one real attempt, and two threats (that I know of). All of this could honestly be for attention, and to be honest probably is. I however just don't know, and don't know what to do for them, they're so far gone in the hole I feel they need professional help yet I know won't seek it.

Should I be looking getting to get them committed involuntarily? When I threatened calling the cops to check in on them, they replied that if I did that their meds would be taken away and they'd never get them again (xanax, vicodin, adderall, ability, muscle relaxer, and another anti-depressant). I feel like forcing them to see a medical professional will curtail the legal prescriptions they're on, and force them to come to terms with that is plaguing them into such a depression.

Any advice is appreciated as I've had this friend for 15 years and care a lot about them. I have to go to bed, so I may not be able to answer until tomorrow so I apologize, I just had to put this out before I sleep.
