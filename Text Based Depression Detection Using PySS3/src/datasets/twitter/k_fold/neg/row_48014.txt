Do looks matter?Hey. I doubt anyone's gonna see this shit anyway, but I can let everything out I wanted to say here I guess. Do looks matter at all when successing at life? Because I have the feeling that beautiful people have such an advantage over people that are not so good-looking (like me) (no but really im fucking ugly I hate myself). I've always connected my situation with the way I look, because as long as I can remember I have never ever really socialized at school that much and just watched people. Is it because of the way I look? I dont k n o w. Thats why I came here to just discuss this (if anyone even sees my useless talking that is) and yea I cant write for shit so Im sorry if this whole text just sounds like garbage but hey at least I had the possibility to vent. Honestly idfk if this is the right subreddit to discuss this in but people are writing all sorts of stuff in here and its where I feel the safest. Dont judge me this is my first reddit. Anyways please if anyone sees this can anyone answer cuz Im getting tired of feeling like trash because of the way I look. thanks and um if not then sorry for bothering aaaand uhh yea im sorry.
