I have a serious undiagnosable illness and I don't know how to keep goingI have a pretty serious neurological illness that I can't get a diagnosis for and is getting progressively worse. I have no idea if it's treatable. It's basically preventing me from doing anything enjoyable whatsoever - I can't focus on anything because my memory is so shot, I don't have the physical strength to go out or do anything fun, I'm pretty much in constant pretty severe pain and haven't been able to find any medication that helps. Literally all I can do anymore is lie in bed crying in pain between doctor's appointments where I get more tests done where they can't find anything.

The few people who are barely still in my life seem to be doing it more out of pity at this point, because I'm definitely more stress than fun for them right now. I can't do anything fun with people and I'm constantly spaced out, exhausted, and depressed. I almost don't want to see anyone because I feel so guilty for getting them down all the time.

I've been trying so hard to stay positive, but I'm really losing any hope here. If there's no treatment, I honestly can't think of any logical reason to keep living, even looking at the situation without depression goggles on. I don't want to spend the rest of my life lying in bed weak and in pain and mental fog. I keep trying to tell myself "this will be the appointment that they find something!" or "this will be the specialist that helps me!", but it's just a neverending series of disappointments. How am I supposed to keep going? When should I just give up? I keep having the thought "I should just jump off of a bridge while my legs still work well enough to" and I don't know what to tell myself, because "it's going to get better" just feels like a lie more and more every day.
