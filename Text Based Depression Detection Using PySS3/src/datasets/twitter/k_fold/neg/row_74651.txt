First and last post under this usernameItâ€™s time for me to say goodbye. I donâ€™t recall the last time I had a modicum of desire to live or get help to live. Iâ€™ve seen multiple therapists, many who said I was too fudged up for them to see and referred me out. Iâ€™ve tried what feels like every antidepressant out there. Iâ€™m not close to my family, who publicly shamed me about my depression and suicidal tendencies. Iâ€™ve lashed out at and pushed away any and all friends. I have no romantic relationship. I live on my own. If I were to have some breaking news to share, I literally would have no one to call or text. Iâ€™m $350-400K+ in debt from student loans. Iâ€™ve failed to get into the one career I was relatively excited to get into x3. I donâ€™t have a job lined up and my contract with the current one ends soon. I donâ€™t know where I will live. The one last confidant I had told me we shouldnâ€™t talk anymore (understandable given how toxic I am) and proceeded to share everything with his girlfriend who I have never met and told me to call 911 (not understandable and imo, a breach of my trust in him). Iâ€™ve been dealing with crippling depression and have had to choose between that versus binging and purging a minimum of 10 times a day (thanks eating disorder). The first and most likely only way Iâ€™ll be found will be due to the stench of my corpse. Thankfully, the coronavirus lockdown is facilitating my death. I sincerely hope I donâ€™t wake up tomorrow. If in the most unfortunate event I do, Iâ€™ll have a decision to make. 

Iâ€™ve been told to get help and to commit myself. The issue is that it requires me to actually give a crap and *want* to continue living and *want* to get better. I honestly, genuinely have no idea what that even feels like and donâ€™t care for it. Iâ€™m beyond saving because I didnâ€™t want or care to be saved. Iâ€™ve been guilt tripped into living, and FYI - never do that because for someone like me, continuing to live is excruciating enough without being guilt tripped or blackmailed. I have no desire to live or get better. I havenâ€™t for years. Iâ€™ve been a mindless meat suit with little to no integration into or contribution to society for the past 5+ years. 

Iâ€™ve already sent out packages and letters to people who were important to me but left. I know my death will hurt my immediate family but I literally have no one else in my life that would odd me or even know Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™m selfish and Iâ€™ve been so detached from everyone that frankly, I donâ€™t care and when Iâ€™m dead, I definitely wonâ€™t care. 

Good luck and best of wishes to everyone on here. Iâ€™ve seen a lot of posts expressing a will to live and that is a wonderful desire to have. I truly hope that you can find and get the help you need by whatever means. You *are* important and you are your strongest advocate. Please take care of yourselves. You do you. â¤ï¸
