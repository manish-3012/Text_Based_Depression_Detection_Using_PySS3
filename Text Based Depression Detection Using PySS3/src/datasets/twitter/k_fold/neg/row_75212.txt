Nothing is going right and nothing ever willIâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m an inconvenience. Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide for a while but today I really want to do it. Iâ€™ve fucked up to many times to my friends and family alcohol was the only thing making it better but no one wants to drink with me. Iâ€™ve lost my best friend cause of a stupid mistake and now it seems weâ€™re strangers I just donâ€™t see a point in living anymore. Sorry if Iâ€™m being dramatic or Iâ€™m a inconvenience.
