I need to talk to someone.Hey guys. I'm gona keep it short.     

I'm on a very bad night, on a very bad month, on a very bad year, on a very bad life. I just wrote something on my secret blog (it's always better than posting something public, I feel like no one's judging me there) to try to cry it out, but I can't. I only end up coming to the same conclusion: I'm never going to be happy and the simple idea of living in society and having to deal and see other people is a reason for major distress for me. I need to talk to someone and I feel like my friends already saw me post too much sad shit in social media. I feel like directly telling it to them will not make it any better. I don't want them to worry. I don't want to turn another group chat into a pity party for me because apparently I'm very good at that. I don't like it and I want to change.      

If someone wants to chat with in the next few hours, DM me. I just need to talk to someone who understands what depression feels like.
