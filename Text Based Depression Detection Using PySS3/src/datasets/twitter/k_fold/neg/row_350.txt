I don't know how to get my hands on a gun.I don't want to mess up suicide, but I have no way to access a gun or buy one. 

I don't want an overdose. I don't want to jump in front of a train. I can't jump off of a building. 

I don't want to traumatize random strangers or cause collateral damage of any kind. 

I want my death to be comfortable and on my own terms. I need a gun, and I need a nice quiet place in the middle of the woods. 

I want to walk until I can't anymore, I want to watch the sunset with a glass of rum and I want it to be a quick death.
