Almost thereI think I'll do it. I haven't talked to anybody about it (sometimes I tell suicide jokes, funny ones I think). I closed all my social media accounts, logged out of the forums I frequent, even I'm trying to sell everything from the hobby ive had since 2000. I'm trying to sleep all day taking pills (not to overdose, justo enough to sleep) and I think I'm ready. This past weekend I slept around 18-20h per day
Last summer we went on vacations, though about it when we were at the hotel. It was really high but didn't in the end (I thought about my wife, dying on vacations would have been shitty for her)
So far I haven't done it just for my wife, but I feel like I'm getting there
Obviously I have doubts, I'm trying to make a pros and cons list, what better place to start than black txt on a public forum
