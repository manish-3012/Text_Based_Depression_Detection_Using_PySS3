I would say my life is a joke, but people actually like jokes. Ha-ha.I just hope I can find a final line to go out on so that I leave some kind of impact. No matter how brief it is. Cause I think thatâ€™s why I want to die. No impact. No improvement. Just a waste of space and a fear of screwing up a bridge jump. Or not tying the rope right. Or waking up after taking pills. 

I just want to leave with some sort of mark, but I know that it doesnâ€™t matter. When I die, the world will keep spinning and burning like nothing ever happened. Because nothing did happen.
