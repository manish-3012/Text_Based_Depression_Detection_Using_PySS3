I became homeless today.My fiancee and I got into an argument over her breaking her promises to me and spending an obnoxious amount of time with her secondary partner. A couple of days later, she called the police on me as a potential suicide, and I was committed to a mental health ward for over a week without being able to leave. She still won't talk to me, and she has my belongings, including my meds, ID and wallet. I was discharged today, but I have nowhere to go, no money, no food. I barely have a support system, and I'm waiting for a shelter to open to beg them for a bed.

While I was at the hospital, she told the social worker and the attending doctor that she doesn't want me back.  She broke up our engagement while I was hospitalized, and wouldn't even tell me herself. We were together for five years; two weeks ago she told me she loved me, she called me her future husband, her soul mate - and suddenly I'm nothing to her. I don't understand...

She's taken our pets, is the only one with access to our joint finances, and ripped out my soul. I feel so empty inside. 

Being in the hospital didn't even help. I still want to die, now more than ever. I feel so alone.
