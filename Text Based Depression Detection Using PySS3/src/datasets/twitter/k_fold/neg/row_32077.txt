It just occurred to me - I have enough benzos to actually do thisHi guys

This has been something that I've been toying with for a while. 

It's been a nightmarish year so far, my wife of 11 years left me, I lost my job, I was put on anti depressants etc etc.

I just watched Der Siebente Kontinent (don't watch if it you're depressed) and it occurred to me - I have enough benzos to actually do this.

I was prescribed Pipamperone for sleeping problems and I just got a refill of 50 pills.

That, plus a handfull of my anti depressants, plus a shitload of alcohol, surely that will do the trick.

I just want all of this to be over. Forever.
