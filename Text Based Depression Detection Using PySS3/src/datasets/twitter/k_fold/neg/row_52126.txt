Iâ€™m sorryIâ€™ve decided to commit suicide and I have a plan and time and when I decided it was like a weight had been lifted off my chest - Iâ€™m kinda excited to so that finally the loved ones Iâ€™ve hurt can move on and be the successful people I know they can be. Iâ€™m wanting my death to be their chance at a happier life one without a fucked up friend whoâ€™s mental health issues have caused heartache and pain. So that my family no longer has to constantly worry about me. I love them all dearly and I hope they move on quickly.
