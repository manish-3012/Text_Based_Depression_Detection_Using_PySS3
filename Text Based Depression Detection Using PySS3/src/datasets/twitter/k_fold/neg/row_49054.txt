I don't know.I had my sisters move in with me, and I just seem to be a bother to them. I gave up my room and have been sleeping on a cot in the living room so my sister could have her own room. My other sister seems to always want to try to fight me lately. I just wanted to help them out and have them help me too in terms of cost of living. But lately they just seem to be annoyed by me anytime I'm home (busy work schedule), they just ignore me. I've just been thinking it'd be easier for then if I were gone. I've had many visits to CSU in the past, and multiple attempts before. If I just disappear, maybe things would be earlier for my sisters.
