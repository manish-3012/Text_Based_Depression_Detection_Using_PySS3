Seems as if the road is ending. I have been thinking about committing suicide a lot this week and I think I'm going to do it.I've been thinking of two ways to commit suicide, the "Exit bag" or just slicing an artery on my leg. 

Dont really care if my family finds me dead, but It will take place in my locked room, a place where no one ever comes to hang out or talk to me in, I'm with my uncle so when I say family, I mean uncle and cousin.

I got a job to try and socialize more and get out more, but I dont know.. I've made friends, but are they really friends? Idk.

I have a fresh razor blade right now, and I could go right now. But idk if I will mess up, so I'm probably just going to go with the exit bag. 

I just feel like life is so meaningless, and yeah I could be positive but holy fuck I feel like time is just going so slow. I dont have friends to hang out with and I'm too much of a bitch to hang out with anyone.

When I was young my cousins had sex with me (same gender) and I've literally been so to my self ever since. I dont feel comfortable with life anymore. Nothing is fun anymore.
