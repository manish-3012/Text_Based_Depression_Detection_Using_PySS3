What's the fucking point anymoreHonestly I wake up everyday and I just want to blow my head off. This past year has been hell for me. My mom passed away, I failed out of college because mentally I'm unstable at the moment. I have terrible luck getting a girlfriend and quite frankly it seems like an impossible task where I live. Plus what the fuck can I give a girl I got no job at the moment. I'm only 19 but I already despise the rest of my years. The only thing that gives me pleasure in life is cigarettes, booze, and weed. I have some friends now, most of them moved on but they got girlfriends and their own lives to live I don't wanna bring them down with my pathetic bullshit. I'f I don't have cigs booze or pot I start realizing how lonley and pathetic I am and I start wanting to kill myself. Trust me I haven't even really gone into detail on how fucked up my life is this is just what happened this past year. I really just want to die, life just doesn't feel worth living and I how can I look forward to the future when I despise it. I feel like I'm numb to everything at this point time just flies by and Im caught in a loop of shit, I don't even feel emotion anymore. Someone tell me wtf to do.
