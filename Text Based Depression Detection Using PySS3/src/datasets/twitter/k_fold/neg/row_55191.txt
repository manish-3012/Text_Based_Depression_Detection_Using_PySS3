It is getting closeer to that time.42 years later one wife three kids been disabled for 10 plus years, loveless marriage, kids who don't really have much to do with me i tried to give them all i could but riddled by health issues i lost our house almost died from blood clots sure wished i would of. So much to explain not enough energy to care to bother i am afraid of how to end it been trying to tell my wife i am going to kill myself but doesn't seem to think i am serious i am afraid to use a gun i don't want to mess up and be a vegetable. I have been building up the courage to just do it hoping either for me to just do it or get a sign life will get better but what am i kidding each year goes by it just gets worse, doctors taking away my pain meds for my chronic pain slowly but surely i am way to young to be going through so much, my sister killed herself then my mom couldn't handle that she was gone and killed herself and then my dad gave up no loss for him he was a pile of shit but within 1.5 years they all died one by one and my younger brother has disowned me, i guess it is just in the family to give up and end it this would be so much easier if i didn't have kids but the older they get and the less they have shown they don't really have much to do with me it has gotten a little easier to just get that final push to be done with it all, i have tried to reach out to my family it seems like they don't take it seriously, a cry for help with no sound to be projected for all to hear. One day will be the end!
