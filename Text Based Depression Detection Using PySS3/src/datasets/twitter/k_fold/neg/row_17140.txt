he left two hours agoim 19. i got married. im a fucking idiot.

he's in the army. he promised things would be great. we got our own apartment, and our own cat. we got married in april.

he has autism. you cant tell unless you know him. until youre on the ground, bawling, and he stares at you blankly. until youre begging him to just be nice to you, and it makes him more angry. until youre trying to get him to understand your emotions, and he wont listen. until you realize most of the things coming out of his mouth are lies.

tonight we argued because im tired of the blank stares when i cry. because i want him to act like he cares about me. because i know when he "showers" he watches porn, and when i ask him, he lies. i dont care about the porn. i care about the lies. i just want him to cuddle with me sometimes. hold me. hug me when he gets home from work. kiss me. he won't. he refuses. says he wont because im a bitch. called me a psycho before he left. every guy ive ever been with has called me that.

i got fired from my job because i have an attitude problem. supposedly. i dont feel like i have an attitude problem. my mom told me i just dont see it. i feel like i am honestly a nice person. apparently not. i've been looking for a job for 8 days now. looking pretty hard, even outside of my field. nothing.

im alone in my house. i have my dog and our cat. ive been wanting to die for 6 years now. i dont know if its ever stopped. i was on antidepressants for awhile. tried 3 different ones. none of them helped. i can't be helped. i want to die. i guess i just wanted to talk to someone first. theres about 5% of me that wants to be helped. but that 5% goes away if i think about never being with my husband again. i dont want to get divorced. i love him. i want him to love me back. i dont even know where im going with this. i just feel hopeless.
