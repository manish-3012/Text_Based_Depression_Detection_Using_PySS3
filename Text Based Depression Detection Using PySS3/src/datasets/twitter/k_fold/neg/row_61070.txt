I am going to commit suicide eventuallyI am sick of this. I have Asperger's and there's no job for people like me. I have a useless master's degree in cyber security and there's no jobs for those with limited experience and no certifications. I have made too many mistakes and failed at EVERYTHING.

What is the joy of living when there's no jobs for anyone unless you know someone? Like I was laid off just because the president wanted to hire a family friend and nepotism is legal. All the jobs out there that do hire are paid off of commission or are low wage people-oriented ones.

I quit my permanent job for a cybersecurity contract, thinking it will jumpstart my career and it DIDN'T! I feel tricked. I hate my life so much.

Why is life worth living when there's no employment? Why do I have to be the dumbest and most useless piece of bilge in the world? Why do I always get treated like the runt of the litter? Everyone in my family is more successful than I.

Maybe in the next life, I will have a better one, but this one has been far too much for me.

I will not commit suicide yet. Maybe not in 10 years, but the stress of this is starting to heat up.
