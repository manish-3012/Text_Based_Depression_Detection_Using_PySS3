I really want to die.This is currently on my mind. I know my mom would be really upset, but this pain just gets worse everyday. Of course, some days I feel like I'm getting better, but when it comes back, I feel so much worse than before as if I'm in an even deeper hole. I just can't talk to my parents or sister about this. I only have two friends, but don't feel comfortable talking to them about this either. I definitely never want to see a therapist and I don't have the money anyway. I pray that if there is a God, he will take me instead of someone who actually wants to be in this world. The only time I feel happy or calm or soothed is when I'm thinking about planning my death. So I beg every night to not wake up, so I can just stay in an eternal sleep.
