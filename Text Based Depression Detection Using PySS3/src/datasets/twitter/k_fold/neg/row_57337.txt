Early death by self destructive behavior or suicide, what's the difference?I have no friends, I don't have a job, I don't have an education. Unfortunately I do have a lot of alcohol which I've consumed excessively over the past 4 years. I'm always tired nowadays. On top of the indiffirence I feel towards everything caused by a decade of solitude and depression, my physical health has noticibly declined as well and I've barely any energy left. I feel like I could die any day now, I don't feel alive. I love pitying myself and telling myself it's not my fault. I can't love myself however, and since I don't love myself no one is. I'm frowned upon in society. In social norms I'm referred to as edgy and stupid for being depressed when I once had the foundation to built a decent living upon which in their eyes would've brought me joy and contentment. I'm a joke in the eyes of the common person, because all they've ever known has been chasing material wealth, they don't know the first thing about empathy.

Empathy is rare, very much so. Many may think themselves to be empathetic but in reality they always put themselves first when it really comes down to it. The reason they think they're empathetic is because they want so badly to believe that they are good people, so they do good things and act as if they care in order to reinforce that idea so that they can feel good about themselves and get validation from others.

I don't doubt there are others like me, but I do believe that I'll forever be alone in this world. I can't be bothered to search for a needle in a haystack that would actually be compatible with me and make life worth living.
