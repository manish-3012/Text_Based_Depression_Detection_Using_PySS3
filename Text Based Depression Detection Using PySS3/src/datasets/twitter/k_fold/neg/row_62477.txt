i canâ€™t do this anymorei thought i wanted to be pregnant and my so is so happy i am but i canâ€™t do it  iâ€™m mentally and physically at my limit and i told him i had to get rid of it and he understood because i havenâ€™t been able to do anything and barely have had the capacity to get out of bed and relapsed but i got the quote on the termination and i canâ€™t afford it 

this is probably it, and i feel selfish and horrible but i canâ€™t do four more months of this, this is the worst feeling in the world everything feels bleak and hopeless and meaningless i want my life back and i canâ€™t even afford to get my life back
