I'm going to do itthere are no legal consequences against emotional abuse in my state. I'm stuck with my parents for 5 years and even then their words are going to be stuck in my mind. I'm going to go out into the woods in a week and end it. I have a rope, I have a knife, I have whatever I fucking need. My life isn't one worth living. that's just how it is.
