Tried to talk to the â€œdonâ€™t kill yourselfâ€ people and was 17th in line...Just leaves such an open door to feel silly to sit and wait to talk to a stranger. So of course I kind of chuckled and closed it. I deactivated my Facebook today. No one will notice. I left my family group chat and no one will notice or care. Itâ€™s genuinely true that no one really cares about me, itâ€™s not just depression talking. Iâ€™m just tired of attempting to fix things. I have a crappy dangerous car thatâ€™s scary to ride in. I canâ€™t afford a doctor (and Iâ€™m chronically ill and in need of help), this week Iâ€™m without grocery money and almost worse, money for my medicine. Medicine that if I donâ€™t take I get very very sick. Itâ€™s very hard to fight suicidal thoughts when life genuinely is very bad, when people genuinely donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve worked very hard in my life, have a masters degree etc and I canâ€™t get ahead.
