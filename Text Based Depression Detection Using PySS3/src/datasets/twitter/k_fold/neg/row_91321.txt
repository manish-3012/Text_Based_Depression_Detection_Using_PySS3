I just need someone to chat with...I'm 15 and have been an on/off relationship for a while. The main details can be found in a previous post. This is mainly an update post.
So after what had happened before me and the girl had carried on in the friends with benefits style relationship, but in the past 3 weeks it escalated into us going back into a proper relationship. The thing is she is a very emotionally unstable person, more than me most likely, and only last Thursday she decided to break up (again) and then decided she didn't want to be my friend at all.
I don't know what to do no, because as I'm sure I said in my last post I put my everything into this girl. I saved all my money which I would use for games and my own means of escaping on her, as she became my means of escaping. But now she's left me. She was all I had. And this time it's for good. I can't talk to many of my friends, I only told one of my friends last night about how I almost attempted suicide. (Mentioned in last post.) And I don't feel I can really talk to anyone. The past few weeks my urge to kill myself has been growing stronger and stronger, and not just when I'm sad, even when I'm happy I'll just think about ending everything. I cut myself for the first time in over a month last night upon finding my old blade. It made me so happy, the pain felt so good and idk why I just loved it. The only reason I have to keep going is to upgrade my computer (strange I know) but at the same time I want death more. But I'm scared of what will happen to my mum, my stepdad, my dad, my sisters, even my ex. Because I know even though she might not care, shell blame herself and get back into her own self harming routines. I've thought about waiting for times when my sisters were out, just so they wouldn't have to see my body. Sometimes I smile just thinking about the release it would provide. Idk, this is a cry for help. Please someone be there to talk to, I would obviously prefer someone my age but I don't care anymore I just need someone. Please.
