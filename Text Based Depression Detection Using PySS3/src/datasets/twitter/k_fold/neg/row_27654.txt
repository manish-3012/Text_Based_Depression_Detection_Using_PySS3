I'm scared.Hi Reddit, not sure if this is the right place to post as I'm not currently suicidal. 
I'm an 18 year old girl living in a family with a 16 year old brother that is taller and bigger than me. A few years ago he started collecting knives and has used them ever since to threaten me and my parents. My Dad is a small guy with absolutely no temper and my Mother has a flaming temper but she's terrified of my brother.

The police have been called before and children's aid have come before but obviously no one has taken away his knives, his privileges or him. 

They just got into an argument a few minutes ago. He grabbed something glass and smashed it. He punched through the wall and smashed our supporting pillar. And of course, he threatens us with his knives. 

I've been in the hospital on suicide watch before. I'm not afraid of my depression and my anxiety, I'm afraid of my brother. 

Every day that I live with him, I'm fucking terrified. We all have to walk on our tippy toes because if he gets mad, he'll pull out a knife. 
I don't know why I'm so scared. Pain is temporary after all. Maybe I should just let him kill us all. 

Sorry for the rant. I'm just really scared. That's all.
