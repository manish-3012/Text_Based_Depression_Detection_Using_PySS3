I am a clownI'm funny but my jokes are immature so my friends hide me in the closet and use me as a toy when they are bored. One is pretty open about the fact that he hangs around me because he hasn't found a "real" group of friends yet.  

I am being replaced now more rapidly because this year of college just began and my friends seem to have found a new group. One is based around 2 new guys that are charismatic enough to replace me. 

I guess the part that makes me feel the worst is how I feel like an object or a character for their amusement. I make really vulgar jokes, but I am honestly the only genuinely funny guy in the group outside of 1 or 2 jokes they might make piggy backing on mine. (BTW I know how stupid that sounds but I'm not going to type out examples. Obviously I don't just sit there doing a joke routine but I am gifted enough in the area I guess.) Well when the joke's over, they act as if the jokes are really me. THey aren't that stupid. How can you believe someone joking about bestiality/hardcore sex/whatever is being honest and not just joking? 

It just offends me I guess, makes me feel less human, when I am made to fit in their little box that contains their idea of me.

I deserve better than that, and I still do enjoy being able to walk away from the group, it's a sweet pain to say fuck you to the fairweather friends.

The problem is I've been thinking about suicide lately. Just really bored I guess. I think I am getting better, though, so I guess maybe I wouldn't mind advice about my "friends."
