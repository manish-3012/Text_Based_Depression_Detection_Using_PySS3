My depression has made me a mean personSo that makes me feel like I'm a total piece of shit and that I should just kill myself because I have nothing to offer.

Or at least I like to *think* my depression's made me mean. Maybe I've been mean all along. So I guess that means I don't deserve help and I deserve this amd I deserve to kill myself
