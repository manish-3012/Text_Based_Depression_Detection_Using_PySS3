I'm transgender, but I can't get help and feeling extremely suicidal?


I just can't get help, and it's killing me. I can't get hormones, or anything to just stop me turning more masculine. 



I have no options. I'm too anxious and suicidal to work to get money, I have no money and if I go with the NHS I'll be 19 by the time I can get treatment. By that time testosterone will of done more damage. 



There just seems to be no way out of this. All the other trans people I see are all out there, getting amazing support, getting all the medication they need and everything, and I'm here can't so shit about it, and just purely existing. 



It feels like suicide is becoming the only real option. Do I really want to continue living like this, knowing that testosterone is damaging me everyday, knowing that there are ways out of it but I can't do shit about it? I can't even be fucked with anything anymore, I just want to go to sleep and never wake-up, or just die and be reborn as female. But I can't, I'm having to live like this, a life I don't want. 


I'm about to be kicked out of sixth form. I tell people I'm just finding it too difficult, which is only 5% of the story. No one knows I'm suicidal and I take lethal amount of pain killers everywhere now. I've been keeping all my thoughts a secret for too long now. 



I got about 48 pills of paracetamol right now, I could take them all at any moment and be out of this soon. I've just been hiding all this for so long and I'm on the edge, it just seems like transition (which I can't) or suicide (which I can). 



Everyone keeps saying to see a therapist, I'm just too nervous to say anything or do anything about it, I can't even see a GP to get a referral to gender identity clinic I'm that scared. What if I'm wrong, what if I too nervous, what if my GP is transphobic, what if my parents find out, it's just everything about it. 



What the hell do I do?
