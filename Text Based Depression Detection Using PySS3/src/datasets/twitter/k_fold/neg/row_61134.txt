Can't handle any job so I think my parents are just giving upI quit my job today bc I can't actually handle anything. It's a waste of time convincing me I'm worth anything after this. I think even my parents are starting to stop caring now. I've been avoiding them for days now but that's because this conflict won't go away unless I actually do something (which won't happen)

Interestingly enough, I was forced to a new counselor today and nothing was really resolved at all. In fact, things are going to get worse as they may just demand I get a new job. I can't believe they thought I could be successful. What a joke.
