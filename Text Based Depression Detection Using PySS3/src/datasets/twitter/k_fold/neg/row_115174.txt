I keep trying to reach out, and no one is reaching backAll my friends have left me and I don't like the person I have become. I am alone all the time, and do not want to keep on living. There is nothing for me on the horizon and I feel like it would be easier just to end it all. The amount of people that would miss me is so small I feel it would just be easier for them if I wasn't alive. 

It has been miserable for me so far and I can't imagine it getting any easier, so why not just end it...
