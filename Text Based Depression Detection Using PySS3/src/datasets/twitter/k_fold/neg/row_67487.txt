I can't take it anymoreShe has found someone else. I'm not good enough anymore. It absolutely tears me apart. Thinking about her in the arms of another man, her saying the same things to him that she used to say to me, them having sex. I can't get it out of my head. I'm being burned up from the inside and it hurts so much I can feel it physically. It hurts so much my joints starts to ache and i feel nauseous. I have been drinking myself asleep the last two weeks, but I don't know if I can take it anymore. She was the only thing that kept my depression at bay, but I have lost all will to live.
