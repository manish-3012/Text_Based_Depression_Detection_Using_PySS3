Pressure feeling in head and suicidal ideationHas anybody here experienced a feeling of pressure in their head that makes them want to squeeze their head or squeeze their eyes shut and accompanies suicidal ideation? I frequently struggle with suicidal ideation and experience these symptoms at different times and was wondering if this is normal or if anybody has shared this experience. I do not know if this is a symptom of depression or something like that as I have never been diagnosed with or treated for depression and never talk with others about it.
