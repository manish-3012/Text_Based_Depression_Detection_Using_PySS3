My girlfriend threatens to commit suicide on a daily basis, however, Iâ€™m clinically depressed as well...We just had a huge fight and I had a mental breakdown, I have no idea how long I can hang on to this...My girlfriend has her issues, I know, and I tried my best to help, Iâ€™ve lost count how many times have I talked her out of it...basically every time we have a fight or sth she will threat to commit suicide. I love her very much, but I know this kind of relationship is toxic to me and to her, so I tried to break up with her, and even if I hint on that, she will immediately threaten to kill herself. We just had a big fight, I was just saying that Iâ€™m sad and depressed, she responded by she will commit suicide if I feel sad about her...so I lost it, and became really depressed all of a sudden...I didnâ€™t and canâ€™t console her as I usually do, and it went really bad...I suggested we break up, but I couldnâ€™t do it, she couldnâ€™t do it, and she was talking about killing herself all the time. Iâ€™m so worried about her that I just swallowed my feelings and made up with her. Now, I donâ€™t know what to do... Iâ€™m desperate, trapped and helpless...
