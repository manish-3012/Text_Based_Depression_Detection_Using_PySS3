Happiness never lastsOr maybe it's more sadness never ends.  I can't expect to feel happy all the time, but I'm tired of feeling like shit every day.  I've worked hard to make changes in my life that I thought would make me feel better, but I only feel more empty now.  My best friend fucking hates me, idek why I'm posting this anymore.  I've felt done with life before but each time it gets harder and harder.  I have less to live for the last time I was this suicidal.  It fucking sucks, I want these thoughts to leave.
