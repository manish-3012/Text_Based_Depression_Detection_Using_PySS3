Am I going crazy?I can't stop thinking about suicide, I've been this way for at least four years, I feel lonely, a lot of the time I want to die, another big part, I ignore it.  but suicidal thoughts always return.  I don't usually walk all the time sad, but the thoughts are there anyway.  Have I gone crazy and I don't know?
