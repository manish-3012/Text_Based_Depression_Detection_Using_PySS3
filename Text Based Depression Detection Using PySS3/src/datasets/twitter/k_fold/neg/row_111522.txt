Afraid I might kill myselfI'm sure this may seem small to some of the other stories here, but regardless, here it goes. 

&amp;#x200B;

I've been moving as part of my parent's job my whole life, and about 2 years ago, I moved to the United Kingdom from the US. There, I was at my absolute best, making a ton of friends, getting good grades, going to parties and such; classic high school stuff. About 2 months ago, I had to move back to the US.  (for context it was an international school so on the last day of every school year we would gather and say goodbye to one another, as it was common for people to move) I had to leave 2 days before the school year was over so I didn't get to say goodbye to the majority of my closest friends, as many had forgotten that I was leaving. At my school in the US, I have a few friends but none are very close. I love being around people but the instant, I'm all alone, I'm hit with an overwhelming feeling of sadness, as all of my friends in the UK continue to have fun together without me. It's crushing. I've contemplated Suicide a few times, but never gone past that. When I'm feeling good, I know it's absurd and I'll turn around in college when I have the opportunity to meet new people but when I'm feeling down, I immediately start thinking about it again and I'm afraid that one day ill have a really bad day and actually try to kill myself before I even have the chance to go to college.
