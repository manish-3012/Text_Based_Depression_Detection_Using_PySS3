i need helpI have Pure O ocd, and one of my past themes are (the title of this subreddit because I don't want my parents to read this) thoughts, These thoughts used to bring me anxiety, But now they don't. I kind of like the thoughts. And I just can't take this quarantine any more. Do you have any advice, and can you please not report me?
