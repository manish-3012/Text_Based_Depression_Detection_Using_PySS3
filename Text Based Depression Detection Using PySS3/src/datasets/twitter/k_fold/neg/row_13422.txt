HiYou know that feeling when you enter a room but forget why you did it?that is what i have been feeling for quite a while now, i'm always entering rooms without knowing why and just pointessly going forward for the only reason that im still alive.It feels like everyone has a thing to do and i just cant keep up.I've been thinking about killing myself or get in a coma and wake up in another place and start again.Its been a lot since i've seen my friends and i can't just walk up to them like nothing although i never felt like they were my type of people, so i don't have any support friendwise.Its hard to open up to my family about how i feel,they would tell me that i should stop being such a whiney piece of shit so thats no support from that part either.So what is left?On the weekend i sometimes stay in bed all day or at least half of it because What can i do?i'm alone.Im tired of pretending to keep up to the people on this race, they run too fast and i'm getting behind, i think it should be time to finish my race.i hate myself for being this slow.
