I feel like im eventually going to kill myself.Hey im 19 year old guy. Do any of you guys ever feel like you guys are ever going to kill yourself eventually.  Like my family and friends may think im just trying to seek attetion and even i believe that but im eventually going to do it i feel it. Im depressed i dont really feel the depression  but my brain  is done to the point where its just like whatever. No ones there for me not even my ex which i thought would but i dont know if i do it i do it right. Just another person who dies. Which doesnt really matter to anyone . I say this because i started work and i feel like everyone is talking about me. Not just to be mean but as if they know my life.  Im honestly stressing out so much thay i feel crazy. I get home and just think about the person ive become and i just cant its not cool but ill se what happens. Lets all stay strong
