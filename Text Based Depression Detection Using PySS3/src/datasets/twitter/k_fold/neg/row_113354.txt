If anyone needs someone to talk to [30m]Hey guys and gals.


2020 was supposed to be my year. I was pumped to finally get life back on track. Yet, this year brought on the loss of the most meaningful relationship of my life, the loss of my job and the loss of my savings. 

Corona has done more damage than just getting people sick. More and more people are losing their jobs, their friends... their hope.


I lost my job as well, and have been stuck at home since march. In my country, corruption is extremely high and we were going through major economic downturn before the virus. Inflation is massive. Starvation is becoming a reality to most of the country.
My friends are practically non existant anymore.



With all that being said, i want you to know you aren't alone in feeling the struggles of life. The depression, the loss of hope, the fear and the loneliness.

I am here for anyone who wants to chat. Whether you just wanna kill some time, or you just need someone to really hear you.
I am down for either texting or voice chat, i don't mind either. 

Feel free to reach out and maybe we can help each other ride out the storm.

Lots of love!
