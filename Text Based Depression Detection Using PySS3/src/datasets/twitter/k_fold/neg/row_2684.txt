Donâ€™t â€œtakersâ€ deserve to die?This is what I am. I am an irredeemable piece of human garbage. I have loving parents who do everything they can financially and emotionally to see that I succeed and I continually let them down. Today was my dadâ€™s birthday and I couldnâ€™t even bother to get him a present/card. I lie in bed too long and only give myself barely enough time to get up and go to work. Believe it or not, Iâ€™m also already 24. 

I wish everyone would give up on me and leave me to die.
