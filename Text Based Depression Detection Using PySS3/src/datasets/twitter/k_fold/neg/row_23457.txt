I've had itI've tried so hard again and again and again to just try to continue, but I've always been shot down. I'm a mentally insecure 13 year old, yet I've already decided that death is the only way out. Everyone keeps saying it gets better when you're older, or you're just finding who you are, but I'm waiting for it to get better, and maybe I've already found who I am. Someone who has been on the road to death their entire life. If you're reading this, I've probably overdosed on pills, and I'm now dead, finally at peace, and I hope that none of you have to suffer the same life as I have had to, and that no-one has to resort to the same option as I have.
