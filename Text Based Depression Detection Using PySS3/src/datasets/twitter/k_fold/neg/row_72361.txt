I AM TIREDI wake up every day feeling like shit, I tell myself it'll get better, but the emptiness is always there. I can't stand this, I just want to kill myself. Nothing seems to be getting better. I even want to die for no reason sometimes 
I am afraid to do it though. And I don't want people around me to be in pain. Please tell me what to do. I'm drowning in my own head.
