I dont deserve to be aliveMy whole life has been a waste, and I hate it.

I dont deserve to be alive, I dont do nothing, I dont produce or do anything worthy of living, I hate being here because its either stressfulness all day or being bored as fuck, I try learn new things but cant even grasp the simplest of concepts, everything is too hard for me and I need to constantly ask people for help, my social anxiety is too high. 

My future is already finished, Dream job and career all gone down the drain, In a few weeks I might have to be taught via home school which will cripple any chance of finding friends/ gf. 

If only I could have the courage to off myself instead of being a pussy, there is a bridge near my house but the fear of surviving is too scary of a thought

My future will just be more pain and misery, Ive failed everything in college this year and lost 2 of the closest people in my life, I want to be next, nothing seems to be going right no matter how much I try, one problem turns into 100 with no solutions, if this isnt a big enough sign Idk what else is.
