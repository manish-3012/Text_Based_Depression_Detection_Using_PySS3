In advance sorry for my bad English.
I just wanna share my story. It all started 2 years ago, where I ducks up my relationship with the girl I was sure I was gonna end up marrying, she was the girl I had been looking for! After we broke up, I started being inside a lot, like 24 hours every single day of the week. ( I used to play soccer 4 times a week, but quit that too) Stopped attending school, cause why would I bother to show up. I got kicked out of school, and started to be a lot on the computer, started gaming, and thatâ€™s basically all I do now, Iâ€™ve gained a lot of weight, until I started to starve myself, and in 3 months, Iâ€™ve lost 34,8kg. And I now weigh 58kg as a 17 year old guy. 
Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself multiple times, and failed every time. But this time itâ€™s totally different, I actually wanna die, for real. I hate being here, I feel like a burden to everyone, and especially my family, which I moved away from, cause I felt I put them in a bad light. My arms are covered an scars from cuts and self harm, and I hate being with other people. 

Just had to share this somewhere, thanks.ðŸ’”
