Help! I think my 16-year old sister is suicidal!I have noticed a significant change in my sisters behavior lately. She never wants to be left alone and goes on these long pointless walks on her own. She's repeatedly said stuff like "I shouldn't be as much of a burden to you" to my parents and "I wish I were dead"... She doesn't really go out anymore and never calls/meets up with her friends.

I feel extremely guilty and powerless. I mean have I teased her too much when we were young? Have I made her insecure? Am I a lousy brother that never gave her the right kind of attention? What can I do to help? I would be broken if she were to take her own life. Maybe that's selfish but I believe she still has a great life ahead of her.
