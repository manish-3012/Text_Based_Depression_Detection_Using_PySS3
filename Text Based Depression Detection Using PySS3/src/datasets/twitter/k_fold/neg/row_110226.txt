Overweight, ugly, don't see why I should keep goingI absolutely hate myself, mostly because I hate my body. I'm disgustingly overweight, have a wide, ugly face. I've gained 35lbs in the past year. I can't fit in my clothes any more. And yet, I keep eating like the weak pitiful wretch I am. I'd rather I could just stop eating anything at all. I'd rather be dead than live in a disgusting nauseating body.

Every day, I think of killing myself. Sometimes, I drink until I pass out and can't think about it any more.

Yes I fucking tried therapy. Cognitive-Behavioral, Dialectical-Behavioral, Mindfullness-Based, even Freudian psychoanalysis. It doesn't help because at the end of the day I believe that my body the way it is is worthless and have no interest in changing that belief. Why should I if it's true.

I've been on SSRIs, SSNRIs. I've been hospitalized. I've tried everything that any therapist ever suggested and more. Nothing works. 

I almost want permission. I just want to stop suffering, day in and day out. I'm not strong enough to keep fighting. I don't want help. I just want someone to tell me it's ok, that they'll forgive me if I just let go.
