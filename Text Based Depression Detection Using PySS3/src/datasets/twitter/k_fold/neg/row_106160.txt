Why don't I have will to do things?i can't seem to do anything anymore. i need to sign up for school by the 8th and I still haven't taken the math placement. i'm in so much physical pain from fibromyalgia. nothing helps. I am getting worse and worse. I don't see a reason to live. I can't think anymore. my memory is so awful. i used to be so good at math and remembering things. im just worthless. i started to cut myself because my life is stacking up so much. please tell me it is okay to kill myself.
