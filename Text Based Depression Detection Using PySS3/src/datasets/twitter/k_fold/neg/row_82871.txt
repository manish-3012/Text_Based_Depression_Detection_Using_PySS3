My world is shrinking every day. I want out of this chair.I don't want to be in this wheelchair.  I cannot close a fist with my only working hand, I can't even grab a gun.  I can't open a pill bottle without assistance.  I felt like the past month has been a big improvement, but wvery thu has gone wrong this past few days, and I need human interaction so badly.  Nobody will look at me.  I can't stop crying, I want to die and I can't even kill myself.
