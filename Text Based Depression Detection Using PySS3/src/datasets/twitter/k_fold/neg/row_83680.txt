I'm physically surrounded with people but emotionally aloneHaha! Hello, reddit; I'm a long-time reader but not user.

You see, I have an emotionally neglectful upbringing. My grandparents were my guardians  as my parents were only college students. They fed, clothe, bathe and gave me things but didn't give emotional support.  It made me feel like I'm weak for showing emotions.

parents needs to work right now, and they're super far away. I'm left with my grandparents again. They restrain my freedom in internet and punish me for staying up late for assignments.

They keep telling my parents I just lie about my assignments to stay up late, and that I probably spend my lunch money for nothing but toys. They belittle my interest in art. They only mind me if I did something wrong.

I've been depressed since 2015

1'm 14 years old and I already attempted cutting my wrists and suffocating myself. I'm on my school's computers. I may replyon thursday and friday this week.

Please talk me through another week.

Please convince me to go froward.

I just want to live. i FEEL EMPTY. I'm missing something.
