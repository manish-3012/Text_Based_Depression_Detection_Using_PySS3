I Hate ThisI thought I had reasonable wants, (a degree, a house, a spouse), and thought settling for less (some college, renting a tiny apartment, a boyfriend) would have been manageable, but it's not. All I'll get from life is poorer, uglier, older, and more bullshit about how everything I do and think is wrong. Not even the therapists really think I can be helped and threaten to lock me away every time I see them. But I have to keep waiting around to die..?
