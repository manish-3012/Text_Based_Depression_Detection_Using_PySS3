Goodbye.Im on the verge of suicide. My heart is torn up and shattered, Im at a loss of emotion and feeling, I have no idea what I'm doing, Where I'm going or even who I am. But this is it. I've felt this pain for way to long. It's over Reddit. Thanks for making me smile. But I dont think I can do this anymore. It hurts too much and im just done. Thank you to the redditors who spoke to me :) I dont know if I'll go through with this but Incase... Goodbye. Im so sorry for being a failure to this world. for being a mess and hurting people. Im history now.
