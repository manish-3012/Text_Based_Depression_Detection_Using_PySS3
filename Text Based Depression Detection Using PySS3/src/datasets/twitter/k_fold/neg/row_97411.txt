Swings and Roundabouts4 years ago almost to the day,
I sat  exactly where I am sitting right now.
Ready to let go of all the burden, strain, pressure, and just overall sadness. I was ready to let go.

Death is something that has always interested me,
I remember being 9 years old and telling myself if this girl I liked at school said she didn't like me back, well then I'd kill myself. 14 years later I don't think a day has gone by where I haven't fantasised about what's next...

I've never really done a post like this before,
But today I lost it. My partner of the last 3 years and I have ended. It was mutual and it was fine. Until she cut me off completely,
And deleted me out of her life.

The same girl who pulled me away from this exact cliff edge 4 years ago as a friend turned into the love of my life.
But I ruined it.

My own depressive thoughts corrupted my mind into being so reliant on substances like alcohol and weed. And she couldn't take it anymore I assume.

She's better off anyway,
I just want to be happy. And I feel like there's only one way to achieve that.

I told myself I'd never come back to this place. And I am better than this...
