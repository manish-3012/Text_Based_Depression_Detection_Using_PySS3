Everyone says I've been looking more animated and happier recentlyMany people have told me they think the medicine is working and I seem happier, but I feel so much worse. All I can think about is killing myself. Every time I talk to my psychologist or psychiatrist I feel 100 times worse. But if I stop going I'll just be quitting another thing, and it will scare my mom.

I have been thinking about confronting my mom about my suicide, and trying to get her not to be as upset about it if possible. I don't think I could ever make her not be sad about it, but I'm hoping maybe I could get her to consider not killing herself because of me.
