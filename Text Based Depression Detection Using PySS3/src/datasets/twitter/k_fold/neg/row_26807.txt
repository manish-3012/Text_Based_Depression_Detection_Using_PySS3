Is this it?Iâ€™ve had severe depression most of my life due to a injury I received when I was an infant. I had all of the skin on my left hand melted off and it left a pretty disgusting scar. Through out elementary school I was called gross and disgusting due to the scar. My father had a drug problem and when he was going through withdrawals would either beat my mother or me. He once broke my collarbone. My mother was busy working and usually left me alone. She hurt me the worst I think because I know that I loved her...anyways here I am a broken man understanding that it doesnâ€™t matter.  They didnâ€™t intend to hurt me, like I donâ€™t intend to hurt the people I care about, Yet it happens over and over.  I see myself hurting those I love because Iâ€™m somehow unhappy with where I am in life and decide to take it out on them cause Iâ€™m stressed or insecure. Fuck I feel like Iâ€™m a burden dead or alive. I feel so trapped...
