I know no one will read this but I'm desperate I guessToday I felt like throwing up in the morning stayed home from school and played games but I don't want to eat anything I have pizza from an hour ago that I never touched I don't want to eat I want to die I'm not letting myself cry or anything I looked up ways to kill myself and I'm thinking of trying to get a noose but I just need rope I want to kill myself to the point that I will steal to get the job done I have no intention of trying to make friends anymore I'm only in the seventh grade and I've been this way for years when I saw my father throw pictures at my mother getting glass stuck in her face. I have no love for anyone or maybe I do but I don't know I just have wanted to die for a long time I have never gotten help because I don't want people to say anything to me, last year someone thought I was writing notes about suicide and showed the guidance councilor and how I was treated made me feel like I was an upset 5 year old and at that time I had started to think of talking about it but after that I had no intention of telling ANYONE how I felt I DONT GIVE A DAMN ANYMORE IF YOU SAY PEOPLE LOVE ME BECAUSE THEY DONT IM NOT 2 DONT TREAT ME THAT WAY. I don't care anymore go ahead ignore me trying to get help to push myself another few days I don't give two shits so I don't expect you or anyone to read this but hell if I did it and people I know find this then I have one thing to say. Fuck you.
