Not sure where else to turn. I'm 26 years old. I've spent my entire "adult" life chasing my career. I got good grades in high school, I never partied. Same thing for college. I had a job before I even graduated, but I've never loved a woman. 

I feel like I've wasted so much of my time on this stupid, stupid green paper. Everyone tells me to be glad that I'm employed, but I don't care. I want to be gone. I want to sleep forever. I'm so burnt out on everything. 

I just wish someone understood me.
