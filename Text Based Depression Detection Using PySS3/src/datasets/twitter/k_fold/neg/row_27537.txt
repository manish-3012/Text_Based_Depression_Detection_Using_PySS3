I am too tired of thisWhy am I posting this? I don't know, but I need to get it out of my head and into some where else so I can find something relative of peace. I guess this is my final attempt of reaching out.


I suffer from chronic pain. Also major depression. I am on meds for my pain. Sure, my chronic pain is under the most control ever, I am having to deal with horrible side effects in return and I am having enough of it. I tell my chronic pain specialist about the side effects but I am constantly brushed off with my concerns. I have a bf who I live with and I am just dragging him down. Because of me our credit is ruined and I have to go bankrupt while he consolidates his debts. We are behind on rent. Barely have enough for groceries, at least 2 weeks out of the month all I eat is canned goods. And my body is not taking it well. He has dreams and aspirations and I don't. Its like we suddenly aren't compatible any more because he keeps striving, and I am too tired to keep up.


I am too young to deal with all this bullshit! I feel like I am 60 years old at times! I'm not even 30! My life is NOT what it used to be even 5 years ago. I'm like a lab rat, constantly trying something that "should help" me out but rarely ever does. I can't keep this up any more.
I am tired of being constantly miserable. I have had a plan set for a long time. I think it's finally time to go through with it. I just want to close my eyes and let my soul escape this cage of a body.
