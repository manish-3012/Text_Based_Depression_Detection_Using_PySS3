Life on downward skid for years27, unemployed. NEVER employed. I had a plan that didn't pan out; Can't get so much as an interview.

Used to be in good shape, bouts with depression and injury have me flabby and in pain, can't get back in the swing of eating right. I'm so tired of wasting my life but can't seem to help myself. I want to be a fitness model, but that's impossible at this rate -- I look like a "Before" picture from one of my magazines now

Oh, and when my sister stopped cutting and burning me, I started doing it to myself. And I have no friends.

I've tried to kill myself a few times (at least five) - how's another sound?
