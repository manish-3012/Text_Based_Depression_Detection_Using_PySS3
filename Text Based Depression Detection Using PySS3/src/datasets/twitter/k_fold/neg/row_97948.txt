I can't do anything and I'm tired of disappointing my parents.My mum is the only person I can talk to about my mental health and I hate myself for making her worry. 
I have goals for the future, but I can't imagine how to get out of this pit or ever have enough control over my anxiety disorder to be able to work or study. I've already had to drop out of school, lost a job, and been removed from two TAFE courses for not being able to be punctual etc because sometimes I get awful agoraphobia and social anxiety. Not to mention my general anxiety and fear of failure preventing me from handing in any assignments.
I'm very tired of not being able to get professional help because so many people don't think anxiety is serious or can lead to suicide
