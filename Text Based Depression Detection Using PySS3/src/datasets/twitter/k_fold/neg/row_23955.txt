yo so i didnt die and its kinda nice to not be deadi cant find the post but in june, i attempted suicide by hanging
which means i kinda almost died
and it was terrifying
so terrifying that things that used to scare me
doesnt really scare me anymore
just makes me uncomfortable
cause the worst that could happen happened
i survived a suicide attempt
i went through with it and faced the consequences
and while it obviously wasnt any positive response.. well, ive got a dog
im getting myself back to track and its honestly nice
im not okay though
im not stable
and ill most likely end up in some kinda terrible state again
but for now
it actually feels nice surviving
also
i cant post my dog but its a sprocker spaniel and he is 14 weeks old
