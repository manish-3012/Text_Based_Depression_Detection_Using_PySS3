The longer I live the worse everything getsI've gone from being relatively sound of mind to just a corrupted mess of ever rotting mental decay. 

Confidence and charm lead to minor depression lead to major depression. Major depression leads to violent mood swings leading to people rejecting me. Losing jobs, partners, friends, family members too concerned for my well being to have a  proper conversation with me. My confidence is gone, I struggle to talk even to long term friends because my brain just won't produce things to say. They've started not inviting me places because I'm a downer

Violent mood swings have lead to psychotic episodes I'm becoming too afraid to leave the house as my brain distorts reality around me making me think that everyone wants negativity towards me. Strangers are laughing at me in the street, people gossip and decide they don't like me for no reason making me too nervous to talk to them.

I've tried everything, medication, therapy, mindfulness, hard drugs, giving up substances, burying my anxiety in work, quitting my job. Each one doesn't work, each one reinforces that maybe I'm unfixable. 

People tell me It won't be like this forever and as I look back at my 20's feeling like my best years are behind me I ask myself when will it get better because it just gets worse. Maybe life just wasn't meant for me.
