Numb and paranoid and grumbling excessive amounts of f-words.What are the possible negatives of calling a hotline and what is likely to happen if I were to call? I don't want to be hospitalized or forced into anything. I have the same issues about not going to a therapist (or when I go not telling them most things). 

I don't want to die exactly, I just want to disappear for a while, but I have too much to do, which in itself is overwhelming, so I can't spend the day sitting in the back of the closet to "reset". I'm as afraid of existing as I am of dying which just turns into paralyzing numbness. I've been really tempted to start SI again just to feel something and snap the fuck out of it (not as suicide method; just scratching enough to feel pain - my old psych said it seemed like I was using it as a coping mechanism to keep from dissociating and I should find a different one but I've never been able to find something that worked as well). The only ONLY reason I have for not doing so is not wanting to freaking talk about it if my husband happens to see it.  I both need to get away from myself and be more... with it at the same time. I need to be more calm, but attempts at relaxing keep me from doing things that need to be done, and leaving them undone stresses me out; but it's never finished. I feel like "life sucks, get used to it" is the extent of pep-talkage available without bringing in a bunch of BS in effort to keep me from doing what I'm not going to do anyways. And yeah, it may "get better" but if better only lasts an hour and is the result of me willfully ignoring everything and/or dissociating, what's the point? 

(If anyone happens to recognize my username from /r/islam, /r/hijabis, or /r/shia, please keep in mind 1.c. in the guidelines here; don't want you to get in trouble with the mods and to be honest I've heard advice from that end. If it worked for me, I'd have felt better a long time ago. Still depressed, still anxious, still numb.)
