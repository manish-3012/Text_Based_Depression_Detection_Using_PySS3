Probably gonna end it when I'm 18When you're 18 you're supposed to have something to do with your life. I know for a God damn fact I won't know what to do with my life. I probably won't have a driver's license, won't go to college and still live with my parents. I'm losing hope that I'll find something sustainable to do other than sit in my room all day and look at memes and be a fuck up. That's all I am is just a fuck up. I'm such a fuck up that when I'm 18 and try to kill myself I'll probably fuck that up too, like I have numerous times. I'm 15 right now so maybe there's hope but I severely doubt it.
