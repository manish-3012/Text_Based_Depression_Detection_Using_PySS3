I think I've scared my friends away.I'm pretty sure they found out. I can feel it in their texts. The hesitation in every word. I cant believe I was so careless. I wish we never met, then they wouldn't have to deal with a worthless deadweight. I want to leave the world forgotten. I wish no one cared about me so I wouldn't have to burden them with my problems.
