A signI have been wanting to take my own life for years now but never really had the courage to do it.

But I think this is a sign, my brother was arrested due to drugs and its not bailable but due to plea bargaining he can plead guilty and have freedom but we need a large sum of money to do that. 

Iâ€™m the breadwinner of our family, all of them is expecting me to have that kind of money to get my brother out of prison. WITH NO HELP FROM THEM.

My family doesnâ€™t really consider me as a family they consider me more like a financer. Im 25 and Iâ€™m hustling to make my life better and to have a financial stability coz I donâ€™t wanna be living from paycheck to paycheck but having people like them makes it impossible.

I have a life Insurance and the death benefit is a huge amount of money which could cover the payment for the freedom and to feed my family for like 6 month

The only things thats been keeping me alive and keeping me to love my life is the thought of having a good life in the future but seeing the situation right now, those things are impossible anymore.

The only way that I could give them a huge amount of money is to be dead.
The only thing that could make me happy is to die.

So I guess its a win-win.
