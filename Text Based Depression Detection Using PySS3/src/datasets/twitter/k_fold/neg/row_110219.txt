Just want to put my story out there.Hi, 
Iâ€™ve never done this before so Iâ€™m sorry if itâ€™s a mess. 
My past is filled with abuse and my childhood sucked. Every time I take a shower I get lost in thoughts of the past. Abandoned. Abused. Poor. Every moment must be filled with music or some other distraction or I recede into my mind and itâ€™s problems. I canâ€™t sleep because of it. Dreams are always nightmares of being killed in different fashions. 
Iâ€™ve worked hard. Iâ€™ve worked for some large companies and finally made it into management making good money. Then I was fired. 
Iâ€™ve worked so hard since 2013. After being fired last year, I spent my life saving to start a Buisness. Itâ€™s failing. I spent ever last penny I have to start a new LLC. A good friend of mine said he needed a consultant. I got everything done then he decided he didnâ€™t. 
Iâ€™ve been fighting my whole life for the little, so very little I have. I donâ€™t want to fight anymore. Whatâ€™s the point of living with nothing for the rest of your life? 
Iâ€™m an intellectual who struggles with emotions and it hurts my relationship.  The relationship is bland anyway. Arguments, no sex, aggravation. 
I donâ€™t want to fight anymore. I donâ€™t want to struggle. I feel this is my maximum potential. Itâ€™s all slowly slipping away. Iâ€™ve achieved all I can and Iâ€™m ready to take my seat on the final swing set. 
Also, ya know, Iâ€™d call the help line, but they have the power to call the police. And that would just be the end of it right there. That makes me so angry. Wish someone would listen and not judge. 
Thank you for reading. Thank you for replying if you do.
