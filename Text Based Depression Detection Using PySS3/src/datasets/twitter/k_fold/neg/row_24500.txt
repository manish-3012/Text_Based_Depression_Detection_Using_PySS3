I'm a cowardI've been thinking about ending it all, the thought of it alone feels like a great relief, It's like thinking about summer break, away from it all. 

I've been feeling really bad lately and I don't know what to do with myself, I am not capable of talking about my feelings. there are many people that love me that don't know about how I've been feeling, the thought of suicide makes me feel guilty. It's such an easy way out, and I'll hurt so many people doing so. 

I want to be with a girl, we're still young and we've had a relationship for about 2.5 years and I'm sitting on in the playground next to her house. She just broke up with me (under 10 minutes ago) because she couldn't handle it anymore, I was too much of a burden to her. I don't blame her, it's my fault, not hers. It feels unfair though, I did everything I could to help her when she was depressed last year and now it feels like that all she cared for was her own happiness, something she learned while she was getting professional help I think. 

I'd love to chug down a bottle of bleach when I'm at my father's place, but I won't be able to, I'm sure. I want to be with her, and I'm starting to realise that will never happen again no matter how much I want it to work out. It's like she doesn't care about me anymore, as if she's going to be in another (her second) relationship in about a week. probably just something I'm forcing myself to believe to make me feel better about the fact that we just broke up. 

I wish I wasn't here anymore. better yet, I wish I was someone else, anyone.
