Why not get it over with?So I've been very depressed for a long time now. I don't feel anything anymore I just go to school and then work everyday. On my days off I just sit on my bed and go on my computer I don't really talk to my friends anymore I tend to just distance myself from them  I'm a senior in high school I'm working about 35 hours a week of all for more time of but I feel like I need to prove myself that I can handle all of this but I can't anymore I just can't feel close to anyone even if I want to and I just can't open up with people. I'm a smart kid but really do not have anything to live for nothing to look forward to Ive considered suicide for awhile now why shouldn't I just get this all over with?
Sorry for the wall of text in there and any typos
