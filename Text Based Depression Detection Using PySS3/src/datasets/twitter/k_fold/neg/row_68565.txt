Don't see a point in going on anymoreWoah...so this isn't easy seeing as how I'm a very private person. But I just don't think I can handle life anymore, I'm not cut out for it...just to give you a rundown I'm 23 and spend 24 hours a day in my room and rarely leave it. I drink and use drugs on a daily basis to stop myself from going crazy because I have nobody else but myself to talk to. I have no friends. I keep hearing and seeing all these things talking about how life is precious but it just seems like nobody gives a shit about mine, nobody is calling me, checking up on me to see if I'm okay...I dont mean shit to anyone...and I'm just so tired of doing this
