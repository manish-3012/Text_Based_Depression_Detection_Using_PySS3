I keep forgetting why I tryI try. I tried. And then I forget why. I'm tired. I want to stop. I want this to end. I'm so sick of this. I don't know why I keep trying to make my life better when I know that at the end of every day, all I can think of is how I should kill myself. I've come up with a pretty solid plan, imo. I just need to set it in action.
