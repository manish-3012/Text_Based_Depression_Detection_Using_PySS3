I'm not meant for hereThere's too much wrong with me for me to feel like i should be here. I'm short, unnatractive, needy. I have no self confidence, I was laughed at by girls for my appearance. I just feel dead, like an outline of myself walking. I don't have any substance, I hate myself, I hate that I lost the genetic lottery. 

I don't want to be here anymore, I don't belong.
