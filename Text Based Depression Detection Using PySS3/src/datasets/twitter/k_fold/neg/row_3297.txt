Why would anyone take me seriously, when I'm still alive?I've often reached the point of what I thought was no return, I've had a lot of breakdowns. Some a lot more visible than others to those around me. But I've realised that because of that when I cry out for help no one cares, because it's just ''another suicidal day'' and  ''I'll eventually get over it.''

The fact I'm still alive is a problem because my feeling's don't matter to people hearing what I'm saying, because they've heard it a hundred times before. Pherhaps this time will be different, and pherhaps it won't. Pherhaps I will kill myself, or maybe I'll admit once again I'm a coward who won't go through with it and I'll look like ''an attention seeker, who can't control his emotions.''

Or maybe I'll finally do it. It will be a relief for everyone that I'm finally gone and I'll no longer be able to poison other's with my ''negativity and drama.''

A part of me really wants someone to talk me into doing it. Are my feelings any less valid because I've managed to get to this point a hundred times before? Or is this time worse, but just less visible?
