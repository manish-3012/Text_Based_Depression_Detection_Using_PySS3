Trying to get my life together M (20)I am very sensitive person who like to drink. I know thats not good combination but I can't help myself it makes my loneliness go away in some point but when I drink too much I just uncontrollably cry until I pass out. I am orphan so my parents can't help. I had once girl who was like angel to me , but she cheated on me , I found out because one of my few friends who told me then I just took my car and wanted to just drive straight in full speed in tree, but something in my mind stoped me , so I just wrecked my car and survived.
After the crash I just feel blank like nothing could fullfill my emptyness in me, everyday is same for me , trying not overthink which is worst for me.
Please if some good soul could help me, I very appreciated..
