Mom has been abusive lately...I'm a 19 year old female that has been enduring a lot of abuse from my mom as of late... She keeps yelling at me for pointless crap and calling me "sensitive" whenever I start to cry or try to tell her how I have been feeling lately... She always complains about my stuff being everywere (even though I pay for rent and most of utilities.) And complains about the "mess" even though it's nothing to freak out about... I really am starting not to care about what happens to me anymore... I want to end it all so I can just... not suffer anymore...
