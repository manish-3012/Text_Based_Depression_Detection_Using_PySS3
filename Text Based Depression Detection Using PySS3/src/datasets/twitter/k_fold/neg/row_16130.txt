I want to die and at the same time wrap my whole life aroundThe title says everything. So basically I really want to change my life, get a makeover, buy new clothes, finally get the discipline to fulfill my dream to study music. But on the other side, i simply want to die. I  could save myself from all the pain, torture and stuff life. Since my girlfriend left me, all my problems started to pop up again. I cant do this anymore.
