Pull the plug alreadyI'm really doing everything I can to be better--I quit my drug of choice six months ago, I'm sleeping regular hours, going to the gym, not restricting my eating, going back to school. I still feel so much constant pain and self hatred and heart-in-my-throat anxiety.... everyone says these cliches like "you're doing all the right things, everything's going to get better" or "you're so young, years from now you're gonna look back on this phase of your life and laugh" or "you're more resilient than you realize" yet they don't have to constantly be suffering through the torture of just existing, constantly telling themselves "just a little longer, just survive five more minutes, just another couple of seconds" every minute of the day, every day, until god knows when? I'm so angry at myself for the way my mental illness still shapes my behavior. I'm so so angry at everyone who cares and is trying to help because it feels like their fault I'm being kept alive right now, not for myself for some idea of a future or potential. I'm so cynical that there's anything anyone could say to shift how I feel
