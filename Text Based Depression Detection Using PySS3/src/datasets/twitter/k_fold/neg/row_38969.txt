So lonely I just want to dieI have no one and I just want a friend to help distract me from all of this. My living situation is not the best and I just feel like a failure in every sense of the word especially with my dead social life. I could use some friends, talk to me about anything, please...

Sometimes I just wish I was already old enough to purchase a gun. Where I am I could do so easily if I was the appropriate age. I've tried to hang myself with a belt before, similar to what Robin Williams did, but I just couldn't go through with it. I'm scared of a painful death, so essentially I'm just forced to exist until I can get my hands on a shotgun and end my misery permanently. Therapists are useless.
