Iâ€™ve been stuck in this cycle for almost half my life.9 years. 9 fucking years. Every time I see a glimpse of hope? Shot down. Destroyed. Not a trace left. I have no one to help me. Not the way I need to be helped. 
The 6 months I was able to live on my own in university dorms were what made me realize Iâ€™d never be able to get better living with my mom and brothers. We bring out the worst in each other. I absorb all their problems like a sponge leaving me crippled because my brain is overwhelmed. I need to find a job so I can get out. But itâ€™s so damn difficult to get a job unless Iâ€™m already out. Maybe Iâ€™m just a whiny self-absorbed loser. 
My dad could help me but he doesnâ€™t understand. â€œJust go out and get a job,â€ he says. â€œIâ€™ll help you once you have money.â€ I wish I were that simple minded. 
Thereâ€™s just so... so so much. Too much. Iâ€™m stuck in my own head. I canâ€™t get out. My own body is my worst enemy. How do I escape that? I canâ€™t. I have to learn how to cope. But I donâ€™t have the energy. Once every two or three weeks Iâ€™ll wake up feeling amazing and hopeful and motivated. Usually lasts for two days. Then I sink.. and sink.. and sink. It seems so simple. Get dressed. Walk to a couple places nearby. Make some calls. Even applying online ffs. So why canâ€™t I do it? Why wonâ€™t I do it? 
I hate myself. And I hate myself for hating myself. I hate everyone. And I hate myself for hating everyone. So why bother. Everything ends in death anyways. But I donâ€™t have the guts to end it with what I have. I could try to find enough money for something easier to use. But will I even have the energy to get anything? Tune in next time.
