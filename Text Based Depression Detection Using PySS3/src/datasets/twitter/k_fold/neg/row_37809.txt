I'm a huge loser and I think it's over25 y.o, recent graduate (this month) with a useless degree in anthropology (2.8gpa) from UofT, I have $400 to my name and am paying over $500 in rent a month and am likely not going to be able to meet this months rent unless I can find a paying job in the next 2-3 weeks. I have a shitty job resume and haven't worked in 3 years, and all my work is heavy labour so I can't make headway into anything with my degree because 100 people apply for every position and my resume is not able to compete. I live in Toronto.

I feel like shit, have no friends, never had a girlfriend and am completely overwhelmed by the stress of getting a job. Basically my entire life I have spent on the computer, addicted and doing nothing at all. Now I've come out of the bubble into incredible pressure with no skills whatsoever. I feel like I'll just go broke and never be able to succeed in life at all, so why not end it soon anyway? If I can't find a job in the next few weeks I will - got nothing to lose, I have too big dreams to be a welfare guy everyday. 

I also can't stand working, never have been able to, don't understand why. Probably bad social skills but I always feel very anxious and attacked by people, every day when I've worked before I've been stressed out of my mind even if the job is relatively simple. No social skills, no ability to defend myself from others, too weak to assert myself.

I don't think anyone has ever made a comeback from a life this bad, even the addicts had tons of friends, I've got none. Computer addiction is fucking horrible and destroyed me, and soon it will all be at an end.
