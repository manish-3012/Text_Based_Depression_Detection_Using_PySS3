Financially destroyed, getting evicted, burned all bridges...and one final actGetting evicted from late payment of rent, phones off, electricity close to gone, paid tomorrow but so far negative in the bank that when direct deposit hits i'll have nothing for 2 weeks. Already borrowed money from family who is tapped out. I'm married but my husband doesn't work and is disabled, although the state denied him of his disability so he's not able to bring in any money either. Fortunately, he has family that can take care of him when I'm gone.

Going to be gone in a few days. The one thing I have to redeem myself is a life insurance policy. It doesn't pay out for this kind of act, so I'll be setting this up to look like an accident.

I don't even fucking care about anything anymore.
