I canâ€™t do anything right.I was dog sitting and forgot to take the dog out to pee so it peed on my boyfriends carpet. We live together so everything in it he bought. I cleaned the piss. Iâ€™m getting the dogâ€™s stuff ready. The dogâ€™s asleep. I open the front door to throw some trash, the dog bolts out the door. Iâ€™m fucked. Luckily a man was washing his car outside and caught him. The dog kept biting me as I was trying to calm him. My boyfriendâ€™s pissed cause now the rug rippled cause I didnâ€™t get all of the water out. I offer to help he says no a million times. Iâ€™m in the bathroom crying my eyes out, staring at my cutting scar from last time. I donâ€™t want to cut myself but I wish there was a way to hurt myself without any evidence. Fucking impossible. I canâ€™t do shit right. Day after day. Iâ€™m too embarrassed.
