I can't stop thinking there is a way outI really have no one. No friendships, my family doesn't really care about me either. I keep feeling like everything is not going to get better. The only person I cared about was my now ex girlfriend. She cheated on me, four years of a relationship for nothing. I really don't want to live in this reality anymore.
