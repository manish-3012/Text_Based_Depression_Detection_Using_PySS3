Plan, Execute, Bleedout.It's bad today. There's no real reason or difference, everything environmentally is sound. It's just bad today. Even writing the word suicide gives me a jolt. I can't tell you any triggers, any lingering thoughts, nothing I'm dwelling onâ€” it's just bad today. I don't really want to kill myself on my sisters birthday. But being alive tomorrow seems like such an impossibility... it's terrible to think "My life is perfect, I've had everything with such fucking ease, and I want to die." I apologize constantly like a retard. The guilt is extreme. I don't want to ruin lives, I just don't want to live mine. I've seen four counselors, three psychiatrists, taken 5 different meds, and I just want it to be done. Just end it, please, for fucksake, end it. The voice inside my brain is fed up. Get your gun, drive out to the lake, and fire.      They tell you that if you have a plan, go to the hospital. If you have a method, go to the hospital. I don't want any more of that. I don't want any more. The greatest thing ever would be to not exist at all, so â€” for fucksake, end it.
