I just feel like I have no other optionI'm 21F close to finishing my undergrad but my health is bad and my depression is worse than ever. I just need the pain of everything to end right now, because it's not getting better and I can't cope. 
I don't know why I'm writing this, I'm past caring. 
I just need it all to end.
