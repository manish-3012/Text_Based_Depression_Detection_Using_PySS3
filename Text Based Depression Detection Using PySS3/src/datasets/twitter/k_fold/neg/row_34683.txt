Depression caused by chronic inflammation in the brain?Hi, I read an article about Depression being caused by chronic inflammation that makes its way to the brain.  If you are feeling suicidal, please take a couple NSAIDS (Advil or Aspirin) and give it a little time and see if you start feeling better.  I started doing this when I felt really bad, and I actually really think it helps.  Now I take it at the first signs (I'm sure you know what I mean, you can feel the depression creeping over you).  Also I love me some heavy weight lifting to help my mood.  Of course when you are depressed you don't want to exercise, but an easy 5 minute warm up on the treadmill gets you ready to work!  Love and peace to you, brothers and sisters!
