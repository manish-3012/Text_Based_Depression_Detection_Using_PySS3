Maybe my pain can help someoneThis is going to be quite a long post and Iâ€™m not really sure what to expect; perhaps moderation, perhaps trolls, perhaps genuine questions. Iâ€™d be amazed if anyone ends up reading it from start to finish but here goes. I should probably also say that some of the details in here might be particularly difficult for some people to read, especially if youâ€™ve thought about suicide before. 

Around six months ago (six months and ten days to be precise) me and my ex-girlfriend broke up. The decision was pretty mutual at the time, weâ€™d both been unhappy for a while but within a pretty short period I had changed my mind and didnâ€™t want to do it anymore; unfortunately, that change was one-sided and as of today weâ€™re not together. For the first month or so after the break up I tried to keep in mind that we would end up speaking again and I was optimistic that the time apart; some contrition for mistakes I had made; and my ideas on how to fix the problems that had led us to that point, would get us back together. A couple of days before the first time we saw each other after the break up I started asking myself the question of what I would do if I couldnâ€™t rectify the situation and in jest my answer was always â€˜probably kill myselfâ€™. At the time I didnâ€™t take it seriously, I knew I was joking, but in hindsight I think it was the beginning of a kind of desensitisation to the idea of causing my own death. Iâ€™m sure anyone reading this can imagine the idea of killing themselves but itâ€™s probably quite uncomfortable, I didnâ€™t really feel anything. 

The first time we met things went really badly, it was probably too soon. At the end of the conversation I found myself stood by the side of a road, unable to stop crying or control my breathing. The only thing I could think at the time was that I had to make the feeling stop. I saw a bus coming and decided I would step in front of it, once I made the decision I was able to get some kind of control over my breathing and I was crying a bit less. I stepped to the edge of the road but the bus went around the corner. Iâ€™d found myself in a position with no optimism that we would work things out and at that point in time nothing else seemed important or even worth living for. We ended up speaking again over text that night and I got some hope back that there was still a chance we could actually fix things. That feeling carried on for the next couple of weeks but in the back of my mind I kept thinking that if things couldnâ€™t be resolved I was going to follow through and kill myself. A week and a half before Christmas 2019 we spoke again and my hopes were dashed, I was sure there was nothing that could be done. Again, I found myself unable to stop crying and barely able to breath, this time I happened to be a couple of hundred metres away from a river. Again, once I had decided that I was going to jump in I was able to get more control back over myself. A combination of the design of the railing, people constantly passing, and my lack of strength from not eating for three days prevented me from jumping in. Before I tried to climb over I sent her a goodbye text and because I wasnâ€™t able to get over the railing that ended up developing into more of a conversation. She knew what I was trying to do and was trying to change my mind. I decided to listen and give her a chance, if anyone could stop me she would be the only person. Nothing she said changed my mind and after hanging up the phone I decided to do everything I could to make myself as cold as possible and then fall asleep, I hoped I just wouldnâ€™t wake up. The fact that Iâ€™m typing this means that things didnâ€™t go to plan. 

We spoke again just before Christmas and agreed that we would meet up and see what happened. She told me how worried sheâ€™d been all week about me and I convinced her that it had all been a moment of madness and it wasnâ€™t something I could really have done or would ever do. I didnâ€™t mean any of that but my mindset had completely shifted: in the beginning I was concerned with what would make me happy and so I wanted to get her back at any cost. Thatâ€™s not to say my intent to kill myself that night was insincere, but once things started happening I think part of me was hoping sheâ€™d give things another try, if for no other reason than to save my life. I realised after a week of thinking about virtually nothing else that I couldnâ€™t claim to love someone if thatâ€™s what I was doing. I realised that her happiness was what was most important to me and part of that hinged on her not having to worry about me.

We ended up seeing each other almost every weekend for the first couple of months of this year. There were so many moments where things were good and I was optimistic that we were moving in the right direction. A couple of weekends in a row she cancelled our plans at the last minute and after the second one I called and asked what was really going on. She said that after seeing me she ended up feeling crap for a couple of days so I said that I would leave her alone and we didnâ€™t have to do it anymore. Midway through the conversation I could feel the crying and breathing problems coming on again so I just hung up the phone. At that point I was again certain that there was nothing I could do and again started planning how, when, and where I would kill myself. That was derailed by her texting me half an hour later asking if we could talk again in a few weeks. 

At that point none of my friends or family knew how bad things had gotten. It was just after that that I first told a few friends how I had been feeling and eventually told them that it had gone beyond just thinking about suicide. I had also been speaking to a counsellor for a few weeks by that point but largely due to fear of being locked up I hadnâ€™t been completely honest about how far my suicidal ideation had gone. 

I also hadnâ€™t told anyone at work, my manager knew I was having some personal issues and that I was having counselling sessions but the true extent of the issue was never something I made clear. To make matters worse I had started this job four days before the aforementioned bus incident. Iâ€™ve found it very difficult to concentrate on work when Iâ€™m consumed with the idea of killing myself, employment seems fairly unimportant if youâ€™re going to die soon. I had been preforming so badly at work that I reached a point where I decided I would have to tell someone how bad things were or just resign. Since opening up about it at work I have had a lot of support and theyâ€™ve offered to make any reasonable adjustments possible. I suppose this is a positive; I had been thinking it wouldnâ€™t be very helpful if the relationship was mended but then I found myself unemployed and no longer suicidal. 

Since I last spoke to my ex I have made two plans to kill myself but for one reason or another neither of them came to fruition. As things stand Iâ€™ve proposed to my ex that we meet up and speak once this Covid drama has passed and lockdown rules are eased, given that that may not be any time soon I told her not to feel rushed into deciding either way. I still feel much the same, if there is no hope of this moving forward then I need to remove myself from her life, the only way I think I can do that is by killing myself. 

I suppose the purpose of this is partly for me to just write everything out but I also feel like it could be good for anyone who is curious to know what it feels like to be in a suicidal state of mind to be able to ask questions. Above all I want to be able to answer questions because whenever Iâ€™ve watched videos or listened to advice out there about how deal with suicidal thoughts Iâ€™ve found that it doesnâ€™t really resonate with me, the way a lot of the people in TedTalks seem to have felt doesnâ€™t match up with me. Initially this made me feel even weirder and, although I donâ€™t hold out much hope for myself, I want to be able to help someone else who may also feel like their feelings exist outside of the â€˜typicalâ€™ suicidal narrative.  

Below Iâ€™ll try and explain a bit more about my thoughts and maybe answer some questions or comments before anyone raises them. 

Iâ€™ve had symptoms of depression for as long as I can remember but Iâ€™ve always managed to stay on top of things until now. I had never considered suicide until recently and I donâ€™t know anyone who has killed themselves. 

Iâ€™m sure people will tell me that I need to cut her out of my life completely and start moving on, this is the advice everyone I know has given me. The problem with this is the only times over the past six months that I havenâ€™t wanted to kill myself or wished I was dead were times when I was feeling optimistic that we had a chance. Completely cutting her out would mean that I have no optimism and therefore no reason not to kill myself. 

I recognise that this kind of feeling of dependency is not a healthy basis for a relationship, my counsellor explains it as: life should be like the bottom of a boat, they have compartments (analogous to different interests in life like friendships, career, family, hobbies, etc.) and if one floods the whole boat doesnâ€™t sink because the other compartments are fine. To continue that analogy, I feel as though my compartments arenâ€™t separated very well and when one flooded it spilled into all of the others, to build up the separation I need to drain the flood and then start work. That might make no sense to anyone so in plain terms I feel as though I need the relationship back to give me the motivation to start putting a safety net of sorts in place so should we break up again I donâ€™t find myself back here. Ideally, weâ€™d get back together and not break up but I recognise itâ€™s definitely a possibility. 

For the first few months I kept it all to myself but more recently I have told friends, been speaking to a counsellor, told a few people at work and I have recently been referred to a psychiatrist. I also have a million different cards with crisis helplines on so thereâ€™s no shortage of people for me to speak to. 

Contrary to how it may seem Iâ€™m really not a sensitive person so donâ€™t feel like you need to sugar-coat any questions or advice.
