Least Painful Method. Hi everyone in the sub Reddit community of Suicide Watch, I just needed to ask a very brief question. Would a gunshot to the Cerebrum actually be a painless method for suicide indeed? The reason I ask is because the Cerebrum covers 2/3 of the brain and if I am able to shoot it directly then death would be quicker, and it would quickly shut down the bodily functioning of my organs. I know that it would not be an instantaneous death, but I just wanted to know, based on your opinions of course, if it would actually be felt as a painless and quick death.
I have a plan set out with diagrams, a handpicked discrete location, timing calculations of when I will proceed with each plan, what intoxicated substance I will consume prior to my self execution to have total numbness of pain, and so forth. I ask here because this community is mostly affiliated with these kind of encounters and more affiliated with the knowledge of such methods; either personally or just well informed.
Now, I know that many individuals here will not take kindly to this post and will surely attempt to talk me out of this, but I am begging you and asking you kindly to just answer with the utmost honesty. My life is terrible, and after reevaluating my life, it will definitely not get better. Also, I truly despise the world we live in due to what the human inhabitants have done to it. So, it's an external and internal type of conflict.
All I need is the main component to my suicide, which is the handgun. i specifically want to utilize the Glock 17, 18, or 19 since it's the most safest handgun. I hope I get high caliber bullets as well. I'll see for myself. Statistically, after my own research and review of my planning I'd say that I have a 90% chance of this being a successful suicide. I can't underestimate the 10 percent of odds though, those are still big risks. So, fellow reddit community, I beg you to just answer with your own opinions and knowledge so that I can be of peace at last.
