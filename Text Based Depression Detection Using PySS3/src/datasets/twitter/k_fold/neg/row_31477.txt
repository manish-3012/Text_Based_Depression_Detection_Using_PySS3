Since were all here to go, imma say goodbye as well. Fuck god, fuck life, and fuck this world...Reddit has been one of the only things that has kept me going in years. But in the end, its still just people spread out across the world talking over computers. No human to human contact or talking.  Ive been told i have a great future in music, I'm healthy, good looking, good family, good job, last semester of school, but this life doesn't make me happy.  Seeing ppl get killed everyday, wives cheating on their husbands when they are over seas. God isn't real and doesn't give two shits about us if he did.  We are not significant. I am not significant. I was a mistake from two ppl fucking like people do.  Hey lets go out to the bar in our best dressed and fuck some hot girl so we can all just have fun, but then have a baby and decided not to give two shits.  This world does has so much to offer, but it has a lot that it can take from you as well.  I hate myself. I beat my face sometimes because thats how bad i hate who i am.  I am so talented and smart and I've kept trying to continue to go, but it is never that easy. Fuck god, fuck family, fuck friends, and fuck life.  Im done with all this. I hate who i am and I am finally going to end it.  I just want someone to read this and at least acknowledge that i was alive.  I really hope reddit continues to help others as it did me, but somethings things just are not enough.  Im done with this world and the shit ass people who dwell in it.  Fuck you god, i didn't ask to be here.  This will be the last time i ever type something. Im sorry reddit, thank you for always being there for me! I love you guys....
