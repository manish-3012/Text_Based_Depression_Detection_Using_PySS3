Reasons I don't want to live anymore- I find no pleasure in anything anymore.
- I don't want to talk to or see anyone.
- I'm becoming a huge burden on my family. (This is one is huge. I can see the pain I cause them. They think I should just be able to snap out of it. I also am causing them a huge financial burden since I'm unable to hold down a job.)
- I feel worthless.
- I don't feel like there's no purpose for me living my life anymore. 
- Everyday I wake up with dread and anxiety for another day.
- I feel disconnected from everything and everyone.
- I feel very isolated even when surrounded by people.
- Everyone is in it for themselves at the end of the day. We are born and die alone. I just want to speed up the inevitable.

The only stipulation to suicide is knowing how bad it would hurt my family... But, if my family knew how much pain I was in, wouldn't they want me to just end it knowing I'd be happier dead? They don't want to take care of me for the rest of their life either.
