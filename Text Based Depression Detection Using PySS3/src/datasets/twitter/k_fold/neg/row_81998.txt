It's a lot to think aboutI'm not sure what going on with me. I've been feeling really great recently. There have even been moments where the world makes sense and I feel like I have purpose. But in all that I really just want to throw in the towel and disappear. I don't even think I want to die, but I'm just not interested in living. There's so many reasons to keep going but I don't particularly care. I'm okay with my experiences so far. I don't really have interest in experiencing more out of life. I feel so beat down and tired and I'm just tired of trying anymore.
