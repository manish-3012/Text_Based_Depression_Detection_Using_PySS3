I donâ€™t wanna fight anymoreI am so on edge, I donâ€™t know if i can kill myself i feel too scared but i just want to disappear from everyoneâ€™s brains. I feel like a monster i know no one wants me anymore but it hurts so badly i donâ€™t wanna accept it. I love my boyfriend but i feel like he isnâ€™t in love with me anymore sometimes. my life has been not the best (tw) iâ€™ve been though csa and have a lot of really bad ptsd. I feel like it made me into a horrible unloveable person. I just wanna die but iâ€™m too cowardly. I just wish i could restart with my boyfriend because iâ€™ve ruined everything. But iâ€™m no one without him. Iâ€™m horrible and worthless No one wants me. Iâ€™m not a damsel in Distress trauma victim like everyone expects me to be so they can come and save me.iâ€™m a nightmare and i just wish i was normal  I know i canâ€™t do i just want to die
