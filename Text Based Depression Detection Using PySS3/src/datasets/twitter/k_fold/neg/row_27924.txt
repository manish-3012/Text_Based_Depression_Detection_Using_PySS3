Figuring out the right thing to dlI have felt like this is the avenue I want to take for many years now. I guess I am a skeptical person by nature, which is why I feel like maybe it's not the right decision. Of course, the only people who think it isn't are the ones who are alive themselves, so there's a bit of a bias there. I  am asking for help in figuring out what I should do. It was thanks to posting on several subreddits that I was able to discover a place that tells you the way to end your life peacefully. I now know the method, so it's just a question of going through with it.
