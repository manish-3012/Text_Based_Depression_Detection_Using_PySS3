I want to die and live out the rest of my existence as a ghost but I'm too much of a coward to kill myself and I want to be killed by my best friendSo I have an unknown brain illness that is causing me to have hallucinations 24/7 and I've had this for years and its getting worse and its making me depressed as even anti schizophrenia drugs don't work. I'm addicted to many kinds of controlled class prescription sedatives to make the hallucinations weaker just so I can sleep and relax for a few minutes. I'm constantly irritable, depressed and angry.

I recently read about a young man who was taken to a secluded area by his friend, and his friend randomly murdered him.

He was murdered by a friend. I kind of wish my best friend would take me to a secluded place, and kill me too. I legit got upset and cried after reading about the case because that man is dead and free and I don't understand why that can't happen to me. I want to live out the rest of my existence as a ghost and because ghosts aren't physical I won't be having hallucinations anymore since I wouldn't have a brain anymore.
