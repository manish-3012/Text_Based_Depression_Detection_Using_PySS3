I hate my birthdayTW: I'm a vulgar person.

The whole damn month and September too. I hate my mom asking me what I want to do for it every year. Like I can respond with anything. I really want a party. With friends. There's the fucking caveat. Cake is easy. Friends are impossible when you've moved across the damn country your entire childhood.

How can I say that the only thing I want is friends? To be in a group and not become the third wheel that gets dumped off at some point. There's no store for that.

Im so alone. It's been years since I've had anyone even give a shit about me and my birthday is a rude reminder every year. 

 Getting that happy birthday text from my sister sucks. Scrolling up four messages and seeing the same message from last year and the year before that is depressing as hell. 

Every year I start making plans to kill myself but I never do it.  I don't want to be another year older. Have to embrace another year of failure. Another year of anxiety about life and the obviously worsening global climate, both literal climate and political. 

I don't see anybody wanting to be with me and that's honestly a good thing. I'm a 25 year old pessimistic shut-in that cuts herself. Darwin has a theory about me.
