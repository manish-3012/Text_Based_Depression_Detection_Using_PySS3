I dont think ill ever be happy again. Ever.I have absolutely no will to live anymore and I don't even know why I'm holding on still. Like I genuinely don't want to be here anymore and somehow I'm okay with it. I don't want to do life or anything like that. I'm sick of everything and everyone and how I sad I am about literally the dumbest shit. I have no will to continue and I think it's time to just end it. I've always wondered when I'd reach that point where I ACTUALLY didn't want to live anymore and I think I'm there. I don't want to exist pathetically anymore like I'm really tired of it. I've been waiting for things to get better since as long as I can remember and it never has. It's only gotten worse. Nothing means anything to me anymore. I'm actually really happy that I have no will to live anymore because now I can end it without hesitation. Anyways. I don't know why I'm posting here... Lol. Deuces âœŒï¸
