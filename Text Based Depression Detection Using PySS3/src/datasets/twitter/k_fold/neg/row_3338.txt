I really want to die, but my last attempt was in october and I want to give my family time to process it better.I really want to die, living feels so wrong, and I'm sure I'll never be satisfied with my life, no matter how much I try. I'm on medication, I go to therapy, I speak 3 languages and study two careers at the same time, and yet, I feel I'm the most stupid and useless person that has ever existed. I have friends and still feel lonely, people think I'm pretty and I can't even look at myself without crying my eyes out. I barely eat and take showers anymore, I'm not taking care of myself at all. I don't deserve to be alive, and I don't want to anyway, I'm disgusting, ungrateful and the worst person that has ever existed. I've trying to make a plan where my suicide seems like an accident, my last attempt was on october, and I don't want to make my parents and sister go through that experience again. Also, I would love to self harm rn, but I promised my mom I wouldn't do it anymore, I've been clean for two months, but it doesn't seem worth it. I don't know what to do.
