I want to dieUsed to get through things day by day, usually by playing games with people I came to think of as friends. Now I can't cos I got banned from the community I'd been apart of for nearly two years all because I broke an unspoken rule I had no idea existed, now the thoughts I had before are back and I just want it all to end, I want to just not exist anymore. I get no enjoyment from things I used to love doing, I have no IRL friends and the ones I do have that aren't apart of that community i'm not even 100% sure they are my friends. And I'm not even sure my family likes or loves me cos I feel worthless. Even typing this has me tearing up.
