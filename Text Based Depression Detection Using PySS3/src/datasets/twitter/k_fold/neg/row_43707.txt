My second failed attempt at suicide was today. Is anyone out there willing to talk to me without judgement?It's been 4 years since my first suicide attempt back in sophomore year of high school. Today I tried again, and failed. Is there anyone that will just talk to me about life and tell me there about their experiences with suicide?
