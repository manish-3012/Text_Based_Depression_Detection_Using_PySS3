Dad is acting suicidal. Idk what to do.I don't feel safe at home, so I left to a friend's house.  He has a history of being violent and has been towards me once while drunk.   I walked in on him with a loaded gun talking about how if he does I get $250k in life insurance.  I got scared for my safety and left.

I just called my friend who is a cop and knows my dad's superiors.  He's calling them to tell them what I said.  I told them to keep me out of it because I'm nervous he may try and hurt me.  I feel I made the wrong choice and should have kept my mouth shut.

What should I do at this point?  I'm definitely moving out, but idk how to do so and escape him for my safety.  I also have nowhere to go.  Can anyone offer any advice?
