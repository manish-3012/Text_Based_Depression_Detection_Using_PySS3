It's like it'll happen eventually, I know it will.I'm a trans woman, 1 year into transition, who lost their wife of 7 years (unrelated to being trans - just lost our spark), my family feels so distant, my mom - who i have to temporarily live with - is embarrassed by me, i'm failing my 2nd semester straight and I just look way to male to pass ever... I don't know.. I just don't see how I can salvage life at all. Like, every day its like I see a "dead ahead" in the most literal sense. Like me killing myself is just on the horizon, and it's a one way road to that.

I wish I had whatever tipping point I needed to just go through with it, but for some stupid fucking reason, I can't quite pull the trigger on it. I hate that I don't know what's holding me on here, and I hate waking up in the morning having to try to mark down another date on the calendar of life. I'm exhausted. I'm spent. I want to scream, I want to cry, I just want sleep.  I want this nightmare to be over.
