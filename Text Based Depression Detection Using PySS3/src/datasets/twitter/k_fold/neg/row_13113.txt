Just want to ventNot in danger of hurting myself, but struggling with suicidal ideation. And, well, I was thinking: after all I've experienced in life, I still would prefer to never have been born. And I've had some pretty fucking awesome experiences, too. 

It seems life is 40% joy and 60% heartache/pain. And when I get upset about something, even something small, I can't help but think, "just waiting to die..." and it's a huge relief to know that SOMEDAY, someday, I will die! I won't be alive! No more problems, no more worries, no more bullshit to deal with. Not having to wake up, get out of bed, do the stupid, insignificant tasks that life requires. No family, no job, no stress. Just nothingness. It sounds so goddamn awesome. 

Done venting, it feels good. Thank you for reading this. Only so many years to go and then it's over. That is what comforts me when I'm depressed.
