Cutting and numbness feeling hopelessI've been cutting sense 9th grade at first it was for attention and in the middle of my 9th grade year it became an addiction then in my 10th grade year I began to develope major depression. Know I'm in 11th grade it's just about the end of the year and it's come to the point if I cut it just becomes more numb. like it doesn't hurt when I cut anymore I use a regular scissor and then it hits me it's like a flood of pain in my wrist once I'm done. I have a counselor who's helping me but it's not helping to much and I wanna die but I don't. I feel like the wrist cutting is coming to a point of if I do it anymore I may have to go to the hospital but I can't because I have so many things to do like horseback riding which is my favorite. Someone please try and help me. ALSO ANOTHER THING! The anniversary of my kidnapping and rape story is coming up on may 1st idk what to do... I have an appointment with my counselor that day but I'm just so lost right now...
