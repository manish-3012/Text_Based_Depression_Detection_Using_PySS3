Even with therapy and medication, I want to be dead so I don't have to suffer.I'm seeing a therapist, I'm on Zoloft and Xanax, and I still want to die.  I have the means and access.  I think about it.  I think it's going to be good for me that I don't have to feel this way anymore.  My wife is supportive, my parents aren't in the picture concerning my emotional well-being, my friends are supportive, but I just want to die.  I want to end it.  I want to have no more of this.  I'm the common thread to all my problems and the one thing I haven't tried yet is removing myself from the equation.  

I don't know if I could do it but I wish I could, because even though I've done everything right both in life and in trying to be good about self-care, I just can't stop feeling like I can't do anything good in the long run, I can't help my wife through her medical situations, and I can't hold up the burden of the house nor can I ask her to help because of said medical problems.  

I can't logically think of a reason to stop myself, because what people say you're supposed to do just doesn't seem like it's working, and if I tell my therapist or psychiatrist that I'm in crisis, I'm going to have to go through all this again and I don't want to go through it anymore.
