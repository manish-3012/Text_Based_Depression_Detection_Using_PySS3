I want to die so badly but Iâ€™m being guilt tripped into stayingSo Iâ€™m currently 15 weeks pregnant and I have a 2 year old, 3 year old and 5 year old
I found out my boyfriend has been cheating on me for the past 6 months with over 30 women, they are just the ones heâ€™s admitted to so thereâ€™s probably more
So basically me, this baby and my kids mean absolutely nothing to him. I donâ€™t have anyone else so I donâ€™t mean anything to anyone else either

Iâ€™m so sick of being in pain, spending all day thinking about killing myself, wanting to just break down and not have to feel this anymore because itâ€™s exhausting and overwhelming. I canâ€™t eat or sleep anymore. I canâ€™t think of anything other than him fucking all of those people while I had miscarriages and while I bled with this baby, waiting on my own in the hospital to find out if it was still alive or not, and all he wanted to do was get his fucking dick wet

I keep replaying everything in my head and I just canâ€™t cope anymore but I know if i kill myself then my kids will suffer and I donâ€™t want to hurt them but I also donâ€™t want to be hurt either
