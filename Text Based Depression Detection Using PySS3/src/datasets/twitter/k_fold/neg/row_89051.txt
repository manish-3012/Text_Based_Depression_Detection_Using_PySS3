Should I do it?15 Year Old Male
My life is literally a pot of shit, my mom is an drunk addict who just had her car smashed during a dui, and my dad is a hard ass manager who basically only spends time ranting to me about how suicide is â€œdangerous and selfishâ€ I just was transferred to a new school where no one likes me and Iâ€™ve lost all my friends, even if the internet exists they wonâ€™t talk to me, I came out as bisexual and that made things even worse, including not making the baseball team last year when everyone told me I shouldâ€™ve made it, I feel like no one wants me to be here and Iâ€™m the reason my parents are now splitting up, should I commit suicide and just end my suffering?
