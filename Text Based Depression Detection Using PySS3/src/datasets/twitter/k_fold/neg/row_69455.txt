Does thinking a lot about suicide equates to being suicidal?I have been having a very hard time this year and I find myself thinking a lot about suicide, but not feeling suicidal per say. I already go through therapy and my therapist said it is normal to feel like that when you are depressed.

Anyone with similar experience? I am just scared it might evolve into actually making me feel suicidal
