Can I please have some non-cookie cutter tips on how to handle extreme depression.I'm not sure if I suffer from a clinical or medical form of depression but occasionally I'll just get extremely down on myself over stuff. 

But in my mind, this "stuff" is important. It's pathetic as hell but when I lose a really long game of starcraft or fuck up on a math test or whatever I just think I'm such a bad human being. There were ways I could have avoided this failure and yet I couldn't accomplish it the way  I wanted it to.

I just want to know if there are ways to deal with depression that actually work.

Everything I google is silly. "Deep breathing exercises, looking at kitties on youtube", none of this works, its all so... I don't know, obvious? Like I'm suppose to be happy because I looked at an animal that I find cute. Do you guys have any decent tips to stop being down on myself? For the most part, I actually have extremely high-self esteem, but then I swing into these depressed moods where I am the worst person ever based off one thing.

Please though, don't say "That stuff doesn't matter", because it does. Thats where It really blows, I feel like I'm justified in hating on myself because this stuff IS important to me.
