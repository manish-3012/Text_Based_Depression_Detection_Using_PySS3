just a tiny bit tired

i guess i might as well leave some sort of note behind before i do this so here we go


it started when i was about 12 years old when i got my first phone, i downloaded some stupid app called kik and to sum it up some middle aged man started asking me to send pictures and i was stupid and needy for attention i guess so of course i made my biggest life regret in my entire life now some man has hundreds of pictures and videos of me and i know the police wonâ€™t care since heâ€™s from a different country and itâ€™s not truly a huge deal i probably should of just blocked him but he could just send them to my family and friends so itâ€™s not worth it anyways


now 4 years later and i know itâ€™s dramatic to say that he ruined my childhood and life but i feel like he really did well i guess i shouldnâ€™t blame him itâ€™s not his fault if anyone messed up it was definitely me for adding to his urges 


but on the other hand he did break me emotionally by calling me so many names causing me to starve myself and have a feel attempts but itâ€™s my fault for letting those words cut too deep i guess

so iâ€™ve finally decided to report it on january 20 two days  before my birthday least i could do before i go really and then january 26 will be the day i do this and finally get some sort of peace since i obviously wonâ€™t get any here iâ€™m just honestly too tired to do this anymore so itâ€™s best i know itâ€™s selfish and all and iâ€™m pretty scared of leaving but i have no choice well i do but not any i wanna take i just wanna have some sort of peace

i only feel bad for my dogs thatâ€™s the only thing iâ€™ll miss
