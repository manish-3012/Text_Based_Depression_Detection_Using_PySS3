Iâ€™m anxious to dieA few months ago I decided I wanted to kill myself when I finished college. I realized I have no tangible dreams and I donâ€™t see a point in having kids, getting married, or living to an old age. Iâ€™ve felt pretty neutral emotionally these last few months and I realized the â€œpeaceâ€ I found is just probably depression. Since iâ€™ve decided I want to die iâ€™m just anxious for the time to come. I want to ride out these last few years, enjoy them, and be done before I have to take any accountability for my sure to be failed future. iâ€™m one of those types who has nothing to truly be depressed about and it drives me crazier- I just wish I didnâ€™t want to die so badly. 

Sometimes i want to see a  therapist but it hasnâ€™t worked out well since iâ€™ve been in college. I want to tell them this to fix it but iâ€™m nervous itâ€™ll cause more problems.
