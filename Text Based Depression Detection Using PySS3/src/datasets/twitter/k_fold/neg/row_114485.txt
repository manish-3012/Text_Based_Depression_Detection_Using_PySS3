Another impossible chance at lifeI wish I could be given the chance of another shot at my life when i leave. One without the trauma. Emotional trauma made me a miserable and stressed out child and eventually Led me to make poor choices later in life, which made me the pathetic excuse of an adult that I am today. I was never confident enough to form a stable sense of identity either (also due to BPD). I canâ€™t help but feel like the potential I had has been wasted due to unfortunate circumstances and mean adults around me. These thoughts torture me every day.
