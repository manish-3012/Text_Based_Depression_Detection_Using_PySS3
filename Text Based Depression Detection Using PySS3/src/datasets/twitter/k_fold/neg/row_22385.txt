I need advice on the right thing to doI've been suicidal before. I know the drill. I know what to do. I know how to get to the psych ER.
But...
This time, I actually started writing a suicide note (1 out of 5 I want to write). Didn't finish it. I'm trying to tell myself that if I don't finish it, I won't do it.
But I'm terrified of this sense of calm. I keep thinking about spending x good days doing things I love before killing myself and it makes me... calm. Almost happy. And that's really scary.
I could go to the psych ER. I probably should. But I don't want to, and not because I don't want help. But I'm supposed to see my best friend on Monday, who I haven't seen since quarantine began; my partner on Tuesday, who I haven't seen since early May; and my brother's birthday is on Saturday and I want to spend it with him. Basically, there are all these great things coming up next week and I don't want to miss them by being in the psych ward.
I'm also scared that after a week of great days - exactly what I want before killing myself - the desire to do it will only be stronger.
Idk what to do.

P.S.: If I don't reply for a couple of hours, I probably fell asleep; I'm not killing myself tonight.
