I want to dieIts too much. My girlfriend broke up with me, and she told me that everything shes ever told me was a lie, and I did nothing to hurt her. I even asked her why, and she said that she was worried that I would break her heart in the future, and she just dismissed my feelings entirely. Now im just here, listening to a depressing song that reminds me of her. And my jacket still smells like her, and I just miss her so much. I had our whole future planned out in my head. Now Im just here, crying. My sister sprained her ankle not to long ago, and they prescribed her some Ibuprofen, and she didnt take any of it, so I wanted to down that to numb the pain and die, and now Im scared. I dont want to die. Somebody help, please. Im scared. What do I do? I dont want to let go, and I dont want to die. Im scared.
