I don't know.My father was abusive. He kept a wooden stick on the windowsill of the bedroom my brother and I shared. He'd use it if we ever acted out, along with yelling at us constantly and putting us down. My older brother handled it better than I did. I hated my father. He put on a show for everyone. Get some guests in the house and suddenly he's caring and loving and wouldn't *ever* touch us. I wasn't very social in school, I didn't really have *any* friends there back then, so I didn't really have anyone to go to about it.

He beat my mother too. He would get angry for such minor things, and stay angry at her for weeks. Sometimes there were a few months of peace, but he'd always find something.

When I was around eight he stole some money from my mom's boss and left the country. He left us with a shitload of crap to deal with, but at least he was gone.

Skip forward a few years, and here I am, 15, two months away from my birthday, thinking about killing myself. In January the girl I've liked for over a year started going out with my former best friend. At the time, I hadn't been able to sleep since around New Year's. I couldn't explain it, I just suddenly felt like I wouldn't be able to sleep again if I tried. As soon as I got into bed I would feel intense anxiety, my heart would start beating quickly, I'd start sweating, and I couldn't do anything about it. I feel like I haven't got anyone right now. I know my problems right now are trivial compared to a lot of peoples but I still feel like I cannot handle it anymore. I don't have the will to speak to anyone, go out with my friends, do anything.
