My storyI need to tell someone the whole story, and get this off my chest.

About 4 months ago I was planing a suicide, and decided to try to get some help. I decided to use the Nami text line to talk to someone. I started to tell them how l was feeling suicidal. As the conversation started I got panicked and turn off my phone. Five minutes later the cops showed up because they pinged my phone. (At this point I haven't told my parents or my siblings what was going on, and this was at 10:30pm on a school day.)

Then the cops put me into a ambulance,  (at this point I was sick and had no idea what was happening and was crying.) Then to make it worse the paramedic was someone I knew. So that just made me even more ashamed. 

When I arrived at the hospital they had to take my blood, and I HATE needles, so I was screaming at the nurses. They made someone watch me at all times, even when using the bathroom. Also my mom was sitting next to me crying.

Never the less it took six hours to get transferred to inpatient.
