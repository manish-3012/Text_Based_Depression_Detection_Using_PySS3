I wish i could just hibernate throughout the whole holiday seasonI hate christmas and thanksgiving. The only reason i stick around for them is for the time off of school. I hate to sound like an edgy lil teen but I hate literally everything in winter. I hate thanksgiving. I hate christmas. I hate new years. I hate my birthday. I just wish i could go to sleep and wake up in march. Fuck the holidays. Christmas music and all the stupid fucking commercials make me want to blow my brains out. Christmas doesnâ€™t mean anything to me but midterms and depression. Can I just cancel them or something?
