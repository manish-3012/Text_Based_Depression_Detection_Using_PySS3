Tonight is the night.I have told my story on this sub hundreds of times. My younger brother killed himself, my life has spiraled out of control, and the only person that kept me grounded broke up with me and fucked someone a week later.

I tried to give every family member a good last few memories with me, even my ex. But I'm not coming home for Christmas. I want to just say, I feel fucking horrible, but I need to. I get out at 6 and I just keep thinking about how fucking bad I want this. The holidays were already hard enough, but once she told me what happened, I knew what I had to do. I can't get over her no matter how hard I try. I got to accomplish one last thing, being accepted as a transfer student at the same college that she goes to.
