I feel like everyone pushes me into doing it.Hello. My name is Flor , im 23 years old, depressed since I was 15, I tried to kill myself when I was 18. And now I think it's finally it.
My dad has always been verbally and sometimes physically abusive towards me, I was bullied in high school heavily.
My cousin died when they tried to steal his motorcycle 2 years ago, and I've always thought I should have died instead of him.
Everyday I'm getting more fearless , and not in the good way, I'm less scared of cutting myself, of just finally doing it.
I want to die.
I can't stay here anymore, people keep hurting me, specially my dad. My mom is never going to divorce his ass, and my depression is so bad I won't achieve anything in this life.
I saw my nephew , my cousin's son , today. And he's so precious. I just cant believe my cousin died and I didn't.i just. I wish it had been me.
I want to end this .
