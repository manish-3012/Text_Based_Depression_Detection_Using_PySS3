A series of journal entries.Hey guys! This will be my first post here, and it's gonna be a long post, but I'll make it as entertaining as possible (which is kind of ironic given the subject matter). I'm also trying out another way of writing in a journal-like style. But anyways, here we go!

First let me introduce myself.

I'm a girl who's lived a relatively happy life and hopefully has a lot to look forward to. I haven't had the best life but I know there are others who have it worse. I come from a Christian family and I'm a first generation American-born citizen. I go to a pretty nice school in sunny Arizona and do pretty well in it, and while there's practically no physical bullying, the academic courseload can be rigorous at times. I think I'm a good daughter, I do my homework, I stay out of trouble, but I'm not perfect. I argue and fight sometimes.

When I was little, I never understood how my mum could be so loving one moment and scary another moment. We celebrated birthdays and went to theme parks and such when she was in a good mood, but something was always off. When she got angry, she told me things like "If you're not happy with your life, kill yourself" and "I'd rather go to jail than take care of you" and "I wish I never had you." I knew I wasn't the worst daughter and I didn't deserve to be told these things, but whenever she'd tell me these things a part of me would want to cease to exist. It was as if I had two very different mums.

I first realized that when we were going to church on Christmas. I was too young to really understand, but I she somehow got the notion that it was my fault we were going to be late to church, and I don't remember much other than her being really angry and hitting me (not hard enough to leave a mark though). It was strange to think that my Christian mum would go against what I percieved as the church's teaching's and hit me for practically no reason. From this moment, I began to question my faith and family.

My first thoughts of suicide came a few years later. Sometime's we'd get into arguments over practically nothing (forgetting things, having bad handwriting, not putting the piano bench back in all the way) but after a while both of us would seem to forget about them. She threatened me with a knife on multiple occassions, one of them being specifically an argument over me not understanding a math concept. My older sister laughed when she threatened me, and her laughter really hurt. A lot. My mum and my sister didn't know I was suicidal yet. No one knew but me and maybe God. I thought God would take me if I asked him, and after I fell asleep I woke up a bit dissapointed. I kept these dark thoughts burried deep within me.

-

I started cutting and no one knew for a while. My mum saw scratches on my legs and was convinced I was being bullied and wasn't telling her. I didn't cut because I wanted attention. I did it because it became somewhat therapeutic in a way. After a few cuts I'd calm down and my tears would come to a halt.

A year after that things were well and happy again. I virtually had no problems for a few months. We laughed and joked together. We hugged. She told me how much she loves me. I wish it could always stay that way.

-

I ran away once. I didn't want to but my mum told me to get out of the house. So I did. I only walked to the park, and after an hour or so my sister found me. She was pissed and my mum was too. Why was it my fault when she was the one that told me to get out? She never apologized and justified herself explaining that it was to keep her from doing things. That was the only time I ran away.

-

My mum drove out one time, and I thought she was gonna kill herself. That's what she said anyway. She yelled over and over, "I just wanna kill myself" and I didn't know what to think when she went out the garage. My sister acted like nothing happened but I could feel her anger. I could feel her blaming me and I wanted to die too. I never really emotionally recovered. All this over an argument started over my bad handwriting.

-

My cutting was finally discovered. I forgot about the scars on my legs and put on some shorts. My mum was upset, and for once I felt that she was starting to care about my mental health. But she never really addressed the problem. She told my sister, and my sister, who rarely cries, cried. They made me promise not to do it again and I tried so hard to keep that promise.

-

I lost it. I couldn't help but cut myself again. All of the negative experiences built up and up until I could contain them no longer. My mum was furious and threatened to drag me to the police station (which I thought was pointless). We finally seeked help at a psychiatrist's.

-

I didn't want to see the psychiatrist but I wanted to get better. I asked my mum how much money she was spending and she told me not to worry about it. I wish it'd actually helped. I wanted them to actually break it to my family that I had depression but they never directly said it. I wish I had some anti-depressants, even if it was placebo. Talking to the psychiatrist helped a little, but it got repetitive and pointless. I hated waking up earlier to go to appointments first then to school. I finally told a friend a bit about my situation and I think they genuinely cared but felt they weren't in the position to do anything about it.

-

I stopped seeing the psychiatrist because my mum was pissed at something they said. She complained that the psychiastrist was crazy and she wasted her money. She made it seem like my fault.

-

I went back to my cutting habits, and every time I'm caught, my mum gets super pissed. She never stops to talk to me about it. She just hides or takes away whatever I was using. I just want her to talk to me. I just want the comfort of her kind words. I want her to hug me. That's all I need. But I can't tell her that. I don't know how. 

-

Very rarely I'd come to school crying and no one would know why. My teachers would ask me what's wrong but I couldn't say anything. I'd just tell them I needed some time to get over it. I'd kill myself over my bad English grades too, I'd thought. It's easier to die than to finish that essay. I took the harder route.

-

There's a little anti-suicide/mental-health awareness campaign at my school, and I had a very unpopular opinion that I never voiced until now. Some people argue that suicide is selfish or people who care about you will really miss you. Almost everyone's against suicide. But I personally don't see much wrong with it. No one ever asked to be born, so it's not like you're throwing away "the gift of life" or whatever if you die. Some people desperately wanna go and it's not our job to interfere. Let them be.

-

I think I have friends, but I don't feel close enough to talk about my personal problems with them. I think some of them go through stuff to, and some of them have virtually no problems. I don't think any of them really care about me. It's not like I'll see them after high school or later in my life. 

-
Every time I think of suicide, I think of how I'll never have to be so upset again. I debate in my mind whether the good parts of my life outweigh the bad and if living for either is really worth it. My family thinks I'll be a successful doctor sometimes, and other times they think I won't make it through college or even go to any good schools. I personally don't care at this point. I have no problem ending my life if I have to end up on the streets or something, I thought.

-

I'm still here. Tell me why mothers can treat their children like this, or why I even treat myself like this. I'm starting to break. I don't know who anyone is anymore. The good and bad of people confuse me so much and I can't take it. I don't want to make any rash decicions.
