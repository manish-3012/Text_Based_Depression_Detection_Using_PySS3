GoodbyeThis sub helped me a lot. But itâ€™s not enough and no one else is here to care. Reach out to those who you love if you know that theyâ€™re in a bad place. But Iâ€™m going to end it tonight. I realize that I cannot be helped or be happy and need to go through with what Iâ€™ve wanted to do since I was 12 years old.

Peace out.
