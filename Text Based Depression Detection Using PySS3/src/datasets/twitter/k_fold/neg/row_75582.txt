The girl I love is a lesbian...First time poster, long time viewer.

I've been depressed for 11 years. Ever since my parents decided to move half way across the country and I lost everything and everyone I cared about. I've never attempted to kill myself, but I came very close on two occasions, and I once even walked to Home Depot with the intention of buying some rope to hang myself. But I'm too pathetic to ever go through with it.

Anyway, there's this girl. I never had a chance with her because I'm worthless, and she one of my only friends younger sister. He obviously doesn't know. But I always held onto the hope that one day, under extraordinarily unlikely circumstances, we might hit it off. In fact, there are days that it's the only thought that sends my spiralling downwards.

But a few days ago, I happened upon a Facebook post where she seemed extra-close with another girl, and after some investigation it turns out she is a lesbian. She has been in a happy relationship for half a year. The thought makes me sick. I can't eat, I can't sleep. The only thought that goes through my head is her. 

I'm truly happy that she is happy. Everyone deserves to be loved. I just wish that for once, I could be happy. I never seem to get my turn. I wish I could forget about her, but the heart wants what the heart wants.

This bit of knowledge has sent me back into a crippling depression. I just needed to vent, so if you read this I thank you.
