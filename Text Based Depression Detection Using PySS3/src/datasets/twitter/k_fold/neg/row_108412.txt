Update on my Therapy appointment...:'(
It did NOT go well.

I have quit drinking. Not a drop since noon. I chose to stop, and it is working out well so far. I feel fantastic, though really shaky at times. My hubby didn't take the news so well and we had a huge fight in the therapist's office and I sobbed through the whole thing. I made it this far, though, and I intend on staying sober from now on. 

I quit because it was the right thing to do.

I got hell from the therapist about taking my meds and drinking, so that was the whole problem. I deserved that. I was actually able to take my night-time medicine just about a half hour ago and not have to worry about it. I am getting sleepy from them now, and it feels good to be back on them fully and willingly.

It feels great to be sober.

Oh, and the suicidal thoughts have NOT really come back, even when my hubby was screaming at me!!! I thought about it for a millisecond, and it wasn't that I wanted to do it, but more of a "gee, at an earlier time, I would be running for the pills or noose or something...but I really don't want to hurt myself!" kind of thought.
I am extremely proud of myself for quitting and also for sticking with this and NOT resorting to self-harm or suicide.

Go me!!!

(By the way, hubby seems to have gotten over it and I have a psych appointment where I have to convince them that I don't need further help...which I don't since I have quit on my own) so I think I can do that and convince the Psych PA tomorrow.)
Wish me luck for tomorrow. As for withdrawals, I think I was truly scared sober and I don't have any cravings or bad symptoms except for a little shaky in the hands. I am extremely lucky that I stopped when I did--before I had gotten myself TOO far in and unable to stop.

Thanks for the support guys.

~LG Sober and happy about it!!
