Maybe I'm doneI've found out a lot of bad shit about my ex in the past few days. I won't go into much detail but the gist of it was she was cheating on me for almost a year before she went to prison. So that hurts a bit.

And now...
Someone I love has either decided they hate me or something has happened to her. Either way I'm worried as fuck about that. I'm broke, behind on rent, had my car towed last night n there is no way I can afford to get it out. I've reached out to friends but they haven't tried to help. I have just enough money to buy a big bag of coke, chop it all up n do the fattest line possible untill the lights go out for me. I only say that cause it sounds like a fun way to go.

I'm not sure what to do right now....
I've always thought I was stronger than this but for some reason I'm breaking...

Edit: And shit like this is why I'm considering ending it. Who the fuck cares. 5 hours later n no one says a word. I get the same shit on facebook.... Meaning I get nothing on facebook.

I'll delete this post shortly, but to anyone that reads this.... Pay attention to people around you. I can't say I need help any better way than I have to those around me. I got a like for it.... 

So yea, thank you. At least you dont know me to miss me
