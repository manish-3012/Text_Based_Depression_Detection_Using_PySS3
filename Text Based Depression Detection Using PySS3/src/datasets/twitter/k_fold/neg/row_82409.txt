I'm not afraid of suicide anymore. I'm going to do it.I used to worry about what would happen and I would scare myself because of how I was feeling but now I'm at peace with the fact that I can end how I'm feeling. It's selfish and cruel but there's no way I can stop what's happening as easily as just laying my head on a train track and waiting. I'm thinking of writing notes to the few I care about and then killing myself. Soon.

Edit: I was talked out of it. Sorry to disappoint.
