i'm so fucking stupidi promised myself i wouldn't call lifeline but i felt so alone and now the cops are looking for me. i need to take the pills before they find me but if they do they they'll reverse it and there will be no point in me taking all the pills. i don't know what to do, if i should hide the pills and wait until tommorow or just take them and hope the police don't find me passed out before i can't be fixed
