dad died, struggling through school, wanting to end it allhi
im 12 years old and my will to live is now completely useless 
my dad, who was in my life for only 7 years, died in a car accident
he was the dad who believed in me
he was always there with me , problem or no problem
and now my mom believes that i shouldn't think about him anymore
and plus nobody likes me in school
everyone thinks i am fat, stupid, ugly, retarded, and it always gets to me
i dont want to live in this world any longer
i just want to end my life
relatives think that i should seek therapy
but it wouldn't work
it would just make me feel even worse
i need help
i tried to hang myself but i was too scared
someone please help
