I have suicidal thoughts and theyâ€™ve been getting worse and worseIâ€™m depressed and hurt and I have no one to talk to. My mother and I arenâ€™t close and I have never met my father. My friends wouldnâ€™t know how to deal with these things... and Iâ€™m always there for them But itâ€™s not the same.. Iâ€™ve been getting overwhelmed with college and family and my life and everything feels like itâ€™s slowly crashing down and things are getting worse. I got out of a bad relationship about a month ago Iâ€™m still not over it. My mom has been through 3 jobs this past year. Iâ€™m in college and just graduated high school and I also work. Money is tight and my depression is getting worse Iâ€™ve had over 3 councilors in the past and Iâ€™ve been on meds but i stopped that. I thought I was better. I need help and I canâ€™t go to anyone here.
