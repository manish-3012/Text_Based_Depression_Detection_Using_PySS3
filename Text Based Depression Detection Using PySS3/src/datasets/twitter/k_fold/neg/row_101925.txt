I don't know what to do with myself anymoreI just feel pain, everywhere. I'm tired  of beint sick on the inside and rhe oitside. I'm tired of being a constant drainbon everyone else's life and enthisiasm, I just don't want my dwpressoion to be a burdern to anyone other than myself. They don't deserve this, to have to be my crutch because I can't function by myself. I don't deserve this. People have been telling me forbyears that it gets better, but does it? When can i feel normal? When is it my turn?

Imbjust tired.  I feel tired and worn. I'm done. I just want to fall asleep and never wake up. I hurt too much. 

I dont know what I need... just what I wqnt. I want to not feel anymore.
