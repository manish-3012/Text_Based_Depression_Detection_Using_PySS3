So close to being done with all of this.I'm a failure in every sense of the word. I'm a terrible writer, terrible photographer, terrible friend, and terrible at fixing any of this. I'm stuck in college with a useless degree (finishing my associates in 'creative writing' lol and planning on getting a bachelors in whatever STEM field that doesn't sound as soul-crushing as the others) and no idea what to do next. I'm literally not good at anything, what's the fucking point? Because I certainly have tried to come up with a reason to continue pushing forward and I've come to the conclusion that **I** simply don't have one.
