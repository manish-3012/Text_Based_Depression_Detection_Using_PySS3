Iâ€™m so FUC*ED!!! I lost my insurance but I have no will to fix it because I cannot handle stress. Yet Iâ€™m developing tooth aches and running out of psych meds. Oh what fun! I feel tempted to end it allI cannot handle anything. I donâ€™t work.
I donâ€™t cook, clean, shower, brush, etc.
Only once in a while I shower.
The smallest things that go wrong send me into either an anxiety attack or RAGE outburst

Even caring for  my cats stresses me out. 

So I keep my heart rate low and temper at a minimum by playing  on my phone and keeping my head in the sand


As my therapist always tells me 
â€œYou seem to have given up.â€

I and I have. I am severely mentally ill, my dreams in life were crushed because of my issues even though in the past I worked so hard to make my dreams come true. But poverty and mental illness donâ€™t work well together! Especially with ZERO family support because they are also poor, ridden with mental illness, dysfunctional and selfish

I only see my therapist because at least she is someone to talk to who wonâ€™t judge me and also because I need my medication. I have no friends nor want any. But the office wonâ€™t allow me to have medication unless I see a stupid Therapist.


As for my insurance issue...

I was on medicaid and I renew it every yr by mail.  But there was some type of paperwork issue and I never got a notice in the mail about it so my case was closed. This means I have to go to some office and beg them to re-open it  by going to the Medicaid office which is nowhere near where I live. Medicaid office workers are **notorious assholes** like none other. Iâ€™ll even take talking to the DMV workers over them! 


If the asshole workers tell me they are not gonna help me,  Iâ€™ll have to reapply and wait 45 days for an approval. And if they have an attitude Iâ€™ll probably be escorted out after screaming at them because I have a temper.
And especially in the morning.
I tried to get dressed to go today but was too tired and once my coffee dropped on accident This morning I wanted to smash my TV into pieces. My issue is Iâ€™m someone who can never keep my eyes open in the morning even if I sleep all night. Iâ€™m a mega bitch unless I sleep in

But if I donâ€™t go early in the morning to this office Iâ€™ll be stuck waiting there for like five hours of probably nowhere to sit because these places are often crowded and full of cranky fucking people and crying babies. 

Also I live in a city where i must take the metro and people here are often rude and pushy.

When I get stressed, in a matter of minutes I get full of achey back pain and leg pain and feel hot and itchy to the point I get eczema.


Itâ€™s all too much.
This is gonna be bad.

I think once the toothaches become bad enough Iâ€™ll just kill myself because the last time I had a toothache it was so bad I was screaming my head off on and off for weeks until they  finally pulled my tooth out

But  I donâ€™t want to become toothless either

 but I also wonâ€™t do anything to fix it so Iâ€™m just going around in circles and going nowhere
