Iâ€™m aloneMy heart hurts from being so alone. Thereâ€™s no one in this world that I can be honest with and knows me. If it werenâ€™t for the fact that I would break my families hearts I would be dead right now. Every day that goes by is harder to deal with. I just want to end the voice in my head that constantly tells me iâ€™m worthless. I want to die and just experience silence for once.
