Last night I had a dream that made me question everything.So lately I've been dreaming of my stresses. My plan is to buy a gun and kmsl when I turn 21, but last night I dreamed I had a shotgun. I picked up the gun and pointed it at my head and was suddenly hesitant. I knew one finger flick would open a world of the unknown. Then I woke up IRL. 
I don't understand this. A part of me is suspicious that I don't want to commit suicide, but my life is really hell. I really hate this world and I really do see everything going downhill. Past the point of redemption for reasons I really can't control. Suicide is the best option; I just feel selfish for wanting to fight so much. I feel stupid. My fear angers me.
