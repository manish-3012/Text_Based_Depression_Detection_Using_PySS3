Bad timesI don't know what else to do right now, so I figured I would try to see if anyone has some advice. I have 2 friends who are saying they are suicidal right now. This has just sprung up in the past couple of days. Lets call them A. and B.

A. called me up and told me to take him to the hospital because he didn't trust himself and thought about suicide constantly. He informed me that he looked up different ways to do it. I talked him down, brought him to his wife and we sat down and talked through all his feelings. He seemed better when I left them and I have been checking up ever since.

B. just had his fiance trash their place and take all of her stuff. No note, no nothing left behind. We drove around to her haunts, found her car at a friend's house and the friend of hers said she wasn't there. Now he's at my house and I am suicide watching him right now to make sure he doesn't do anything. He said he can't stay home or he'll put his gun into his mouth.

I'm feeling overwhelmed right now and don't know what I should do about this. A. has a good network of friends that he can rely on but I feel like I am the most suitable for support right now. Finals are almost over and I have a chunk of free time between here and when school starts back up.

B. does not have a good network of friends. I can think of only a couple of people who are both willing and able to provide support for him excluding myself. I am also his closest friend.

I want to be there for support for both of them but I don't want to negatively impact my life, either. I'm just trying to get through finals right now. I don't want to have either of them sent away, really. My brother was in an institution for depression and attempted suicide and says it was a horrible experience and it would make him ensure to do it right the next time. Thankfully there never was a next time, but that just makes my present decisions harder to make. Does anyone have any advice?
