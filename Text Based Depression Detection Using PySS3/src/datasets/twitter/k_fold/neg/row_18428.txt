Sorry little dudeI'm sorry to that little kid who liked to build forts in the woods and catch bugs. I'm sorry to the kid who when he god a little older always dreamed of being a doctor or entrepreneur. I'm sorry to the high school student who worked so hard for an impossible dream. How could I ever look you in the eye, how could I ever face you with the way things turned out? My past selves. I'm happy for you. Happy that you got to experience wonder, happiness and joy. And that you always dreamed big. Your dreams were always too big, too much disparity between your skills, and what you wanted. Knowing that those silly dreams thought up by some silly little kid are all but impossible, makes the decision to go a little easier. It's a stark reminder of the cold unforgiving nature of the world. A reality check. I guess you were never really meant for this world, and it turns out stopping the pain is all that really matters now. That and running from the disappointment and dissatisfaction until it chases you down into your grave. But it can't hurt you there. But still, I'm sorry little dude.

Edit: just changed one sentence a little, and thank you for all the kind comments.
