Veteran requesting information on access to care outside of the VA system.First off, this is a serious inquiry.  I am on 100% VA disability, and social security.  I am suicidal.  I don't wish to discuss the particulars, nor do I need 'don't do it posts',  I am just looking for information on who I can contact to receive care outside of the veteran's administration that will be covered by social security, VA benefits, or Medicare/Medicaid in the area surrounding New York City.

I am not looking for the closest ER.  Having worked in them, I know the protocol.  I am simply looking for information regarding access to counselors.

If anyone has any insight on who to contact, I will be most grateful.
