nobody caresits understadable, everyone has their own lives to worry about.. why on earth would they take their time to try to talk to someone, especially when that person is suicidal its like talking to a wall.. i find most suicidal people are stubborn and talking doesnt do anything.
Its worse when people pretend they care because they build false hope and then leave. People online dont care, they dont even know you.  Its all for their own image of themselves, they pretend to care to feel good about themselves because theyre *such* a good person. bullshit
