I never thought it would come to this pointAs a kid, I never thought my life would come to this. I never thought I would be crying myself to sleep every night. I never thought I'd be this hopeless and scared all the time. I never thought I would have suicidal thoughts. 


But here I am. A 15 year old girl that wants nothing more than the pain to stop. I'm so tired. I just can't take it anymore. I used to be such a happy, cute kid and now I think about killing myself daily. Eventually I'll get the courage to do it.
