My s/o is obsessed with her ex who committed suicide...what do I do?Basically, my s/o, who I will call Pat, ex killed them-self 2 years ago now and they weren't even dating at the time. From what i gather the person was a shithead...dropped out of school, abusing drugs, abusing pat, raped pat when they didn't want to have sex. The person was an all around awful human being, put my s/o through hell. But the worst part is...Pat still loves the person, and even gets sad about it a lot. I feel like I am constantly in competition with a dead scumbag. It was 2 years ago...we're so young, and he was the first person pat said "I love you" to. It's not like they were fucking married! She has gotten a lot of her idealogical beliefs from him, not even accepting other peoples point of view. What can i do? Will she ever get over this?
