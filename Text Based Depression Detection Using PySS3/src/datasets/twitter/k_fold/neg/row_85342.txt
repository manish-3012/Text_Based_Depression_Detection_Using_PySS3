What a sick jokeSince I was little, I knew something was off. Always pitied, looked down and "left aside", all of it in my "family" environment still. At school, teachers would rather whisper with others about me than talk directly to me. And when they did, feigning normalcy, it was all the usual "study, yes", "you'll reach nowhere without effort, yes". Fucking bullshit.

I grew up with the mindset I had to prove myself the best to be worth the bare minimum, and to punish myself over every little failure. And I did so. Result? Nothing. All the way, seeing others being granted stuff so naturally, but never attaining nothing on my own.

Nothing. Fucking nothing. Absolutely nothing. Nothing will ever change, never. No matter how much effort I put, I'll always be disregarded.

So why? Why did you guys dragged me for so long? Why I had to go through all of it just to left to die? There isn't a day in which I feel puking out of hatred.

There was never anything in this world for me, since the start. It was all a sick collective joke.
