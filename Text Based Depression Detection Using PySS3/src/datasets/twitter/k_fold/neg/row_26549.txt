I don't want the future.Iâ€™m exhausted. Iâ€™m truly fucking exhausted, despite being so privileged. Iâ€™m in a constant state of not doing anything, from getting help to ending it all. I canâ€™t make any decision on my own. I canâ€™t even go outside without being scared. I canâ€™t even drive. I canâ€™t catch up on my online assignments. Yet Iâ€™m paying $26,000 a year to jump through assignment after assignment. For what? A degree? A piece of paper to hold onto while I beg for a dead-end job so I can afford food for 35 years? Then just stroke out and die one day? Itâ€™s fucking bullshit. 
And itâ€™s not like I can go anywhere else. I canâ€™t even fucking go outside to take out the trash. 
I thought it would get better. Iâ€™m 19, and Iâ€™ve been thinking about ending it since I was 13. I donâ€™t see why I didnâ€™t. Nothing has fundamentally changed. Iâ€™m still the annoying, sad little sack of shit I was in middle school. The only thing Iâ€™ve got going for me is my writing. Or so everyone says. 
I donâ€™t want this life. I would absolutely give anyone else my place in the world. But thatâ€™s not possible. I canâ€™t even make a plan to die. Iâ€™m that pathetic. Iâ€™m laughing at myself, not being able to take a step outside or even think of a way to die.
