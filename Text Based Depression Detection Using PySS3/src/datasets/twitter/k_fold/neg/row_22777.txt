Ideation to self soothe?Hi everyone!  Sorry for formatting, I'm on mobile.

Does anyone else find themselves ideating as a form of self soothing? When I'm in a particularly dark place in my mind, I don't know why but I find daydreaming about my own suicide really comforting, to the point that it is my go-to cognitive coping method. 

Stay safe xx
