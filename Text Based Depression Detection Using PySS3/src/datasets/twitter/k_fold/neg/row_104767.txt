What do I do?I don't sleep anymore. I haven't slept in 5 days, five fucking days. I cannot go out in the sun anymore it hurts too bad. I cannot talk to my family for fear of them asking (how did you sleep?) I have told them to please stop asking me, the question makes everything worse. I don't have friends, I don't have a talent so why do i go on? there is really no reason for me to live.  I have been depressed for so fucking long, therapy doesn't help at all. I'm so lost, alone and scared. This is destroying everything about me, I can't talk to anyone more. I can't leave my house anymore. I just need to get this out there..
