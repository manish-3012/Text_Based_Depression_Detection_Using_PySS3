Thoughts becoming realerI thought I had a love but he ended it and it seems so easy for him. Nothing went wrong he just couldnt be in a relationship right now. Itâ€™s so depressing and I feel like shit. Iâ€™m so bored during this quarantine. No work no one to really talk to. I donâ€™t see any excitement in any activities I can possibly think of. I just sleep and lay on the couch and cry. This isnâ€™t a life this isnâ€™t living I just want to end it and not deal with any of these feelings even though I know I probably deserve it for being a shitty person
