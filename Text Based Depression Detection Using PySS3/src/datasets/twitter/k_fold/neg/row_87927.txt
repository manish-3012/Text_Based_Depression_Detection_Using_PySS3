I just canâ€™t take the stressEveryone tells me Iâ€™m smart yet my grades suck, my personality sucks, my family is poor, I have no useful skills, my friends donâ€™t even know who I am, I just canâ€™t take it. My dad pushes me to do better and that Iâ€™m not doing enough even when I do everything for him, I donâ€™t care where I end up. The world is going to shit and in donâ€™t want to contribute. I feel like a useless vacuum, that my family spend money on even though Iâ€™m not gonna make it to 18. Iâ€™m a pussy though, I just donâ€™t want it to hurt really bad and I donâ€™t want to be disfigured when my family finds me. Iâ€™m thinking carbon monoxide, but idk. I have to get another surgery and itâ€™s gonna fucking hurt, I canâ€™t do this math shit, and nothing seems worth it to me. Iâ€™m 13 btw, I donâ€™t want my dog to miss me I dont want my family to be sad because the fatass died. My mom and stepdad wouldnt deserve it though. Any help??
