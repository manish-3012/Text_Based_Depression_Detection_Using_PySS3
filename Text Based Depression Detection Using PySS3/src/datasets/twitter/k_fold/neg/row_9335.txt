I donâ€™t want to be alive anymoreI ruin everything always. I ruined thanksgiving, and I ruined my fiancÃ©â€™s birthday, and Iâ€™ll probably ruin Christmas. I thought I was doing good this time, but I didnâ€™t think enough. I didnâ€™t use my brain. I never use my fucking brain. I hate myself. I donâ€™t want to feel anymore. All I do is fuck up and let down the people I love. They all deserve better. My fiancÃ© deserves better. My siblings, even my shit parents. They deserve better than me. Iâ€™m so sorry for even coming into my partnerâ€™s life. He thought he found the love of his life and he could finally be happy, but all he got was more disappointment. I got his hopes up for nothing, hurting him so much more than he would have hurt if I had just stayed down and let his heart be. I shouldâ€™ve fucking died in 2015. Now I donâ€™t even have the fucking balls. Iâ€™m a living disaster. I want to die. I hate everything so fucking much.
