If I may have a moment of your timeHello!

Please forgive me if this is the wrong place to ask. I've been seriously contemplating suicide for at least a decade now. The only things that have been keeping me going were the knowledge that, should I fail, I would end up in an even worse torment than the one I am currently in, and that there must've been something I missed in my situation, and there is hope somewhere I can reach. I'm sorry, but now I'm almost completely out of strength. If there is hope somewhere, I don't believe I could even make any use of it. But I will not make a fool of myself and act if there is a better way I don't know about. Hence this post.

I always feel mentally tired and stressed, as if I was caught in an endless vise. But what's worse is that I believe I know why. If I try and stare deep inside what I should be, I find that my heart seems to believe it was made to love all and every equally, with no boundaries. That I should just follow the winds of will and fate for where I should go. That I should just listen and trust without fail, because my desires will inevitably end up matching those of who I'm with. I have no issues trusting others. I try my best to follow those winds, but I am but a single person, and cannot follow two paths at once. My mind cannot resolve conflicts for which I cannot use reason and logic for. It just tears itself apart. I've tried to find ways to cope and twist things around but lately I've even had difficulty interpreting the words of others correctly to do that. It just hurts too much. I've often told myself that that view was wrong, that I just needed to find myself within. But there is nothing there. I've looked over and over again. It seems that for me, self-identity, self-worth and self-esteem are not right. I've tried (had no choice) to just fake something, in the hopes that I would end up becoming it. But now everything is just falling apart.

I've scoured the net in search of what illness that could be, and its treatments. But it always seems like they miss the mark. I'm in control; the thoughts I have to suicide are from the logical part of my mind. The one that analyzes and tries to find practical solutions. But there is none for this one, other that suicide of course. It doesn't seem like depression or anxiety, and I tend to already do most of the things mentioned for treating those anyway. I have good relations with my family and friends, exercise and eat reasonably well. I'm trying to have some hobbies but it always feels like blowing air. I tried to talk to a therapist once, but it ended catastrophically. I trust too easily and readily. Even if the logical part of me would be screaming that no, nothing was fixed, I would believe their judgment and follow what they said to make them happy. Because that's what mattered to my heart. Of course nothing would be solved and I would come home to cry.

  

I hate talking (writing?) about this. I feel like I shouldn't even know any of this. I should just be, without having to scour and warp my mind to avoid agony. I'm so tired. I feel like I'm just wrong, and there is nothing awaiting me but more distress and suffering. I've been believing the good old saying "Things will get better, you'll see!", for so long, but I just can't see any reason to. And my strength to just blindly hope is gone.

Sorry for rambling, have a good day and thanks for your time.
