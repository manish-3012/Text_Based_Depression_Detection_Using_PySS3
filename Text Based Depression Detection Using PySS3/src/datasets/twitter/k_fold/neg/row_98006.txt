I will stay, but am very unsatisfied.I am very "done" with life circumstances.
I know that if I were to leave there would
be a lot of devistation here on Earth. 

I won't do it because of that. But I am hurting.

Idk how I could possibly change everything that needs to change to make me not feel this low. There is a lot wrong right now. I'm not happy with my job, my home life, or my long term relationship. I have trauma that's my fault... I've made bad life choices. I may even be a bad person.

I don't know what to do anymore.

I feel lost.
