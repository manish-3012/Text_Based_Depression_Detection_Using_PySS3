One more shot, then Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m not in this for the pity or the attention Iâ€™m in this because there is nothing else to do, Iâ€™m not anything like you, iâ€™m awkward and canâ€™t seem to make anyone smile, i made this account to make this, iâ€™m afraid of being caught. What if someone sees the notification on my phone for the replies?(though i doubt thereâ€™ll be any,so many people who need help here more than me. Iâ€™m a lost cause who doesnâ€™t deserve attention)
When i was young my sister took a gun,put it to her head in front of me and cried too scared to pull it off.
That shit wasnâ€™t good for a small child. Later i learned that my mother is depressed and that my sister has it cause of my mom having it and growing up around that. But my sister got help and made it. My mom tried to take her life three times but failed it. First she cut herself, then she took a car and slammed into a tree,then when she got medicine she tried to overdose, with my sister and mom having this problem i grew up even worse than my sister did. 

I always sheltered my little sister from this, listening to my parents fight, comforting my sister(shes my older sister btw) while she cried and cried and didnâ€™t know what to do. On the day my mom tried to slam into a tree, she was leaving for work and wanted to say goodbye, so i said goodbye,gave her a hug,and she put both hands on the sides of my head,looked me right in the eye and said she loved me no matter what, she was crying, she had been arguing in the middle of the night with my dad.she looked me right in the eye and said she loved me and i said ok,not thinking about it. How could i have not thought about it? What if she had died?

It wouldâ€™ve been on me. I shouldâ€™ve been paying more attention. How selfish am i? What kind of son and brother am i? My little sister wouldâ€™ve grown up without my mom and it wouldâ€™ve been because her dumb brother wasnâ€™t paying attention.
One more shot,one more week,if I can make it, then maybe theres hope
