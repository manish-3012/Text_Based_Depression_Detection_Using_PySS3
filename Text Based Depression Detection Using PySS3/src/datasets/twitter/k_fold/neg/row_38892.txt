Feeling very guilty for friend's suicideIn highschool, he was a really quiet person. Never talked much or replied to questions often, he did not have many friends, it is not that people did not like him, he was just not very social. I graduated with him and we would play games online through steam such as Dota 2, Minecraft, GTA, etc. We usually had a group of us that would play, roughly 3-6 people in a Teamspeak channel this went on for a at least 2ish years from grade 12 to a couple years after. I only learned about his death yesterday, he passed away late June. His death hit me like a truck and I could not believe it, he was only 20 years old. This is the part where I feel absolute regret and remorse. Back in early February, some teamspeak friends and I deleted him and pretty much isolated him away from our group, this includes steam, facebook, and teamspeak. What he did was not even that bad, he just acted like a jerk to us in the span of a week or so.

Now what I feel now will never go away. I feel my friends and I were part of the reason he commit suicide and that if we were still friends on all those platforms and were communicating he would still be alive. Friends for around 2-3 years then gone instantly. Although we never hung out in person because of the social aspect, I still feel we were a large part of his life. We just took all that away. I feel ashamed of my self right now. He even tried to apologize through Facebook in February but I just ignored the message. They are saying he suffered from depression, I think that might be right.

In a summed up version, I feel like I was a big part of why he commit suicide, although I don't know what else was happening in his life. It's like I took a branch of hope and blocked it from him.

Hopefully this is one of the right sub-reddits to post in, I just felt like I needed this out of my mind.
