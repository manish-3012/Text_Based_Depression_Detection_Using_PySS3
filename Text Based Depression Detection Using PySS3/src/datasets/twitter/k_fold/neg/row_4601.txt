i need to give upmy entire life has been a series of worthlessness,  burying my entire family before i was 18.  spending the last 15 years struggling to stay afloat.  
my ex really did a number on me and took any worth i had left.  here we are for the second time of him dumping me and i just dont wanna deal with this.  last time this person dumped me,  it took me almost a year to recover,  six months of that i spent trying not to cut the pain out of my skin.    i've been in therapy,  i get how it works.  and it only works on the surface for me.  it never once took the pain away,  just taught me how to ignore it.  it never made me feel better about myself,  just made me represent myself better.   im in my 30's,  i dont have any chemical imbalances,  i dont believe in heaven,  i dont think suicide is glorious or spectacular.  i just cant do this life thing anymore.   not after what he turned me into.  i cant live with the shame of knowing i let this coward use me over and over and get everything he wants without having to give anything in return.   i let him abuse me emotionally and even created situations where he would do that just because its better than being ignored after he cums.    i have given everything good in me to this person and he wont give it back.  and hes running away with it and i cant keep up because my burdens are tearing at my skin behind me.  i hate myself because i still love him unconditionally.  i love his abuse because its the only attention i get.  the other day he opened video chat and jerked off to me talking like it was nothing.  how sick is that that it made me feel good.

how starved can you be to where someone violating you feels like a compliment.

i cant do this anymore.  

i am disgusting,  worthless and weak.  

i cant do this anymore.
