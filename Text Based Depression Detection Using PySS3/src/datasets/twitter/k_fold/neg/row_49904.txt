It's been like this for so longAll i can think is why am I doing this? I know the reason: other people. I don't want to destroy my family; not yet anyway. I thought I would at least hang on until my younger sister finishes her final year in school. But then I don't want to mess up college for her. So maybe I would hold out another 4 years or so after that? But I fucking hate life, I hate living every day. Everything has got steadily worse with time - mostly my mental state. I'm not saying nothing good has every happened, but there's no point when you literally cannot enjoy anything. I was numb for a few months last year. I don't think I'm numb now, because I do cry sometimes. But I can't feel any happiness. I'm out with my boyfriend and he tells me he feels so 'blissfully happy' at that moment. All the time I feel a constant weight and never feel joy. 

But yeah, I hold on. And get guilt tripped by by mental health team for a suicide attempt - 'what about your sister?' You think I haven't thought of that? Anyway, they discharged me because I would say they were frustrated by two years of getting nowhere. The anti depressants that I tried just brushed off me, I never even got side effects. Therapy didn't do a lot for me either, I would be willing to try it again but I can't afford it at the moment.

I look into my future and see nothing worthwhile, just more of this only with ageing. I can't really see this lifting; don't tell me to go look at the sunset because I feel nothing.
