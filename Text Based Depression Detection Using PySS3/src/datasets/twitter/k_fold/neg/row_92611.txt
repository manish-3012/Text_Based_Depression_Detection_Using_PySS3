How many people go out drinking with their friends only to feel worse after?I swear to god I feel like alcohol is presented as this holy grail but I only hate myself more after going out and being social. I dont know if its the booze or seeing how effortlessly happy everyone else is, but I feel even worse after. There is something wrong with me and I hate it. I want to feel normal.
