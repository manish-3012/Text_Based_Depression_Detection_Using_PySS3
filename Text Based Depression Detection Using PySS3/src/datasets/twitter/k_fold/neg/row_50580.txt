I just lost my job at Wendy'sI just got fired from Wendy's after working there for nearly 2 years. I got fired because my pants kept falling and I didn't bother to buy a new belt or tighter pants because I thought it was a non-issue. This is my first time getting fired before. What should I do? I get depressed real easily and I'm contemplating suicide. I need help.
