Going into harms way in a few hours.It's the only road left for me. Not killing myself yet even though it invades my thoughts every hour wearing me down. 

Every step I've taken since 40 has been extraordinarily unlucky. Or some will say it's all my own doing. 

So now I'm taking another *miss*-step in the making. 


In the end, the worst thing that can happen is death right?
