Maybe I was meant to die?Iâ€™m 21. Ftm. In the closet. I feel like a failure of a man. I feel like a failure of a human. I love my family but they suffocate me. My father especially. I was homeschooled until 15. Put onto the wrong medication so I lost my entire teenage years and got nothing to show those 5 years besides becoming 48 pounds overweight. I feel like Iâ€™m trapped in limbo and worthless. My family is very evangelical and ever since 15 theyâ€™ve low key alienated me due to me not believing what they do. I want to run away from my family and live a happy life but I donâ€™t know how. I feel trapped. Like I was meant to die in 2014 but didnâ€™t. I should of killed myself then but I wasnâ€™t able to and I regret that
