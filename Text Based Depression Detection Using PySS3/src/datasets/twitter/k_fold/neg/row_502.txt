sick of pretending to be ok but I have toItâ€™s so demotivating having to pretend to not being super fucking sad all the time. The few times I did vent my issues all the advice I got was â€œfake it until you make it.â€ It also led to some family arguments and an ADHD diagnoses. 

So one ADHD diagnoses later Iâ€™m on pills which make me concentrate more but also make me feel worse. I need to keep saying Iâ€™m okay so the family doesnâ€™t get into more arguments. The only thing my brain is telling me currently is â€œyouâ€™ll sort it out when you move out.â€ But I canâ€™t wait that long. Iâ€™d rather die than live like this. This is gonna sound really fucking weird but sometimes I just wish I were a fox, I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about any of this shit. I just fucking hate who I am and I want this to all end. Iâ€™m so fucking disgusting and I donâ€™t know how anyone tolerated a personality as fucked up as mine. Iâ€™m so annoying itâ€™s impossible to ignore even my friends have to tell me to shut up every once and a while. I fucking hate my body I donâ€™t want to thinkanymore.
