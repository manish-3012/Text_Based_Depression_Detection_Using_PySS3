I failed an attempt a little while ago and all it's done is made me want to die moreI always read this stories of people who survived and are so glad they did because it turned their life around and so on. Not me. I'm more determined than ever to get it done right this time.

Mom is entering hospice and watching her die is a reminder of just how pointless all is. Pointless suffering.

I will not fail again.
