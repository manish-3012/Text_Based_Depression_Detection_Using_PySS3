I donâ€™t relate to any of it.so Iâ€™m still getting off my high and my medications (and/or the cutting) are making me feel like a robot. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m writing this (and please donâ€™t fucking come to me saying that this means Iâ€™m â€œscreaming for helpâ€ cause I donâ€™t want to be helped anymore). Itâ€™s probably because Iâ€™m alone and lonely. Maybe because I donâ€™t have a place/someone that feels like home or maybe itâ€™s whatever other reason.
anyway. I just want to confirm again that I donâ€™t want any help or empathy. all Iâ€™m looking for is a logical reason for me to â€œliveâ€. I doubt that it exists but Iâ€™m still curious and Iâ€™m too careful with talking to those around me now so that they donâ€™t suspect anything but at the same time donâ€™t suspect it because Iâ€™m isolating myself either (idk if that makes sense but whatever). either way itâ€™s not like I can tell someone about this lol. I donâ€™t want to risk anyone suspecting anything or stopping me and Iâ€™m not fucking getting hospitalized again. I gave up on therapy at this point cause I can never speak freely without the fear of being hospitalized. I donâ€™t fucking get why canâ€™t they understand that killing myself or not should be MY FUCKING CHOICE cause Iâ€™m the one struggling here in a fucking forced existince and youâ€™re all selfish in not wanting me to go even if itâ€™s whatâ€™s best for me.

for real tho fuck that anyway. basically I read all these posts etc that are supposed to let you rethink your decision of wanting to kill yourself. I donâ€™t relate to any of what I read (in that it applies to me) or find anything thatâ€™s a logical reason for me to keep doing this.
yes, I do want to die and not just want to not be miserable. even when Iâ€™m stable or even maniac and everything is great, this world is still fucked up and everything in it overwhelms me. I know that Iâ€™m â€œexpecting way too much from lifeâ€ but why should I play by the rules of a world I didnâ€™t choose to exist in and canâ€™t even choose to leave it peacefully? also yeah I do understand that to decide whether I want to exist or not will mean that I should exist in the first place to make that decision but oh lol. another fucking dilemma that overwhelms me. Iâ€™m so fucking anxious about everything and Iâ€™m.so.tired. Iâ€™m so tired of everything feeling like a heavy weight and that I canâ€™t breathe. Iâ€™m tired of the fact that no matter how stable and doing well I am and no matter for how long Iâ€™m always going to collapse again because yay bipolar is chronic after all. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m supposed to do any of this. I have no reason to live for nor a purpose or a meaning in this life. my friends and all will be extremly hurt etc by me doing it but I wonâ€™t be here to witness that. my best friend who is the only person that can be my reason because i know that i cant live without her and she cant without me told me before that shell forgive me if i did it. i know that yeah thereâ€™s a possibility and â€œhopeâ€ that I might find a purpose and a meaning to all of this and things will get better but why the fuck do I have to wait and keep suffering just living on â€œsome hopeâ€? my problem is with the way this world works itself. itâ€™s not just with my depression or anxiety or ptsd or any of that because even if they all go away Iâ€™ll still fucking suffer. I know my thoughts are not organized but well. I just have to wait a bit longer and perfect it so that Iâ€™m certain I donâ€™t fail. Iâ€™m not going to do this on an impulse. itâ€™s going to hurt a lot but I guess that being able to endure physical pain (which i couldve gained from when I was abused sexually/physically lol) is going to help. finally itâ€™ll be the last thing that I get anxious about. one thing that I have to get through and all of this is done to me. my body is so full of scars I canâ€™t even find a spot to cut without risking if showing cause Iâ€™ve exhausted all places I can hide. canâ€™t even have tinder hook ups anymore because i dont want questions or empathy because of the scars. so yes even the strangers that i used to have a new one of them every weekend and just seek intimacy anc connection with are now gone. 
Iâ€™ve always known that this is how itâ€™ll end. sooner or later iâ€™m gonna end up doing it. everytime i get closer to it and I really feel like itâ€™s getting closer to the time now.
Iâ€™m scared, Iâ€™m lonely, Iâ€™m so tired and hurt but I have to do this. give me one fucking reason to live (if you bothered to read this full to begin with lol).
