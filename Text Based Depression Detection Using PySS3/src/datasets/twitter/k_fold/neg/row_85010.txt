I need help, I'm a 19-year-old closeted mtf trans boy and I'm full of despair and need somebody to talk toAs the title says, I'm a 19 year old boy has always wanted to be a girl, but who hasn't had the courage to come out as trans to anyone but my current girlfriend and my two best friends.

I've always had body image issues, even going so far as to become bulimic for a couple years. I just can't see myself as being anything other than ugly, and there's absolutely nothing feminine about my face. As more time goes on, and my body becomes more and more masculine because of puberty, I feel as though my chances of ever being feminine enough to pass are slipping through my fingers.

The thought of never being able to be who I want to be because I was too much of a coward to talk to my psychiatrist about my gender issues makes me want to leap out of the window of my apartment. My girlfriend has been helping me, teaching me how to apply makeup and how to match clothes and such, but I feel like no matter what I'll stick out like a sore thumb and people will hate me, and, more importantly, I'll hate myself.

What should I do? The more I think about it, the fewer options I can see. Are there any ways to feminize my face? Non-surgical ones? I feel so goddamn ugly I can barely stand mirrors, let alone pictures of myself. I'm debating posting one or two, but people I know may see. What can I do? I feel so fucking hopeless.
