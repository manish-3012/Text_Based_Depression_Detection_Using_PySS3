...I feel so hopeless. I have no job and have always been rejected by the places I applied to. I'm a 27 woman and I still love with my mother and grandfather and I hate this situation, but I see no way out of here.
My grandfather is diabetic so I could overdose on insulin, but I'm too much of a coward to actually do it.
Everyday I just feel worse and worse and just wish something would make this misery go away.
If I wasn't so stupid, maybe I could even go outside and buy some drugs so I wouldn't feel anything, but I barely know the city I lived my whole life
