Iâ€™m scaring myselfToday I got a gun, just handed down to me from my dad because heâ€™s worried about my neighborhood, and Iâ€™ve shot guns before, so I know gun safety and all, when I got it, I was just looking over everything, and without any thought I loaded it and just looked down the barrel for about a good 2 minutes, I had urges to just pull the trigger, idk Iâ€™m just scared of what Iâ€™ll do
