I've never done this before, yet it seems "talking" to anyone is pointless... There are no "friends."My whole life I've sacrificed for those I love despite jeopardizing my stability. 
It's fruitless. 
There's no genuine people. "Look to family for support" is a joke. My family ignores any cries of desperation and undermine/minimize anything I say. 
No one takes any of it seriously. Repeatedly I say I just need a friend, then I don't need to have all the answers. But I have none. And no family that takes any of it seriously. I merely exist day to day, cry everyday while everyone suggests and yells, "see a doctor!" 
I have many times. Been medicated a good majority of my life (I'll be 29 in a few days). 
I simply can't settle for superficial "friendships" or any relations. But it's always been that way. I've been without an actual friend for years. 
And I think we all know how greatly one person can effect your life. 
But for me, any significant genuine person is the most difficult to find to make anything feel worth it.
I have children, and for them to not even motivate me is something painful to admit. And that guilt feasts on me every single day. But no one listens. 

I think about dying every single day, I can't focus on anything else. It's as if what I've sacrificed for others will never amount to anything, and I certainly have nothing to show for it.

The idea of the ultimate sacrifice seems to be the only thing left that I have to offer anyone in this world...
