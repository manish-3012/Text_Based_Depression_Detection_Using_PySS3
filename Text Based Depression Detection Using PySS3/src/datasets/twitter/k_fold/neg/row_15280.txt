What's the point?What's the point of continuing? Continuing only takes effort, the rewards is small.  And to go with that there is suffering.

It doesn't matter the ratio of suffering to happyness one experiences in their life, in a blink they're just gone, they no longer exist, nothing that happened mattered. If it effected other people it still doesn't matter, there is simple nothing for that dead person. And for the people that mattered the same thing will happen to them.

I'm happy and glad to be alive (although I can't rationalize this feeling). Given that life is short and death is infinite then no matter how you look at it death is the better option, if you look at the average there is infinite more peace in death.

I've been in love, had the best sex of my life, felt like I've achieved something with my life, I've ever done heroin, meth and MDMA. These thrills are amazing (sex and heroin being the best but in different ways), but none could compare to infinite neutrality, infinite neutrality is simply what it is, there is no describing it, there is no experience, there is no nothing, not even a feeling of emptyness.

Why is living better than death.
