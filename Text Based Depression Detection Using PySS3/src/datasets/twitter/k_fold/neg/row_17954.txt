I've planned my suicide...19(M) bullied my whole life. Betrayed by friends and family alike. I have no-one left. Nor will I ever have someone. I'm fed up with everything.
I had therapy to no avail. I've tried al I could think of, but everything always make it worse. People pretend to care about me, but when I try to get smth of my chest, they dont care. They say they have it worse. I should be happy. "Its just the weather". So today I've made a big step for improvement: I've set a day when I will commit suicide if things dont look better. 
I've already written a letter, not that anyone would care. They won't miss me. No-one ever did so why would they? I've no future nor any way to obtain one. They say they will miss me. But they never call or message me. Nor do they accept when I ask to go out with someone. Which is understandable as I'm just a lazy good for nothing POS. My mother deserved a better son. Not some leech like me.
I've given myself a bit more than 3 months, I will most likely do it earlier the way things are going now.
