I feel like sometimes its not worth itI have everything that can make a person happy

- loving family network (even though father is out of the picture &amp; every family has its problems - their still wonderful people)
- pretty face
- nice body (for the time being..)
- Friendly personality
- financially stable environment
- studying at one of the best unis in the world


I worked hard for all of it. if it were up to my parents I'd still be fat, ugly and on the doll. but am I happy? no. I am depressed every single day of my life and I don't know why. Its a daily struggle for me to not overeat and return to what I used to be... I am so scared of being overweight again. Somtimes i lose control and binge eat on junk food gallore. I feel most suicidal then, sometimes i just think it would be easier to not live anymore then deal with the repercussions of my actions. I treat my mother so badly. I talk back to her all the time and I hate myself everyday for doing it, I hate for how I make her stressed and I wish I was never born. 

I don't plan on ever killing myself, I need to experience life first, I'm only 21 (didn't really know where else to post suicidal thoughts)-  sometimes i wonder, why bother? Life is not worth the amount of stress I self-inflict upon myself.
