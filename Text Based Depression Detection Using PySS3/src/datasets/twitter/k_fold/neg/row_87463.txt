I think it's time for me to go...I really think I'd be better off dead, not being a drain on my family and society. I wasted a ton of my parents money getting a degree that I can't seem to find a way to make use of, I'm stuck working a dead end job just to pay for my half of the bills that I split with my sister in our apartment, while she is flourishing and starting a new federal job. I feel like I've failed both as a son, and as the oldest of my siblings. Hell, my dad committed suicide 6 years ago. My best friend has been dead for over a year. I'm just, a waste at this point. I'm just a fat-ass piece of shit being a drain on everyone around me. I figure with the 325 (yes, I just counted them) pills of varying medications, a lot of alcohol and some high power edibles that I have, it will let me die semi-peacefully. My sister isn't here, she is off with her boyfriend. I'm at the apartment by myself with no restrictions. Nothing is stopping me. How can I do this without leaving a disgusting mess to be cleaned up? Maybe the bathtub? That'd at least contain the mess and could be cleaned up easier. Maybe just go out in a field and do all of this? I don't know. I'm debating on calling in sick tomorrow from work just so they can find someone else to come in and not be short-handed. That could at least be a good thing I do. I don't fucking know at this point.
