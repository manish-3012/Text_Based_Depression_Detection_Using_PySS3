I think after I give birth itâ€™s the right time to do it.I donâ€™t want the kid to have to deal with me. I want them to have the best chance at being happy. Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 14. My fiancÃ© cheated on me. My mommy is sick. I canâ€™t do school all by myself. I just feel like Iâ€™ve given it my all. It didnâ€™t work out. Iâ€™m 23 and have done nothing in life but spread misery. My fiancÃ© is such a happy, good man. I think whoever else he chose and him would have the best impact on my baby.
