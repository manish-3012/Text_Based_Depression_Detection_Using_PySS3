I've always been crazy, I've just had enoughWhy me? That's a good question. Why do I have to be in this body? Great question. Smoke weed and learn about appreciating life for what it's worth. You could probably buy some candy with the money by the end of it.

Why do I have to be autistic? It's normal to me, but other people probably think I'm weird. I have 1 friend in real life, of which I can't interact with due to being socially deprived.
Why do I have to live in a town of 500 people? There is nobody here except children and old people. There is not even a highschool here.
Why do I have to have misophonia? I deafen myself all day every day with pink noise. Lucky normal fucks around me watching tv. Thanks, you're the reason I'm suicidal. The sound of that is enough to make me want to be deaf, so I make myself deaf.
Why do I have to have this unknown skin condition? I don't sweat, I just itch. No, it does not cause a rash. It's not fair. I don't even know what it's called. I can't even skate much anymore because of it. The only thing I actively enjoy. Thanks life.
Why do I have to be young? I don't care if people don't take me seriously. I just want to be somewhere else, yet all I can do is wait.
Why do I have to have potential? I just want to have fun. I'm not allowed to enjoy my life.
Why is it that I'm never enough for people? My sister was talking highly of a dream she had where I shaved my head and became a jacked body builder. Funny, I laugh too, but don't fucking say that. I struggle enough with how I am now, yet still so many expectations on me to be better.
I don't care if I'm better. I learned programming at 13. I guess that's cool, but does it make me happy? No, not at all. I just want friends. I just want to be normal. I just want all my problems to go.

Imagine if you were the only person who grew old.
