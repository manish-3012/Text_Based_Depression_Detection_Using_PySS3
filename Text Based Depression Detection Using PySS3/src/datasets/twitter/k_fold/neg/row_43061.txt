(Throw away acc) I know I shouldn't but...Guilt has become less of a valid reason to not hang myself as the days roll by. I'm 24m living in a tent in my grandparents backyard, alone. I just lost my best friend of 22 years to some girl he only knew for 4 days. I have no one and I have nothing. I have suffered from depression and anxiety since I was 13 and have tried all the therapy and all the fucking pills. I've tried to kill myself before but the guilt of leaving my family with that feeling makes me sick but it's starting to lose it's validity as a reason not to. I can't fucking stand feeling this way anymore I just want it to stop....
