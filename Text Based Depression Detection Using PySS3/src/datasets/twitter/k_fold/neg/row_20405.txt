I feel awfulI feel like the suicidal thoughts are creeping into my mind again. I have severe problems with my health and mostly my teeth. I kinda want to blow my head off with my brother's 12 gauge. I feel like life screwed me over with my crappy health. If someone would like to help, feel free but i dont feel its urgent yet.
