I just bought a gunIâ€™ve attempted suicide twice in the past without thinking much about it or expecting to actually die. This time Iâ€™ve bought a gun so Iâ€™ll actually be successful. I have to go pick it up later today and then Iâ€™ll just be waiting until the time feels right. Part of me still hopes I wonâ€™t do it or I wonâ€™t die but I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I hope you reading this finds a way out of this pit but I just canâ€™t hold on anymore.
