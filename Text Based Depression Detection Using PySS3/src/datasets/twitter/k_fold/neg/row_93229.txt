another post, another person on the brink. TWIt sucks being another person posting here. I see all the posts and I don't want to add to them but where can I go? who else can I tell before I go?

I don't like the idea of oblivion. but it's the lesser of two evils. I have lived through hell on earth, yet it's the aftermath that is truly killing me. not the CSA, the beating, cult brainwashing, rape, torture, neglect, isolation etc. I lived through all of that, it was easy to dissociate and lose my soul, but how do i live through this? the aftermath? I'm not even in the same state as my family any more, but i'm not free. the agoraphobia, night terrors, the DID, PTSD, stress, panic and eating disorders, everything. I've been ruined. I'm sabotaged from every angle. No therapy has helped me. I cannot work. I'm almost homeless. I have nothing, and nobody. I starve myself in the dark, afraid of even being bumped or even looked at by another person. I spend days in a catatonic state, crawling to a useless therapist when I'm able to go. I dissociate three days a week to study/do unpaid work placement, but I don't know how I do that. It's another person that does that, and she wants to die as much as I do, only she is irrationally afraid of failing a class due to past trauma. Everything I do, and everything I cannot do, is because of my past. I'm not even a person anymore, just a sack of traumatised meat.

I can't reach out for help, and I'm scared of people too much. What does one do in this situation besides kill themselves? I can't go on. I have alcohol and an ocean to swim in to drown myself.
