I'm not ok.I'm sorry if you are reading this.  I just wanted to get this off my chest.  Just a way to help me.  I'm not sure how, but I really needed to talk to someone.  I've been in treatment for a long time and I don't know how to stop seeing my psychiatrist.  I've had intense suicidal urges and have been hospitalized twice.  Once after I woke up after the po*** chlor*** I injected missed the vein in my upper thigh.  It burned when I injected it and I just thought I was going to die.  Needless to say, I didn't.  I've always been honest with my doctor, but I didn't think that she was going to place me in the psych unit.  She asked me to admit myself or she will call the police to pick me up.  I promised her that I would, but I sat in the parking lot of the hospital.  I could not do it.  I knew what was going to happen to me.  I've been placed on a 72hr hold once before.  My doctor must have called the hospital because a guard found me in the lot.  I want to forget the hospital, but I have thoughts of this that don't go away.  I have multiple health problems.  I was told that I would live with this the rest of my life.  This isn't the life I wanted.  Why can't they just let me go?  Now I have daily checkins with my doctor.  I don't think I can keep doing this.  I wished that I never told my doctor what I've done.  I know my doctor really cares and this makes this even harder.  I would rather die now than suffer with pain and endless medications.  This isn't living.
