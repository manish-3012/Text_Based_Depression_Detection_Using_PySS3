I'm broken and I can never fix thatI'm lonely and have been that way all my life alot of people say "your young life will change!". What a bunch of fucking dishonest bullshit I'm sure they don't do intentionally but know it just looks like life will always be me as an unfuckable outcast. I don't know what to do anymore everything I enjoyed I can't do anymore it just feels hollow.
