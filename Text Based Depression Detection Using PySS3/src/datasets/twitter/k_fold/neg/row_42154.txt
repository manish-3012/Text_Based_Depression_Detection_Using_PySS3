I just needed to tell someoneSo things have been pretty bad for me lately. All my life, it was my dream to travel, live in a different country and experience a different culture. I'm 20-years-old now, and through my university course, I've managed to make that dream come true. I moved from Australia to France in January, for one year. Last year was a huge struggle with depression, but before I left, my psychologist told me that I would feel better once I moved here and was away from all the stress that plagued me in Australia, so I was excited. I've been here for 2 months now though, and not much has changed for me. I still feel really empty inside. I still hate myself and I feel misunderstood all the time. Everybody tells me that I'm in Europe, I'm 'living the dream' and I should make the most of it. I want to, but I'm finding it really hard to feel happy, or even just okay. I don't even know what that would feel like any more, so I guess I couldn't tell anyway. 

I guess what I'm trying to say is, I think about suicide a lot, and it scares me. I thought I should tell someone, but I sat in bed and I didn't know who I could tell. I feel like nobody cares, my friends and family at home are sick of me being depressed and exasperated at not being able to help and most of them think I'm just being ridiculous; they probably wonder how I can still be so sad living my own dream. I wonder that too and it makes me feel guilty.

Anyway, I just needed to tell someone that, so that if things get too much and I do need to give up, I can say that at least I told someone

Thank you for reading.
