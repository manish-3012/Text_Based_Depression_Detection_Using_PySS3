I think Iâ€™m a small part of other peoplesâ€™ bigger pictures.TW: Brief mention of CSA.
This is just how I feel, I donâ€™t believe people should agree or want other people to agree with me. I came to a realization.. it canâ€™t be everyoneâ€™s time. Sometimes you canâ€™t make something good out of something bad, sometimes itâ€™s really not worth it. I donâ€™t believe in much but a part of me believes in past lives and next lives. This just isnâ€™t the one for me. I think Iâ€™m a small part of a bigger picture. A couple peoplesâ€™ bigger pictures. Iâ€™ve lived my life as a commodity to be used and discarded of. I was born into it. I didnâ€™t get to be innocent, I started my life being born into someoneâ€™s sick fantasy. 

You know how they say some people have â€œmain character syndromeâ€? Maybe some people are like main characters. I must be a supporting actor, but not really that.. more of an extra. I think Iâ€™m a stepping stone towards other peoplesâ€™ bigger pictures. Iâ€™m the person in the background. Iâ€™m a punching bag that becomes a lesson for them that leads towards some sort of self realization redemption story, which will always be bigger than a forgiveness/healing one. I think Iâ€™m half a person.. the other half left awhile ago, or maybe I was never really whole. I think Iâ€™ve always been half of what a person should be and thatâ€™s why I never fully mattered. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve been in the situations Iâ€™ve been in. Iâ€™m just something that happens on the way towards a â€œbadâ€ persons self-realization. 

Iâ€™m tired of feeling like Iâ€™d have to spend the rest of my life healing, and Iâ€™m tired of being told to forgive. My forgiveness doesnâ€™t matter, plus Iâ€™m allowed to be angry. Some things are unforgivable but no, it doesnâ€™t matter whether I forgive them or not. Theyâ€™re still gonna wake up and applaud themselves for realizing they have hurt people, and â€œbreaking the cycleâ€. Theyâ€™re gonna forgive themselves and move on while they pat themselves on the back, and others do as well. It doesnâ€™t matter what I do. Theyâ€™ll know peace because they didnâ€™t have to experience themselves through the eyes of others. 

Why are people born to take on the pain that other people choose to inflict? Why was I born to be broken? 

I guess if you really want to turn things around for yourself no matter how bad the things youâ€™ve been through, you probably can. But do you feel like it? Iâ€™d rather try next time.
