I really donâ€™t want to deal with it anymoreThis year has been so fucking horrible.  I live in a house with my abusive alcoholic father and my mentally ill mother, Iâ€™ve dropped out of college because I could keep up with the work load, I have no irl friends, and with each month my mental health has spiraled lower.  I just donâ€™t know why I should keep going.  Iâ€™m constantly in pain from my fathers physical and emotional abuse, I had plenty of people who offer to help but as soon as I open up about whatâ€™s going on they seem overwhelmed by it and I donâ€™t want to be a burden.  Iâ€™ve gotten close to some online friends this year and whenever Iâ€™m feeling really depressed they worry about me so much.  I wish I didnâ€™t cause so much pain for them.  I hate so much about my life and I donâ€™t have anything to look forward to.  I really donâ€™t want to make it to 2019
