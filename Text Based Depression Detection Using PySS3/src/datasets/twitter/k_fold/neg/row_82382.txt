I ruin everything I touchEvery time I try to make any improvement in my life, I make it worse. Every time I try to help someone, I make it worse. Every time I talk to my counselor, it gets worse. Every time I talk to my parents, they make it worse. Every time I get in my car, I think about what would happen if I flipped my car end over end, without a seatbelt. I don't care how bad it hurts everyone else. I hate being alive. I hate being told to "get my shit together" or "keep saving money" or "make better decisions". I don't give a flying fuck about anyone else anymore. People suck, I suck, everyone sucks. All I'm good for is eating everyone's food and wasting what little money I make from my job. I'm fucking done. I'm so sick and god damn tired of everyone telling me how to live my life. Even if it means I don't move out of my parents house til I'm 40. I'm not worth anything apart from the organs that'll probably be donated to science once I die in a car accident. Thanks if you made it this far.
