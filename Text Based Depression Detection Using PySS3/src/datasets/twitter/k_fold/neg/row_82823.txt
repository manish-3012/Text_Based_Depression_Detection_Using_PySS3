i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happeningtoday has been so bad. i stupidly thought i had cured myself but i realise it was a delusional phase again! been dissociating in the shower for the past 6 hours iâ€™m just wrecked and shocked that iâ€™m in this place again!! anyone else w/schizophrenia or delusional disorders ever convince themselves theyâ€™re of sane mind?? always a horrible time when that delusion breaks ://
