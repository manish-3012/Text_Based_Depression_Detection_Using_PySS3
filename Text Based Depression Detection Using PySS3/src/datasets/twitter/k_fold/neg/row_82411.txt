I don't know what to do, I'm in a motelSo yeah: 
My parents have always fighted, constantly, non-stop, it's been annoying. It would always get violent, the cops would be called and things would be broken. Now, my mom has blowed all of the money out of our wallets and we haven't had enough to pay our rent, so we got evicted and went to a crappy motel, then we went to another motel that we got evicted from because of, you guessed it, a fight where the cops were called. Now we are in this motel and everyone was happy, but recently my mom spent 80$ on food and now it's crap again. I feel like ending it all but I just don't know what to do, my little brother loves me and I want to watch him grow up, what do I do?
