Slowly starting to feel suicidal ideationMy life has been a fucking wreck lately. The will to push on has been harder and harder.

When covid hit i started drinking again to fall asleep. 

I hid this from my gf for awhile before realizing i needed help and checked myself into rehab.

My gf and i tried to work through things, but my loss of self and insecurities ultimately led to the failure of our relationship. She broke up with me and my world shattered.

I realize how badly i fucked up and how far from where i wanted to be. 
The feelings of guilt are insurmountable, the anxiety and depression have left me numb and exhausted. I cant sleep, im losing weight, nothing feels real and everything feels fake.

I feel as though this is some new normal, that this was caused by my drinking and it has left me hopeless. 

Ive tried to do things to correct myself, but they all seem to fail. 
Work has been painful and exhausting. It gives me no joy. 
I cant think straight.
My relationships are strained.
Today i felt so numb that i couldnt even cry.
I have started to feel complacent, like whats the fucking point. I feel selfish. I feel embarrassed. 
This all came so quick that i cant even process any of it.

I lay awake for hours thinking and sleep has been nearly impossible. 

I want to fucking die, but the motivation for that isnt even there. 

Nothing brings me happiness, my gf was the one thing that made me feel normal, and now she too is gone. And its my fucking fault.

I cant live like this.

The more i try to feel normal and fail, the more hopeless i feel.

Ive told my mom and she tells me i need tk reach out to God. I have, it doesnt make me feel different. 

Im going to try therapy, but if that doesnt work then im out.
