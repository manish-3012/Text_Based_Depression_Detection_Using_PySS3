Not sure anymore...Well i dont know where to start so ig we will start around 5th grade where i think i mostly started to get sad and keep in mind im in highschool now but anyways Now that i got the backstory out of the way here we go: I honestly feel nothing anymore and i lost interest in absolutely everything especially the things that made me happy the most and now on most days i still do the things that used to make me happy hoping that happiness will come back to me but everyday is a loop of any other day and i have a hard time making friends since im weird ig and im not really much of a talker and my family doesnt seem to make me happy anymore either ive seem to be sleeping more due to the lack of energy and interest and i really dont feel like im worthless and i just feel like i rather be better off not here on this planet since whats the difference between dead and feeling nothing right? Yes ive thought about taking my life and have cut a little bit these past few months and ive talked about it to a few friends which is good cause i never really thought id reach out but here i am on reddit telling a thousands of people how i feel so i can get an opinion on how i feel.
