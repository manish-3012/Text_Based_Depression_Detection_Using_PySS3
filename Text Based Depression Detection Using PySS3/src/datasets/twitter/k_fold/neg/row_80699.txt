please help meSuicideWatch is probably not the place to go for comfort considering that most of us are suffering, but I just need a person to help me.

Iâ€™ve been depressed for nearly 8 years and Iâ€™m only 19 years old.  I havenâ€™t gone through any sort of abuse that most people have gone through, and I grew up in a hardworking middle class family.

I want to die so much though.

Anytime something goes wrong, I think about dying.
Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s healthy behavior of a suicidal person lmao, but I fantasize about dying a lot.
I think about different ways to kill myself and itâ€™s become normal for me.

I donâ€™t think I want attention, but maybe I do.

I have a nice family and a nice boyfriend and good friends, but I feel so lonely and unimportant I want to die.  Iâ€™m lacking in love and I want to be taken care of the same way I take care and think of people.

I donâ€™t know what to do, but I feel like suicide is the only way out and the time slot for that choice is getting shorter.

I want to give up sigh
