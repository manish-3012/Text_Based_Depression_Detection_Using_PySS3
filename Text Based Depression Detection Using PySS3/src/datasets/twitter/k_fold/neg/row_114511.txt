2017 may be my last yearSo I've decided that I've experienced way too much pain in my life to keep waiting for better days. I'm very lonely and really struggle to make friends. Never had a gf, 26 years old, the whole 9 yards. My life is in shambles. If I don't sort my life out I'm going to commit suicide at the end of 2017. To fight for my life this is what I'm going to do: I'm going to quit my 13 year porn addiction. I'm going to sleep and wake up the same time everyday. Gym 2-4 times a week. Eat as healthy as I can. I'm already back to college, going to work my ass of to put myself in a better situation financially and get a job. I'm going to work on my social skills. I also want to help poor people in some way. If I'm still the unhappy recluse at the end of the year, I'll end it all. So this is my public ultimatum, will keep you updated throughout the year.
