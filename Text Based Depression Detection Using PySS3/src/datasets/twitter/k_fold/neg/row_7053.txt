...Hi, im just 11 years old. My relationship with my family isn't very good anymore. It's rare when we won't get into a fight, It's just a daily thing now, I have 1friend who is all in living for at the moment. I was a perfect student but this year it all went downhill, The fights with my mom are always about Where in going, what im doing, school, and my attidute with my siblings. I can't help it. Just something in my head says Hit Her, and dumb me does it, I can't control it, . I swear in not gonna be alive at 18years old, I've been having panic attacks at school to, At some point I just can't stand in the class anymore, i wanna run out the door and go home, I've never told anyone about this, but who u can talk this about to? My hand is full of scars of cutting, I don't care anymore, I would just go out earphones on and just walking on the railway, I don't care about life anymore, If someone would help me, it would be great...
