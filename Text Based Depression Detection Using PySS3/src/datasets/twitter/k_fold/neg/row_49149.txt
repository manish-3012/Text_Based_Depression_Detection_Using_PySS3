Recent news is highly triggering for meI apologise in advance if any rules are broken here, but I donâ€™t really know where else I can spill my mind without facing judgement so. 

Iâ€™m sat in a hell hole of people who dog piled me a year ago, now all sat talking about how we need to be nicer. How we need to think before we speak. These are the people who would happily see me die, have created hostile environments in my life, but would be the first to wish me peace if I finally died. Itâ€™s making me feel so rocky and uneasy. I donâ€™t have the words for it exactly, but itâ€™s affecting my mental state and Iâ€™ve had to take myself out of so many situations further isolating me. 

I am (still) waiting for help from a MH team. Itâ€™s taking forever and Iâ€™m holding on but the longer time passes the more I feel like this is just how itâ€™s supposed to be. Iâ€™m simply a commodity, a whipping boy, the scape goat for others to treat me badly because â€˜you started itâ€™. I hurt right now. I just want it to stop.
