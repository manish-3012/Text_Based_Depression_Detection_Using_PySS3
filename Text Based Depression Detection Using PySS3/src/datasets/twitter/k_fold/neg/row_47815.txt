I want to attempt suicide in a cry for helpi turn 16 next saturday. i canâ€™t function like this. things are so dull and lifeless.  iâ€™ve been severely depressed and anxious for over 5 years but camhs refuse to give me any treatment under the reasoning of iâ€™m not bad enough and doctors have given up referring me there when iâ€™ve been denied multiple times. i just want to slightly overdose on something and call 999. iâ€™ve been actively suicidal for, i think, the first time in over a year. i donâ€™t have the guts to do it
