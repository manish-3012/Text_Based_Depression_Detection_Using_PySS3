I feel like a burden to the worldI really don't want to live. I think about suicide often, and how some people might be sad. But I also think about what a useless heap of garbage i am, and how I don't contribute anything to the world. I'm just breathing everyone else's air. I feel guilty. There's so much guilt that it almost physically hurts me. But I can't say anything to the people I know because the thought would just create another burden to them.
