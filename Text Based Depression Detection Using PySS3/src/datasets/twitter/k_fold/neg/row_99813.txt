I thought they were supposed to help..Well I admitted I need help and therapy and how when I was way younger (like 8) my moms ex boyfriend's son molested me. My doctor had to fill out a report (I said I didn't want it tho but "it's the law") and he fucking put it as my moms ex did it. When he didn't -.- but now CPS is involved and they have it that my moms ex husband is still in the house after that crap happened, and so now we have to have the police come to our house (OR SCHOOL LIKE LAST TIME) and get in contact with my biological father whom in which I have no relationship with (I can't stand him anyways) 

I didn't want this.. I didn't sign up for ANY OF THIS. I just wanted therapy and that's all and now they are flipping everything upside down and it's making me feel shitty because I know my mom is already tired of this shit that happened so fucking long ago. THIS is the type of crap that makes me not even wanna talk to anyone. I don't even want any help anymore. I just want to stay to myself. Now they are trying to make me relive a traumatizing situation and escalating so high. This is hurting my mental state so fucking bad and I just can't stand it. They are hurting me more than they are suppose to be helping I'd rather just get rid of myself so it'll fucking be over. I never wanted all this trouble.
