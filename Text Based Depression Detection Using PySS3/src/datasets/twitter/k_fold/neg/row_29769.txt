I'm Worthless, Completely Worthless...It's been happening alot lately (about 5-6 months)

Can't sleep as much, Barely eating, and feeling completely useless. One of my friends from work killed himself last year and it's been hard on me. 

I feel as i don't belong. I'm always quiet, have very few (if any) friends, No job, No bike, no nothing.
I have Asperger's Syndrome and i've begun to pick up on social cues and i got the biggest "fuck off" in my life today. All of my friends are "Busy or Working". Then i look on Facebook. They're out at Six Flags, or something of that sort.
And one of the Guys at my fire department said yesterday that he was having a barbeque and that he was inviting everyone from the department over. I asked him if i could come. He immediately responded "Personal Party. Sorry try next time" but if it was a personal party, then why is everyone else going? Is it because i'm quiet? Is it because i'm Weird? 
I just don't care about life anymore. I just want to go into the woods and hang myself from the tallest tree and leave a note in my hand "If you didn't like me, just say it. It wouldn't have made anymore of a difference now would it?" 
I feel worthless, unwanted, and I feel as i am better off dead.

I Seriously wish i was born normal...
It would make everything soo much easier then it already is

Probably the next time there is a House fire or something, ill just run in and NEVER come out...
