I have reached my destinationIt took a while this time around, I havenâ€™t always gone into things with 100% commitment before. I believe I have set my house in order this time so there are no loose ends.
I have perhaps been too feeble minded and allowed myself to be distracted for too often and most-of the time they have provided false hope of making the intrusions stay away. For too long I have sat with the tools and I believe I am ready this time.
I always find it odd typing here and other places as I donâ€™t know what I will find if anything. I am devoid of the feeling or want of care, most of the time I can only see the end, the journey to it is just a nuisance.
I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m saying, Iâ€™m tired and I doubt Iâ€™m making any sense.
I will be alone tomorrow, it has been a while and I will try again and pray that this time the ticket is clipped, I know what I want to do.
