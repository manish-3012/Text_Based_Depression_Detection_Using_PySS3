A friend of mine told me he tried to kill himself.So I've been friends with this guy for about ten years. We butted heads a few times but still pretty good friends. We used to party a ton. When I knew him he had his shit together a little bit, but eventually he moved back in with his parents. Then they kicked him out and put him in a trailer park. 

When that happened he called and asked if he could come live with me, which he's asked about before. I tried to tell him that he wouldn't like living in my town (it's shitty and small), which is the truth.  I told him it was a possibility, but my situation is up in the air, I might move any month now, and I would have to ask my landlord about it etc. 

So he tells me he tried to kill himself with his prescription drugs.  I told him I didn't know what to say to him, and he said that's what his mom said. I told him he should get sober, that drug and alcohol abuse are causing the problems he has in his life. He was like, I don't know if they're causing all my problems, for one I never have money. And I was like drugs and alcohol don't help with that. 

But I texted him a week ago and he hasn't texted back. I texted him today and still nothing. I don't know his parent's phone number so I can't call them. Not sure what to do.
