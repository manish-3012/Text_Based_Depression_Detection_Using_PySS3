One reason to liveMy son.  That's it.  I love my wife and certain family but that just doesn't seem to help. I hate most of my job, I feel alone, I feel helpless and hopeless.  I recently self harmed which I am ashamed of.  I can't get thoughts of just wanting to die out of my head.  I've become more and more bitter about life in general that I continue to question if it is worth it.
