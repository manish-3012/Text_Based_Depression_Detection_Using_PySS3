So. My boyfriend cheated on me with... You guessed it. My best friendTo be honest this happened a couple months ago.

I met her on a reddit support sub over a year ago. We called each other every day, sometimes spoke for up to an hour or over. We told each other everything.

We visited her for the first time. Drove three hours there.

When i was upstairs or out smoking they blew each other. Sexual acts you get it. They tried to get me into a threesome the next day.

I found out they'd done something via a mutual friend. She cuts herself for attention because i was upset . I mean. She needs stitches. I can't exactly be angry... Ha.

We drove home. A week later she calls me and says she blew him. I hang up. He tells me every sordid detail.

I got undressed and hurt my leg. I was covered in blood. I bled and cried. He tried to leave and I told him in a sudden rage I'd kill myself if he went home. He stayed with me. We left the house and went to his. Bleeding through my clothes.

I'm still with him. It's gotten a lot better. But how can i ever trust him. How can he ever trust me.

It's starting to feel like it never happened. I'm moving on. Feeling more trusting and able to communicate. I no longer think of her every time i touch him sexually.

And that pisses me off. I shouldn't still love him. I shouldn't want him. Every time he looks at me and kisses me, tells me he loves me, holds my hand, cuddles me etc my heart melts.

And that **really fucking pisses me off**

Tbh some days i think about killing myself just because i love him yet I'm with somebody that i still suffer with niggling doubts. Some days the idea of killing myself to escape my self hatred, low self esteem and paranoia feels like the only way out.

I don't know whether to be thankful or upset that I'm moving on, and the above days are getting rarer.

There's something comforting about being tucked between rage and depression. All my life since my diagnosis at 11 years old.
