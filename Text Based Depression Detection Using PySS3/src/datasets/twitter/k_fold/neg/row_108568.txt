i just think theyâ€™ll get over itsure, it will hurt at first, iâ€™m not going to doubt that. anytime someone dies itâ€™s hard to deal with, even if you didnâ€™t know that person well. but people move on and get over it and iâ€™m willing to bet that within a few months or even a few weeks, no one will care anymore. theyâ€™ll keep going about their lives and itâ€™ll be okay. 

i just have a hard time believing anyone cares that much. like yes personally if one of my friends did the alivenâ€™t then i would probably never be fully over it but i also am just way too emotional. but i think the people around me would handle it well. also itâ€™s just cruel to ask me to keep going when it hurts so much, like if they really cared then they wouldnâ€™t stop me. at the very least, theyâ€™d be happy that i finally got what i wanted.

people need to get more comfortable with death. weâ€™re all going to die, iâ€™m just making the choice about when and how. thereâ€™s power in that, and i wish people would acknowledge it.
