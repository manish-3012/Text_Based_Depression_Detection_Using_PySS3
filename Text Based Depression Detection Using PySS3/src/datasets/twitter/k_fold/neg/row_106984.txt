I feel like life is pointless, and I've been contemplating suicide for several years. Hello.  

I've been contemplating suicide for several years now.  

I don't think life is worth living.  It is just a bunch of work and then a little TV or video games or reddit or something else mildly enjoyable at the end of the day, and then more work the next day.  Maybe a couple weeks of vacation during the year, but still fifty weeks of work. 

I feel like a slave.  I have no desire to continue living like this.

I feel it is all so pointless and meaningless and miserable.  

What do you think?  How do you find meaning, even as an insignificant cog in a machine?
