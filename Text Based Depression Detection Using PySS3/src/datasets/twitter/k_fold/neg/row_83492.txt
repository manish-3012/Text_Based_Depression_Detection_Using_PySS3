I hope I can do it today.I have done some pretty bad stuff as a child Not only have I watched porn, I literally thought to myself at the age of 9, 10, 11 or 12 maybe, I am not sure "Someone could have sex with a corpse, if they are horny, right? Because a corpse doesn't live, so what's the matter?" I think I even masturbated to thoughts like these...I think I found it disgusting after thinking this, but I am kind of scared of what I could have done if I had the chance to do it as a child, how am I able to live, with those memories, of my own thoughts? I really want to kill myself for this...who would love me if they knew this? I am disgusting...I am going to kill myself...I have even assaulted my own sister as a 13 year old...I can never have a partner...
