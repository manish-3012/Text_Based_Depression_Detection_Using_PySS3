my mom kicked me out days before christmas and now im contemplating suicide againI'm stuck in a quarantine shelter and I'm ugly. I just wish to god I can find a room and start repairing myself but just s bunch of waiting around is killing me both figuratively and soon literally. I'm near central park and I wanna hang myself from a tree.
