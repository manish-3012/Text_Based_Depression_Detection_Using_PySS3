Less than a week to go.My plan is this time next week I will be gone. This new job isn't working out, and a lot rests on my getting a job. No one else will hire me, due to lack of experience. And I cannot go back to fast food. 
I need a job with a definite paycheque and this one doesn't fit the bill. I'm sick of just accepting what is. I can't do this anymore.
