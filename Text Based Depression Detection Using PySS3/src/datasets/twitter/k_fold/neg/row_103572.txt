I realised that no matter how good my therapist is, I won't be able to get betterI just got back from a new therapist and she made me feel comfortable. She's kind and attentive and I didn't feel blamed, well not much anyway. But just now my mom asked me what I talked about with my therapist, and though I didn't want to talk about it, my mom provoked me by assuming that I talked about my issues with my younger brother who is her GC. She told me "the therapist told you that you're the one at fault and he's the right one, right?". I was enraged and told her that no, she didn't say that. She kept on provoking and blaming me for hating her GC, so I croaked a bit and reminded her about the times when he threw a glass at my head and a plastic chair at me, and how my parents didn't reprimand him for it. Then I reminded her about the times when the words "because he's a boy" came out of their mouths to excuse their preferential treatment of him. She kept on trying to blame me for it and threatened to hit me again. I wish she did. She told me that if I don't like how she runs things, to try living on my own. I wish I did.

It doesn't matter how much I go to get help and how good the help I get is, because I always go home to them. If I off myself now, I don't have to face anyone anymore. I'm not afraid of pain nor death anymore. Maybe I should do it after all.
