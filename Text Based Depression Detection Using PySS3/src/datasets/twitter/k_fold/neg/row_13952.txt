is the struggle honestly worth it?sorry if this is formatted weird, i'm new to reddit
this was going to be about three times longer but i chickened out lmao
essentially i'm a senior in HS and i despise school and the way it's situated, thank fuck i'm almost done, but judging by how adults around me describe college and work and bills and yadda yadda, those things really aren't much better and are in fact waaaay more stressful, especially for a person like me who has social anxiety, body dysmorphia, probably at least one or two other mental problems, etc.
so if HS alone is borderline driving me to self harm, and everything afterwards isn't going to be much better, why should i even bother pushing on? maybe i should just end it before it gets worse? or is everything else not as bad as everyone says?
thanks in advance
