I am not a good personEveryone tells me I am. They tell me who I am, they don't know who I am. Maybe I'm polite because I'm afraid, maybe my friendliness is the undying animosity towards them because they have something I don't. I'm a coward. No matter how many times people praise me for who they think I am, they never care enough to dig deeper. They never care, I am taken for granted and the people who do that are the same people who act surprised when someone like me comits a regrettable act. I don't even know what I'm talking about anymore. I'm so tired of being alone, I'm tired of being jealous, I'm tired of being angry. The hate turns me sour on the inside, I cannot sleep, I cannot rest. Despite having no reason, my heart remains broken. So here I am, projecting my hollow self pitty onto the internet for all to see. I want what you want, I want to be happy. We all want that.
