Why I can't get rid of my height?Well I'm kinda sad about that fact that I'm short. I'm still young, 16, and 164.5cm but I hate it. Idk what to do, but when somehow "get rid of it" somebody in school or somewhere else have to tell me that "I'm short", "Worthless", "Dwarf "(btw I live in relative tall country and normal height for male here is about 181-182cm) or smh that makes me feel sad, kinda depressed or smh. But I don't real friends who can I confess to without making fun of me... My grades are great, I know what I want to be in a future but still idk what to do.
