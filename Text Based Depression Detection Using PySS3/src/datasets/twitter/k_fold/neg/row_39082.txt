It does feel very dramatic to feel like ending my life, but at this point it seems like the only thing that will stop all of this painIt does feel very dramatic to feel like ending my life, but at this point it seems like the only thing that will stop all of this pain. The actual nature of death - being dead, putting other people through grief, through a traumatic event - isn't something I want to do. And I know that the people I miss right now who aren't missing me wouldn't even care, they'd just carry on with their lives regardless - just as they're doing now, without me. And even if they did start caring after I died, what good will that do me? I won't be there to see it. 

I hate also that you can't approach someone and say look, the way you've treated me has made me feel like ending my life. You're labelled as manipulative, or crazy, or whatever else. And perhaps it is - but I just see no other way of getting the person to understand the severity of what they've caused. Saying that, what could they really do about it, anyway. They caused it. They can't be the one to make it any better. 

I am so depressed that I'm unable to feel good about other people's achievements; I just feel envy or resentment that it's not happening to me. So that's why I just feel like ending things is probably the only way out. Not to suggest I'd do it, but I think about it all the time.
