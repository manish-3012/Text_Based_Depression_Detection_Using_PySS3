Stuck.If I had the guts, I would have jumped off a building already. If there was an easy way it would be done. Keeping myself alive everyday is so psychologically painful to me it feels like self-harm. 

I want to die just as much as I don't want to die so I feel extremely torn. I first began contemplating suicide in 2012. Things haven't gotten better since despite my efforts and optimism about some improvements. I've just come to realise all I'm doing is prolonging the suffering that has been ongoing for about 10 years. As much as I love the few who are close to me and care for me, my overwhelming sadness and suffering is greater so these relationships are irrelevant.

Iâ€™m lonely, stupid, strange; I donâ€™t belong here. I feel like an alien everyday. Not sure my problems can ever be solved; I feel like Iâ€™ve been deluding myself all this time by thinking they could be. I genuinely wonder what was the point of me being born, I just donâ€™t get it.

A reason I keep myself alive is because I feel it would be such a waste of my 21 years on the planet. If thereâ€™s consciousness after death, Iâ€™d feel bad for just throwing it away like that, but then again I didnâ€™t know how to work with the life, so what was I to do...? :(
