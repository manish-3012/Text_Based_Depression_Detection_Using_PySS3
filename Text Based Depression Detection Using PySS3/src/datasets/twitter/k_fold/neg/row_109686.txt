I can't stand people after a serious attemptI attempted about a year ago, was in coma for many days, got some permanent damage to my body. The straw that broke the camel's back was the final realization how little people care in general, how self-serving people generally are and often they do that at my expense. I asked for help, again and again to mental health professionals, friends, etc. No help came.
When I came to in the hospital, the medical staff was being terrible too. I got tied to the bed, and everything that I said was treated with contempt and as if I didn't know what I was talking about.
When I got home, I spent the next 1.5 months indoors and I came to really despise seeing other people. I  only ventured out on the balcony at night for a cigarette and would experience revolting aversion if someone happened to be outside as well. Weekly grocery shopping was a sickening experience.
I'm now much better and I'm not suicidal any more. I changed jobs and now I work entirely from home. But I still can't stand other human beings. I was sensitive even before, especially to sounds but this is another level. I hate neighbors mowing the lawn, I hate them having a BBQ, I hate talking to the shop assistant and my day is spoiled if they aren't too nice to me for whatever reason. Whenever I go outside, it feels like I am being prodded with a metal rod or scratched with some metal claws, like my space, like me being invaded. I am considering whether I should move to the middle of nowhere with noone around in the country since I only need internet to work.
Has anyone else experienced anything like this? How did you deal with it?
Please, don't advise that I should see a mental health professional. I came to realize that they didn't help me at all and in many cases actually made me feel worse, so I stay away from them.
