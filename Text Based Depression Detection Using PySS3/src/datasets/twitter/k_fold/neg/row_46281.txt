Everything is going to shitIn the last week my dog Iâ€™ve had over half my life died (she was killed by a hawk), my parents sold my childhood home (it was on the market less than two days, now I have to get out all my memories and everything Iâ€™ve ever owned by July 9th) and I just got into a low speed car accident that managed to destroy my back bumper (and Iâ€™m pretty sure Iâ€™m at fault/will have to pay for it). Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve been really suicidal and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m at that point currently, but fuck I donâ€™t exactly see life getting better. Whatâ€™s next? Everything is a goddamn disaster and I just canâ€™t deal with it. I donâ€™t want to deal with it.
