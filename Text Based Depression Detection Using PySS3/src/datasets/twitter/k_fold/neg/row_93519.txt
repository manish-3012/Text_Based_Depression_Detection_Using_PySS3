Depressed because I have no purpose in life. Can't find a purpose in life because I'm depressed.I can't keep a job. I will just give up because I'm so miserable doing unskilled labor when I know I could do so much more if given the opportunity, but those opportunities are gated beyond a college degree.

I can't go back to college. I will just fail again and waste more money. So I'm stuck with a high school diploma doing the kind of jobs that HS graduates are stuck doing. Jobs that make me miserable.

I can't enjoy friendship. I'm so miserable I bring down everyone around me despite the facade of happiness. Everyone i know succeeding at even the smallest things when I'm nearly failing simply keeping myself alive. Their actions invoke a sort of jealous rage of self-hatred and self-doubt. I'm so full of anger that when my friends finally do hangout with me, I'm so negative that it drives them away.

I can't find romance. I have zero spending cash so finding someone in a public place is nigh impossible. I don't even have something like tinder because I don't have a smartphone. Even if I somehow did find someone, I can't really comprehend romance because my Asperger's makes me so rigid and socially awkward that I can't conform to dating standards.

I can't feel love. Despite all the bullshit, knowing that people care about me just makes it all the worse. When my friends try to console me, I wonder why they waste time on someone like me. I cannot comprehend why they like me at all. It would be so much easier if no one cared about me so I could finally just end it without regret.

I can't turn to anyone. My parents are concerned but fail to realize the severity of the situation. They think things would just be better if I got a job at a factory, a job that would put me in even more misery than I'm in right now. My friends care, but they're busy dealing with their own blossoming lives, they can't take care of me while they're working 9-5 jobs and having romantic dinners with their significant others. I can't afford therapy -- my health insurance won't cover it anymore.

It's not as simple as having a positive outlook or looking forward to something.  The cycle is simply unending. The depression gnaws at my psyche -- constantly telling myself that I'm not good enough, and that I don't deserve happiness because I'm not good enough, and that lack of happiness continues to eat away at everything.
