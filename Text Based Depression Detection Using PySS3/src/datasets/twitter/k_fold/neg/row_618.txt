Not really suicidal, just depressed...For a while (a couple of years) I have been getting more and more depressed. However, I'm very good at hiding it, so the only people who know are my close friends who cared enough to listen to my stoned rants about how shitty my life is. 

Actually, that's not true. My life is great compared to a lot of people; my family rocks, I have (a decent amount) of money, I'm in college, and good friends. But there is one thing that has been missing from my life; a relationship. I'm basically your generic nerd redditor who has never had any intimate encounter with a girl. I'm 20 now, and it's awkward to admit. I have a girl I kind of like who I work with, but she's from Nepal and has a boyfriend so I pretty much have no hopes.

I really want to tell my parents how depressed and lonely I am, but I don't want to worry about me and spend tons of money on a therapist. They have enough worries without worrying about me. I know they would give me all the help in the world, but I just can't bring myself to telling them about it. Every time my Mom randomly asks "Are you O.K?", I think for a second to say no and tell her everything. But instead I smile, say "Of course Mom!", and move on with my life.

Anyways, I just wanted to vent here because I know the people here will listen. It actually really helps to type out my feelings like this.
