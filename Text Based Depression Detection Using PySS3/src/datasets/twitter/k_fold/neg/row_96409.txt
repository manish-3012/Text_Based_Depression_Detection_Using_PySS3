If god is real, I bet everything I own that he hates meI have nothing to be thankful for. Anytime an opportunity to advance myself has come up, it has been denied to me. Any time I felt grateful or happy about anything, there has been an accompanying disappointment that brought me back down to the pile of shit I live in.

If god is real, I am his toy, and I hate him for this. Life has been one spit in the face after another for me. I often find myself fantasizing about committing mass murder before finally killing myself. It's a comforting thought while I'm constantly being kicked while I'm already down. Fuck everything. Words can't do justice to show how much I fucking hate myself and everything around me.
