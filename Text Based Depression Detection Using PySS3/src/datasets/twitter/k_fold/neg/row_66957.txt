I don't know where to goI have the worse pain in my life. It is not in my head, it is not in my mind, it is killing my chest. My heart wont stop and I can't eat. I'm trying to keep it together at work, but I'm in so much pain. 

I had a girl I was going to ask to marry me and I just found the guy she's been seeing while she was away with the Ameri corps. I don't know what to do, this has been 5 days and I'm lost. I have no spirit and no matter what I do, this pain won't go away. 

Help.
