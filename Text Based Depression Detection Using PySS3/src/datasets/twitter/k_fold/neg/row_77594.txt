I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m still suicidalItâ€™s been three years since Iâ€™ve last acted on any thoughts of self-harm or tried to kill myself. My life has been good so far and my boyfriend of one year is blissfully snoring besides me but I find myself laying wide awake with thoughts of killing myself. Thereâ€™s just something appealing about being here one moment and gone the next. Death seems rather euphoric and I keep envisioning how Iâ€™m going to die and for some reason, I keep imagining myself dying in the most violent ways and I feel at peace with myself. Thereâ€™s nothing in my life that makes me feel like Iâ€™m being tipped over the edge. It feels like I want to kill myself on a whim without reason or rhyme. 

I was formerly medicated but discontinued since I canâ€™t afford medication. The same goes with therapy. I just want to know what other people think about this because I somewhat worry I might kill myself on a whim just to achieve that euphoric feeling of nothingness.
