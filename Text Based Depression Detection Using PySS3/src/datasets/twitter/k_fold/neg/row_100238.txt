I hate everything about myself. I hope I die a painful death.I am a nobody. I will never be anything. I'll never succeed in everything. I've never succeeded in anything and I never will. I will never be able to accept myself. Its 100% impossible for anyone in the world to look at me and find one good quality. All I am is an inconvenience. I will never do anything right. I will never be good enough and I want to just end myself right now. I wish for myself the most painful death imaginable. I want to hang myself right now. I want to stop breathing right now. Then I won't be able to curse anyone with my presence ever again. It would be a net positive for the universe to rid itself of the subhuman garbage that I am.
