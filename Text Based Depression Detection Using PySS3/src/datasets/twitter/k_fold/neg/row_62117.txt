i should be able to end my life with no debates.i know this sounds clichÃ©, and it said a lot, which I feel like is right. but its true. i didn't ask to be born into this world, i didnt ask to be born, i didnt ask to be alive.  you know why people go to prison for murder? because they dont have the right to end someones life. they shouldnt get to control the when someone time comes to an end. i didnt have the right to choose to be here, i should have the right to take myself out.
