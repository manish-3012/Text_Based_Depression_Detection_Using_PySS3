I'm a terrible person who will never find loveI'm 25, turning 26 in August. I've never had an LTR or PiV sex. Just blowjobs and hand jobs. This has made me really bitter. I just want to be loved. It would make me feel much better about myself if I could find someone who loves me. But that's not going to happen. I have 4 accounts on reddit, all banned from /r/askwomen beecause I was mean and said some misygonistic things (I wished rape on several women on there). I know that's terrible, and it makes me feel terrible. I just don't know how to vent my anger properly. 

Knowing that I've been banned on all 4 accounts from /r/askwomen just goes to show that no woman will ever find me desireable. On top of that I don't even have a steady job at the moment. 

I'm so tired of hurting.
