I'm gonna commit by October 1stThe reason I have come to this conclusion is as stated in my last SuicideWatch post. My super mega plus ultra crush, Isaac, isn't dating anyone because (presumably) his girlfriend cheated or something. Anyway, this destroyed me and all my happiness. I was surviving on the fact that he could still say yes, so this news devastated me. So, I know all you guys are gonna say that I should just get over him or I'll be over him soon. But I start to doubt it more and more everyday, because my obsession just keeps growing and growing more and more and it's just horrible. I love him so much that I would give him everything if it meant just one day with him. If he heard that though, he would never want to talk to me again because he would be really creeped out. That's the one problem that was keeping us apart. He's creeped out by almost everything I do. I admit, I have done really creepy stuff to him in the past, so it's probably my fault that he felt/feels that way. But anyway, that one of the big reasons for me committing suicide. I have a few more, but those would make this thing too big, I'm only putting up my main reason. I say that I'm gonna do it by October, but I'll probably do it tonight or tomorrow.
