There isnâ€™t any turning backMy college is expensive to be in, Iâ€™m already going full time for the summer, and Iâ€™ve just been laid off of my part time job, it takes a long time to get a job and this one wasnâ€™t great, it was kind of humiliating, but it paid weekly, I need a steady source of income in order to finance myself, I still need to get things like gas and food, but jobs take about a month to pay you, so Iâ€™m pretty much screwed. I donâ€™t have a girlfriend, or friends for that matter, and I canâ€™t tell my family what happened or Iâ€™ll never hear the end of it, funny thing is they havenâ€™t worked hard in their lives, as evidenced by my living situation, but Iâ€™ll be damned if I hear anything from them. The best thing to do seems to be suicide, Iâ€™m better off not living than living in a tight spot anyways.
