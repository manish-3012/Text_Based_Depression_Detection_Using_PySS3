I donâ€™t know where to go anymore.I am USAF. Thatâ€™s about all Iâ€™ll give. I donâ€™t know if I want to keep being alive. 

I have been a maintainer for about 15 years. I have worked C-130s and F-15s and now I work on F-22s. I thought that I would be happier on an airframe that was easier. Lighter workload, easier maintenance. But I find myself just as unhappy as when I was on legacy aircraft. My wife is depressed too. I think we hate each other but we tell each other that weâ€™re in love because we both grew up in abusive families with step parents and we donâ€™t want to hurt our children. (We have 3).
