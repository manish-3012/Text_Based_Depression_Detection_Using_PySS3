I donâ€™t know how to continue.Hey all el momo here. I have cancer and depression and a lot of other stuff. Recently Iâ€™ve tried to help people on this sub by talking to them and trying to comfort them. I feel like Iâ€™m not worth anything if i donâ€™t do this and I feel like I can never help enough.  I canâ€™t really interact with folks my age because I have a very weakened immune system. If anyone wants to talk I really need it. Thanks.
