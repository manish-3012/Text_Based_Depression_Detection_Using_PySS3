This is really, really long. I started typing and just kind of exploded.(First off, no hard feelings if you take one look at this and go "nope, too long." I don't want anyone to feel obligated, I am NOT at immediate threat, as the first paragraph will indicate)

I honestly don't know how much longer I can take this. I've had suicidal episodes before, but I never got close to the edge because thinking of the pain I'd cause those around me was too much. But now I'm getting to the point where that matters less to me than my own pain. Right now the only thing holding me back is my dog. She loves me, waits for me by the door until I get home every day, and never leaves my side once I'm home. Everyone else in my life, while they might never agree with or forgive my suicide, I could at least give an explanation why. But I cannot leave my dog wondering where I've disappeared to for the rest of her life. If she wasn't here, though, or if something happened to her? I wouldn't be writing this up right now.

I have a shitty part time job that I can't stand that only gives me enough hours to keep my head above water paying off my share of rent and student loans for a fucking worthless degree in philosophy that I was an idiot to get. I've been searching for a fulltime (or a supplemental part time) job for the 2 years since college ended, with no luck. I'm applying to everything I'm even partially qualified for. The best I've gotten was a group interview. None of the other places have even called me back. I've tried joining the Americorps and the Coast Guard, neither were interested in me. This leaves me still stuck living at home, in a rural area, without a car, which severely limits employment and social opportunities.

Well it used to be home. Back in April, my mother decided she was sick of my dad, so she and my sister found a small house and moved out. My dad said if I could convince one of my friends to move in, we could stay at that house. So I did, but after she moved in, he changed his mind and decided to move to a smaller place after all. So now I live in a 2 bedroom house, and since my friend can afford more rent than I can, neither of the two rooms are mine. I sleep on a futon out in the living room/kitchen area. This makes being depressed fucking wonderful, having no privacy to cry or blast music unless I go down to the river and hope nobody's there.

Plus, without my mom or sister around, I don't have anyone to relate to or talk to. They live in the same town, only 5 minutes drive from me, but I never see them anymore. My dad's not an asshole, he just doesn't get the whole "being a father/husband" thing. The only time he ever really talks to me is when he wants me to do something. My roommate isn't really a close friend. We make smalltalk about video games and movies, but she couldn't care less about my issues, not enough to even ask me what's wrong when I'm obviously on the brink. She's too busy having her boyfriend over every single night.

I've given up hope on getting a relationship myself. I don't understand how to talk to people I don't already know. I just can't do it. What the fuck do you talk about? Every girl that I do manage to get into a conversation is, without fail in a relationship. Even the ones I'm not attracted to. It's a statistical anomaly, but it's true. What makes it worse is that I always hear the same thing from my female friends. "You're fun to talk to and you're pretty decent looking. Someone's bound to snatch you up eventually." But words don't mean a whole lot. I could deal with being alone with my escapism, if not for being forced to listen to my roommate and her boyfriend every night. They try to be quiet, but it's a small house. And to be completely honest, the sex-sounds don't bother me half as much as hearing whispers and soft laughter at midnight, and knowing I'm never going to have anyone to talk to me like that.

I can't remember the last fucking time I've had a hug, and that's all I want right now. What I really want is one from somebody who is hugging me just because they're happy to see me, but at this point I'd even settle for a pity one. Just someone in my life who notices how much I'm hurting and actually gives a shit.

The worst part is this fucking curse that's been following me for years. I just never get the chance to be happy with life. Every time I get my hopes up for something that looks like it will turn out well, or every time things start going well for me, it's just a trick so that life can kick me in the teeth while my guard is down. Examples, because without them, I know all I'm going to get is "no, no, that's just how you're *perceiving* things!" 

1. Perfect full-time job opens up within walking distance of my house. I send in a resume, and mention that I applied to a friend. She tells me she's best friends with the manager of the place, and will talk to her to put in a good word for me. Calls me back the next day saying her friend the manager was interested in me and would be giving me a call soon for an interview. Then nothing. Finally I find out that shortly afterward, one of the manager's OTHER friends applied for the job herself and got it instantly.

2. Female friend from high school gets back in touch with me, wanting to get together and hang out. We end up talking and spending time together CONSTANTLY over the next week. They were my happiest days in recent memory, the only time I can think of where I enjoyed living instead of just using some form of escapism to keep me less depressed. She, normally a less-than-happy person, was feeling the same. She's in a relationship, but that it's "on a break" and mentions regularly how unhappy it's getting. Despite my intentions not to fall for her, and (assumedly) hers not to fall for me, chemistry kept building until it got to the point where we had to talk about it. She admitted that yes, it was the happiest she'd been for a long time, there was definite chemistry, and she caught herself intentionally flirting with me at times... But that she really wanted to make her unhappy relationship work, and the only way to do that was to stop talking and spending time with me, despite it making both of us happier than ever. Sorry, that's it, your newfound happiness has just been whisked away. Hope you enjoyed it while it lasted.

These are just the two latest in a long, unbroken pattern of me getting my hopes up about something and dashed on the rocks. For every rung I climb up the ladder, I slip down two. I feel like I'm being trained pavlov-style to duck and cringe whenever things start looking up, because it *always ends this way*. I never make any sort of progress in life that sticks. I'm in the same fucking spot I was in two years ago, only older and with less chances. I just want a job where I can support myself, or someone in my life who really cares about me, or some form of creative hobby that I enjoy and am good at. I just want some form of long-term enjoyment or self-esteem in life that doesn't come from fiction and video games, which is the only way I can really be happy anymore.
