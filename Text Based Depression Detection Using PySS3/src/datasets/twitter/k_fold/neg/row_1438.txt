Iâ€™m killing myself this year.Iâ€™ve made my mind up on this.

I canâ€™t even handle just being a friend. I fall apart too easily to be dependable. Iâ€™m an awful person and friend.

I canâ€™t do anything right anymore. I come away from every fucking thing I do feeling like Iâ€™m just an absolutely pathetic piece of garbage. I just canâ€™t do this, I hurt every fucking day, Iâ€™m completely broken.
