Itâ€™s Friday, and you need to read this.Todayâ€™s the day to get out of bed! Get off that couch, or get the hell out of that chair, yâ€™all. Start by sitting up wherever you are right this second. 

Right now, I want you to take a deep breath in through your nose, and slowly breathe it out through your mouth. Take another deep breath in, this time focus on the roof of your mouth and your tongue; relax those muscles, let your tongue fall away from the roof of your mouth, and breathe all the way out. Repeat this breathing technique, focusing further on your lungs and your rib cage. Feel each breath slowly touching your nostrils, pulling downward into your chest, filling your lungs. Consider your posture now, letting your shoulders roll back and your neck pull up as your lungs fill with fresh air. 

Your body is likely sore from sleeping too much, or not enough, and I know that story all too well. 

Youâ€™re alive today, and I challenge you to stand up, stretch the body your mind has been neglecting, and get into the shower. Practice the breathing technique in the shower or a hot bath, being mindful of how your body feels. Listen to it when it speaks today. Youâ€™ve got this!
