feeling guilty/ "hanging in there" is the same as a gambling addictioni post on here so much like an attention whore. and no matter how kind you guys are, how helpful you all are, i still feel shitty again. people have it way worse than me i have no right to complain. 
being suicidal makes me feel like a gambler. everyday i put all my money on the idea that today is when that magical 'around the corner' day arrives and things start getting better. the day everyone tells me to "hang in there" for. every fucking day i lose. 
theres only so much loss one person can take. eventually, soon, ill do it. probably with a gun because i dont want to feel pain, but i dont want to leave a mess either. maybr ill get drunk then go outside and freeze to death. i heard thats pretty painless and the alcohol makes you feel warm regardless. 
one day. one day when i stand up for myself and kill myself. but until then im just a pathetic whiney piece of shit.
