I just donâ€™t know anymore.Iâ€™m sorry, I really just need somewhere to rant and I donâ€™t know where else to. Just events that happen through this year and I really need to let it all out.

2020. The start of a new year, what felt to be my best year yet. I worked a year to buy a car, turning 18 in March. Oh if I knew what was coming. The one thing I had always loved was cars, and I was finally so happy to get my own. February, I get my first girlfriend. Things seem great, right Ryan? No. I didnâ€™t know what I was getting into. My girlfriend left me on the day I graduated high school, no reason given - walked out blocked me without a trace. I knew it. I shouldâ€™ve known better. Iâ€™ve already been hurt so much before why did I even try to give effort to someone else. 3 days later, I was kicked out. Parents were done with me. Iâ€™m living in my car, my last sense of security and hope. All I care about, I put so much of an emotional investment into it, what a mistake I made. June 27th, 10:02 PM. It happened. The last thing keeping me together was taken, my car, totaled, landing myself in the hospital for the night. Crying, lost, feeling helpless. My parents chose to take me back in. It wasnâ€™t the same anymore. All it was for me is blame. â€œItâ€™s your fault everything happenedâ€ â€œitâ€™s your fault that youâ€™re a failure.â€ Permanently injured from the accident, nowhere to turn, no car, family just dragging me down telling me to do better. All I hear now is bad, arguing, and that Iâ€™m the let down of the family. Well, if Iâ€™m the let down, I guess this is it. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I lost everything I cared for and about. I lost my path. I lost my friends to COVID - guess they werenâ€™t really who I thought they were. Lost my family - kicked out again as of tonight, nothing to get me by. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m so lost, I donâ€™t know if I can ever get myself out of this. Iâ€™m sorry everyone, Iâ€™m sorry.
