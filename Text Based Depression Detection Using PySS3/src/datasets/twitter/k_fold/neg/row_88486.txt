I'm fucking patheticI'm typing this up after crying my eyes out for the last ten minutes just wishing I'd drop dead. I'm in such a shitty situation right now. It doesn't even sound that bad thinking about it, typing it out, but every night I go to sleep wishing I'd just die, and then I dream, I have these fantastic dreams where I can't even remember what happens, I just remember I'm happy in those dreams, and when I wake up its gone, back to my garbage life.

For the last 4 years of high school I've had 0 motivation. I'm missing so many credits and I skip school to stay home to cry and sleep. I see all these people, so excited and happy to be leaving the school to move on with their lives, and I'm here, no drive, no aspirations, just my self pity.

Prom was last night, I almost didn't go because I didn't see a point. A friend of mine was going who I honestly really like so I decided to go. My friend convinced me to dance with her and we did, we slow danced and got really intimate. It felt like these clouds had cleared up, maybe I can actually change my attitude around for the better. She was going to an after party at a mutual friends so I decided to go to. The same friend who convinced me to dance with her was cuddling her, and at the end of the night kissed her on the cheek. Idk if it was because they were drunk or whatever but a part of me died that night.

So now I'm here, going to reddit for some god knows why. If I had a gun in my house I'd have used it by now. I'm so lost
