Fake friends?So I was very good friends with this person for like 5 years. Eventually I got depressed as fuck and she was the only one who knew. She always told me she cared so much about me etc. etc. I even told her I almost killed myself at the end of last year and she said she cant lose me etc. in july or something we both graduated and she hasn't contacted me since. How is it possible that you dont even check up on someone who literally told you that he almost killed himself? And yeah you can make the argument its not her responsibility but if she didn't care she should've told me that before, and not lie to my face by saying she cared and couldn't lose me. How can people be this fucked.
