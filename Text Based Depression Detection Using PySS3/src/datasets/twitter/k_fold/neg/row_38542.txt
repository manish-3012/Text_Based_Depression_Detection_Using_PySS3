Catharsis and you: Why you should swing by /r/talk.Regularly maintaining yourself emotionally is extremely important. One of the best ways to do this is to talk to others about what you're going through. /r/suicidewatch is the last line of defense. But it shouldn't have to get that desperate. Often times, people just don't feel like they can open up to anyone on a regular basis. I want to introduce you to /r/talk. The goal is catharsis- aka releasing the pressure that has built up internally. That happens by telling others what you're going through and getting feedback. No topic is too personal or too upsetting to bring up in /r/talk. Consider swinging by from time to time and letting out that pressure. It'll do you a world of good!
