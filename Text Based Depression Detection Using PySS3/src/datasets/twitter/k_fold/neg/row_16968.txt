I don't know what to do anymoreI posted this in another thread but lately I have been feeling more and more depressed and now I have started to think of suicide again so I figured I should post in here.

I hate my life. Every day I wish I would just stop breathing and die so that it can end. I am sure that I am transgendered and have a form for CAMH (which isn't a place I really want to go to first for therapy but its the place the doctor sent the recommendation to) but i haven't filled it out since Toronto is about an hours drive away so I have no way of getting there since I don't drive. My mom knows about this however I think she is kind of opposed to me becoming a girl. I want to change my image so that I look more girly but I am not sure how to go about that, I want a girlish looking hairstyle also but. Every day I wish I were born a girl and wish I would die and I don't know what to do anymore.
