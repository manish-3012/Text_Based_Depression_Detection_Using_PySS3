I can't stop thinking about suicide but if I do something about it, my life will be destroyed anyways.Hey guys, 

I don't know how much I want to say about what I do for a living, but I'm in an occupation that if it was found I'm considering suicide I would be absolutely destroyed. I do want help, but I cannot go somewhere where these thoughts end up in my medical record.

Things have gotten dark for me over the last couple years and I don't know why exactly. I find myself thinking about what death would be like all the time and weighing if it's worth living. I feel really fucked up about it because I also have a wife who I know loves me. I think I'm dragging her down with me too though. I know people are gonna suggest that I talk to her about this all, but I don't want to put it on her. I also don't want her to freak out and call a doctor or something. Many years ago I went through several weeks of panic attacks and told her afterwards that I had considered suicide and it was one of the only times I've made her cry. 

I already know my options for how I would kill myself and many of them aren't that bad. I guess the main other option I'm considering is just leaving everything behind and starting a new life somewhere else. I don't know if that would last though. I just think things would be simpler if I was dead.

I don't know if any of this makes sense since it was just a string of thoughts essentially. It's kind of how things have been lately. I'm not sad. I'm just ambivalent about everything. Reading over what I've written doesn't even seem to come close to the darkness of what I'm thinking about. Anyways, I don't know if I'm gonna hit submit or not, but at least I know I'm not alone being here.
