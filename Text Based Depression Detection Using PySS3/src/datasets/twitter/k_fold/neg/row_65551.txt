Literally why do people think therapy or â€œtreatmentâ€ is some magic cure for being suicidalI get upset on here and preface every post I make anywhere by throwing in Iâ€™ve received extensive psychiatric intervention and am still suicidal. People seem to think that therapy or medication or â€œtreatmentâ€ is a magic cure to being suicidal. It seems like people canâ€™t comprehend that yes you can be in therapy and be suicidal.

Most therapists are not very good in my experience. If you have really severe problems some will be totally overwhelmed.  Many people just cannot afford therapy. And honestly like you suffer every day for years and see a therapist for 45 minutes once a week while you suffer every day and even the same day while progress is excruciatingly slow or non-existent.

And hospitals are useless. People have this most grandiose idea hospitals are great places that help you and can turn your life around and provide intensive treatment. Yeah, just no. I got out of the hospital the first time and self harmed after being free and thought about overdosing on my prescribed medication. And I went four times after that.  I literally had a nightmare about it last night.  I would have panic attacks and cry about what happened to me in a hospital. Hospitals are worse than actual prisons. Theyâ€™re degrading, infuriating, humiliating and dehumanizing.  Imagine being a prisoner who hasnâ€™t done anything wrong or committed or charged with a crime.

And then medication. Some of them increase suicidality.  Some have terrible side effects in certain people.  

So I just want to say you can be suicidal and on medication and in therapy
