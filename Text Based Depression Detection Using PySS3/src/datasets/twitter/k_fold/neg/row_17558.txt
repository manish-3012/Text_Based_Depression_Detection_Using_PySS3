Why does this always happen to me?I met a boy, and I thought I had scored a sweetheart. I loved him so fucking much, but yesterday he was being a complete fucking cock to me, and what does he fucking do? He blocks me on facebook. He's such a coward, he knows we won't see eachother soon because its summer break. I can't fucking deal with this anymore, I'm tempted to go fill my tummy up with pills just to fill the hole thats there.-
