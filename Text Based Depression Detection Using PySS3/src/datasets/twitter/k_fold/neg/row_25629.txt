Itâ€™s backI went home for thanksgiving. Iâ€™m back at college. The thoughts have come back full force. I feel so isolated and alone and even though I know itâ€™s impossible that nobody else feels this way.. I feel completely alone, 

Iâ€™m so overwhelmed. I donâ€™t want the thoughts to get to the point where I have another attempt. I donâ€™t even think the next time will be an attempt, I know what I need to do to guarantee Iâ€™m dead. I hate this depression. I hate this suffering.
