I'm not depressed I just wanna dieI always read posts in here and most of the times it's either people in hard situations or people with severe depression, both in a lot of pain. But I'm neither and I still wanna die because I know nothing is ever gonna change for me and what I've seen so far is not worth living for. I think about dying a lot but today I seriously began searching for best ways to do it. I might just go through with it. I don't know.
