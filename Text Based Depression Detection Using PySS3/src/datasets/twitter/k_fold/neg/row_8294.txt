Can't live on anymoreHello,
I just wanted to vent and let out whats on my mind so here goes.
I'm in my 20s, in uni with debt, got no friends here, not motivated to study at all, I feel depressed all the time (just a few days ago I was close to killing myself but someone stopped me but I might attempt it again) I feel more useless than a pile of trash and I can't do anything to change that, I've went to therapists, took meds but nothing does it and I dont know what to do anymore.
That was somewhat it, and probably soon it will be it for me.
Good bye
