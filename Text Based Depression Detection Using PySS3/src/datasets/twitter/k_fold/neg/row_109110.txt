Help/adviceI've been going from house to house for years, left college about 3 years ago, I'm alone most of the time, and I'm working a dead end job. Me and my family do not get along (they're pretty abusive), and I live in a homeless shelter. I'm 21. Fortunately I don't have to pay any bills here so I can save up and try and get back to school, but it seems so far off. No 21 year old should be living in a shelter with little to no friends (except some of my coworkers), no girlfriend, and nothing to do. I've thought of joining the military, but I don't know if I'm cut out for it. I want to kill myself.
