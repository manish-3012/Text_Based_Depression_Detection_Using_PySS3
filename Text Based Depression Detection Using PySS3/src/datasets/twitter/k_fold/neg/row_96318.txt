I'm pretty much doneEverything is going to be over soon. For a couple of years now, everything just kept getting worse and worse, now I've finally reached the limited.
I don't know how to cope anymore, so I'm just going to give up. I'm just a loser to stupid and depressed to achieve anything in life, I'm also disabled which makes everything even worse. I just don't know anything anymore, there just isn't a light at the end of the tunnel...
