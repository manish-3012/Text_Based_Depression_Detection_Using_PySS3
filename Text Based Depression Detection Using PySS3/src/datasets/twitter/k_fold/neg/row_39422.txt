I don't even know what I want in life anymore.I want to end my life, I just don't know anymore. I always was happy imagining myself in the normal traditional life but I just don't anymore. I don't even really know what I want in life, if anything. It feels like the less complicated answer is death, But maybe this will pass, I might go back to my old dreams. But is that a good thing? Maybe I was just brainwashed into thinking that was what would make me happy but maybe it isn't. Maybe nothing can make me happy and nothing really matters. I'm not sure, but it really feels like suicide is much less painful than even figuring this out, Much less living a life that makes me unhappy.
