How to talk to people about an attempt...I recently tried taking my life by overdosing, luckily I did not do too any research and what I tried od'ing on only made me intoxicated, or high, and without any side effects so far. Regardless, I have not told anyone about this, and I am not sure how to tell anyone, I do see a therapist, but work has got in the way, and I believe that partially contributed to my mindset sinking so low. I've always had thoughts, but the other day was the first time I have acting upon them. I was too embarrassed to even go into work having thoughts of paranoia that someone might know, and I have lost my job. I haven't talked to anyone in a few days, friends have tried reaching out, but I haven't worked up the courage to reply, school has been rough, but I have been able to show up and leave, and put on a brave face. I'm just looking for some guidance from someone. I'm not sure how to tell anyone, especially my parents and my therapist. I don't want them to think anything of me because of this. Thanks in advanced, in means the world to me. And if you are reading this and are thinking poorly, please do not attempt it. It is not worth it.
