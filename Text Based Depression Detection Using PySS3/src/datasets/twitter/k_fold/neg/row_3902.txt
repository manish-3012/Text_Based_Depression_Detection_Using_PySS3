Itâ€™s over, Iâ€™ve made my decision.For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been very suicidal. I was put on 40mg of Prozac, and it has done wonders for my anxiety, it just hasnâ€™t helped my depression. With the anxiety no longer there, my depression thrives, with no worries or â€œwhat ifsâ€ constantly running through my mind.

Iâ€™ve also been looking for a new place to live, with no luck. Iâ€™ve been back at my moms for the past year, and she wants me out, understandably. I have nothing saved though. 

My sister gets married Saturday. I want to kill myself after that. My last memory will be a happy one, full of love and happiness that my family is happy. I will act completely normal, but after the reception, I will drive somewhere secluded and blow my brains out. 
I just want it to end. Nothingi will ever do will make up for the piece of shit that Iâ€™ve been.
