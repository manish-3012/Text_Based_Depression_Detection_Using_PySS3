negative cycleIâ€™m in a really bad negative cycle right know and I donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s the worst itâ€™s ever been. 

I spend most of my
free time doing nothing, I cancel virtual plans with friends since I lack energy, and then I hate myself for doing so. Instead of using this as an impetus for change I just lose even more hope. I lose a lot of sleep and itâ€™s impacting my work performance. I donâ€™t see an exit. I wish I was strong enough to improve myself, but I find myself just longing for death.
