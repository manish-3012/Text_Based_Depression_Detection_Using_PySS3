Want to prepare for tonight, but also afraid I will want to stop once I startI screwed up a few days ago. I had everything laid out to carry through with my plan - well, everything but my resolve, apparently. I didn't want to start just to freak out and waste a bunch of emergency resources (I did end up wasting emergency resources, in the end, but not because I started). 

So now, feeling so disconnected and lost, I still wish I could follow through. I've nearly left the house tonight for a new (similar) place to do it, but then just felt the heaviness of depression weigh down and I think, "maybe if I just sleep for a while" or some crap. Though at the same time, I wonder if I just getting starting it over with that it might not be so hard. Attempts in the past weren't as hard because I knew there was a possibility of survival, but desperately wanted to be close to death. Now I'm much more concerned with it working if I'm going to bother at all. 

Needed to get that off my chest.
