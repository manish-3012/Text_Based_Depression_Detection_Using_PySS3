Every day is relearning how to live.Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can do it. Wake up. Get out of bed. Shower. Work... just remind myself of the routine while I hope things improve. People say things get better but Iâ€™m having trouble believing it. Depressed for as long as I can remember and finally diagnosed and medicated 7 years ago. I try to keep up on hobbies and have something to look forward to but that gets harder every day.

The last 20 years have been a complete waste and it feels impossible to come back from that. Thereâ€™s the ex gf that broke up with me on he day that I was going to propose. Had the ring in my pocket, even. Thought it was perfect but found out later sheâ€™d been cheating. Went from her to a girl I married in spite of red flags. I thought I couldnâ€™t do any better and just dealt with her emotional abuse. Iâ€™m now divorced and being forced to sell my house and move in with parents in my late 30â€™s. Just a complete failure. Iâ€™m looking at being stuck living with them for years while I pay down the debt Iâ€™m in thanks to ex wife. 

Then there are the friends. I already donâ€™t have many and try to fake happy but they still fade away or cut contact. Even that gf mentioned above. I tried to hate her but couldnâ€™t and we were friendly a couple years later but recently, she called. I thought just to catch up but no, she was just beating around the bush before saying goodbye for good. 

Nothing gets better. The few things that are good that I hold hope for just crumble. I should have listened when my ex wife told me to kill myself.
