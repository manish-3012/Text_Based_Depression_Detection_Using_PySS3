The ONLY reason why i havent ended itMy mama is the reason. 
She has done so much to help me, to keep me alive, to protect me, to support me in everything. I don't want her hard work to go to waste. I'm her only child. Her only source of happiness.I love seeing my mama happy, I wanna do everything I can to make her happy. And if enduring this living hell will keep a beautiful smile on her face, then so be it. I'll keep enduring this nightmare. I'm gonna keep going only for her. 

My mama is the only reason I'm still alive.
