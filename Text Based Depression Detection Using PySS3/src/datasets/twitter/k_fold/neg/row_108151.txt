I just can't get up again.Ever since I was a child, I was always more fragile than everyone else. Everything hurt me just a little more, and every fall seemed to be harder for me to get up from. I am now 27, and the falls seem more permanent now. I feel like saying goodbye to someone, but I don't want anyone to know. I just wish I could get up from this... I really miss you, Siv.. Wish you could love me, wish someone would hold me, but there's no one.
