The feeling that life is over and I ruined it.I'm sorry, but I've spent the last 5, yes 5 genuinely, mentally collapsing so the text and formatting of this post will likely be bad.

In short to sum up my situation, I was accused of cheating by university and my punishment is likely to be a year long suspension at best along with failing a class I need for my major (which I will no longer be able to apply for if failed). For reasons, I won't say if I actually cheated or not in this post.

I feel like my entire career is wrecked and I've got nowhere to go except blowing my brains out with a gun and ending the pain.

I'm so tired. I just want the pain to stop. 

I have no support systems as I have no friends and I'm on bad terms with my parents.

I've been to therapy multiple times with multiple different therapists of different specialities. I've been on antidepressants and never liked them.

Everything is crumbling down...
