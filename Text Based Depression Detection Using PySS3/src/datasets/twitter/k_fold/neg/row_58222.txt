I want to cry.Donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so emotional. Just want to end it. Not good at anything. The hobbies I used to enjoy now just make me stressed. Iâ€™m not worthy. When people say Iâ€™m worthy just makes me feel even more worthless, undeserving. 

I wish I could turn off all the emotions. I wish I was asexual and aromantic. Iâ€™m tired of being depressed, being sexually/romantically attracted to people who donâ€™t even think of me once. If I had no emotions and was asexual &amp; aromantic, my life would be easier. Just feel absolutely nothing.
