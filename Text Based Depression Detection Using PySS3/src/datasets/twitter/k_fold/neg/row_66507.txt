It hurts me so much to say this but I think tonightâ€™s the nightSuicides been on my mind for as long as I could remember. I didnâ€™t really want to think too much into it but I always considered an option. The only thing is, I always had the slightest hope that maybe if I just waited a little longer things would just work out and it kept me alive for so long but Iâ€™m just breaking down and I think that last hope has kinda just disappeared. Even until my last moments I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever just be content with death but Iâ€™m just so tired of being me. Iâ€™ve ruined so many opportunities and I only have myself to blame. I just look back and feel torn knowing I only have regrets. 

I think Iâ€™m gonna take this last chance to just say sorry, thank you, and good bye
