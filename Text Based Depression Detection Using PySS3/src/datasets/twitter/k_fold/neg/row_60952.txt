A relationship doesnâ€™t make my suicidal thoughts go awayMy cousin said if I am going to get a girlfriend I am going to be fine because thereâ€™ll be someone I can talk to about all my problems. Yeah right. I can talk to my mother about all my problems as well. Talking about them doesnâ€™t make them disappear.
