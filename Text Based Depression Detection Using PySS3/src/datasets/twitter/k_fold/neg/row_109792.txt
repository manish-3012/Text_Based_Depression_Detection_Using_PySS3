I wish I could fall asleep and never wake up againThis is life in limbo, right?

Im sat here, Im fighting the battle of the urge to commit suicide and what for? Just to get up and fall straight back into another whole 2 days later. I dont have any friends, my family seem to think Im making all this shit up for fun. I had awful night terrors yesterday so I didnt sleep again last night. It scares me.

What did I do wrong to deserve feeling like this? Why do I deserve to live alone and without anyone? Why cant I be loved????
