Casually suicidal.My life is improving.  I don't care if it does or not.  I'm almost apathetic toward things and people at this point.  I have options, none of them are worth it.  I've spent the last 5 years improving myself and my life, I've gotten away from my abusive mom...  nothing matters, nothing I do holds any significance.  Nothing anyone else does holds any, either.  I'm so tired of trying to improve.  Why bother?  Why spend my whole life working on my problems?  It's all so pointless.
