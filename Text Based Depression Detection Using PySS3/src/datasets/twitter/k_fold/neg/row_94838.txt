Wish I could trade places with someone who has a terminal illness and wants to liveIt's the ultimate irony that so many people with serious health problems struggle desperately to stay alive, while there are suicidal people with no interest in continuing to live but who are in perfect health. Not to mention, it's the former group that benefits from all those assisted suicide laws that don't apply to someone like me.

Given that 'trading places' in a literal sense is impossible, you'd think that society would figure out some kind of euthanasia + organ donation program that would satisfy everyone. It's a win-win situation: suicidal people have viable hearts, livers, kidneys, skin, etc. that aren't doing them any good (by their own evaluation), and many people hopelessly in need of organ transplants are stuck on wait-lists because there aren't enough donors. If I have to die in a ditch to avoid being 'rescued', by the time I'm discovered, my organs have gone to waste. By not allowing suicidal people to die peacefully and harvesting their organs, is society not condemning those who want to live to die, while forcing those who want to die to live?

It will be a sign of progress once I'm no longer considered mentally ill by default for wanting to end my life, and when I'm able to use my death to benefit others who would rather stay alive.
