Want to die but worried about going back on medsI have severe generalized anxiety, severe social anxiety and was diagnosed with severe depression in 2017. I went into remission for my depression over the summer but it came back. I had some rough things happen to me and ended up getting really physically sick for about a month which made me depressed. 

Now Iâ€™ve had about two weeks of awful anxiety. I donâ€™t want to leave my room, see family or friends and been having trouble breathing. My brain wonâ€™t shut up and after two weeks of what feels like prison I want to die again. I just am done with it. I want my brain to shut up. 

Iâ€™m also in a fight with my Boyfriend which doesnâ€™t help because seeing him helps with my anxiety (I know I should be fine on my own but he does help and since I couldnâ€™t see my doctor until the new year it would be nice to see him. He just has work and then I have work). And fighting makes the anxiety way worse and it makes me really unhappy in the relationship and also makes me
Not the best to be around. 

I know I should go back on meds but they made me super depressed too and sick. Iâ€™m just so at a loss. It seems Iâ€™m always trying to escape this illness and Iâ€™m doing everything and everytime I finally feel in control it comes back and hits me harder. No one understands how awful and debilitating this illness is and so I want to die. I wish I could just go. But I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. But Iâ€™m tired of
Hurting and itâ€™s only been two weeks and I canâ€™t do another two.
