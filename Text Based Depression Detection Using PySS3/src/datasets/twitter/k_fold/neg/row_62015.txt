CycleItâ€™s mostly sitting and waiting for the next wave of depression or mania isnâ€™t it... And the feeling of your arms itching where it wants cutting. Why not stop the fear and pain and hurt now? Because itâ€™ll only come back, worse next time. Itâ€™s an endless cycle and itâ€™ll never stop unless I stop it myself.
