Tired RantI am drowning in student loan debt. I can't get a full-time job. I am working part time and barely paying bills/feeding myself (when I can convince myself to eat, I've lost 20lbs in two months). I'm couch surfing. I would love to go to therapy/get meds but I don't have health insurance and I'm drowning in debt enough already.

I barely have any friends so 90% of my time is spent myself inside my head. Any attmepts to socialize are thwarted by lack of funds or the fact that apparently people just want to be my friend in an attempt to fuck me.

I can't get up the motivation to do things that used to make me happy.

My boyfriend and I broke up because I was smothering him and dragging him down with me. I adore him and he makes me feel like I can get better and he wants to try again. But I can't convince myself that I'm not just gonna smother him again. I am not fun or happy or nice to be around and he deserves better.

I've made several attempts at posting but it keeps crashing. Maybe I'm not supposed to reach out. Maybe this is a sign that this really is the end of the rope.

This is much more clear than my first attempt but still not completely inclusive. I can't get a grip on everything.
