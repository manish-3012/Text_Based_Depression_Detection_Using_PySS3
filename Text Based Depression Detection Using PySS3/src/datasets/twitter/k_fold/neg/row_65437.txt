Am I worthless?Welp, here I am. I thought I could get better by being in other subs but itâ€™s finally led to this. 
Iâ€™m genuinely scared. I have little friends and I have severe trust issues, which makes it really hard for me to make new friends and to find help. I have to do it anonymously through this account. 
Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for around 6 months now. Not long, but it hurts. Every single day. But, I never have the courage to do it. Iâ€™m not even brave enough to cut myself. I just want to die. 
Everythingâ€™s been building up, one tragedy at a time, like a snowball, until one day it just rolls over me and I finally muster up enough courage to kill myself. 
Iâ€™m so worthless and pathetic I canâ€™t even be brave enough to end my own life. I have no talent, and my trusted friend on the other hand is good at anything he ever does. So are everyone around me. 
Am I worthless?
