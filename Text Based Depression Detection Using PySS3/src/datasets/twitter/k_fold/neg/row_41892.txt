I've got to go through with it.I used to be a happy and cheerful person, but now I'm depressed and I can't find anything to live for. My friends have all stopped talking to me and my family just does not care about me at all. I can't stand this anymore knowing that my life is just shit. I don't have a job, never have, and probably never will because no one wants to hire an 18 year old who can't do shit. I can't even get into a school because I had such shit grades. I don't even have anything that I'm passionate about. 

I do like to harm myself, it helps with coping, and I have attempted suicide before. This time though, I need to go through with it.
