Another new fucking year, and I still wish I wasn't alive.As of right now, I'm sitting here, watching a bunch of people be happy on tv for new years. My dad is downstairs in the basement, sleeping, because he can't stand my mom anymore and I feel so bad for him. My mom and sister are sitting on the couch on their phones like normal. And here I am. Overweight,  relationship-less, fucking lazy and devoid of feelings for myself. I sometimes wish I wasn't alive so I could just do nothing forever. My life is one big broken record. Wake up, go to school, get bad grades, work, come home, watch my dad cook dinner because my mom can't come home in time to do it,  listen to him complain about how much he hates my mom, mom comes home, tension in the air between the two, go upstairs, surf the internet, go to sleep, wake up, repeat. None of you probably don't give a shit about what I'm saying, I'm just bored and typing out what's up. Whatever.
