I don't wanna be here anymoreI hate everything about me

I keep having these very bad mixed episode that results in a huge rush of depression, crying spells &amp; that "energy" feeling from anxiety. And I'm just to the point where I can't handle it anymore

I wanna be okay but I can't do it. I can't ever be happy anymore. I don't do anything in life so I'm honestly worthless.
