I spent all of the last night thinking about killing myself.Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.
I don't know what is wrong with me. I keep having episodes, where I go from happy and interacting with people normally to a terrible...well, I don't know what to call it. It's a very dark place in my mind. And once I go there, it feels like I am sitting in an echo chamber and every single self-destructive thought I have ever had, is being hurled at me. I will go from talking normally to people to being convinced that everybody hates me and tolerate me only because they can't say that to my face, in maybe 5 minutes. And then the suicidal thoughts will come flooding in, how I should kill myself as nobody cares about me, how my death will make everybody happy because then they won't have to deal with me. 

Last night was the longest such episode I have had yet. It lasted well into today morning, meaning I have been unable to do any work, which just adds onto the stress. 

Once before, when I had an episode like this, I talked to my big sister about it, she being one of the few people I would trust enough for something like this. I didn't tell her then that I was suicidal, though.

This morning, I told her that. I told her, remember how I am down in the dumps from time to time? Well, I have suicidal thoughts to go along with them. Her response was:" It's disgusting when people think of ending their lives for no reason at all." 

I don't know why I am posting all this here, and what I am expecting to happen. All I know is, I spent last night in hell, trapped in my mind with no way out. And I have no one to talk to about it. And I am scared of when the next such episode will come along. Because last night was also the closest I came to actually jumping.

Please, somebody, help me.
