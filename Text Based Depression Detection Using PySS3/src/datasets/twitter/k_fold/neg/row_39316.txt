Its already planned...I have been thinking about this for awhile, and everything is just getting worse around me, everyone is fighting around me, I basically lock myself in my room all day, I am being taken advantage of by other people, I haven't had a vacation from my "job" in a long time, my anxiety is through the roof right now, I am going into severe depression, my insomnia is just getting worse as well, and I don't know what to do with myself anymore.  The only people that I thought actually loved me, and are actually the only reason I am alive at this point, who are my "counselors" won't listen to everything I have to say, because I am underage, and they are worried my parents are gonna talk to them, and they will have to tell them everything because I am underage... (Isn't that their job anyways???) I haven't had the courage to tell them how suicidal I actually am, actually at all, and at one point awhile ago, I was self harming, which one of them ended up finding out about 1 1/2 months later was kinda worried and didn't want me doing it again, and told me to talk to them if I ever thought about it again, well I am again, just a different way, and they haven't found out yet.  I just don't trust them anymore, because they just don't seem to care about me anymore, they are just worried about themselves getting in shit because of me.  

So the only people who are keeping me alive at this point have lost me.

As the title states, I already have this planned out because I can get me full license soon, so I am gonna run. Maybe my life will change before that, but I highly doubt it.
