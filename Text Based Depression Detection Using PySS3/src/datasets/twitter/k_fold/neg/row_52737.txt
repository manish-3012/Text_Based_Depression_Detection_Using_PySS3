Gave up in life?Lately i been debating on if i engaged in self-destructive behavior, and it seems likely so. Im starting to lose interest in the â€œfriendsâ€ around me so i can be free. 

Im quite needy, but as an infj the best choice is to isilate myself than to drag them down to.

Now im wondering, will all these negative thoughts kill me? Im starting to engage in very negative behavior such as becoming more racist, cold hearted, grouping people. My reason: cause thats how the world works.

Tired of being that caring.

I feel the world gave me a choice to fight or die. 

However, what goes up most come down. 

am i on the path to eventually suiciding? 

Update: Freedom keeps popping up in my head.
