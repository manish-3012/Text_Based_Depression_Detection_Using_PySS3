I'm going to have to end it tonightI lost my reason for living a few years ago, and since then I thought I had found another, but it seems like I was wrong.
I can't do this, it's all become too much, and I can't go on.
I guess I don't really have anyone to say goodbye to, so goodbye redditors, take care. Signing off.
