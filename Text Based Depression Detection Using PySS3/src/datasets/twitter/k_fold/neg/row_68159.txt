Iâ€™m starting to lose my mind.Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a while now, I had an intervention type thing with my family and it was kinda eye opening. But recently Iâ€™ve been spiraling down this dark path where Iâ€™ve been getting really upset, thinking about regrets, I had a ex gf who I blew off for a couple months and I finally decided to try to get back with her and it didnâ€™t work out she didnâ€™t want me and I just canâ€™t take it anymore. I constantly think about her. Get jealous of her new bf and am just overall really depressed, certain things trigger my depression and then which trigger my anxiety which doesnâ€™t help. I sometimes really feel like I have a demon like sitting on my shoulders,  just waiting for things to get good in my life and then he just directs things down the wrong path. Iâ€™m losing hope, Iâ€™m losing motivation, Iâ€™m losing the will to live anymore. Idk
