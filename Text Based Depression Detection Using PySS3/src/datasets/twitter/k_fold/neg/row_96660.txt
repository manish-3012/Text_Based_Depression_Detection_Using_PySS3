Would anyone like to here how someone got out of this pit?Iâ€™m not gonna lie, Iâ€™m not completely fine. Iâ€™ve struggled with depressive feelings for a good 4-5 years, although I canâ€™t actually say when or why they started. The kids at my old school bullied me quite a bit, but only in the way that they degraded my self-esteem with words, and I guess my dad having cancer also contributed to feeling helpless and weak. The feelings I had were centred around feeling like I was nothing more than a meat-shell, and moving to a new school (and largely getting ignored only contributed to this). Now, Iâ€™m a privileged kid- Iâ€™m middle class, my dad was the CEO of a big company and I currently live in a big beautiful country house; so by all standards I shouldnâ€™t have been feeling the way I did. But I was. I only directly attempted suicide once, hanging a guitar cord from the ceiling in a noose, but my dad walked in on me as I was setting it up, and the look on his face deterred me for months afterwards. Two years after that he died of cancer, which had resulted in a personality change and a reversion to his childhood, but I felt nothing at this time. I felt callous and worthless for feeling nothing; I thought it was because Iâ€™m cold, because Iâ€™m a bad person etc. I kinda spiralled downwards from there, self-harming regularly with a pencil-sharpener blade, which my one of two friends also did at that time too. It was not trying to kill myself: it was like an odd secret, something to distract from the worthlessness of life, but it was also a way of reminding myself that I was worthless. Anyway, this continued for half a year, until my mother found my scars out (Iâ€™d left blood under my pillow somehow and she questioned me). My mum loves me, and I love my mum, so seeing her face as she saw my scars tore me up inside. But I felt more guilt. I felt worse. I stopped cutting for a while, but started again out of habit. I was as low as Iâ€™d ever been, and I was toying with a second attempt at suicide. At my new school thereâ€™s a bridge leading to a town, over a motorway, just suicide height. I often went down there to contemplate the idea, to make sense of my suicidal feelings. Well, this was until I met my girlfriend. I threw myself into this relationship entirely, holding onto it, and to her, as my lifeline. I quickly realised that I was the same for her. She was struggling with an eating disorder, and had planned her own suicide a week before we started dating (later sheâ€™d reveal that she actually attempted it, but couldnâ€™t cut deep enough). Instead of being a lone battle, after a few months, we took it upon each other to fight our ill mental health ourselves. The prospect of losing her, and it being my fault, was enough for me to push against my own self-hate to fight what was happening to her, and the same was true for her. However there was one incident which taught me more about the state of mental health than any other. Over the summer after our GCSEâ€™s we were in a relatively good place, and despite her eating disorder being in full swing she was making progress and I finally felt a bit more alive. But in coming back into school, the shock of my isolation to most people sent me into a relapse of sorts, causing me to slash my stomach quite deep, about half way down. I wasnâ€™t trying to commit suicide, I was trying to punish myself for my ineptitude. I ended up in an immense amount of pain, writhing on the floor and bleeding more than I ever had before. The next time I saw my girlfriend I mentioned nothing about it, but grimaced when she hugged me and put pressure on the cut. She immediately noticed and checked my stomach, and burst into tears. This was the second time Iâ€™d seen this happen, and if youâ€™ve seen it too you know the feeling. This time, however, I realised the truth. I realised fully and completely that I was valuable to someone. Now Iâ€™m not suggesting anyone do what I did because that would be both illegal and fucking stupid, but I am saying that you can pretend no one will miss you all you like, or that it doesnâ€™t bother you, but when you see the face of someone who cares about you hurt by your pain, itâ€™s an indescribable feeling.

Sorry if that was a bit preachy or melodramatic, I just thought it might be useful to at least someone to read about someone who didnâ€™t end up dying. Also kinda cathartic to properly relive all that stuff I guess. Anyway I love you all gn
