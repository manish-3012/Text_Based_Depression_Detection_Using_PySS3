Worst. Luck. Ever. Screw this fucked up world.Hi reddit,

I've contemplating this for a while now, the pain inside me, the depression, it's fucking killing me.  Why? I DON'T KNOW! I JUST FEEL LIKE THE WEIGHT OF WORLD IS ON TOP OF MY CHEST! My girlfriend broke up with me 8 months ago and I'm still not over it, every fucking day I think about her.  Do I want her back? No. The thought of her makes me sick to my stomach.  She gave me an STD and whenever I approach anyone at a club, bar, or any social occasion, I think to myself, "if i like her and give her my heart, I have to tell her I have an STD." Then, if she rejects like EVERYONE else that I tried to start relationship with, it takes away little more of my soul.  I'm an athletic, funny guy, and ALL my friends like me, and I like them.  I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY I HAVE THESE THOUGHTS. I have not slept for 2 weeks.  I would fall asleep and would be in heaven for 15 minutes to an hour and wake up and feel like crap ALL OVER AGAIN.  I don't know what to do.  I can't take this shit anymore, I have several thoughts of how I want to do this but, I can't handle the emotional despair i'll be leaving behind.  I'm not worth it for them to feel my death as a worthy cause.  It's been an emotional roller coaster..
