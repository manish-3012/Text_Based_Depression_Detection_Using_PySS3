I can't do another day of life.I never amounted to much in life. I have no family left alive. My last family member died a little over 20 years ago. I've been a lone for a very long time. What makes me, me coupled with what makes me happy stands in direct conflict with what a SO would want to find in someone. I desperately need to attend college but can't afford it. I didn't know you were supposed to sign up for the draft. I had no family back then. So now I'm not eligable for financial aid. I've been turned down for every student loan and I missed a lot of days in high school because I couldn't get there everyday. So I ended up finishing high school with a very low GPA due to all the make up classes I had to take during the summer. 

I can't advance in life, I can't find a partner and I can't do the things I want to do. There is always a catch to why I can't succeed. It's time to kill myself. This life isn't really worth living. I should be able to afford things like health care and school working full time. I live in squaller and it's bullshit. I just never had what it takes to make it in the world. I think it's time to die.
