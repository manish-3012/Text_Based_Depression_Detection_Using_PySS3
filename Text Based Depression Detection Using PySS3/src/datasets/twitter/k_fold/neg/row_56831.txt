Why do I feel suicidal?I have no reason to feel this way! I have a lot of friends , I don't get bullied , I am pretty popular , school is over , I have both parents and they aren't abusing me or fighting! But despite that I still sooo alone and sad and suicide feels like the only way out! I don't want to feel this way !
