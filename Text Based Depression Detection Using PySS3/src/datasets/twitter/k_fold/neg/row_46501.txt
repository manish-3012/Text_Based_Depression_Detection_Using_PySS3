My abusive ex is taking me to court for full custody of our son and I'm ready to go away.He has accused me of raising our son in a bad environment, not taking care of him when he is the abusive one. If he wins, if he takes my son, I've already planned to kill myself. It will be in December. I want to do it now, so I don't have to go through it all. I love my son so much. I don't want to be without him. It's really not fair. I really want to do it tonight.
