Gotta die of something, right?I was doing better and now Iâ€™m not.
I guess this is the void Iâ€™m yelling into. I might be too much of a coward to fucking do it anyway. But Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m so ready. 
Iâ€™m so in debt and I keep fucking up my career path. Iâ€™ve fucked up a lot of people and I know that Iâ€™m a toxic, terrible person. I tried to fix it. I fucking tried.

Iâ€™ve chosen the bridge to jump off of. Itâ€™s been snowing so maybe Iâ€™ll go for a walk and decide where I should aim to land. Lots of people survive jumps from bridges because the structure isnâ€™t tall enough. 
Thatâ€™s the one mistake I wonâ€™t make. 

I always get this weird thing when Iâ€™m suicidal where I start to feel more affectionately toward people. I like driving by them and seeing someone enjoy a cup of coffee, play with their dog, or just put in headphones.
I hope you all take care of yourselves.
Thanks for letting me read your stories and vent. 
I finish work soon. I guess weâ€™ll see but Iâ€™m hoping I succeed.
