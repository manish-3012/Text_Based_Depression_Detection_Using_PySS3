I'm so sick of feeling like I'm nothing.I'm at a really low point again and Iâ€™m so frustrated. I've struggled with depression for years and over the past few months I had been feeling like I was getting better. I was still having bad days or even bad weeks â€“ periods of time where I felt like I wasnâ€™t making any progress after all â€“ but in general, I felt like things were getting better. And now, since the summer has started, I feel like Iâ€™m back to square one, back to where I was two or three years ago. I feel worthless and hopeless. Iâ€™m not sleeping well, not eating properly, I hate everything about my body and my personality, and I feel unmotivated and indecisive. I feel like Iâ€™m just existing without any purpose or potential. Iâ€™m wasting every day feeling horrible and not having the energy to do anything. I have little bursts of excitement about things I used to be passionate about, but theyâ€™re short-lived. Iâ€™m starting to feel like Iâ€™ll never get better. I canâ€™t keep living like this, and I know there's something wrong but I can't get help because my parents don't take mental illnesses seriously. They think it's about a "positive attitude" and they would never understand what I'm actually dealing with. I feel like no one cares about me and like my life is so uninteresting and meaningless compared to everyone else's. I think about suicide every day and I feel like I should just get it over with.
