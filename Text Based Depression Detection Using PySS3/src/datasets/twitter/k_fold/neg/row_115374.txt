I'm scared for my SO and I feel like there's so little I can do to help them.( I refer to my SO as "they" or just as "SO" since this is a throwaway account. I highly doubt my SO will ever find this or care I've posted looking for advice, but it makes me feel more safe this way. Let's just say we're both in our late 20's and we live in the United States.)

I think my SO may have manic depression. While I do work in social services and am well educated in this field, I am not a psychiatrist and thus cannot make the professional diagnosis of bi-polar disorder but in the amount of time I've known them, I see those characteristics. It also runs in their family, compounding my conclusion they may have it. 

I only bring this up because they tend to have these episodes of threatening suicide in two scenarios (extreme depression and occasional drinking bouts to the point of blacking out) , but I'm afraid that all this talk of suicide will eventually turn into action. We live together alone and neither of us have a stable, solid support system outside of each other (family living far away, no real close friends). This even makes me depressed, but I would never kill myself over it -- the good news I always come back to is we have each other. 

They, given these moods and also occasional excessive drinking, given also the lack of support system and lack of money and real fun in our lives makes me easy to see, when in a really depressed mood, why suicide seems like a good idea. 

I just don't know what to do and I have no where to turn for help when my SO does these things - I'm afraid to call for psychiatric help for them because we both need to keep our jobs, but again, without close friends or family, I'm left to my own devices. 

Those who have helped an SO through these phases or put your SO through these phases yourself, how do you cope? What do you suggest doing or saying? They had a knife to their wrist last night and it made me want to hide all the knives in the house going forward.
