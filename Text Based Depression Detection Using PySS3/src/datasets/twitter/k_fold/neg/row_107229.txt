I hate being alive. I want the pain to end.I never thought I would hit 26, let alone the 36 that I am now.  I am always feeling like I am struggling or fighting to stay afloat...to stay alive.  I am being crushed by debt, I've lost the ability to connect to those around me (including my wife) and I am a abject failure at being an adult.  My family wants nothing to do with me, my mother tries to steal money from me and I feel like every day I am going to screw up and ruin my life.  But the rub is that my life is ruins and a stain on the world. 

I just want to fall asleep and never wake up.
