I think my friend may have killed himself, i donâ€™t feel like I have a reason to live now.My friend who lives in a different country hasnâ€™t read or responded to messages in 24+ hours. Itâ€™s around 1 PM his time and I doubt he would be sleeping. His last post on Twitter was just â€œI guess this is itâ€. He has told me about his suicide attempts on the past and ongoing ideation. He also posted on a throw away account (which admittedly I wasnâ€™t supposed to find) about how he was planning to kill himself this month. 

This was the only person I had ever looked forward to talking to in years. The fact that he might be dead and didnâ€™t even fucking say goodbye is pissing me off. He was the only goddamn thing keeping me going in the past few months.

I guess itâ€™s my fault for basing my admiration and hope around a person who I knew was unstable. It was my goddamn fault for letting emotions, that I knew would backfire, exist. 

I donâ€™t even want to be alive anymore. All things on earth that I had cared about are gone, I fucking hate this. Sorry if this comes off as edgy or unreadable, haha.
