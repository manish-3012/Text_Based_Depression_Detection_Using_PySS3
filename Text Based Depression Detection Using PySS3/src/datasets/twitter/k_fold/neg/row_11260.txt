I feel isolation taking over and I (19F) don't want it this time.I lived with my Husband for a year, he was depressed and needed space to improve, so I've come back home so we can both get jobs and grow so we can be healthy together and functioning humans. I've come back home to a toxic environment that makes it impossible to get a job, I feel my husband getting happier and happier, growing the way he should. I feel left behind, like I've not made progress, I'm happy for him. But at the same time it kills me knowing that if he grows more, it'll be without me, I feel it happening already.. I think tonight I'm gonna try. I feel like shit, I feel worthless, tired, forgotten, and alone. I thought once I'd come back home people would miss me, its been a year, they'd miss me right? I guess not. I don't wanna feel this way anymore, I just wanted my husband, my home.. Neither of which will stay.
