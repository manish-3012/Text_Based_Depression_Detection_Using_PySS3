Would it be a dick move if I did it on my birthday?So my birthday is next Monday. I'll be 27. I have my first counselling session on Wednesday and I'm gonna try to get tested for bipolar. I've already written out my note and I've sort of made a deal with myself that I'm gonna kill myself on my birthday, even if I get told I'm not bipolar. My ex broke up with me recently and I don't wanna spend it alone without her. 

I think if I am bipolar then it'll be easier for me to do it. I'm also hoping that none of my friends or family wish me happy birthday just so I have the proof I need that no one cares. The only person I want to wish me a happy birthday is her.

Am I being a dick if I do it on my birthday?
