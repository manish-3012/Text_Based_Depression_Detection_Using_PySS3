I'm going to kill myself but i don't want to be aloneThe plan is set, im off work for the next week, and Friday ill have my method of choice... the wait is killing me.. I live with my ex who cheated on me, and he's making my life hell.. I almost want to ask him if he'll help me do it sooner, but i know better than to tell anyone i know my plan... just.. I want to tell someone 
I have a few online friends I could tell, and they'd have no way to get to someone who could do something, but how messed up is that? No..i have no one to talk to.. no one to help me through this.. why has it always been like this...
