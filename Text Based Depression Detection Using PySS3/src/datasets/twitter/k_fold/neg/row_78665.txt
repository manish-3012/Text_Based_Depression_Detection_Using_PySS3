I m sorryI am sorry but life has turned into something I dont want to go through. It's just too much. My mind is never stable, I have become impotent, I am suffering from many lifelong illnesses including mental ones. My career is destroyed. I have just lost the will..
I just wanted to say it..I am not looking for answers. Not anymore. Thanks.
