Just need to tell someonesorry in advance for rambling about my situation but I'm to scared to tell my friends and family about it and i just need to tell it. ill try and keep it positive. I wont get into whats wrong in my life and what not, only that whatever is wrong in my life or whatever I don't like about myself and all the flaws are okay; as long as i tell myself ill kill myself. so now whenever I get anxiety or feel depressed for whatever reason i tell myself i'm going to kill myself. when it gets bad i see in my head, me killing myself via different ways. the only thing stopping me from leaving is thinking how it would hurt my immediate family, because even though I don't like myself I do know they care about me. I feel alone, and not good enough for anything or anybody. I know i shouldn't think these thoughts and they are not normal, but the thought of that only drives me to leave sooner.
