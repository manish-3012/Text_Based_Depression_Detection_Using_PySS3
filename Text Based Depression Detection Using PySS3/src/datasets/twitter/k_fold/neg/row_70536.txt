I just want to give upFor the last 2 years my life has been a mess. 1 and half year ago my girlfriend left me and I couldn't handle it. I loved her and I still love her so much. The only support I had was a friend of mine who also left me now. Everyone in my life has tried to get ride of me including my famlily. They never cared and they never will. For the past 2 years I have so depressed that I can't do anything. I have anxiety attacks almost everyday and I just feel like giving up. People who I love told me that they donâ€™t want me in their lives and thet they donâ€™t want to be associated with me and th was not out of anger or something, they just told me frankly. I am not a bad person, I always try to help people and put myself in other peoples shoes and understand. I always understand someone else pain and tries to make them feel better. I always try to make other people happy even if it means putting all my needs aside. I did everything I could to everyone I love. None of them want me to be in their lives, I have been waiting for my ex-girlfriend to give me another chance, I just love her too much, but I donâ€™t think that will happen either. I want to die, I want to just give up.
