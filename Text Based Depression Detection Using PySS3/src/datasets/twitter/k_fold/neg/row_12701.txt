34 days leftI've written notes to the ones I care about. Will the police search my flat? Or should I post them the day of? Or do I keep them on my body? Feels like I'm in limbo. I picked a specific date for personal reasons and now I'm just waiting. I don't really know what to do now. So much of my life has been spent trying to get help/feel better and there's no point to that any more so I'm kind of lost now. I was lost before anyway. There's no need to respond, I'm just.. idk typing it out because it helps solidify my thoughts. On one hand I'm scared, and on the other... I'm just relieved it's going to end.
