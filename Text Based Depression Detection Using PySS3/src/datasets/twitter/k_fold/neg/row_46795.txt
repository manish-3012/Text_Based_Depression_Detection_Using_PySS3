I'm gonna try again, I'm not if waking up tomorrow is actually worth it.It's a shit day after another, everyone leaves me, nobody cares, I wake up everyday and it's like a part of me is left on the bed, It just feels like I'm falling apart. 
But I do hope that some of you are able to not give up and actually overcome whatever each one of you are dealing.
