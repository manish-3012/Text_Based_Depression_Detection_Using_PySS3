New Diagnosis !Finally went in to get officially diagnosed by someone other than my PCP, and boom. 

They think Iâ€™m bipolar with SAD and donâ€™t have major depression.

It took a lot of trial and error and testing meds to finally get somewhere and now that Iâ€™m here I hope these next rounds of meds help :)

Thanks to all of you guys thatâ€™ve dealt with my bipolar on again off again bullshit for the last however long on however many accounts

Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll be posting in another month about how Iâ€™m so fucked up and I hate everything but itâ€™s a long road right ? So stick with me and Iâ€™ll stick with you

And to everyone thatâ€™s struggling - weâ€™re all in the same boat and as long as we keep talking it through maybe itâ€™ll get better :)
