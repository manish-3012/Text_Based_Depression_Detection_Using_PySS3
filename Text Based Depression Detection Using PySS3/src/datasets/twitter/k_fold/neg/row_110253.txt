Do I deserve to live?I just got a phone call through, from my girlfriend's best-friend. Once I realized who was on the other end of the phone I kinda guessed that something bad had happened. But it wasn't until he said the actual words "she's dead" that it hit me.

We'd just broken up yesterday, because of me. I still cared about her and loved her so much, but couldn't deal with things so I had to call it off. And now she's gone :(.

I know how to handle my brain during depression, so I'm leaving the question "is this my fault" unanswered until I can at least think logically. But deep down it feels like I already have answer, because I feel so guilty. The only question that seems to keep repeating itself in my head is; do I deserve to live? And honestly I just don't know.

I feel so terrible. The girl I loved is now gone and... I'm just at a loss for words. I don't know what to think. I don't know if this was because of me. I just don't know. Do I deserve to live?
