Meds won't word.Even my boyfriend of seven years thinks I'm useless. I can't do anything at all to prove otherwise. I went to the doctor to get a prescription for antidepressants, and he belittled my decision, and made it clear he thought every action I took was for naught. The one man in my life, the one *person* I have to rely on, now thinks I'm a useless POS, and I honestly don't see the point in trying to make myself better if even he thinks I won't see any results. What's the point, again? I've forgotten.
