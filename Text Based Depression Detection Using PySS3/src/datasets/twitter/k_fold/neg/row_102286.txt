I want to end it allLiterally just fuck it. Iâ€™m bipolar, major depression, PTSD. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Last time I tried to do the right thing and get help in crisis I was made to feel like a criminal.

My anxiety keeps me stuck in this god forsaken life. Bc â€œI DoNt WAnnA HuRT anYoNeS FeeLiNGsâ€ No one cares. My fiancÃ© acts like Iâ€™m a burden, I donâ€™t have friends bc Iâ€™m so bleh all the time, my mother consistently reminds me that Iâ€™m a worthless daughter and I was a mistake.  My father has a whole new family so whatever. Iâ€™m just a piece of shit in this world and it would be better off without me
