Lots of thoughts, lots of reasons.I've always thought about. Never thought I'd have the balls to follow through. I still don't think I do, but I can't help but fantasize about the idea of "leaving".

My own very temporary and usually triggered bouts of depression are enough to trigger the fantasies and I start to question existence.

Why am I here?
Why do I have to deal with horrible people?
What's the point of existing if existence can't be enjoyable?

The weird thing is that I have a pretty decent life, lots of friends, a good middle class job, a girlfriend...

Not sure what to do.
