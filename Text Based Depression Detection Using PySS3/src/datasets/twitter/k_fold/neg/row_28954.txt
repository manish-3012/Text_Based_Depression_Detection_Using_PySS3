I really, really, really feel like I'm just ready to die and go home.For the past, few days, really - no, scratch that, ever since this morning,when I woke up this morning, I felt this strong, strong, strong feeling of "goddamn it, I don't want to be here anymore." That feeling has stayed with me all day - ALL day. I'm a high school graduated, failed five hundred times over filmmaker with no family except my mother, who never really recognizes my sadness and I have no friends, my mom and I are poor and we live in a shelter, meanwhile in a shelter, I managed to get together an investment prospectus for one hell of a good damn psychological thriller film that I had hoped to direct, a prospectus that had a solid plan for investors - but what happens? It goes absolutely nowhere - **at all** because no one - **no one** wants to give me a chance.

Furthermore, all of my mom and I's family and the ones we did love and care about are all dead and so....I feel like I'm ready to go home. Life isn't going to get better for me because no matter how many times I keep asking the universe, mother goddess - people, to please give me a chance as a filmmaker, the only dream I've had since I was ten, it's just not going to happen. 

All I ever wanted to do was be like my inspirations, my idols, Dallas Roberts, John Krasinski or A.Z. Kelsey or Mark Duplass, but what am I? A thirty-five year old, sheltered, female failure, a loser. So what's the point in going on? In living? I'm very, very, very serious, this feeling of wanting to just end it all is so, so, so strong that I can feel it like an adrenaline rush throughout me. I really don't see any hope or future for tomorrow for me or for my mom, but my mom can make it without me, so I'm just ready to die and go home. I've heard about the afterlife and how beautiful it is in the many, upper dimensional planes, so what am I doing staying here? When no goal that I have, I will never reach? 

I don't even know why I'm posting this here because no one probably gives a shit, but I just felt the pleading urge to express this to someone, because right now, I don't care how it happened, I just wished that I wouldn't live to see tomorrow - another day of losses and failure.
