crying and typing ha :( byei want to die. i've been telling myself this for so long. i've been on this subreddit too many times. i dont even know why i come on here. some form of release i guess. i cant think clearly anymore. i am such a burden to my parents, such a failure. at 22 i feel so old. feel like i havent done anything with my life. i cant find anything to look forward to, work towards. especially at a time like this. so i think this is it. i always tell myself that, but this time i mean it. its my time. i want to say sorry to that little girl that thought she was going to become something. im so sorry i let you down, couldnt make something of myself. it hurts so much, i cant take it anymore
