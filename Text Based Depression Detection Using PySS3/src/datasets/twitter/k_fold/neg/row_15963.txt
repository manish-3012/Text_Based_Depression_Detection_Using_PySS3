I feel so aloneI'm 27 and married. I have a child who is 4 almost 5. My husband was controlling at the beginning of the relationship before I was old enough to know better. Then we were pregnant and I thought having a child would bring me companionship. He is not affectionate. We work opposite schedules. He goes out twice a week. I have no friends. My job is at home. I don't leave he house other than for daycare or the grocery store or to fill up at the gas station. I have no family. Sometimes I just cry because I feel like I'm worthless. I want to end how I feel but I can't help but feel so guilty because I have a child. I just feel financially trapped and emotionally drained. I'm mentally exhausted. I attempted to talk to an old friend who was always there for me prior to my marriage. They said they had people over and were too busy. Please help.
