I just feel defeated.Um hey reddit. Guess who just failed a class and is being held back. Me. I'm 16 and have been struggling with depression for the past 4 years. I've been In the hospital for severe depression and self harm. On top of this my mother is making me move to Florida, away from all my friends and my girlfriend. All the people that I can really live for. She doesn't care, I've talked about it with her numerous times. I feel like killing myself would be the easier way out. But try and tell me otherwise.
