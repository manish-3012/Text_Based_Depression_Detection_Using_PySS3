Struggling to cope, yet againThis is again the only place I have to go. Tomorrow would've been the second year anniversary with my girlfriend but she broke things off due to my anxiety. My anxiety and thoughts of suicide have only worsened since then.

I feel a very uncomfortable tightness in my heart all the time, every day. I think about dying every single day. 

I need something right now. I'm struggling to find a reason to actually continue fighting. I usually love reading but I can't get past the first few pages in any book I pick up. My thoughts just consume me.

I ruined my relationship and myself. Everyone in my life keeps lying to me for one reason or another, no matter how much I lay down for them or try. I'm sorry I keep coming here, I just have nowhere else to vent or seek help while I wait in between therapy sessions.

It's so hard to find genuine people who care. I feel so alone. I am alone. I'm sorry for coming here over and over, I know I need to stop.
