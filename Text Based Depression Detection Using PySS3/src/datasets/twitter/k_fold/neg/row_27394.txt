I've lived a decade of wanting to die, but I'm getting tired of fighting.I feel in the quiet moments that I am teetering above an abyss of unknowable darkness and lack of possibility. The feeling seems indescribable most times. I roll to my side and see my husband sleeping beside me. I decide not to wake him. I know it will pass but I dont know for certain how many more of these teetering moments I can take and still survive. 
In these quiet moments of suicidality, the near-constant, crazed urge of wanting to die is finally allowed to sit in the amphitheater of my thoughts, alone in the center in a position of just existing and being acknowledged. It's like my life slows to a stop and nothing else matters besides the ever-present need to cease to exist. And it is ever present. I am happy most of the time, living a happy life with all I need to be joyful. It still lurks in the corner of my mind in the form of a void begging for my presence. I can be with friends and it beckons me to run the car off of the road on the way home. If I've had fun, its the voice in my head telling me to hit myself because I need to pay the toll. It is the autopilot that takes over and begins beating myself and wailing noises I didnt know I could make when I come to a conclusion that I cannot accept or understand. 
I love my life. I dont understand why I am like this. I feel so deeply sad sometimes that I just dont want to be here anymore. I've been to years of therapy. I have the most loving, supportive husband that the world could offer. I am grateful for what I have. I dont know what I'm looking for by sharing this. A sense of community perhaps? Some advice? I dont think I'm an immediate danger to myself or others. I just dont think this is is a sustainable life.
