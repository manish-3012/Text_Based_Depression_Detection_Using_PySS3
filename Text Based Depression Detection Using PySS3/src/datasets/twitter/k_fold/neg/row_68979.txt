Mom killed herself on my 25th birthdayIt'll be two years just after this Christmas. 
I've been thinking about it a lately. 

Man of, man. 
How did I get here.

Haven't talked to my family since.
6 aunts and uncles.
Two dozen cousins.

Looking for thoughts.
Literally all comments appreciated.


Thanks in advance.
Give love. Get love.
