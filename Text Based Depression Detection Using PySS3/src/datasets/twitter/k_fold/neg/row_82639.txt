Whenever something goes terribly wrong, I just think of ending it.Hey guys,

I don't know if this qualifies as depression or something that needs immediate attention, but I usually have days where when shit hits the fan, something goes wrong, stupid amounts of stress, or I just over react to something I get into this thought provoking overly critical judgmental view of myself that I don't snap out of until the next day. I think about what I've done wrong, how it's affected me, how worthless I am, and the list goes on. It's like a never ending cycle of self loathing.

 Now I posted here instead of /r/depression because I definitely have thought about just ending it. More or less every time I get into this mood. How often it occurs is maybe once a week, sometimes less and sometimes more. 

Perhaps it's a cry for attention/help, maybe I'm just being a spoiled little shit, or I do have a problem. I'm better off than most people why do I think like this. I don't know. I never do just end it because I keep thinking I would be a little shit for not dealing with life. I keep telling myself that it's a bitch move and I'm better than that. But the other day I just looked at a bottle of tylenol when it was an amazingly shitty day and I stared it for awhile.

**Note** I'm not trying to advocate my way of dealing with this, I'm just trying to get this off my chest.

I just wanted to get this out there.
Thanks for reading everyone!
