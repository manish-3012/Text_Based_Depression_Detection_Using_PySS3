Iâ€™m a piece of shit (vent)I hate myself more than anything. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because one friend who doesnâ€™t want me to die. All I do is ruin their life though, anyways. I stress them out by talking about how bad I want to die and all my problems even though they have way too many of their own that they never talk about. My parents wonâ€™t let me get any mental health help because they donâ€™t believe in it. Iâ€™m transgender and they hate me because I tried to discreetly start to transition and they told be I was â€œtrying to be a boyâ€ and that it was sick and unnatural. Iâ€™m fat and ugly and I look like a female. The only person Iâ€™ve ever experienced genuine attraction to is disgusted by me. I feel so alone and lost and like Iâ€™m a burden to everyone. I talked to the school psychologist and she didnâ€™t help me at all; in fact, Iâ€™m a lot worse since I went. She insists on calling my mom but last time she did I got in huge trouble for seeking help because â€œI have everything I need and Iâ€™m ungrateful for wanting to dieâ€. Iâ€™m planning on ODing sometime this summer (before my senior year in high school). I think I might try to make my friend hate me before so theyâ€™re not hurt by it. Even if I lived I would go into college as a female, looking like a female, named as a female, and dressed like one. I could not legally change my name until after I started and I would be outed to yet another group. My whole body physically aches. I hate myself Iâ€™m a piece of shit and Iâ€™m ruining everyone elseâ€™s happiness. I was a mistake. I wish I was aborted.
