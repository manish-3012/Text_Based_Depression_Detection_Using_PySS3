Not too sure I can do this anymoreI've gone through so many 'I'm gonna do it this time' moments, but have never been able to bring myself to actually commit. I feel so alone in this war with myself. Nobody takes me seriously, and I'm not sure how to talk to anyone about what I'm going through because I've heard 'you have no reason to be depressed' from my own family. I've talked to therapists  but I always come out of them with the realization that maybe I'm just being too sensitive about things. There's a part of me that wants to keep fighting  but what is the point? Nobody's life is any different because of me, no matter how hard I tried to be positive for them. In fact, I hinder and annoy people more than I do make people happy, so my last act of goodness can be getting rid of myself for them, right? I have so much love for those in my life, but I realised that they don't feel the same. I know that all it would take to help me is if I had someone to tell me everything is gonna be alright, but I'm so alone I doubt anybody would notice enough to say it.
Maybe just this rant alone is enough to help change my mind, but thank you for taking the time to read this. I'm new to reddit, so I haven't had much of a chance to explore the site, but it's nice seeing there's a subreddit dedicated to people who feel the same. I'm sorry this was so long.
