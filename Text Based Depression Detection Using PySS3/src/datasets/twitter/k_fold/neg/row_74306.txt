Every single mind is a universe collapsing.First of all, **hello and sorry for my wacky english**, it's not my native language but i'll do my best.

I've been a reader of this sub reddit for a while now, i'm not a very active reddit user (i mostly restrain myself to reading only) **I'm 25 years old**, halfway to 26, male, loved doing sports and excersise since i was little, **i'm a sound engineer**, i'm a animal lover (not vegan tho), i've played online video games my whole life, i'm 6,29 ft (1.92 mts tall), and **i'm honestly so** **lost** that i don't even know where to start, but i'll try.

**I've never been a family dude**, my core family is quite small (Mom, dad and a older sister), and the rest of my family has never been around, (and i think that's okay, i don't feel like we would like eachother very much) **My dad** is a photographer and he has been very passionate about it, he is around 63-65 years old (not sure lol) and he has always been very affective, kind and very smart. **My mom** was an incredibly outrageous woman, the kind that would set her mind to something and would accomplish it, she would devour books in just a couple of days, she was an actress like very few, incredibly passionate about her job, and would not take roles that would not fulfill her in some way. And **my sister** that is 10 years older than me, damn, she has always been **my role model**, the perfect combination between my mother and father, she managed to leave the country at the age of 16 to study and never stopped since then, she is terribly passionate about her life, she never stops grinding, like never, for real, she is about to obtain her P.h.D, she has traveled the world more than i can recall, she met **an incredible man**, as smart, passionate and compassive as my sister is. They have two beautiful daughters and are currently living in a nordic country.

My family and i lived in a **very small apartament** since i was two years old, in a twelve floor the apartament had no doors inside the house, had only one room and one bathroom, an small balcony, a tiny kitchen and the living room was also quite small.

**My sister left the country when i was 6 years old**, and that left a mark on me, i remember being in the airport, at that time i was on a wheelchair because i had some issues on my knees that would not allow me to stand, damn, i've never been so mad in my life i think, my sister was leaving and i was there, unable to simply stand up in both of my feets (i played a lot of soccer and was very hyperactive kid) so this was so frustrating that i was **equally mad and sad**.

After that my life just kept on going, my mom and dad started to have **some serious issues in their relationship**, they started to fight over anything and things would heat up in no time, they would throw dishes at eachother and yell like there where going to kill eachother, all this while i was playing with a friend of mine just outside the door, it was embarrassing, it was painful, it was a total disaster for me. Soon after they would divorce and fight over my custody (i stayed with my mom) and my dad had to leave the house.

My relationship with my mom **wasnt a good one**, she loved me, and i loved her, but we where unable to be in peace with eachother, i'm stubborn kid, and she worked really hard so she wasnt at home most of the time, **i learned to cook** since i was a kid because my mom would not come to the house until 12 pm or something because she was rehearsing for a show or something, so i stayed a big part of each day playing outside alone, sometimes they would hire a girl to take care of me. Or i would be a in a very close friend house (he lives in the upper floor).

My dad and i would get along much better than me with my mom, he is much softer and would love to play sports with me (soccer, baseball, running, hiking) but he wasnt living with me anymore, so i think that made harder my relationship between my mom and i (**i guess i would blame her** for making my dad leave the house) 

Years went through and i kept on going to a private school, kept on seeing my friends with their families and feelling weird about me, **often wondering whats the difference between them and me**, my mom and dad didn't had a good salary at all, so we would always be in debt to the school, i remember being part of the very small list of people in debt with the school, always on top of the list. That feelling was embarrassing, the school trips where always terrible because my friends would end up paying for me and i was really unable to understand why the hell i was so different from all of them. And always made me wonder why i was there.

In highschool i would meet someone that would have a **huge impact in my life**, she was this shy girl with very beautiful face, very big eyes that would perfectly match with her astonishing eyebrows, light skin color and hair that was so smooth that would not even need to brush her hair. Her voice had this perfect pitch that is actually enjoyable to hear, she is also so smart and kind, like the kindest person i've met in my whole life, a girl to nurture and protect. sadly for her **she fell in love with me**, and even worst (for her), i started to like her a lot too, so we dated and we became a couple in the last year of high school.

By that time my relationship with my mom would have gotten **worst with each year that passed**, until it got physical, my mom hitted me and i lost it, i went berserk and broke some dishes, punched the corrugated wall with my naked fist, broke a calendar we had on the kitchen. I  left the house crying and moved with my girlfriend and her family (mom, dad, a little brother and a little sister). This was totally different, the apartament was beautiful, with an amazing view. Her mom is one of the **most beautiful human beings i've ever met**, she is 200% dedicated to her childrens. Her father was a very serious, very focused and incredibly supportive dad. They payed for my whole last year of highschool, they would drive us to the movies and back home and would do anything for us to be alright. After that i tried going to the university to study sociology with her but i would drop it. They even supported me while not knowing what to do with my life, they payed for my sound engineer studies and supported me every step of the way.

**-Going to stop here for a second-** 

By the time i was studying sociology my mom **got diagnosed with cancer** and started to battle with it, she won battle over battle and fighted that for like 8 years or so, she had more than 3 or 4 different kinds of cancer over the years (or even more) until she lost the fight the last year.

The rocky relationship we had didn't got much better while the time was passing, i was far away, and as the time passed she tried to come closer to me again, but i would not listen, i would not see, my mom always said she would beat cancer and i actually **took that for granted**. 

When her situation got worst my sister came from Canada and told my the situation was critical. And it sure was, when i saw her she would have problems to stand on her feet, but she was so proud that would do anything to stand straight. She saw me and said with a defeated face that her last chemoterapy didnt went as expected, that it was a **"partial victory"** but there is no partial victory while fighting cancer and she had undergo all the options she had, so this was it, it was the final couple of months, my mom was a very active woman, with this very long and curly hair. By the end of her life she didn't looked the same, **i saw how the cancer consumed** her inside out and i was unable to open myself, i was just trying to keep my eyes shut until the very last month where i tried to be every moment i could with her in the hospital, and that's how she died, in a hospital bed, tired after so many years of suffering and fighting cancer. After telling me way to many times that she would make it, after telling herself that over and over, after spending all the money everyone had to do it, she was still unable to win the fight.

Meanwhile i took every single call to make myself miserable, **i managed to break** this incredibly outstanding woman heart over and over, while living with her and her family, i enclosed myself so badly that i would feel uncomfortable in her house, not because anyone would tell me that or anything, it was always in my head, i felt that my simple presence was something that wasnt enjoyable, that it was troublesome for everyone. She was in love with me and i was in love with her, but my self destructive self only wanted to isolate myself from anything that would move my life forward in a positive way. My self confidence grew short and that made me just go from bad to worst, to rock bottom.

**I've been killing myself for a very long time now.**

**I actually tried** to change the course of my life, i started doing lots of excersise, got involved with a band i love to work with and wanted to do some modeling, i just wanted to get my sh!t moving and trying to take back all the time i lost. **Then it happened,** after some months of being focused on getting myself into a better version i met this guy that worked for a modeling agency and offered me a deal to go into big casting, he offered me everything i would need and told me that i had the potential to win, and winning meant having a much better life i had. I went berserk with that plan, i just wanted that to happen, to be real, i wanted to win, i wanted to win so bad. All i had in mind was starting to get paid finally, i wanted to see the lights, i wanted to be able to give back, i've been feelling so powerless my whole life and this was the moment i could turn everything around, help my dad, being able to give back to this family that adopted me, i wanted to travel with this girl and finally trying to get some stuff done, i wanted to talk about the future with her, i wanted to settle down, **i wanted everything,** everything i was confident. I had a good chance. 

**I was too naive.**

This guy that offered me the chance to be a model, the dude that payed for my gym and my personal trainer in that moment took advantage of me, he drug me and sexually abused of me, this was like 3 months ago. I cannot try to explain how i feel when writing this. I just don't know if i just had it coming, for being a selfish trash can for such a long time. I cannot hold the tears because the memories i have of it are awful, i feel smaller than ever, i feel like im the dirtiest shit ever, i feel like there is no way no one would ever like me, or should like me, because everything that's around me gets hurt, because i'm stained from the inside out, because i cannot go a day without having flashbacks of being unable to move in that car, having this blurry vision of this fat and bald dude pulling my shirt up to spit on me and lick me everywhere, i just can't hold myself anymore, i ain't worthy of anything and sincerly **i would like to die**.

I stil live in this girls house, but we are not longer anything, (she says we are but she is no longer insterested in me, im convinced that she is dating other people even if she tells me that she is not (im a piece of shit scumbag that went through her phone and tablet. So, yes i know)) i try to stay away from this beautiful place because i feel even worst than before, i don't have anywhere to go. My father is having a very hard times here (like most people in **Venezuela**) he is having some health problems and there is nothing to work with in this country, my dad is unemployed. My relationship with my sister has grown thinner with every year it goes, we don't fight, we don't hate eachother, we just don't talk much anymore.

I would like a lot for this relationship to end, but i just can't do it, i'm unable to do it, and **this girls heart is so warm and big** that she would not kick me out of the house. But still, i just can't be around her right now. I really feel dirty, worthless, tiny, insignificant. I want sincerly want to kill myself, but i know i wont do it because i'm too scared to do it, i cannot hang myself, last week i actually did took a belt and placed around my neck and started to strangle myself but just ended up scared in the bed crying until i fell asleep. I wont take pills because fuck, i read too much, i just dont want to try to kill myself and end up alive with permanent brain damage, unable to really end me. I've been ballsy, i go careless in the street at dangerous hours walking, just wishing for something bad to happen to me. I guess it would be easier for the people around me. I cannot afford a gun, and i have no idea where to get one, im too scared to jump from the window. 

I really wish she would just end me, end this relationship, **end myself.** She knows about what happened to me, but she is mad at all i did to her (she is right to be). It was a terrible mistake telling her this, i just cannot even imagine how she sees me now. i just cannot keep on living like this, since i got abused my mind is everywhere, my jelously went psychopath levels, i cannot see her holding her phone because my mind goes crazy, she is not interested in me but she is in other people, still, she is near me all day, we sleep close to eachother every night but we cannot touch. I can't take this.

I have to apologize because my grammar it's getting worst the more i write, i'm too shaky right now, my eyes are really cloudy.

I just **want to cry**, but i don't want to be seen.

I just want to be held, but **i don't want anyone to know**.

I just want this to get out my head, but im certain that **i wont be able.**

I just **want to kill myself**, but i know, deep inside of me, that if i try, i'll fail, and my misery will just get worst.

Sorry for the long post. (it **could have been longer**)
