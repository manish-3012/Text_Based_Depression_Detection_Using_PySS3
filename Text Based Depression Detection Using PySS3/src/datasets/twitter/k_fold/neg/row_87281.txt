My voice is making me suicidalI was bullied in high school every single day because of a problem I can't fix (voice sounds like a blocked nose when I talk), so I just pretty much stopped talking. This made me depressed and fat and have sevre anxiety. Depression made me fail do many exams at school, and made me gain weight. When I try calling over the phone my voice just sounds so shit, and always mumbling when I talk. I have thousands of things in my mind that I want to say but I just can't physically say it. I finished high school last Thursday and i'm pretty much all alone (well,I've been alone and single my whole life but the last  few weeks just seem like being alone is trying to kill me). I tried to call a GP yesterday but at the last second I had an anxiety attack and I quickly just ended the call. My dads been in hospital for 4 weeks or so, and my mum has to go there every single day.

Everything just feels so overwhelming and I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to do. If you guys don't hear from me in the next week then I guess I'll be gone.
