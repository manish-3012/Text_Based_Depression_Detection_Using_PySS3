I don't want to liveI don't want to live anymore. Life is so hard. There is so much stress every day, and very few good things in my life. I have about an average life, I'm not poor nor rich. But I don't get it, why do people want to live a life like this? Doing school/work for so many hours in a day, and then what? 1 hour of computer games/doing something fun? I don't feel the work is paying off. And even the things that I had fun doing are less and less fun. 
What is keeping you guys alive?
