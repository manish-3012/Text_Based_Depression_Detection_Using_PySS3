I donâ€™t have the meansI guess itâ€™s a good thing. I have a knife and held it to myself to plunge it in but I couldnâ€™t go through with it cause Iâ€™m a coward. I guess itâ€™s a good thing I donâ€™t have a gun since that would be much easier. Idk why Iâ€™m posting here yet again. I just think about it every day. I recently got started with therapy but I havenâ€™t had any results yet. I feel so fucking low. Thanks for anyone who reads. I know itâ€™s pathetic.
