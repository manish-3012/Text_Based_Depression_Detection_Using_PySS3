Just wrote my suicide letter.After a while feeling anything but loneliness and pain I've been thinking a lot about, I'm going to end this soon. Felt I did everything that I could.
 
I wrote a lot here but deleted it.

This was the first place that I searched for talk about this, I felt like a ghost until now.
