Life is like a bad partyYou're at a party and really not enjoying yourself. There are moments that you enjoy, but you're very quickly brought back to thoughts of how little you are enjoying yourself. It seems like the best thing for you would be to leave and go to sleep, where you'd no longer be being miserable.

People keep saying "don't leave, you'll enjoy yourself at some point in the future" but that doesn't help how you feel now. You know that once you're asleep there is just nothing, you won't be miserable you won't be happy you just won't be conscious of anything, and that feels so much more preferable to the horrible time you're having. 

You're constantly wracked with guilt that if you left the party, your family and friends would be unhappy because they wouldn't be able to spend time with you. This guilt just makes everything feel a million times worth. Wouldn't it be so much easier if there was a way you could sneak off and sleep without anyone noticing.

While you know you'd be missing out on a whole range of fun things that could/ will happen at the party, once you're asleep you will never be aware of these things so don't feel like you'r really missing everything.

Almost every moment of the party you have thoughts of "you should leave, leave the party, sleep, this is horrible, why don't you leave" even when you're having fun

It just seems like so much work would be needed to get to a point where you're happy at the party, and why can't you just sleep and miss it all
