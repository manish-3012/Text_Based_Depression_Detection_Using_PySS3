I tried and Iâ€™m glad I was shit at knotsI felt like I wanted to die for a very long time, I realised recently that it was more the pressure of capitalism and my Gen X parents who grew up with the Thatcher/Reagan ideology / yuppie, you can make whatever you want of yourself(as long as youâ€™re middle class) fuck man... Iâ€™m the product of genX and I know for a fact,dad, you want to be dead. You were a working class man that got tricked into this fucked up ideology that you could make something of yourself. You voted for Thatcher three times. Fuck; theyâ€™ve got us... they got you and me... fuck
