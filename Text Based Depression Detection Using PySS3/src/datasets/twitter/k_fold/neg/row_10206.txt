There's no point to my life I can't do anything that would be useful for anyone. And my mental health and personality are deteriorating. I think I'll try to kill myself soon. I wish I could have become someone. But it doesn't matter. No matter how many people care, one noname less doesn't make a difference. And I've hurt too many people already to think that I'm just a victim. I'm just part of an unlucky shuffle, that I couldn't deal with.
