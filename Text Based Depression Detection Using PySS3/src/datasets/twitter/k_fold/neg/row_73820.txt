Life is nothing but pain, why can't I end itI want to die. I just want to close my eyes and never wake up. I cut myself , but never in a spot I know will kill me. Whenever I try to comit suicide I just can't bring myself to end it. I think I'm manic depressive, and I was just told by a friend they didn't want for me to lean on them emotionally. They were fed up with my bitching, and so am I. Why can't I just fucking die. I have noone. I'll never find someone who cares enough to care. I can't afford treatment. My social anxiety ruins my chances at getting work. I feel so alone.
