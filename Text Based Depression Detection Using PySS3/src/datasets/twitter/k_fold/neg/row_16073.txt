I don't see a point anymoreI just don't see a point anymore. I don't have a future, I don't see myself anywhere in 5 or 10 years, I don't know how to do anything useful. I feel unwanted and lonely and too scared to reach out to anyone I know. I struggle with self-harm and people make fun out of it. I don't remember  the last time I was happy with myself. The only reason I haven't attempted yet is that I'm afraid of my parents knowing that I'm dead, or them thinking that it's their fault. I just don't see any other way right now.
