forever aloneI've been alone my whole 27 years of being on this planet. Nobody has ever really loved me, just acted like it to benefit them in some sort of way. soon to be no family. The Few friends i do posses have been dropping like flies over the past couple years.  I am tired of trying in a world where i don't belong. I hope that someday soon i can be homeless with just a dog that hopefully loves me. then i can just die outside in the cold because i'm too much of a pussy to do it myself. Best of luck to all of you
