Can't see myself living anymoreI've been having thoughts of committing suicide for about 3-4 years now, and it is not fun at all. In fact, it's gotten so bad, I can't even see myself living past graduation (I'm a junior in high school). I've even had thoughts of what my funeral would look like. 

I feel absolutely miserable all the time, and I just don't know what to do anymore. Therapy doesn't work, my meds don't work. Hell, I've even tried exercising, and that doesn't even work, either. 

I want to live, but my thoughts are consuming me like a plague. Fortunately, I have the support of my family and friends, but I feel like it's not helping much. 

I just need a way to get out of this without actually committing suicide.
