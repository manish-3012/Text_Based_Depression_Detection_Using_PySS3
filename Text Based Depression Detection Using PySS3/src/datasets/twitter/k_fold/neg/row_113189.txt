I am trying my very hardestI recently got back together with someone I've had an on and off relationship with, and I feel like I've hurt him to the point where he's just not the same, and it's killing me. I've been struggling for too long, I don't know how to handle all of this, my dad doesn't quite understand my mental health issues, and I am professionally diagnosed with autism.. I hate my disability and I hate myself. I hate my skin, it doesn't feel right.. I hate my confusing emotions. I really hate how I need constant reassurance on almost everything, I hate how I am treated like a child, at the same time though, I wish I was nothing more than just a dumb child, unaware of her surroundings, not having a worry in the world...I don't want to disappoint my parents during the holidays either. Life feels like its grabbing me by the throat, I am terrified of posting this... I annoy everyone in my sight, I'm sorry.
