Feeling the pressure.Going on my 3rd year of my 2 year degree.

I suck at school. It's so hard to understand what the teachers are telling me. I'm incompetent and no matterr how hard I try I can't understand. I've gone to tutors, shut myself in and studied for hours and days, exhausted all my options. I feel worthless and stupid. I just want to quit school and pursue my other job opportunities with my brothers insurance business. I keep failing and falling over but my parents push me harder and harder to stay in school and do well.

I can't do well and I'm going to fail and on top if all that my school just changed my requirements to graduate so I only have 19 credits that count out of the 40 I've completed. I just want to move on with my life. Why am I so worthless and unable to learn.
