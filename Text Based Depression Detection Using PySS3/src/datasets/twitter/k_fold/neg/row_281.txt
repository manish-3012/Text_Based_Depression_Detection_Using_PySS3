I want to die - fastI can hear my heart beating through my ears right now. today was pretty bad, I wont go into details but in short, got up at 10, did something nice, then prepared to get on with my day by going somewhere till my mum started a fight, she left and i grabbed a bottle of wine (btw im 15 i shudnt even be drinking) and drank it. then mum caught me and told me that the bottle of wine was extremely expensive and didnt belong to us. I drank a sip as i was about to get drunk but didnt

i dont know what to do because i took a sip and im scared what the wines owners will say about it as it was expensive and they are friends on my mum.

help? I want to die but my mum took the wine away and knives, I want to over dose but last time I did that it failed and i was put into hospitals and shit and they didnt treat me very well and i think a law suit happened not too sure but it was seriously fucked up and it happened for YEARS only stopped last year and Ive been trying to go back into a normal life but I cant and I want to kill myself

my family is so damn FUCKED, there all so messed up and I hate school, I hate myself, I dont have many friends and the friends I do have are all pieces of shit 

i want to die
