I think i have cancer... I guess fate decided for me...Always wondered if should kill myself, but fate got irritated waiting for me to decide so it just told me "here. You are welcome" 
I will not go to a doctor. I will not check it. 

If i do have it then welp, bye guys.i just hope its not too painful

If not then false alarm just gonna live then...
