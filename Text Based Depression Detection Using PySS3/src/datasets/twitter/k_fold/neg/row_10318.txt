A Redditor Is Troubled and Now Discussing SuicideA Redditor is posting about fatalistic thoughts since the election and mentions suicide. I am not at all qualified to respond to this. I'm posting because I'm a moderator on the subreddit where it was posted.

If anyone here is able to reach out to this person and help, your kind assistance is appreciated:
