I want to kill myselfThis is my first post here and I'm just desperate at this moment to the point I'm doing this

I'm gonna kill myself soon

Because my life is unliveable now , it's fucked up in every kind of way I've lost everything I had.  that's why I just promised myself to not care about the stuff happening now and just have hope in the future . It worked out well for some time but now I just lost that too I don't see a point of living anymore
And know I'm gonna kill myself 

I feel isolated . Alone . Like a failure
