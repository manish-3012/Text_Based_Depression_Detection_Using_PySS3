I don't know if this is legitimate or not, but right now I really want to kill myselfI have a girlfriend, but she's really all I have at this point. I have no friends, no one is ever interested in hanging out with me, my family doesn't care about me, I have no interesting hobbies, my job sucks, I make no money, I have no goals, and I have no future. I just finished my first year of college and I feel like nothing has changed, and I still have no direction on life.

I honestly just want to break up with my girlfriend, run away, and kill myself somewhere in the woods, several states a away. I hate being this lonely and pathetic
