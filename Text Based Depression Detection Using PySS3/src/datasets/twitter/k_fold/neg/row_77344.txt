I don't want to be convinced to live anymore, I just want a way to accept my deathTitle. I give up. I've tried everything, from medication to therapy to hospitalization to trying new things and eating right and drinking water. I don't want this anymore. I don't want to be alive. Please just let me know that if I die it's okay, I'll be happier and finally be free.
