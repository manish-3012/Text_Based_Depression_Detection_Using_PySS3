I have right now 4 people really caring if I live or not but I worry I can't hold on for themI have a few friends, all of them live far away and 2 out of the 4 I met on Reddit, but they're the only ones I really think who care about me. Everyone else I think is just neutral and wouldn't be happy or sad if I died, it would just be whatever to them.


These 4 friends I try to hold on just for them but I don't know if I can. I don't want to let them down but I also think they'd ultimately be ok without me.


I don't know.
