March 16 2004 - August 17 2020It's been over 3 years of constant pain. I can't handle it anymore. 

I'm gonna meet my best friend tonight and have some fun with her one last time, go home, maybe spend some time with my cat, call my siblings and text my friends, then pretend to go to bed and hang myself when my parents are asleep. I've done my research, written my note, even tested the noose. Thanks for all the support I've received on this subreddit. Goodbye.
