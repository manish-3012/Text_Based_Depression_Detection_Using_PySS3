I thought reddit was niceI just was on omegle, wanting to talk to people. In the beginning of the convo, the stranger said "come on dont be a fag" to which i replied, actually, i am gay. The stranger proceeded to call me a little girl and ramble on about some stuff. All of the sudden, his ramblings come around to memes. "When I was your age, I used to be an adventurer...but then i got an arrow to the knee." Also, socially awkward  guardsman, scumbag theist, good guy redditer, philosorapter, "y u no", et cetera. He admitted to being a redditer. He made me feel like absolute shit. And he seemed to take pleasure in it. I asked him several times to stop, saying I was offended and hurt. That probably fueled him. I probably shouldnt have admitted I would cry myself to sleep tonight. He just kept hurting me. I thought reddit would be a place that would help me, that would make me feel ok instead of crappy like every other second of my life. Now I cant even look at a meme without remembering him. The one thing I thought I could count on to make me feel ok and not sad....gone. And right now all I want to do is end my pain.
