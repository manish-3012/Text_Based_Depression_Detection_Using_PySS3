I'm gonna do it.I have the rope tied around a tall tree branch, a chair underneath it, and my mind set on this decision. I'm going to put the noose around my neck and kick the chair over right after this is posted. I've been suffering with severe depression and anxiety for the past 3 years now. I've finally made up my mind and am going to leave this world with all my pain behind. This is it, this is really it. I hope you all live a much better life than I did. Hopefully, my family will appreciate my existence a lot more after my death. This is my final goodbye to this discouraging world.


Goodbye everyone!
