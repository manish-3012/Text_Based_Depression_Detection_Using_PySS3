I don't want to be here anymoreI almost feel selfish for feeling like this because from the outside it appears as if i have everything. I do have good parents and a nice house and my family are somewhat wealthy but this doesn't change how i feel. 

For a long time i've always identified with the quote about not wanting to commit suicide, just not exist anymore. And that was true until the last few days. At this point i really don't want to be alive anymore. 

I don't have a purpose and no one would notice if i was gone. I have 'friends' but no one makes the effort to talk to me or ask me whats wrong. I don't get invited anywhere and don't see anyone other than at school, where i'm ignored among my 'friends' anyway. I'm in love with someone who doesn't feel the same about me, which I can't say is unexpected because no one has ever desired me and probably never will, im too ugly and too broken. No one i speak to ever stays in my life for more than the few days it takes them to realise i'm not worth anything.

I'm so tired of going to sleep with tears on my face and emptiness in stomach every night. I breakdown about things every night and have no one to talk to about any of it because no one cares about me.

I'm sorry for ranting on here, i just don't know what else to do anymore. If things don't improve soon i will take my own life
