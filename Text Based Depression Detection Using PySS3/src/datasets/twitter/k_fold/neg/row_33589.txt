Ready to goI've fought very hard but my battles are never going to get better, they just get harder.

I will always be homeless.
I will always be transgender.
I will always be autistic.
I will never have a supportive family.
I am getting physically sicker by the day.

I've already hung on for far too long and I'm truly ready to go. I'm going to start writing my note and then I'm going to find a painless way to die. There's no rush, but I would like to be gone by the end of this year.
