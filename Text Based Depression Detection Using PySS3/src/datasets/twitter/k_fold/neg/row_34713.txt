I just canâ€™t do this anymore.Iâ€™ve always struggled with a heart condition, the pain varies from slight tingling to hurts to breathe depending on stress levels and physical activity. I HAD two exes, both of them broke up with me due to issues related to my condition. I was single and very closed for about a year, then I met this woman who made me feel so wonderful, like I could do anything, like I mattered. We go on five dates, every things going well, we like each other, similar personalities, same type of humor. I finally decide itâ€™s time to open up to her completely, I do every thing I can to make her comfortable, I know itâ€™s a lot to take in. I prepare dinner, I put on music by her favorite artist. When itâ€™s finally time I sit her down, I cry, not crocodile tears or sobs, just silent moments of how much I care for her and how hard this is for me. She tells me she needs space, so I give it to her, I expected this. She texts me after a week saying it canâ€™t work. Not because Iâ€™m Bi, not because of my depression, not because I pretty much have no friends, but because of my heart, she canâ€™t â€œbe a nurseâ€ her whole life. Iâ€™m so emotionally done, Iâ€™m done opening up, Iâ€™m done being the shoulder to cry on who stumbles because when he needs it no ones there for him.
