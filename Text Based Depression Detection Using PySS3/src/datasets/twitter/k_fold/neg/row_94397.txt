What's the point? You try &amp; it's pointless.Sigh. I've posted here before.. So I guess I'm still here and not great at following things through. 

I needed a place to vent. 

My entire existence has become my work. I hate my job. But, I'm good at it. It's ruined my life, because it was my escape and consumed me. I try hard, every day that I'm there. 

We're all getting our performance reviews right now. Turns out, the rest of the management team are getting the same grade as me and the personnel manager is getting the best grade possible. 

Don't get me wrong; I'm not jealous. I just don't understand. Some of the people I work with are completely useless, I (and others) have to spend our time fixing their varied and many mistakes. It's ridiculous. And senior management are well aware of the issues. So why the fuck have I given up so much, tried so hard, only to be told I'm only as good as the fucking idiots who literally do nothing? 

The personnel manager's grade is utterly laughable - the woman is awful at her job, we work in retail, yet she never leaves her office, does not talk to the store colleagues and actively gets off on gossiping about people. She's an abomination. 

I don't claim to be the best, never will. I just feel like this is such an injustice. Why should I bother? I've been shit on constantly and i take it and come back for more. 

My job is the only thing I've got. And it's been fucking cruel.
