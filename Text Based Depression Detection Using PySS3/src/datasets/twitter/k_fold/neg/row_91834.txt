I think it will happen this yearI'm 24, and for some 10 years I have been thinking about this daily. I feel like I'm closer than ever to actually do it. I've been seeing a therapist for a year but it hasn't really helped, the damage has already been done.

I can hear my parents downstairs, arguing about me. They are rightfully worried, my father is angry I promised to pursue a postgraduate degree this year but so far nothing. I haven't worked or studied since I graduated college at 21. Our house has always been like this, my father always arguing and screaming about something. But at barbecues and holidays with his relatives he's the life of the party, always cracking jokes and making everyone laugh.

I'm a closeted transgender woman, I have always known this. My parents turned a blind eye to the obvious signs over the years, and when we had a chance to do something about it when I was 15 they preferred to sweep it under the rug. As a child there was always something wrong with the way I laughed or what I talked, then as a teen they complained I didn't talked to then and showed no emotion, and now they don't say anything, just complain all the time. Whatever little personality I developed or any joy was cut from me, and now I don't even know who I am. 

The obvious answer would have been to have become independent, find a job, move out, transition. But it's too late now, I made my bed and I have to lie in it. Hormones and surgeries can't fix the damage of puberty, I will never look like a woman now. I will never be normal like everyone else. I don't even remember what it is like to have a friend.

My options are to become independent, transition, fail at it and destroy my family and become a social pariah, unable to find work or meaningful relationships. Or I'll become independent, continue to live this lie and eventually kill myself and destroy my family. Or I can just kill myself now and destroy my family.
