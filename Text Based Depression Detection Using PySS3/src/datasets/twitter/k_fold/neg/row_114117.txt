Why bother anymoreIf life in a nutshell is basicly disappointment, failure, and seeing that people who dont give a shit about anyone and anything have more success than you then why bother.
I dont know about other countries but in my country the end of school year is coming and im trying my hardest to fix my grades, BUT EVERYTHING I TRY IS A MASSIVE FAILURE. 
Suicide? No, maybe when i finally snap, but i didnt know where to seek for help, so im posting here because here you can get the best advice on how to keep going. Is there a way to calm down when the failures and problems just keep piling up.
