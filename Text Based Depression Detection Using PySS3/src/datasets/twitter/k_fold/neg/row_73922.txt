no suicide, but absolute despair that is returning when I felt suicidalso I used to feel suicidal and morbid despair, then I felt much better, I was in the right place and comfortable. 

im a saxophone player and in high school, and even now, one of the best around. but now that Iâ€™m in university going for engineering itâ€™s so hard going from the best to the absolute worst. everyone around me knows exactly what theyâ€™re doing. at the club I go to, they all are solid in everything they do and Iâ€™m fucking clueless. I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing. Iâ€™m worthless. that feeling aforementioned in the first line is returning and I feel it. I feel exactly how I felt when I wanted to end it all. i donâ€™t want it to return but it might. what can I possibly do? im literally just a number now that Iâ€™ve entered adulthood and Iâ€™m just another worthless person that will live their life and do nothing with it. I love mathematics, but I canâ€™t get a degree in that because Iâ€™ll go nowhere, either a teacher or Iâ€™ll end up in a field other than math. I want to be successful, I really do. but right now, every monday and wednesday when I return from my formula one automotive society at 11:00 at night after trying to get better I realize Iâ€™m just so fucking pathetic and that I truly have no meaning. 

ive always been a pessimist so thatâ€™s nothing different than usual, but now, now I donâ€™t even want to fucking exist.
