by the time you read this, ill most likely be gone. I can't take it anymore. This entire year has been a shitshow. My business partner fucked me over before COVID was relevant, the pandemic has canceled my senior year of High School, and now I'm falling for a co-worker who I just know that I have no chance with (hell, I think she already rejected me by rejecting my follow request.). I'm an ugly and useless piece of shit who deserves to be publicly shamed, humiliated, and executed. I plan on ending it all in the near future. I'm sick of being here when everyone I come across ends up hating me. I serve no purpose in this world other than to be God's punching bag and someone who is fun to reject for no reason. There is always something going wrong in my life. I wish to be at peace and killing myself is the only way.
