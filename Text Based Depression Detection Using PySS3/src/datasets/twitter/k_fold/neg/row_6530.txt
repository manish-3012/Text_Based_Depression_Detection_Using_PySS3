Anytime I stop drinking or using some drug or supplement that gets me out of it, I'm suicidal again. I'm going to have to do it eventually. I should do it soon.Just too weak to get it over with. Should do it. Gonna have liver problems/failure soon anyway. Might as well die. We all die right? It's scary but we all die, so I should just get to be okay with it all.
