I want it to be over. This isnâ€™t fair.I am tired of being selfless. My ex bf gets to be selfish and walk out on me and I canâ€™t be selfish and end my life because it considered.. weak? Or pathetic?

A little background, I was sexually abused as a child on multiple occasions by family friends and strangers. I never had a happy life.  In high school, I cope through drugs and a series of bad choices. 


Now, Iâ€™m 24 barely transferring to a university in Spring where I still have to wait 2 yrs for a degree that people consider â€œpointless or equivalentâ€ to a high school diploma.  Which wonâ€™t  get me a job. While people my age already got their degree 2 years ago. 

Iâ€™m tired of dissociating, Iâ€™m tired of just being tired. My anxiety levels are high again and Iâ€™ve been depressed with the whole break up. I donâ€™t connect with my friends or my family. I have no one. The first person I opened up to about all my mental issues was my ex who walked out two days before my 24th birthday.  On my birthday I cancelled my party to go and beg for him back  and got rejected so badly. 

Iâ€™m tired of hurting. Iâ€™m tired of hurting so much. I didnâ€™t even have a proper childhood which turn to a shitty teenage life which lead to a pathetic and hopeless adult life.
