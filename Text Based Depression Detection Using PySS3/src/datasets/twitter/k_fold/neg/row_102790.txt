Tell me something to stop me(29M) giving up on my family(32F &amp; 5F twins)I originally posted this elsewhere but it got removed and they told me to ask for support here


I don't want this, this life is shit, I'm beyond miserable. I love my girls and that's why I've let myself suffer for all these years. Everything I do, I do for all of them, nobody, not even myself has done anything for me in years. The only person on this entire planet who gives a shit about me is one of my twin girls, Amy. Amy is my favorite of the two if I'm honest. Kelly, the other twin, just irritates me, she's so "me, me, me" and probably end up being one of those bitches bending over for likes on the internet whereas Amy is intelligent, caring and is probably going places in her life. I'd barely believe they were related if they weren't identical. Just 2 weeks prior to posting this, Amy attacked Kelly at school because Kelly was picking on some boy that day Kelly came home screaming about how Amy hit her and Amy came to me crying because she felt bad for the boy. That should tell you how different they are from the other. Kelly is an awful person and will probably continue to be. Don't give me "Oh she's a child". Yeah well Amy is a child too and she seems to naturally understand what's right and what's not. Kelly knows but she doesn't care, she is evil. I didn't even want kids anyway it was an "accident". Accident my ass.


My wife is more worried about our dire financial situation more than she is about my even more dire(in my opinion) emotional situation. Not worried enough to get a part-time job though apparently, so it can't be that dire can it? Bitch. "Oh how are we supposed to pay the rent month?" I'd just love to see her try and pay the rent once I finally snap and put my Fn 509 to my skull, she'd be truly fucked then.Â  But naaah, it's all about them "Family first dude". I FUCKING GET IT! NOBODY GIVES A SHIT ABOUT ME! I just do my job feeding them and beyond that nobody fucking cares. Them first apparently means me never, so fuck it whatever. No wonder so many men kill their families and then turn the guns on themselves, I completely understand, it all makes sense to me now. THIS is how they must feel, trapped, like a slave, hopeless, miserable, angry. Oh and obviously all of this has taken its toll on me in the bedroom, so, ya know, an extra thing to add to the daily bitching I have to listen to.


The one saving grace I HAD was that I used to like to smoke 1 blunt per day and that really used to take the edge off of life. BUT NOOOOO!!! QUICK! FRANKLIN IS ENJOYING SOMETHING, REMOVE IT FROM HIM! Where I work started doing random drugs tests so YAAAAAYYYY now work can tell me what I'm allowed to do at home now!!! FUCKING YAAAAYY!!! Ultra-aggressive sarcasm if you couldn't tell. So now not only do I have to work 50 hours per week for tuppence, but now they get a say on how I can relax at home. Fuck this country, fuck this planet, fuck this species, fuck you, fuck me. Am I really allowed NOTHING?! Oh yeah, I'm the man of the house so I just got to suck it up and shut the fuck up, who gives a shit if I'm miserable as long as my family are supported right? Fuck this shit man.


I love them(yes, even Kelly somehow), and want them to be happy but I don't know if I can keep doing this. I own a loaded gun for christ's sake it would just be SO easy to grab it, drive to the desert and finally give myself peace from this shit hole of a planet.
