Epiphany on the selflessness of SuicideI wanted to write this down somewhere because I still struggle with thoughts of suicide. A moment ago, I had an epiphany, why I hadn't really taken the final steps.

It's not because I know people love me. I've used that as my sole reason why--it would devastate everyone I know. Then thinking about my toddler girl, how she would never be the same if I did such a thing. 

Then the thought occurred to me: I love her so damn much. I love my husband, and I love my unborn daughter. I love my parents, my siblings.

So, it's not the fact that I know they love me that stops me. But that if I died, I would be taking away their experience of MY love for them. By taking myself out of the world not only shows that I didn't care they love me, but that I would be taking MY love away from THEM. They'd never experience my love again.

My love for them should always outweigh my own self-love. By loving them, I can love myself in healtheir ways.

So, death by suicide would be the most selfish thing I'd do. And appearing selfish is one of the hardest thing and what I hate about myself the most. I'm selfish. But I will never do the ultimate act of selfishness.

So, I hope from here on, my thoughts will get easier.
