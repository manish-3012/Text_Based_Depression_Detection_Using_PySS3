Maybe life was never meant for me.Iâ€™m so tired. Just so tired of everything. I wish I could call my therapist and talk to him but I know itâ€™s inappropriate and itâ€™s unfair to disrupt his own life aside from our biweekly sessions. 

Iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that life was never meant for me. Growing up, I was mentally and physically abused by my dad. I was an unfavored child to my mother. I canâ€™t make friends and keep them like my twin sister can; no matter what, I just donâ€™t want to put in the time, energy, or resources just to be hurt by â€œfriends.â€ I was sexually assaulted 3 years ago, which has torn a piece of myself that Iâ€™ve never recovered from. Oh, and Iâ€™ve come to turns with my bisexuality, but people have cut me off after finding out. 

I have a love and passion for psychology and counseling, which Iâ€™m currently in school for, but how the fuck can I help others when I struggle so much myself? How do I keep from transferring this hopelessness? I canâ€™t. 

The icing on the cake is that Iâ€™m sleeping on my couch after being locked out of my room by my husband. Iâ€™m so tired of being abused physically, mentally, and emotionally, especially by the person who says they â€œloveâ€ me. Iâ€™m so tired of going through the cycles. He keeps me trapped financially and I donâ€™t know what I would do if we split. Iâ€™m only 23 years old and I canâ€™t imagine living another 23 years like this. I donâ€™t want to divorce because I love him so much, but he refuses to help this marriage. 

I canâ€™t do it all and I donâ€™t want to do it all anymore. I wish I could take my car and drive it into the ocean. I donâ€™t know why I have this thought, but it keeps recurring. 

I wish the universe didnâ€™t waste its energy cultivating this life, because I donâ€™t even want it anymore.
