Closer than Iâ€™ve ever beenI honestly donâ€™t care anymore. That kind of scares me. But at the same time, it honestly makes me feel very comfortable. Itâ€™s a pleasant feeling. Like itâ€™s all almost over. I used to be afraid of the God. Now, Iâ€™m almost to where I have no care at all about anything. Iâ€™ve already given up on my family. Theyâ€™ve given up on me. I am autistic. God forbid they actually treat me like a human. I have fixed so many things and done Great things on my own. The problem is, they donâ€™t know about it. I have to do it everything and even live my life on my own. Iâ€™m 21 and still get treated like a baby. Iâ€™ve tried everything and no matter what, they have no faith. Iâ€™ve driven a lot practice for my real license, only because of my uncle having a bit more faith in me. And yet, the one time I make a mistake and get a bit of a dent, all of a sudden, Iâ€™m the worst at it and no one has faith. 

I  tried going to med school and they wouldnâ€™t let me continue because of my â€œconditionâ€. I got judged even though I knew what I could do. I had the skills. People hate me. I have no income and we live in a dead town with no openings. Thereâ€™s nothing here. Social security keeps denying me. Iâ€™ve tried every depression and bipolar medication and none of them work. Iâ€™m constantly depressed and thereâ€™s no reason to continue. My friends abandoned me long ago and the one I have left keeps threatening me with a mental hospital every time I make a comment about my depression. She has no idea how bad it is.  The only thing that upsets me is hurting my girlfriend but even she doesnâ€™t like talking to me anymore. Even though I barely ever mention my depression. 

I know what you will say. Keep living, you will find something eventually. Not true. Iâ€™m never getting to my Girlfriend. She lives in South Carolina. I have no way to get there. But, in reality, itâ€™s not going to help. I really just want to do this. Why not? What could it hurt?  My parents keep telling me that Iâ€™m fine. To suck it up. That Iâ€™m not really depressed. They donâ€™t know that Iâ€™ve taken 13. Ambient and 7 lorazepam before. They donâ€™t know anything. They donâ€™t care about anything but their electronics. Tiger es no reason that I shouldnâ€™t do it.
