I'm killing myself on September 18th, even though I'm too scared to die.I feel like I'm just always too scared to kill myself. I've always wanted to die at my own hands, because I know that if I changed my mind partway through I'd be able to stop it. I'd be able to cut a rope, or call an ambulance, or puke up whatever I've taken. But if I jumped off a bridge or stepped in front of a car, there would be no changing my mind, or stopping myself from dying. And that's what scares me, the permanence of it, and even though I want to die so badly and I know death is forever, I just don't feel like I can. I want to die but I don't want to be dead. I'm just too terrified of a permanent bad decision, that I made while drunk and tired. And I think that's why I set a suicide date, it gives me time to change my mind. To plan out things in a way that I can save myself if things go pear shaped and I change my mind. I'm killing myself, but I'm too much of a coward to actually die. Does that make sense? Or do I sound stupid?
