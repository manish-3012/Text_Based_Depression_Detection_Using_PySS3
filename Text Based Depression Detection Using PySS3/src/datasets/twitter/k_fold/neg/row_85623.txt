Why canâ€™t Corona just kill me?The only thing that brings me peace is knowing that everyday is a day closer to death. I wish I could give someone my healthy body and trade with them. I am extremely lonely in life and less than 90 days out of the psych ward and nothing is better. I just really want to escape. I tried and failed and there isnt much more. I never thought at 24 that I could not only understand depression but watch it ruin every aspect of my life. I genuinely hate the person I am and the situations I am and I hate how I had to be born a faggot and exiled into loneliness for life. I just need to find a way to leave quietly and someone to take care of my dog without it being obvious what my plans are.
