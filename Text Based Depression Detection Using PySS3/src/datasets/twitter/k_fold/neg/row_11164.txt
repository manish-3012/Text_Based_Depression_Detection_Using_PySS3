I donâ€™t enjoy anything anymore.I basically live to please others, Iâ€™m just doing everything others expect of me. No matter how hard I try I canâ€™t find anything I genuinely enjoy doing, when I was a kid video games were it, I always got a magical feeling from them and I was really happy. Iâ€™m going to turn 18 in a month now and unfortunately I have grown out of/totally lost interest in video games. Iâ€™m basically slaving through college, but I have no plans for the future I donâ€™t really look forward to anything.  I have friends and spending time with them helps a lot, but I feel like I am putting a mask on while Iâ€™m around them, and when Iâ€™m alone I just fall apart. I donâ€™t think I could ever kill myself until my parents die but I would be so relieved if I got into a car accident or some random freak of nature killed me.
