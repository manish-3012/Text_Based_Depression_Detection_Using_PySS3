I can't get out of my own head anymore.I'm only 22 but I've dealing with anxiety and depression since middle school. I was finally diagnosed with sever depression and anxiety last summer but didn't start any medication until about a month ago. My Dr. has me on Celaxa(?) right now, but it isn't helping. The last week has been non-stop torment for me. I've lost all control over my own mind, my mind is static and self-hate. I've come too close to the edge in the past, but I always still had my mind. I don't anymore and I don't know how much more will I have.
