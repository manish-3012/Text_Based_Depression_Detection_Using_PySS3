Last year alive, what can I do?I turn 19 on the 28th. I've told myself for years that I would kill myself on my 20th birthday and that's what held me back from trying and kept me calm for the last few years. I also said I would try get better before that happens. I've been in therapy before and gave up cause it didnt do anything for me. Took multiple types and dosages of antidepressants and anti psychotics. Eaten much much healthier combining with more exercise. Changing habits etc.

  I'm much more than I was years ago and most people think of me as a very fortunate person in terms of wellbeing and attitude (not wealth). I've also tried to figure out if there was a source for me being so sad. I thought it was a disconnect from friends I used to talk to so much. So I got back into that group and spent a lot of time with them. But even if it felt good to be around people, I had a lingering feeling of dread and sadness the whole time. Now I'm just about at my last year alive and I dont think I have any more options. I'm back in therapy and medication but so far nothing good. I spend a lot of time thinking of things that could make me happy and try them out but nothing works. I feel excited to die. I dont really want to but I dont enjoy anything I try do, imagining what it is like to be dead gets me excited but also sad. What are my options now?
