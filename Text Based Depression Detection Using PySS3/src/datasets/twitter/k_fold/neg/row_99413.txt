I believe my gf will commit suicide if I leave, don't know how to go about thisSo heres some lovely backstory. 

Me and my gf have been dating a little over a year. About 6 months into our relationship my gf was getting very unstable, constantly anxious, stressed, depressed, and taking out on me hardcore. I wanted to leave however it came to light that she was one step away from wanting to die. I ended up telling her I wanted to break up and she went to a crisis center because she didnt feel comfortable alone (she has no close friends or family, shes in her 20's). I couldnt let her go alone so I went with her, she talked with the woman there who deemed she was a risk to herself, and then my gf had no choice but to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. 

This was rather horrible because for a day and half they didnt have a room for her, she was stuck in a bed in the hallway of the er, when she did get a room it wasnt long until they decided she needed to go into this program and stay in the psych ward for a week (all against her will) and this certainly wasnt helping her AT ALL. She ended up having to stay only one night in the psych ward and since has gotten a therapist and has worked alot on her issues however a year later I just find myself wanting to not be in the relationship. Its not for any dramatic reason I just dont feel happy anymore, I dont feel like we are two people who are compatible for life. Im starting to lose emotion and im afraid to broach it because I dont want her to be a threat to herself. 

Fast forward to last week, I went with her to a therapy session and everything kinda came out unintentially. I went on how i wasnt happy, didnt want a future with her, etc, etc, and after a long night she told me that it was ok, that she understands if im not happy. So I left. Shortly after I get a text saying "im sorry but I found my courage". Knowing this was a reference to suicide I rushed back to her place and feeling the intense pressure of having a life potentially end by my decision I told her that we can work on whatever. My mind at the time wanted to do anything to give her a chance at finding a will to leave before I left. So now its about a week later from that event and Im finding myself slipping. Shes insecure and anxious about everything I said,  rightfully so, and I dont have it in me to console her otherwise, because I want to leave, but her fear of suicide keeps me. 

Some backstory on her, shes actually a very well adjusted girl, has a great job, is personable and successful. She doesnt act "crazy" when feeling suicidal, she is very calm which is the scary part. She is a person that has suffered alot of tragedy in her life, she lost her mom young to a car accident, was left with a dead beat father who abandoned her and her sister to foster homes for a couple years, then returned to whisk them away to another country, and later in lfie when she found a parental figure in her grandmother whom from what I gather, she was closer to than most are with their actual parents, however her grandmother died suddenly from cancer. 

So now her depression comes from the knowledge that she is quite alone, and she cant help but hurt for the sadness thats happened to her. Its not that me leaving specifically would push her over the edge, but shes already at an edge and any obstacle of tradgedy or sadness (another death, a break up) she has told me she just doesnt have the stregnth for right now. She is content in the life shes lived, knows it is cowardly, and has the resolve to do it, though not the courage. 

I really dont know what to do. I know staying with her because I fear her potentially committing suicide is wrong... but I dont know how to justify the idea that leaving is ok when it might mean her undoing. How do I leave someone knowing that it may not be long until i recieve a goodbye text or just living with the fear that one night she may disapear? Not to mention we work together which adds another layer of complexity on it. 

I dont have any family of hers that I can call to watch after her, she is truely on her own, and I dont want to get the authorites involved because last time that did 0 to help,  and would ruin her job which would ruin her life. I really think that she has just been hit so many times in life shes having trouble mustering up the stregnth to take more and I dont know what to do. Any help or advice would be wonderfully appreciated. I dont know who to talk to or what to think about this
