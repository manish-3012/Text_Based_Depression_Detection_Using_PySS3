My mum's love makes me feel bad for planning to dieMy mum has been so nice today. She's brought me breakfast and morning tea in bed because I refused to get up and do anything, including going to school. 

I've been using my free time doing research of the stuff to consider when dying and I feel like shit doing it when my mum's been lovely :/ I wish I could die without hurting anyone
