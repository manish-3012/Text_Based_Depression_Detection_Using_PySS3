My Third Post Here - Probably My LastWell, this is it. I just can't I guess. I've posted here before and I was in a bad place both times. Once when I was just contemplating it, the second after I spat a whole bottle of painkillers out of my mouth. This time I'm worse than both of those combined. I've been suicidal for the past 5 days, with each day increasingly worse. I can't talk to anyone about this because I'm scared of going to the hospital again. The only person I feel comfortable enough to talk to about it is my girlfriend, and she's not responding. I don't know if it's because this is too much to handle or she's tired of my shit or what, but I told her what I plan on doing. I'm tired so I'm going to nap until everyone else in the house is asleep, and then I'm just going to slit my throat. I'm at the point where I don't really care about the pain or what will happen if I survive. I'm pretty sure I can do it too, I've already made a scratch with my fingernails marking the spot, I just have to work up the nerve to break the skin. I don't really know why I'm posting here because I made up my mind, I guess I just want at least someone to know what's about to happen to me. Goodbye, everyone. I'll check any replies to this after my nap and then after that I'll be gone.
