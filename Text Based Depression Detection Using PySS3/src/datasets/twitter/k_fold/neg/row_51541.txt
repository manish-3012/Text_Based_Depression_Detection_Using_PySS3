I don't want to be alive anymoreI had a normal upbringing. I was never abused, I never saw my family members during coitus, I never had problems until I had to join the workforce. I have "dumb kid" written on my forehead. I am known far and wide for being a shit head. My whole neighborhood thinks I'm slow witted. The few places I do go like work, people have the assumption that I am the scapegoat, the novel concept that someone is worse at life than they are. I just want to be treated like a person. I just want to live in anonymity until I mercifully pass away. I used to be bad into drugs. Every night I am terrified that someone from that drug circle is going to kick my door in and kill us. Every single night. I talk to my wife about it, but I don't want to be a burden to her anymore. I can't escape These problems, I can only be myself. I can't move to a different location, I can't afford it and even if I did, people would have a field day with me in the new location. I have constant drug hunger. I come home from work every day and watch drug porn like Drugs INC and Intervention. I can't take it anymore. I was smoking weed to dull my mind to not think about my situation but I don't want to do that anymore. I may need to go on antidepressants as a last resort in order to cope. I don't want to take SSRI's. I've been on them before and I don't like the side effects. I try and stay clean and even get exercise and still the depression latches onto me with a vengeance. I don't know what to do. If I had a handgun I would have been dead YEARS ago. Seriously, what do I do?
