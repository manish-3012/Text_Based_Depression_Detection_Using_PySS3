Waking up in the morning is getting harder and harder. I have no career, no place of my own and a job that takes a huge hit to my mental illness.I have to wake up early to go to work and every single day I dread being here because itâ€™s a dead end job and I deal with the stupidest customers every single day. I canâ€™t quit cause I need money. If I donâ€™t have money I canâ€™t move out or go to school. I donâ€™t even make enough to save. Iâ€™ve looked for other jobs but no one is hiring. My social life is a joke. I have no friends. No one to talk to. Sometimes I feel like killing myself would stop all these thoughts I have in my head. But then I think about my family and how they would react.
