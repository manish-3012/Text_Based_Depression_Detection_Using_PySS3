Message I want to send to my boyfriend but I cantI feel like such a horrible person. I donâ€™t want to meet your best friend because I am so scared of her and she makes me so anxious because I know shes better than me in a million ways. I feel like I will never be anything compared to her. I will never mean anything compared to her. I shouldnt feel like that because she is your best friend. 
I am a horrible person because I dont want to see my family the people who are supposed to love me the most but just being around them makes me incredibly anxious and sad. I hate it. I hate that I dont want to see them or be around them but I dont know how to change that. I dont know how to be better. I dont know what to do. I just want to die so I dont have to be a shitty person anymore. So that people, you, my family, can be happy, so that they can have normal lives that I am not constantly fucking up. Im such a horrible person. 


I just want to die.
