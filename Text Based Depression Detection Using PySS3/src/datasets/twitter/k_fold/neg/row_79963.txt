Someone please help meI'm a 48 divorced father with a 15 year old daughter who hates me. She thinks I broke up our family where it was her mother who cheated on me and took off. I tell her I love her and I only get silence in return.

My business is failing and the house I'm trying to save for her is about to go into foreclosure. I have no prospects for a future one my business goes under. The analog business I own is quickly being taken over by digital. I'm $50k in debt. I'm a complete failure and a borderline alcoholic. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just want it to end. I'm exhausted worrying about it all. I just want to die. I don't want to feel this anymore, the sadness and hopelessness. I fantasize about hanging myself here at work. The setup is perfect and no one in my family would find my body. The world would be better off without me. There is literally no reason for me to stick around. None.
