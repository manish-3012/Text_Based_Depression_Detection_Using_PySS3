I feel like I canâ€™t take care of myselfThis post is probably going to be very messy and unorganized but thatâ€™s okay I guess. First off Iâ€™m 22 going on 23 years old. I havenâ€™t gone to college or anything and I work in a group home. I also live with my mother because letâ€™s face it caregivers donâ€™t get paid very well. I would go to school but my spending habits and car payment prevent me from doing so. Iâ€™m on generic Abilify and generic Zoloft along with vitamin D3 and these have me feeling stable but also still a bit depressed in that I feel emotionally stable but I am unable to perform basic things like getting myself to shower is pretty hard sometimes and donâ€™t get me started on my room. I also donâ€™t brush my teeth. Iâ€™m just so gross and I feel like I canâ€™t take care of myself. Sometimes I wonder if I myself belong in a group home. Anyways I guess thatâ€™s it, any advice is appreciated. Thank you.
