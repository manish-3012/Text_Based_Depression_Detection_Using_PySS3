A pack of smokes, acetaminophen and funeral songsI just bought my last pack of smokes and a 100 tablet bottle of acetaminophen. I'm going to try and keep 25 pills down, then go for a second round. I don't care about the pain; I'm ready.

As I sit here contemplating, I'm thinking of songs I'd like to be played at my funeral. I work in funeral service, so of course I'm thinking about this. Not to mention the OD is going to happen at work today, because I'm alone.

Alter Bridge: Blackbird
Disturbed: The Infection
Pink Floyd: Wish You Were Here

Not necessarily I'm that order, but yeah.
