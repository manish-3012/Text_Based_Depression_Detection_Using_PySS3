Most people want to die because they don't want to live anymore, I want to die to die.The thing is, I'm not afraid to die, at all, no matter how painful it is. It's only because of how my ma and my one friend will react if I killed myself, that I am still alive today. 
I feel so selfish because of the good life I have. My family isn't rich, but I have everything I could ever need, and many wants as well. I feel so selfish because there are millions of suffering people out there that deserve the life I have.
I knock myself down every second of the day. Whenever I think about ending it, it always leads to me telling myself 'you are selfish' 'you should be grateful for this life' 'how dare you say you are suffering when you have everything you need.'
I don't mind living, living is okay I guess, but there is nothing for me here. The sun goes up and then it goes down and then it goes up again. Everything is heartbreaking and boring. I have some things that I enjoy, but it's never enough and that makes me sooo selfish, but it's how I feel.
I want to know, so badly, what happens after death. It eats me alive every day and haunts me in my dreams to the point where I feel insane. I believe whatever it is, it'll be worth it because atleast I have my answer. If it is just blank, then it won't matter, I'll be dead. 
I got panic disorder, so that shit sucks.
I got alotta anxiety which also sucks.
My ma had a really rough past and I know deep down if I killed myself or even just died, she would kill herself.
I do not, ever, want to be responsible for killing someone that isn't deserving of death.
Even I, sometimes think that I don't deserve death, that I deserve worse than death.
I'm not going to kill myself, not yet.
I guess I'm posting this because I've never talked to anyone about this before and I thought I would feel a little relief to admit it.
