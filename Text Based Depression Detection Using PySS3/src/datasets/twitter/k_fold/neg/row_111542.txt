I'm about to lose everythingI married my high school sweetheart 13 years ago.  I've never been with anyone else, I've never wanted to.  We had a baby right after high school, he kind of freaked out and left me for another girl. He was madly in love with her but for whatever reason things didn't work out between them. Two years later he found his way back to me and we were married.

We've had our problems and worked through them.  I thought we were doing okay until I found out he is back in touch with her and is trying to work on a relationship with her.  I'm devestated.  I don't know how to be anything but his wife.  I've been a stay at home mom and homemaker this entire time.  I don't know how to start my life over.  I don't want a life without him.  Over and over the only answer I come up with is suicide.
