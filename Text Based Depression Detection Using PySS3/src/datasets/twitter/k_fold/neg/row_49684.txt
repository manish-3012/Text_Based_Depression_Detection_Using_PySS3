My name is already carved on the bullet.7.62x39 will be the bullet that cures my defective brain. I've even carved my name into it. I wish I wasn't a failure. I wish I didn't eat my feelings and become a fatass.I wish I was not so awkward and weird. I wish my brain didn't hate me. I'm planning on using that bullet when I officially get kicked off my parents health insurance plan and can no longer get anti depressants. I am just building up the courage.

My parents deserved a better kid then me. I don't want to make them sad. But I hate everything. I hate people. I hate myself. I don't belong in this world. My last favor for my parents is to hopefully not affect their property value and to make it a quick cleanup. So I was either going to blow my brains out in the backyard  or possible put some tarps in my room. I don't want to make a mess.
