Convince me OtherwiseToday was the most stressful day of my life, and tomorrow is going to be worse. I have been severely depressed the last few months, and the result has led to me failing all of my classes in school. My parents don't know, but my mom is going to find out tomorrow. I can't handle this, on top of my addictions. I put a gun to my head tonight, and held it there for a few minutes. I couldn't pull the trigger. I am going to go to bed now, and I think that this will be my last night. When I wake up in 5 or 6 hours, I am going to make the choice. I feel like I have nothing to live for anymore, and it is just easier this way. I did counseling a few years back, but the counselor just told everything that was "between me and her" to my mom. I don't trust them anymore, and haven't been to one since. My friends have started to drift away from me, and I am slowly being excluded from more and more activities. I've been going day to day the last month, and I'm just ready to be done.
