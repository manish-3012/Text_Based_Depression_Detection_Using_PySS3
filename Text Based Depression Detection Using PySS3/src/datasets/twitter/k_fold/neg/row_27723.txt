want to kill myselfI hate my life and every day is hard. I dont think I can handle this much longer. I've always been suicidal but things just get worse. my only friends barely talk to me even though we used to talk all day. I send messages and just get ignored. we hang out sometimes and it's fine, but then as soon as i get home it's back to the same shit. i used to feel comfortable enough to talk about my mental health with them but now I would literally rather die than reach out and be rejected for the 1000th time. we all used to be so close and now i feel they dont care unless I'm entertaining them. I have an amazing girlfriend and she is what keeps me here but I am lonely. I'm just tired of always being everyone's last thought. I'm struggling so much every day and I cant even get a message back. I really just want to kill myself. I stay awake at night just thinking about how I could make all of this end if I just killed myself. im scared of next semester because of stress and the coronavirus. I hate myself and I hate my life and I hate my brain and I want to die. dont comment and tell me to reach out to my friends because I literally couldnt handle it again. I want everything to end.
