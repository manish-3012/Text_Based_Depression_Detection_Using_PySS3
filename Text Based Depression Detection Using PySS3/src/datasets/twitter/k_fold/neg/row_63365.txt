Suicidal ex refusing helpMy ex (m19) isn't over out break up and says he can't live without me, he was better for a few weeks and went to the gp and is on medication but hes got worse again and won't seek help, he's planning his suicide and idk what to do, the times I've called the police or ambulance he's turned them away and they've just left and he now drives in the middle of no where so I can't tell them where he is anymore. His other friends refuse to talk to him because he's been really horrible to them and his mother is very old fashioned and refused to acknowledge the situation despite him already making multiple attempts. Idk what to do at this point.
