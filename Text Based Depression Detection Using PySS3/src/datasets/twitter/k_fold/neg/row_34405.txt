I wish I could live inside of my dreamsThe other night I had a dream where I felt an overwhelming happiness all throughout my body. It was pure euphoria. I was looking at the world and everything around me was beautiful. I had no worries and I even had actual friends who cared about me. It was perfect and I wanted it to last forever.

Waking up was the worst feeling ever. I literally started crying. Everything in that dream was all fake and never happened. The happiest I've ever been wasn't real. The world isn't beautiful, I have no friends, and now I'm back to square one with these suicidal thoughts.

God I wish that dream was my reality. I just want to feel like that again at least one more time :(
