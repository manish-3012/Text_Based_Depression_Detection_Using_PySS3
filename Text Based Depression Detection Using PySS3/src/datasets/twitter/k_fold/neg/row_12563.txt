Hey, I'm broken guysThere are a lot of cool guys here on reddit and I like it.  I try to help everyone because I really like it :) But it seems the time has come for me to tell about my problems.  Yes, I am very young and it seems to me that there can be no problems in the opinion of parents and other adults.  Since I live in Ukraine, there is a completely different mentality than in Europe and the USA.  My mother is worried only about my studies and nothing more, she does not ask how I am doing and the like.  But when I get a bad mark then scandal, humiliation cannot be avoided.  I just don't know what to do, maybe you can tell me.  I simply don't have the courage to even fucking kill myself.  :)
