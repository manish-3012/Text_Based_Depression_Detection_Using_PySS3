I don't want anything out of life - and it's killing meI've got no job. I don't keep in contact with my friends anymore. I don't write. I don't do drugs. I'm on medication so I'm not even depressed with the same intensity I used to be.

I just feel like a blank space. Whenever I try to imagine the future I see nothing. I've got no goals. I've got no drive. 

I meant to kill myself years ago but didn't. So I just float. From book to book. I still speak to my family but if it wasn't for them I'd be trying again tonight for sure.

It's not even that I feel that strongly about committing suicide. I'm just tired, you know?

Whatever motor works in other people doesn't work in me.  Never has. And I don't see how that could ever change. It all just feels useless.
