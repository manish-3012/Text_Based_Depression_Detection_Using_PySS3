Not me but another user from across the worldIt all started with a post a user made and I got worried so I dm to see if everything was okay and she's going through a lot it seems. I keep in contact frequently at some points regularly. I'm from Canada and she's in Sweden and that's all I know about where she's at i know she has kids. I have been asking her questions along with the hard questions in attempt to make the topic of suicide and mental illness not a hard subject so she can talk freely. I would ask her about what things her kids did to make her laugh or smile this week. I talked her into seeking professional help. I hope that she's not just talking the walk. She talks about how everything is grey and that her kids are the only thing keeping her here. I dont want her to hurt herself in the sake of her and her kids. Any tips for possibly at risk people. I said text or call me any time if you need to talk at any moment. If not we would just reply to each other and if she didn't reply I would keep checking up. If you see someone comment something please check up on it. I care about her well being even though I dont know the first thing about her. What are some things I can do to help or make her comfortable to dive deep in what's affecting her safely without bringing too much out that she may do the undoable. I'm afraid she may cut me off if she sees this post but it's a risk I'm willing to take to help someone else who's going through pain.
