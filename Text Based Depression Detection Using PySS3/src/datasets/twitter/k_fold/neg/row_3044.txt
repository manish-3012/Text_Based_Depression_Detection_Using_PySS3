Got caught, now I'm ending it all.I should mention this has always been my plan should anything go wrong in my life. I've never cared much for it anyway.

I've been buying and flipping weed and MDMA in my local area. I've been secure as fuck with the processes. I only sold to 2-3 local people who sold to others around the state. So, I was essentially a wholesaler.

How did I get these drugs? The darknet. 

When I got home from work today, there were 2 police officers at my door. I was told that they had reason to believe that I was selling drugs from my house (which I wasn't. not one of my buyers knows where I live). Since I hide all of my paraphanalia off-site, I let them in. I had no choice, they had a warrant.  

So, they took my burner laptop. Usually, every time I shut it down, it wipes all memory from the computer and encrypts the whole OS on my flash drive. However, that's only if it has a password. I was just making a new flash drive, so I hadn't put a password, since I needed to frequently restart to configure.

TL;DR: I buy and sell about 20,000 worth of drugs from the darknet, and the police confiscated a laptop with non-refutable evidence against me.
