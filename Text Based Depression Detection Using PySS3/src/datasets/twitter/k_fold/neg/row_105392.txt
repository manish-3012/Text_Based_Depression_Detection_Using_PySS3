Autism-related disorder makes me want to die(Not sure if this is the right place to post.) I have a disorder related to autism, and as a result connecting with or relating to people on the same level as everyone else is basically impossible. Even saying hi to strangers passing on the sidewalk is terrifying; literally part of my diagnosis is that I "will always be excessively quiet and have very few friends." I can't not "let my diagnosis define me", as people like to say, when my behavior is predestined and incurable. Every day is filled with humiliation and isolation, and though I've tried for years to fight the coldness and loneliness and isolation that surrounds me, tried to fix or accept myself, this feeling of meaninglessness never leaves. I've had a history of depression since I was 12 and though it's been low-level for many years, I doubt it will ever go away by this point, given that I'm 20 now. The only real reason I don't kill myself is so I won't make my mom upset, given that she does so much for me already; I thought about crashing into an empty car as I was driving home and veered near it, not entirely seriously, but it would break her heart and cost the other person greatly. Similarly, swallowing a bottle of pills would traumatize the family. Being in a relationship temporarily made things feel worthwhile, but I'm not eager to start dating again, someone sticking with me as long as my ex did was really unusual. Literature, arts give me a small sense of meaning, but it's ephemeral and fleeting, a blink of passion and it's over. Nothing has made living this life truly worth it, nothing has given me lasting warmth.
