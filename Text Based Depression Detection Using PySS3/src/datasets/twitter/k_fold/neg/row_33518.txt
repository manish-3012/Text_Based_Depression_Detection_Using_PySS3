For the two people who cared.Looks like I can't die tonight. My boyfriend saw my post and he's staying up all night to make sure I don't kill myself. So I took a double dose of my headache painkillers to knock me out so I don't feel the pain of being alive anymore. It's probably selfish to want to die when I have a boyfriend who cares so much about me. That's part of the reason I want to die, he deserves better than me. 

Anyway thank you to the two people who commented on my previous post. It's nice to know some people care.
