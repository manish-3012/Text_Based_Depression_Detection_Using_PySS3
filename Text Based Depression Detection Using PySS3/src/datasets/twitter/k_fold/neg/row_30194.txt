I feel like it is time for me to go.I'm a failure. I'm the worst.
My pride and my ego is what's keeping me alive.
It feels like this is my fate. To die by my own hands.
Human life will not always be equal. So what's the point of saing others?
Of all the things and my future ideas that can harm someone. I will end it for the sake of my own world.
Why do I feel like I'm worthless to live as a human.
Being ordinary and simple is what I hate the most.
I'm a pathetic with no purpose in life.
I only had evil thoughts with no acts.
If only such things exist maybe I can give it a little effort.

I'll be reborn in a new world after this.
