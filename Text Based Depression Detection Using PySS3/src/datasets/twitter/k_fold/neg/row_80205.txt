I lost the best I'll ever get.So I'm ugly af. And somehow, I ended up with a guy who was super freaking hot. To me he was anyway. I had eyes for no one else when I was with him. He wasn't just attractive though. He had a manliness to him. But at the same time he was sensitive. Most of all, he was super good with people. I was so proud to tell people he was mine. He would be goofy with strangers, and he was a lot of fun. I was so in love with him. It's been three months and I'm still so broken up over him. No, he wasn't perfect. Yes, he was flawed, but I saw those flaws when I was with him, and loved him in spite of those flaws. He made me happier than anyone ever has before. God, I just want him back. Now he's in the arms of some other girl. And he loves her and wants to marry her. He used to tell me those things. I just want to die. 

Yeah, I'm shallow af. Because I'm scrolling through bumble. And I don't match with any of the guys I find attractive. The guys I do match with are meh. But that's what I can get. I know. I sound so superficial and shallow right now. I sound like a horrible person because I care about looks so much. But I don't want to feel like I'm downgrading. These guys aren't as attractive as my ex. Obviously looks aren't the only thing. Then he'd have to have the personality that meshes with mine. I want to feel that click again. If the guy I end up with isn't better then my ex, then I'm always going to compare them. I'm always going to think of what I lost. God I want him back so badly. I miss him. I loved him. I would have done anything to keep him. I just want to die.

But it's apparent, that I'm too ugly for what I had. And I lost what I had. Fuck. 

Yeah, maybe there's more to life. But I was happier than I've ever been when I was with him.
