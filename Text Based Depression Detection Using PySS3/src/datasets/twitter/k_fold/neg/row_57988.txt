in my dreams nowfor a little over a year now iâ€™ve been daydreaming about jumping off a bridge/drowning myself. it makes me feel better knowing i always have the option. last night i had a dream i nearly tried to drown myself. when i woke up i was sad because it wasnâ€™t real. i donâ€™t really understand it, i guess i just want the pain. this world sucks
