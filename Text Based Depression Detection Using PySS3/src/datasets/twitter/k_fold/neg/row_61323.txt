Just need someone to messageThis ain't going to be long. I'm just looking for someone to talk to. The suicide prevention lifeline for my region has a massive wait list. Like, I'm number 57 in line. Idk what else to do. Any other online resources would be appreciated. I can't help but apologizing for being such a bother. Condolences and I hope everyone's having happy week.
