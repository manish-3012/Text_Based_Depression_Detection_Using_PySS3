Why am I inferior?I'm tired of feeling down.

I've always had a problem with envy, I envy people, I envy everyone.

All I can see is people having way better lives than me. I never get the admiration I crave.

I never get the feeling of being important for anyone, no way.

Why don't I get respected? I even try and be as best I can so I can receive some admiration.

Why do I help people that come into my life with positive advice, but I never get that in return?

Why do I uplift others, while they let me drown in my own agony?

Why don't I have dignity and say "NO MORE!"?

Why am I so weak that I have to serve others at the cost of my own well being?

Why don't I feel any reason to have a self esteem, why am I unworthy of love, respect and admiration?

When will this all end?....
