Thinking out loudWhat if this is all there is?  It seems stupid to continue living if it doesn't matter anyway.  Just death one way or another.  Work and university, why does it matter?  It just feels like life is worthless if it's spent paying off debt.  Can't even decide what I want to do with my life, I don't feel anything.  Maybe I could take a few days off of work but then I won't get payed, I won't have money for my car, for my school loans etc, maybe I could take off of school, but then I risk losing scholarships and losing my family's respect.  I think I'm just selfish.
