In a bad place right now.I don't know if anyone cares or not. I just need to get this all out I guess and I don't want to burden it with anyone I know. I'm in college and 5 hours away from my family and my boyfriend and it kills me almost every day. I have an eating disorder and I'm going downhill pretty fast it seems. If anyone can take the cliff metaphor seriously, I'm hanging on by a finger and I just want to take the plunge. I've probably lost 5 lbs this week, and I don't even know for sure because this place doesn't even have a scale. I weigh probably less then 110 right now and just want to dissappear into nothing. I cut for the first time tonight in a very long time, and I haven't eaten anything that has stayed down in almost a week. I'm tired, I don't care about school, and I feel like no one will understand. I need help, but I'd rather just give up.
