c'est la viesuch is my pathetic life. it's on the road, it's in my head. i thought running away would help, become a new person, but it turns out that's harder than it sounds. apparently the stench of pathetic doesn't wash off easy. i tell myself, "smile more, appear happy, tell yourself that you're happy, and you will be happy". what a crock of shit. i've had a support network, but it's dissolved around me. how can i receive support from people who don't trust me? it's obvious and has been this whole time, that they've all been talking about me, as if im just some intellectually inept emotional basket case, ready to blow his lid at any moment. my little brothers never pick up when i call. they never answer me on facebook. 

my mom just died, and i have no one to tell it to. that's a lie, but i no longer know if the person, the only person who i thought i can talk to, wants or even can talk to me. i feel like im slowly sucking her soul out with my problems, and now this? its been plainly obvious that shes tired of listening to my shit, day after day, and i don't blame her. shes been there for me for months, sometimes people need a break. but ive also got the feeling that she doesn't trust me at all. no one trusts me. i just want to reach out to someone, share things with them, and have them share things with me. ive been talking to her for months, and i know almost nothing about her. literally nothing. and its not her fault. im not blaming her, im blaming me, for falling in love with someone i don't even know. how did it happen, when i don't even know her? how can you fall in love with someone you know nothing about? and i can't tell her these things, i don't want to put this on her, i mean how do you tell someone that you can't stop thinking about them, that you dream about them at night, that you can't get them out of your mind? that was my biggest mistake, telling her that i dreamed she disappeared, and i couldn't find her. that's when she started to avoid me. or maybe the avoiding is in my head. i don't think it is though. 

my ex wife won't let me talk to my son, and hes all the way across the country. i miss my mom, i miss my brothers, i miss my son, i miss the only person who listens to my problems. i knew that eventually she would tire of my shit, because eventually every one does. everyone leaves me, it's only a matter of time. i can't stop crying.



im supposed to start school soon. ha! i'm an idiot masquerading as an intelligent person. "cognitive neuroscience". beyond the simple fact that im a fucking simpleton, i have ptsd, and i panic even just crossing the road. i went to this parade on the first. there were so many people, i couldn't even breath. it was my first time out of the house. but im pretending like i wasn't phased. i stood there dying inside my own head, hands shaking, trying to enjoy the music, enjoy the floats, but i felt like i was about to be killed. all the loud drums sounded like incoming missiles exploding. people kept whistling and it sounded like ordnance dropping out of the sky. this beautiful woman was standing next to me, i wanted to say hi, but i couldn't even talk. when was the last time i talked to someone face to face? months ago. and a beautiful woman? years. i make it sound like im so old, im really not. im only 23. i tried walking home, but im so fat i nearly had a heart attack. it was 4 miles, all up hill, and i didn't take any breaks, so when i got to the top, i felt so good, but it only lasted a little. after, i had so much emotion in me. i can't stop crying, ive been crying since new years eve. 

oh yeah, my support network. ha! it's reddit! people on reddit! people who obviously have zero trust for me. who knows why. it's sort of this in group kind of thing, its very cliquish, and i haven't "made the cut" as it were, even though ive been one of them for like a year. i mean, where else does an agoraphobic ptsd depressed fuckwit go for his support? there isn't many options. ive tried everything i could to get them to trust me. nothing has worked. i mean, they talk to me, they pretend to accept me, but i know the truth. the whole truth is they think im a spy. ha! who knew reddit could be so serious? it makes me feel even more pathetic than i already do.

ive been sober for months. i thought it might help, because before, when i was homeless and without money, drinking felt good, it drowned my sorrows, but it also took away my inhibitions. i haven't told anyone this, because i don't anyone who trusts me, but i tried killing myself a few times in 2012. i never really went through with it, just got myself close to the edge. deep down i don't really want to die, i never have, i just want the pain to go away. i love life. life is so beautiful, but so painful. the first time was in feb last year. i tried cutting myself on my leg, near the artery. i bleed till i felt weak, but then i chickened out and put a tourniquet on. i was drunk then too. i told the people at work that i was just sick, and i ran my leg into some metal. i was pretty clever, i even cut a hole in my uniform. ha, its good i got out of the army to be honest. they treated me like shit too. i was just as depressed then, and they all knew it. they just didn't care. shit, i think some wanted me to kill myself, even encouraged it. never told anyone that either. it's a good thing im not as weak willed as i think i am, or i would probably be dead.  second time was with my belt. i suffocated myself a few times, never like in a sexual way, just to get myself as close to dead as possible. scary shit. i got close once, blacked out just as i loosened it. actually, they always wanted me dead. i was in a line troop, about 3 years ago, before my ex wife took my son away, before she left me when i deployed, and the 1sgt there told me he was going to kill me, or that i should kill myself. good times. anyways, so alcohol drowns everything out, but makes me attempt suicide. so yep no alcohol .


my ex posted on christmas that im just a sperm donor. i didn't have money to send to her or my son, so she calls me nothing but a sperm donor. so i responded in full view of the world "you're right, I have been a terrible father. I let my pride at not being able to buy him a present get in my way of skyping with him. That was selfish of me. Moving across the country was selfish of me. I know it doesn't mean much, I am sorry. I know it just sounds like excuses, I did need a change, and I needed it bad. You're a better mother to him than I have ever been a father." she didn't believe it, neither does any of her friends. you know the worst part of all this? she tricked me into the army. i didn't want to join, i seriously didn't. and two years in she leaves me for some piece of shit miles away. then i deploy. i was actually going to kill myself in iraq, like, get shot on patrol, die a hero, or get blown up in my room. too bad the stupid iraqis were too stupid to actually hit anything with their rockets. that would have been a nice way to go. i got back from iraq, that was one of the worse days of my life. you have no idea what it's like to come back from hell, to a huge party filled with couples reuniting, dads with sons, mothers with daughters, wives to husbands. i was crying, no one noticed, they were all too wrapped up in each other. i was literally balling tears. 


anyways, i live in a wonderful place now. the rent is paid, im not homeless, i have food, but now i can't sleep. can't sleep at all. i goes day, 3-4 days with an hour a night. i slept two last night, only because ive only slept about 5 this week, and well yeah. im pretty sure everything ive posted about the one person who has been there for me is just paranoia and delusion brought on by my lack of sleep. i do love her. its strange loving someone you've never met. but now my mom died. i didn't even get to say good bye. i hadn't called her in years. part of me wanted to, but i felt so bad, because i feel like i abandoned her and my dad. they were both homeless, and i had money from the army. i could have sent them some, but i didn't. what a piece of shit son i am. and now i can't tell her im sorry. i can't tell her i love her and i miss her. death is so final. this is part of the reason i haven't killed myself, because maybe there is one person out there wishing to talk to me, that misses me, and just hasn't called me or picked up the phone. maybe people do love me and they are too afraid to show it. or maybe im too blind to see it. 

anyways, i wish i had some alcohol. maybe a friend to talk to. maybe someone to hold at night.
