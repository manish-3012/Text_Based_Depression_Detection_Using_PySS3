4 antidepressants over 2 years. Why bother anymore, it's clear nothing will work.Zoloft, you were okay, I guess. Until you decided that I wanted to have a nervous breakdown and get suicidal, scare my loved ones and get a psych evaluation in hospital. Thanks but no. 

Lexapro, yeah, you were alright, but I hated the lack of sleep, and you killed my libido. I didn't like that. 

Prozac, you were the best of the three. But it's clear I need something a bit more if I'm still having anxiety meltdowns in public.

At least, that's what the doctor thinks, anyway. Now I need to change to yet another one, Effexor. 

I'm sitting here thinking... what's the point? None of these have made me truly happy. None of these have really fixed anything. They haven't kept the depression away and they've done nothing for anxiety. 

Why bother trying anymore? I'll never get better. It'll never go away. These meds will only eventually make me worse. I don't see the point.
