Rock bottomThis is the short version of whats going on. Ive always been unhappy, when I was 14 I attempted suicide but rather than recieving any help I got told to stop being a drama queen and copying what I saw on TV (by both my doctor and my mother). Now Im 22 and at breaking point. Everything is going down the drain, I have no friends, Im overweight (from comfort eating) and Im working at a dead end job earning 400 a month and being bullied daily. Theres much shit going on in my life and I dont know where to start. Its overwhelming. Ive being seriously considering suicide and trawling websites for ways to do it. Ive being trying to think of reasons not too but Im running out. This is my last hope I honestly cant take this.
