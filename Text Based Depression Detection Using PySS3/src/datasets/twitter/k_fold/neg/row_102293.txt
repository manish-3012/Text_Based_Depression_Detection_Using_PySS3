I just want to tell someoneI just want to tell someone that I'm going to kill myself. I dont even know if I'm really going to do it. I feel incredibly trapped. Hopeless. I'm spiraling. 

I'm supposed to believe in something but I can't. I've done everything I've been told - mental health hospital, meds, therapy, trying to reach out to friends. I can't anymore. 

I don't know what to do. 
I don't know if I want to do anything. 
What kind of fucked up person doesn't want to feel better? What kind of fucked up person gets to a point where it's not even worth trying anymore? 

Me, I guess. 

I'm at the bottom of a deep, dark well. 
Bleeding internally. 
I'm going to kill myself.
