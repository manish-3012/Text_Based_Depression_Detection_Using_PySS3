â€œPlease let me go quietly.â€...is what I want to write in a note laid next to me. Thereâ€™s so much in life to appreciate and thereâ€™s so much joy that can come from it. No one is 100% good but no one is 100% bad either. Relationships will be imperfect. And thatâ€™s okay.

Lately I feel worthless. People say to be yourself but when I am, Iâ€™m labeled as too aggressive, too serious, too much of a perfectionist... I do try to be a kind person, but when I heard that I have those qualities without even trying... And then when I actively try not to be, it seems too late to repair those relationships. I know relationships are two-ways. It was a close friend who I suspect uses me sometimes to do better in school and who has ditched me multiple times for her boyfriend. And a fiancÃ© who I cannot discuss topics that are important to me with him because if I go into details or get too excited to exchange differing points, he thinks Iâ€™m trying to argue.

It just seems best for me to hold back. I feel like Iâ€™m being labeled by those close to me with qualities that Iâ€™m not deliberately exhibiting and then abandoned even when I express Iâ€™m trying to change by being more self-conscious when Iâ€™m around them. It just all built up and hit home. This all may sound like â€œHow can those people be that way?â€ but maybe this is just the negative light Iâ€™m seeing. You know, their side of the story is probably completely different. Iâ€™m 98% sure the problem is me.

There are still a lot of other close people who seem perfectly fine with interacting happily with me. Iâ€™m glad I donâ€™t make them uncomfortable, but incidents like this makes me feel like itâ€™s only a matter of time. My true self must not be socially compatible. 

I rationally know upsetting times like this will pass, but my emotional side is increasingly growing stronger as I feel less and less self-worth. Please help. How do I still hold on?
