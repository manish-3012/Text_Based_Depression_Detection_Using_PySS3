why is thatWhy is it that when I'm drunk I get to experience feelings I normally never feel. I haven't cried in so long, and now that I'm drunk I get to cry and feel so incredibly enlighten. Alcohol really does bring the best out of me, I mean normally I'm an emotionless husk knowing nothing but apathy. everything is spinning around as you would stereotypically describe being intoxicated.

i'm only 20, please tell me why I have no friends, why I have no education, why I have no job. What did i do wrong, I only wish the best for others, so why is it that I'm always alone, why does no one love nme .
