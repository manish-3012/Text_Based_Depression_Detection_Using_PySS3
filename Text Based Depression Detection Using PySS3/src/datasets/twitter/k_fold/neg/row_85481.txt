Do you ever wish you could just start overI know that maybe harming yourself after you fully think about it isnt the best decision it's awful and of course life changing for yourself but everyone else on this planet including me you leave behind but what is the real reason is it because we want to start all over in a sense by ending it? Is there just a thing inside us that wishes to hit the reset button... if only we could CHANGE the things we hated about ourselves. What if we could go back and do things differently or would we make the same mistakes or worse? I can say I wish for more and I have lived quite a life but man these days are hard and it seems they only get harder, since I was a kid I was no stranger to pain but as the days increase does this shitty feeling have to with it?
