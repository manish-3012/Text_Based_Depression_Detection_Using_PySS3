Iâ€™m just a fuck up. Iâ€™m done.Ok this is long and Iâ€™m ranting but plz hear me out.....
I just turned 18 and Iâ€™m supposed to be graduating soon this weekend actually but Iâ€™m not. I got addicted to multiple drugs in 10th grade and just this year I tried to put the puzzle pieces back together. Iâ€™ve been trying hard for months being sober and doing the whole school thing. I went from being a cheerleader to almost dropping out. Iâ€™m fucking shit. I canâ€™t do anything right. Iâ€™ve been doing online classes and a full schedule at school. Iâ€™m so stressed everyday I feel like Iâ€™m constantly on an anxiety high. Im depressed and have anxiety (not diagnosed but I sure as fuck do). My lifeâ€™s been hell trying to fit in at a place where I literally feel like an alien. Begging teachers to pass me and having mental breakdowns weekly from stress.  My dad is the main reason Iâ€™m even still in school I canâ€™t disappoint him or heâ€™ll just hold this over me for the rest of my life. He doesnâ€™t believe in mental illness or atleast that I have anxiety and depression when heâ€™s watched me mentally decline throughout highschool. Iâ€™ve talked to people but it doesnâ€™t help. I just want to become an addict again, everything was so simple and atleast I was good at that. Iâ€™m good at being bad, idk why I thought I could do different this time. I could do summer school but me and my bestfriend are planning on killing ourselves before then. Iâ€™m thinking a hot shot to the neck will do it. Iâ€™m just tired I literally canâ€™t feel anything but sadness and anxiety. I hate myself for ruining my own life. Idek who I am anymore I feel like a robot forcing myself to socially interact and forcing myself to give a fuvk. If it was up to me Iâ€™d have dropped out and would have probably been dead by now. I should have just told my dad to fuck himself and gone that way. Now Iâ€™m here even more depressed because I couldnâ€™t make it and have so little friends from focusing on work and Iâ€™m sober as f u c k. Iâ€™m not me, this isnâ€™t me. I just want to die thatâ€™s the gist of this shit.
