28 days till I depart28 days to get everything in order, so I can give everything that I have left to a few people. This shouldn't take that much time to do. I also will need to give notice at work. I don't want my problems to mess with any one else's plans, or financial situations. I have been suicidal for the majority of my life. The only thing that stopped me until now is one question, when do you call it quits? At what point can I say that I have tried everything to stop this feeling? I have tried multiple therapists, psychologists, psychiatrists, drugs, lifestyles, and nothing has worked. So, I think I can say that I have nothing left to try.
