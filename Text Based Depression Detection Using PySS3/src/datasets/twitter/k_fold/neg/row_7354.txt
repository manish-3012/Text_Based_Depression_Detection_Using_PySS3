I feel dangerous when I'm left alone with my thoughts.Does anyone else feel this way?

When I'm in lectures or doing work or around people, the thoughts just enter some sort of back room in my brain. They don't leave nor fade, they just don't show themselves for a while.

The only thing that brings me genuine joy and excitement is learning new languages and I've been using that as a distraction. It works 99% of the time. And I'm super proud of my progress so far! 

But today just feels like that 1%...I never reached out to anyone about my depression and suicidal thoughts except for one friend. I vented for a while and he gave the normal responses like "I don't want to see you go" or "I'm going to be sad" or "I'm uncomfortable with the thought of you killing yourself"... I told him straight out that his reply was flat and sounded like a broken record. We said goodnight to each other after I was done venting. He wished me the best. 

He never checked up on me again.

I don't blame him however. I wouldn't want to deal with me neither.

I have a date set out but I'm still unsure if I'm going to go through with my suicide. I feel so scared sometimes when I think about it, although it does give me a slight sense of comfort when I think about death.  I'm just scared of the pain, is that weird? I've had that question popped up each time I think of suicide.

I'm just writing this post to let it out. I'm not necessarily looking for any help but they're always welcome and appreciated. Perhaps others who visit this post has similiar experience and can share with others? 

Thank you for reading :)
