Shrugs.I have no family even though i have 3 sisters and a mom. I have no friends even though i know and hang out with people. I dont feel love even though i love my gf. Everyday i wake up and its a battle to even take my first breath. Its a battle to not just sit there and cry. I can never make my mom talk to me or even try caring for anything. I help her all the time but still nothing. My gf can never be happy and all we do is just fight lately. Getting closer and closer to breaking up. Work is getting shittier and school is just that. I try smiling and being happy while making people laugh while i make a fool of myself. Why should they feel as i feel? All i know is i can not fight for much longer. Im dying faster and faster with each passing second. At least my gf could be happier without me and my mom will get her wish. I should just end it all. But i cant. I am afraid of being left in the dark. But im more afraid of living in pain. I have been living my life on repeat and i have become insane. Never finding a correct way of surviving a day without these thoughts. Im just venting since no one lets me. Hopefully i can still fight but i feel like its coming to an end.
