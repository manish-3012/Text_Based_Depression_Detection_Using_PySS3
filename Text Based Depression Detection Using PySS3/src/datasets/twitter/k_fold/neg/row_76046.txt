My best friend had a psychotic break this past weekend.I was with her when it happened. It was after we spent almost 12 hours straight talking about a variety of topics including sharing our deepest darkest secrets with each other. I don't think she was able to handle the amount of emotion that we evoked from each other and the intensity of the conversation. She became increasingly delirious and then got aggressive and pinned me against the bathroom wall where I had retreated to after she started to assault me. Our relationship will never be the same even if she recovers. She's in the hospital right now and it's due to the conversations we had, I'm pretty sure. The amount of guilt I feel right now is overwhelming. So much pain. I've been searching for someone like her for such a long time and now that I finally found her, she's torn away from me because of how I fucked things up. I've had 4 other relationships in the past year and I've fucked all those up in one way or another as well. I have been thinking of killing myself for quite sometime, two years or so off and on. Living just doesn't seem worth it, especially now, the pain isn't worth dealing with for the little pleasure that I feel sometimes.

I just want to be happy.
