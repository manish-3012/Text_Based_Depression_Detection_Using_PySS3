honestly wish i was never bornif i had to describe my life in one word it would be waste, one giant, GIANT waste. so much love, affection, care, money and kind words and gestures have been wasted on me over the years by friends, family, whoever. thats what depresses me the most and the fact that ive struggled for so long in hopes of some miracle change happening is just gonna make it so much harder for them once i finally kill myself, which is gonna be real soon. its honestly unbelievable how much care ive been given and how ill have managed to achieve less than nothing.
