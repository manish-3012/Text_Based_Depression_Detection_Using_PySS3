A close family member killed herself last night. I'm in utter shock I just don't understand. How do I deal with this?What is really bothering me is there was no warning, no reason to think she would ever do this it just doesn't make any sense to me. She was perfectly fine. Sorry if this is the wrong place but I just don't know how to deal. I'm in shock.
