i cannot take this anymoreim just sorry but i dont want to â€œhang in thereâ€ anymore. i dont care that people love and care about me. im just done. i hate living. there is so much pain i feel like will last forever. i havent felt right in so long. this darkness will never fade and im just ready to go. its better to not be here anymore everyone will be better off
