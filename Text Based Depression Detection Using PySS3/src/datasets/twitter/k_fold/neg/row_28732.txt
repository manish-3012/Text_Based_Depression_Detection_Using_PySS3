Experience with inpatient therapy for people who react badly to medication?My wife has been chronically depressed/suicidal for the entire time I have known her.  I've prevented a lot of attempts, we've been to a lot of professionals and she has had a few medications. One gave her inorgasmia that hasn't gone away, one gave her insomnia that has only subsides a little, and one made her rageful while she was on it and she has had anger problems since.

She also has very bad breakdowns when she is confined. She'll smash her head on walls and the floor, gouge into her neck with her fingers, try to get her hands on sharp objects.

So I've tried to pin and eliminate every trigger I can for her... But it just isn't working. She was molested, heavily abused, and otherwise entirely neglected growing up. She was malnutritioned and I still have a hard time getting her to eat nutritious food. She has several back injuries and severe bunions. She gets cysts all over when she eats much salt, any processed sugar at all, much oils... Tomatoes. She has bad tinitus. She has pcos... 

So basically she is a walking medical nightmare and I don't trust professionals with her for a second because they have fucked up far more than they've helped, but at this point she had lost all hope and I'm ready to try just about anything, but not really because I think that if she isn't kept under in inpatient care she will find a way to kill herself or she will be imprisoned there. I'm also concerned that her medical needs won't be met.

A huge problem I have is that there is a precedent for pushing medication without consent, there is a precedent for medical imprisonment, and there is a precedent for people not getting the care they need. She has a LOT of care she needs.

Does anyone here have experience in mental institutions as it concerns such an extreme case? From what I've heard its really hit or miss, and i have no idea how to make sure its a hit...
