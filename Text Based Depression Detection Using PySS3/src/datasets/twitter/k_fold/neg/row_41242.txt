Suicide seems like a good idea now and again, but then I remember that it's not.I worry sometimes that I'll wake up one day and forget why it's a bad idea. What exactly is wrong with it. Why it isn't something I want to do. It's hard sometimes. I use to think that if I put in the work and dealt with my issues the this was the sort of thing that would eventually go away. But it doesn't seems to. It seems to just flutter around my mind like a butterfly.

It's possible this is all being induced by a deficiency, but I wont know for a couple of weeks when I get a blood test. It's come on like a deficiency... It's hard to keep a healthy sense of time though. Recently I feel like my mind is about to cave in on it's self, and that full blown paranoia is lurking just outside my field of view.

So I try to focus on other things, but I swear to god it's like something is gnawing on my mind and my will and taking little chunks out now and again. I'm just really tired.
