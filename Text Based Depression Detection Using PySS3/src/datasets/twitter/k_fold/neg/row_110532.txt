She told me she'd look after my dog once I'm gone (22F) My best friend and I went on a walk yesterday and I told her about my suicidal plan.
We sort of talked about the way I was gonna do it (She's the only one that knows I'm gonna kill myself),  and I told her that the only reason I wake up everyday is because of my dog, Milan. My parents told me that if I kill myself, they'd put him up for adoption. I don't want that for him. I wanna see him grow old, but know I won't be able to do so.
He means everything to me. A couple seconds passed, and she said "Don't worry. If you ever kill yourself, I'll look after your dog"
Now I feel a lot better. The day I finally take that step, I'm gonna leave her and my family a letter. I hope she takes care of him when I'm gone.
