I just want to disappearI hate this shithole town I live in, I hate that's it's essentially a place with no future and no prospects, this place is nothing but a rusted over clock that doesn't move. People here are born and then they die. All they do is try to find some way to combat this fact (usually alcohol and drugs). Fun fact Sheena Easton comes from this town if you know her.

I hate my family too. They're failures. None of them ever had a chance in life so they never made it anywhere in life. They just accepted this fate, married and had kids and just settled into a miserable existence, a house with paper thin walls filled with "happiness and love". Bullshit. Their fate is tied into this town because they were all born here, moved away and some came back while the rest want to come back. I am nothing like my family, I'm not a happy person, I don't want happiness or love or a family, I don't go out and get drunk and party every weekend trying to act like my life is worth living. Since I'm nothing like them I can escape them and this town, doing so I can prove they truly are failures and by being the outcast and the black sheep I can break away and escape.

And then once I've done that I can kill myself. Once I'm alone, I've escaped. That's all I need to do.

My feelings could be summarised by this song - https://youtu.be/fWC70m6Gh68

I want to be Half the World Away so I can die. I want to be Half the World Away so I can be free. Free to end my life. Free to escape. 

Ironically I talk about being free a lot and there's this song - https://youtu.be/bX81qzmkzq0

Both of which featured on the same single. Like a story being told huh?
