Just my thoughts and reaching out for adviceSo its been a year since my ex and I broke up and he got married but I feel really shitty because I destroyed a box full of our memories and a necklace he gave to me when we were 4 months in. I wish I hadn't because its all I had to remember him by. I feel like shit. It was a 5 year relationship. It didn't end on good terms and I know It was a huge mistake on my part. As is everything else in my life. I want to undo it I really love him. All the memories are destroyed though I did that when I was drunk one night I shouldn't have. Any advice on how to get him back? I know it was a huge mistake to let him go. I'm honestly not even sure why I did let him go. No one will ever love me like he did. I cant live with this regret for the rest of my life.
