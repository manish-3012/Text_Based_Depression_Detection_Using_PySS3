I am so sad, stressed, lonely, and suicidal every single day.I used to be so happy. And now? Now I'm a mess. I'm a mess for so many reasons. I'd love a friend right now. I've been depressed for so long, I feel nothing. I have zero energy. I know this is just text on a screen to you but I am a very real person writing this and I really need somebody.
