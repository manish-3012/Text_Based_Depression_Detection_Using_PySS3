Video games make me suicidal but i can't stop playing them.You get those rare times where you play with friends and it's great fun and you can't wait to do it again, and i think it's for those moments that i keep coming back to video games for, but the far majority of the time they leave me so angry and riled up i have this pit in my stomach that only goes away with either self-harm or structural damage like throwing something across the room. I really don't see myself quitting playing video games because it's about the only thing i find myself doing when i'm not either at work or with friends, hell it's something i've been doing practically my whole life. Some ideas or help with moderating my gaming habits or stop myself from genuinely wanting to self-harm after a session would be seriously appreciated. You may say to yourself 'moderating gaming is easy! just go outside every once in a while', and while this is probably true for most people, for me it just sort of draws me back in, like my mind is constantly thinking about it whenever i'm not doing it. I don't know, man... I recognize it's an addiction but i don't know how to stop, and I feel like if i don't do something about it someday it might just become too much for me to handle. Thanks for reading.
