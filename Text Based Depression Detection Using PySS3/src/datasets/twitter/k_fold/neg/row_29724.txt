I Don't Want to Do This AgainI've been battling (read: get kicked around) depression for approaching half my life, but it feels like the whole thing.

Somewhat recently I came out as transgender and began transitioning, and for the first time in so long I actually wanted a future. I wanted to live and be a person. 

But Dysphoria just won't stop. I have so, so many procedures if I want to look even somewhat passable as a woman, and they hurt so much. I'm disgusted seeing myself, genuine disgust. 

I don't want to feel jealous of people who transitioned better. I don't want to feel disgusted that I feel that way. 

This time I don't want to fight my way back to being ok.

So I broke the cardinal rule and I started planning. I know what I want to do now, I just need an exact place.

I could wait, more than a month at least, to change my name, so at least it's my proper name when I die. But it feels like a waste of their effort. And so long to wait.

I'll miss them. I'll miss my friend across from me. I'll miss their jokes. But I'll leave them soon anyway, when my contract ends and I'm flown out. So I'm losing them anyway.

It seems so far away, but I think I could do it anywhere

I can't keep doing this. I'm choosing not to.
