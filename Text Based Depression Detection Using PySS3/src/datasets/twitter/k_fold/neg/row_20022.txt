blah. venting.In the city I dreamed of studying in, but I'm exhausted.

I failed the university preparation course, but got let in anyway because I'm 20. I'm on academic risk, so I'm only doing class on Wednesday &amp; Friday. Even more, it is a creative media production degree. No idea if it'll be worth it or I'm just giving myself a debt and shooting myself in the foot.

During that course, my only friends were online. It was in a group where you can post anything you want, and every month there is a vote on who to kick. I felt like this made people kicked based on unpopular opinion, so I made a blog where anyone can post anything anonymously. It was just full of insults, and they voted me out. Ironically, it was just the same content they post about other people but instead at their expense now because it is anonymous. 

Now I keep being targeted online and posts about me blasted to this group. It keeps stressing on my mind much more than it should. This is high-school level shit among manchildren who were never cool in high school, so everyone plays the popularity game online now.

But I'm in a new city, new course, new life. I need to try focus on the present.

Feeling kinda useless. Like my life is going nowhere. I need this bullying facebook group dealt with.

I'm trying to get a long facebook report in, but if that doesn't work I might get another person who has been targeted to contact the police. My country has laws around it and this shit has to stop.

I've just always been depressed. Even with these gone, I'll probably still be depressed but these 2 situations have been stressing on my mind, particularly the facebook thing.
