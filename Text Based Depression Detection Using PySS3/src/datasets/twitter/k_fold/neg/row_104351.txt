Please help, I am so scared.Hi guys.

Not sure if this is the right place to post, but I'm feeling like my life is genuinely ruined. I've been thinking about multiple ways of killing myself, but as of this point I am too scared to do so. 

I feel extremely retarded. My mind cannot focus on anything. People are talking to me but all I have are negative/anxious thoughts. I have extreme social anxiety, constantly monitoring the way I say anything. I'm also extremely scared in social situations because my brain is so slow, I can't understand what people say. I'm scared to ask people to repeat themselves because my self esteem is so low that I don't want anyone thinking I'm stupid. Its like, I'm trying to mask my stupidity. 

Every time I try to talk to someone close, I can't keep talking about my problems because I have really bad communication skills. I can't continue a proper trail of thought and easily get distracted by the reaction of the person I'm speaking to, or if I see someone in my peripheral is looking. I lose my trail of thought when someone looks at me and it drives me nuts. WHY CANT I CONCENTRATE? 

I'm extremely critical of myself 24/7. Negative thoughts enter my mind with everything I do, judging me, telling me that what I'm doing is retarded. Why can't I be normal?

I'm having some insane memory problems. Guys I really feel like my life is over. I don't know how to behave anymore. I've been isolating myself for the past 4 months and feel completely hopeless. Please someone help.
