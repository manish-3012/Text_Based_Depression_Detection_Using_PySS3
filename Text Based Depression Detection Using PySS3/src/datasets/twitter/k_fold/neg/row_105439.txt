how do i tell someone i have tried to kill myself?sorry if the title doesnâ€™t make sense. basically, i think am going to try to do something tonight but if i back out (iâ€™m not even 100% sure about doing this but i want things to end really badly) who do i tell and how do i tell them? should i call emergency services or tell a family member first? and if i did, what would i even say to them? 

any replies are appreciated, thank u
