Is this concerning?So, this is a burner account obviously, but I just wanted to get other people's opinion on something or maybe get other perspectives. I wouldn't say that I'm currently high risk for suicide, but I kind of have a means of suicide that I've prepared, which I guess technically in the books is high risk. I always have it it in my room, in my closet "ready to go" so to speak. I'm always like, passively suicidal if that makes sense? like I'd die if something terrible were to happen (which might be soon tbh we'll see lol) but I'm not seeking to die immediately? So I guess my question here is, would this be enough to send me to a hospital or something? Is this a very concerning thing or just considered a coping mechanism? I could see how telling a regular person this they'd probably freak out or something but it's just so normal to me now. having the "just in case" option sort of calms my nerves. Has anyone else done this or am I a freak?
