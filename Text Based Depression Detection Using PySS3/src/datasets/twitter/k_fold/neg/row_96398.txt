No one caresI just feel like nobody would care if I live or die. 
I never had many friends, I never had a boyfriend or girlfriend ( I am 20 and bi,  out to no one). I used to have a friend, but since she had a boyfriend ( I have a crush on both of them, it is weird) she doesn't want to do anything with me anymore. Since last  october, we hung out once, for 15 minutes, than she looked on her mobile and said : "I have to go,  I have to plan vacation with my be." and left. No one has time for me.
I live with my parents. I don't have   much money , I am still in an apprenticeship. I am still welcome there, but they don't really listen to me, they will never accept the way I am.
 I am just tired of everything, I feel completly lonely, I already was before the pandemic.
I love music, I can play several instruments. The problem is, that my brother is a musical genius. It is of course great, it will be his career choice, but it is just  hurtful when I go to the orchestra alone, when he has a concert or anything, and they ask:"Where is your brother?" before they said even "Hello."  
I am done, I see now way out of always being the second/last choice. 
Than you for your attention, the text is longer than I thought. It would be nice if anyone takes the time to read it.
