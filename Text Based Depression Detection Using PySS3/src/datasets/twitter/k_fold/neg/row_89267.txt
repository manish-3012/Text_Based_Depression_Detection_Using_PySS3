I'm having a terrible week, could someone message me?I'm regularly fantasizing about putting a gun to my head and specifically blowing my brains out because these traumatic memories and flashbacks won't stop. I feel like I got myself into this situation because I didn't have to study abroad or move to a new place. I had a good support network and very close friends in the town I currently live in. I love this country but I am falling apart. 

I don't want to burden my friends anymore. The shit that makes me want to kill myself happened years and years ago. There's literally nothing I can do about it. I cut off my abusers (my parents), have sought extensive therapy, and am excelling in life otherwise. I have a great future ahead of me and loving friends (sorry if I sound like I'm boasting, I'm not), but these memories JUST WON'T STOP. I'm a fucking 10 year old abused child inside. I can't live in peace. I've literally done everything I can. I'm tired of bothering people who can't really relate. I'm fucking embarassed about everything.

More miserable rambles, what a so-called friend of mine said last night:

Nobody can relate. Nobody understands. I am completely and utterly alone, just like I always was and will be.

I think the humane thing would have been to abort me. No matter what I do with my life, I will always be an unwanted fuck up inside. This damage cannot be repaired.
