Don't know what to live for...I don't really know where to start. I haven't always been this way. I had a very happy childhood and was well liked by mostly everyone at my school. Even in high school I had a decent amount of friends. It really wasn't until college that I really began to struggle with my mental wellbeing and sanity. Suicide first crept into my mind about a month into college. I was on a bus early in the morning near a very famous bridge and almost got off the bus to jump. I ended up not doing it and I continued on with school. I have fantasized about going to that bridge and jumping. I get a sort of euphoric high when I talk about it, but I don't ever think I'll grow the balls to do it. Maybe someday though...

I don't know what it was, but I have never really made friends here. I have my "best friend" from high school here but we rarely ever see each other anymore because he's way more popular and interesting than me. He's made countless friends and is extremely well liked by many at our school. I joined a fraternity but never felt accepted among my supposed "brothers". I met my girlfriend at the end of my freshman year and we've been dating since. Recently, however, she told me she wanted a break and we're currently 4 days into the break. And the thing is, it's all my fault. I totally took her for granted and I don't think I am going to be able to get her back.

I went through a serious period of depression this past semester but I eventually snapped out of it. Now the depression has returned with a profound sense of hopelessness. I feel like I have no control over my life and, quite frankly, I don't have a strong desire to stick around and see what my future holds. I recently started cutting myself and the rush it gives me is really extraordinary and makes me feel alive, if only for a few seconds. If it weren't for my parents, I probably would go ahead and just end it already. I think the last good thing I can do on this planet is wait for my mom and dad to pass before ending it. I just don't know how to make it to that point. I feel worthless, have no friends and have no idea what I want to do with my life that will have any sense of purpose.

Sorry for the rambling. A little pathetic, I know. Just had to get it out there.
