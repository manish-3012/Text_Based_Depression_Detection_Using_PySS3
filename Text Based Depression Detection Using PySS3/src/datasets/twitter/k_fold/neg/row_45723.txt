so fucking tiredi'm so tired of spending so much money on medication and not seeing any results. things never get better, only get worse and worse. i've been like this my whole life and i remember trying to kill myself when i was 15 and having to show up at school the other day like nothing happened. when i was 18 i started writing suicide notes everytime i felt suicidal, and now i have a whole binder full of if. i'm 21, but i've been feeling like i had enough since i was 14. i'm so fucking tired. i tried the medication. i tried asking for help. i even started trying any kind of drug at 16 because i was so desperate to find something that would shut my mind off. i don't know why i'm writing this. i don't know what i expect. don't even know if there is anything to expect. all i know is that i'm tired. but i was never brave enough to actually end it. how do i find somebody to end it all for me?
