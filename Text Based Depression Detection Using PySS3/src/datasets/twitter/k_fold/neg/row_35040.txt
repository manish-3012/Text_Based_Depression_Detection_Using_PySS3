Wyn eal gedreas/All the Joy has died.I am 32, jobless, homeless (couchsurfing), alone. Always alone. I live for self destruction, even if I don't intend it.

I have no love for anything anymore, including myself. I have no joy for the things I did anymore.I see misery and torture for my life before a long drawn out death, alone on the street or in some unused building. 

"I am fine" the easiest lie to tell which everyone knows is a lie but believe it anyway. 

"Man up, dude"

"You'll snap out of it soon"

"You just need a good night out"

"I know how you feel"

Constant belittling or over-simplifying or misunderstanding drives me to the point to just break down and give up right there. I want to give up.

I don't know why I don't. I have lost everything and I wish to die, I want to die. It isn't for love, family, friends or myself. I lack courage to do it. I am a coward...

This is my existence... Wanting to die and too much of a coward to do it myself.
