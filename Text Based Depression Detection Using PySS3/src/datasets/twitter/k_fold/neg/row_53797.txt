Im tired i really am...I feel empty now... After exploding my feelings out I just feel.. empty
Yesterday I blew up releasing all pent up emotions but now I feel empty and tired. Yesterday I slammed a wooden armchair straight on my head and now I still feel empty.
I don't know what to do. I can't talk to the one who related to me the most and made me feel at home.
Not being with her is taking a toll on my mind.
I've had multiple times where I blew up but yesterday was the worst.
I don't know what to do anymore. I don't feel human anymore..
