I'm done. DONE.Hello. Using throwaway account here, need feedback.

A little background now. I am a 19 year old male. I drink and smoke weed a LOT. I currently attend Rochester Institute of Technology. I grew up in a very rough childhood was at one point fostered, homeless, jailed, and abused. I have no one to relate to, depend upon on, no one.

Well I been contemplating suicide... my life was and is horrible growing up. Here's a short list of my basic life.

*Dad abused me in childhood.

*Mother is a herion/ meth addict.

*Lived in foster care system for 4 years until I ran away for good at 16.

*I am born deaf, parents made me feel like a worthless piece of shit.

*I have a younger sister that I have no contact with.

*I been in jail for drug use and theft.

*No friends or people close to me. (I have some friends but more will be explained on the below)

*Tight on money

*I have no motivation.

Let me let you know where I am now. I go to Rochester Institute of Technology as a student, (Before you say "How you get in college?" I went to my high school for the food, paid attention to education, got decent grades to prevent teacher's suspicions. You can say that I'm street smart). 

I can't handle this life anymore. No one knows what I went through, I gave you guys basics of my life, I can compare my abuse similar to the book, "A Child Called It".  I can't move on, can't tell anyone, and wish to forget my childhood. I have no motivation to go on... let alone live...

Fuck this...

I'm just in serious need of help. I can't afford to "talk" to someone, don't know who to talk to, and this is probably my last resort.

Edit: During middle school and high school, I always focused on school work just so I don't have teachers suspect my abuse, I lived on the street when I ran away at 16 for 2 years. I got a scholarship for RIT and decided to go here since it will be cheaper. I am not really happy at RIT, but I feel like it's the only place that I can have some basics as in food and clothes.

Edit2: I have some friends, but I don't really consider them friends. They don't know what I went through, I would just fabricate a "fake" life. I always lie to them so I don't talk about it. I feel like if I tell them the truth, they will not know what to do/say and avoid me. I am pretty good at lying anyways, grew up lying that everything is nice and dandy. Let's just say that kind of helped me stay alive, it's like a realistic fantasy world.

Also I have a permanent adoption now. They are an amazing family, I met them while I was homeless. They helped me a lot but they don't know my childhood and life growing up. Somehow, I get the feeling that they are annoyed by me and it would be better off if I cut off all contact with them.

Edit3: I am in class kind of late in the afternoon, if I don't reply, means I'm in class.

Let me give you a weekend of my typical life with my parents. I think this is when I was 10 or 11. One weekend my parents are doing drugs, getting into their trance-like state (also abusive state). They decide to lock me in a small fort-like structure outside during winter with barbed wire all over on the floor and they constantly throw something in flammable. It's like a game, I have to stomp out the flames before the wooden structure would catch on fire WHILE avoiding barbed wire.
They would throw in pieces of bread once in a while over the weekend, maybe 1 slice every 10 hours. The catch is, the bread is on fire too, so I have to stomp out the flame and I, of course, eat it because I was starving. I had to stay up the whole weekend to watch for the attacks.
After the "game", I get a belt beating from my father and my mother would sit there and laugh while consuming heroin. I dealt with this type of abuse almost every day, different "games" made up by my parents for their amusement. I have to figure out a way to "beat" the game so I can live. It was fucking horrible.

Let me know if you want more of my experiences.
