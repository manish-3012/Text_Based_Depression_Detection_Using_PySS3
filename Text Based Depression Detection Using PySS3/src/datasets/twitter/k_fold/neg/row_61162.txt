This is me letting go.Today's already been pretty shit. I got an ultimatum that I've gotta scrap my project car; something I've spent more than two years and most of my income working on, cause some fuck in our secluded neighborhood decided it was "blight", filed a city complaint. I've been out of work for two months due to an unrelated injury, I can't even walk without my SOs help. ***I feel*** like the fucking blight, I can't even piss without help, much less walk 500ft over to my baby to pull the parts I spent so much for off. No one will help me. I'll be lucky to get $200 for it. .

I also upset my SO to the point we both ended up crying for hours. I already feel so shitty without her having to take care of me like a vegetable. My dreams have been all but crushed. I don't know what to look forward to anymore, what I should even bother putting effort into, if it's just gonna end up wasted anyways. Literally so much other shit going on in my life that I just don't have the energy to try and talk about.

Maybe I'll crawl out there tomorrow night and lay under my $10k paperweight, reminisce for a bit before we both part ways. Maybe I'll kick the jack out and drop the engine onto my skull. It won't be instant, but the subdural hematoma and internal swelling will take me out of my misery quickly enough. I've got some shit to think about.

Ironically enough, so many people have told me that car would be the death of me. Rightfully so. It's a testament to everything I've done, anything I've achieved. A mirrored image of my entire life. My Magnum Opus.

I just want to be at peace.
