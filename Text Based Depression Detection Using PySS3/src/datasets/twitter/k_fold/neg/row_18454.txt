Birthday tomorrow, don't want to live to see it My birthday is tomorrow and I don't want to live to see the day. I have no friends. I have family at least. I got no cards this year other than ones  from My brother and therapist. My life is a mess. I have agoraphobia, depression and some pain disorder they can't treat because they can't figure it out. I had friends. They all hate me now. I'm not even sure why. One even blocked me on her cell and email. 

I'm 37 and I want to die. This isn't a life. No one cares I'm here other than family going through the motions. All my dreams are dead. I want to join them.
