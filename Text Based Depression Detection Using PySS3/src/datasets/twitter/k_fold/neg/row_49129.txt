I feel like I don't have a choiceIt's not that I don't want to kill myself, it's the thought and fear that I will always stay alive that stops me. Because of the universe being infinite, I will always be alive and exist somewhere, no matter what I do. I hate it. I hate existance. It's all been nothing but suffering. At times less suffering, but it's never been good. I have been hopeful for but as the years go by, it has only gotten worse, I just became better at coping with it. And none of it matters at all, reality doesn't care, the only rule reality has it that everything has to exist. I can't escape, none of us can.
