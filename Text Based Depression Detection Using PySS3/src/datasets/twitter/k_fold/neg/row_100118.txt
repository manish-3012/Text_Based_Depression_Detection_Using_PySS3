itâ€™s freezing out tonightin the province i live in, extreme cold temperatures. all i want to do is lay down in the snow &amp; let what happens, happen . i cant pay back my debts. iâ€™m jobless. fell out of love with my ex. pretty sure the new guy iâ€™m seeing just wants me for sex or something.
adhd. depression. anxiety. self medicating with weed can only get you so far if you have no other help.
this is just rambling at this point, i want to kill myself so fucking badly
