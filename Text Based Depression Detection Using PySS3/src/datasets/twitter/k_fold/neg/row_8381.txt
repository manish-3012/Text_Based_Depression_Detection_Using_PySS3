Feels like a losing battleMy whole life, for as long as I can remember, I have had issues with anxiety and depression.  And over the years, I feel like my ability and capacity to deal with it is lessening.  

Two years ago I had my worst depressive episode and ended up in the hospital because I was planning on killing myself.

Since then, I have been going to therapy and my therapist is one of the nicest, patient and understanding people I have ever met.  She has helped me with a lot in helping me to understand what is going on in my head and various ways to deal with unpleasant thoughts and emotions. 

Over the past year or so, life has been feeling a lot more difficult.  I just moved recently due to financial issues and I already hate my new place and already want to get out.  I don't seem see my friends as much since they are busy all the time, and I have difficulty connecting with people in general.  I just feel so isolated and tired and hopeless, and it just feels like any progress I do make can't keep up with whatever crap my mental illness comes up with.

I'm scared, upset, angry, ashamed and I'm sitting here typing this out because the suicidal thoughts are back right now and it just makes sense to me.  I want to end it.  But I don't know if I can, I'm too much of a coward.  But I feel like I'm delaying the inevitable.  Depression and anxiety keep finding new ways to derail me and I can't keep up anymore.  I feel like I don't have any other options, medication was tried years ago and that caused some really nasty side effects.  I feel like I can't fix it.  As long as I'm alive, I will continue to suffer.

I don't why I'm posting this, I never post anything, I just lurk.  My head feels foggy, I don't know if anyone will read this or if I'm making any sense.  I just want it to be over.
