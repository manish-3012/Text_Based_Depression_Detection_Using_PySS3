Fantasies about cleaning out my desk at workHope is a carrot I will never taste. I've chased it, I've cradled it in my arms but addiction is a gravity, a lure, a truth I cannot run from anymore . I have lost so much. I skipped a connecting flight to purge, missing my little sister's bachelorette party...and they say suicide is selfish but look st the monster that I am. I swear I am trying but theyll never understand how weak i am. 


The time has come to lay down the bricks...the roadway to my destiny is clear. I need to clean out my desk. I am so scared, but the truth isn't always packaged in ribbon. I need to end this hell for myself but also for other people, or whatever few people are left. it is getting lonelier.  As i age, there is less forgiveness and support. I need to end it when I still have people to hug goodbye
