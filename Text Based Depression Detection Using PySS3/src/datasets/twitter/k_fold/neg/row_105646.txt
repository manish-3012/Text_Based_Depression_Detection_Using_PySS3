People who have attempted suicide...I do not want to continue living. But before I make my final decision I want to ask people who have been in my position before and have made it out the other side.

Is it really worth carrying on or are you only doing it for the people around you? 
Do you wish it would have worked and it just all be over with? 

I am not interested in helplines or people telling me to go see a therapist. 

I want to understand someone's perspective looking back on their decisions.
