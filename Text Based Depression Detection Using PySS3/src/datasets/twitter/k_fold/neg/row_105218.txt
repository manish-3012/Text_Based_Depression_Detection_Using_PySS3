Update on my situationI posted here a few times over the last few years during moments of weakness throughout my 5 year struggle with depression, and this community had given me the support I needed to get through the darkness. 

I still have a long way to go, and am continually striving to make my life worth living, but I wanted to share what has helped me. 

I was anti-medication for a very long time, as I guess I was ignorant of pharmaceuticals, and had a strong distrust of our medical system. About 5 months ago I took the plunge and started a regiment of drugs prescribed by my medical professional, and it's made one he'll of a difference. After the first month or so it was like a light flicked on in my head and I started to feel better. My situation didn't improve. My environment didn't improve. But my chemical imbalance did. 

I'll most likely be on meds for the rest of my life, as the darkness crept back in on days I forgot to dose, but I urge everyone that's on the fence about medication to discuss it with your medical professional. It's not going to solve everything, but it could give you a bit of clarity moving forward in your struggles.
