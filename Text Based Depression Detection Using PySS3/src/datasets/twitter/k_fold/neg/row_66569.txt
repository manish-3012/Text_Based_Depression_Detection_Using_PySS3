Holding a loaded gun to my head makes me feel betterOften with me depression takes a physical toll. I can feel it in my head, throbbing, aching, tingling, and itching. It feels like it I could just open my skull up and give my brain a good scratch it would feel so much better. 

So what I do, what I've been doing for more than a decade now, is I take a loaded revolver and press the barrel against the right side of my head, just above and behind the ear, right where it aches the most. I think about the bullet like a little asprin, I immagine it going in and making me feel better. The metal is cold and it feels good.

Sometimes, not usually but sometimes, I'll put my finger over the trigger and seriously ask myself if I want to do this. I'll sit like that for 10 or 15 minutes, with the gun against my head, and it feels *good* just knowing that a few pounds of pressure from one finger could change everything.

I always end up thinking about some book series I'd like to finish reading, or some video game I haven't played yet, and I say, "No, not today. There's still some stuff I'd like to do." One day I'll be brave enough to go through with it. Not tonight though.
