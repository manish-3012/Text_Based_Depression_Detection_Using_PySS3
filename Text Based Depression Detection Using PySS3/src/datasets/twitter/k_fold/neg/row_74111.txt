Depression getting so much worseI feel stupid. Like I can't even grasp the most basic of shit without struggling. In turn this makes me useless. I don't have anyone to tell about this, but I don't really want to because no one really gives a shit ultimately. They don't like the pressure of being told by somebody that they feel suicidal. I bother people talking about my depression and then it gets worse. Wish I could afford things like medication but I feel like it never will get better anyway. I have no future.
