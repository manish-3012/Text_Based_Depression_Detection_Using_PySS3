FiancÃ© died - nothing left to live forThe love of my life died - stupid pointless terminal illness that took his life away long before it took his life away - and I am so so angry and it hurts so so much. I want it done now. There is literally nothing left to live for. Nothing apart from silence and pain and dreaming of him in some way or another every time I try to sleep. Nothing helps. Nothing ever will. 

I have never written a reddit in my life - I don't even know how this works really - but there isn't anyone else to talk to. I have no family and the friends I do have are all in happy loved up bubbles with husbands and babies and right now, awful as it is, I kinda hate them for being happy. 

I know 'he wouldn't want you to die' and all that, but he is dead so what he would or would not want is irrelevant.

I just want to die. I want it to stop.
