Almost 30 and still got nothing going for me.When I was younger, people would tell me that everyone went through figuring themselves out and that I'd be fine. 

I've never figured myself out.

I've got more student debt than I can pay off, possibly ever. I've never had a job that wasn't retail or food service. I don't really have friends. I don't go out. 

I don't have goals or dreams or something to strive for. I honestly don't know how other people do. It all seems so arbitrary.

I've "gotten help." I've had several therapists and doctors and what have you, and it's not better. I don't think I'm going to wake up one day and just figure it out anymore. This is just who I am and I cannot see how it's worth it.

I really don't think I'm going to be able to force myself to do this much longer. Honestly, choosing to live seems like the wrong choice.
