My cat is literally keeping me alive.Last night I found myself contemplating suicide, but as a plan began to form it occurred to me that nobody would take care of my cat after I died but before my corpse was discovered. Even if he chose to eat me, he would be all alone, trapped in my house, with nothing for companionship but whatever creatures wander past to be seen from the window with the cat tower. 

Thinking about this made me sad. I could never sentence my cat to such a sad fate. If I seek to find him a new home, then I suppose I am admitting my intentions are real. Thinking about sending away my companion also makes me sad.

There is a part of me that knows I deliberately created this situation. I got a cat to have a companion and someone who needs me, to keep me connected to the world, so I suppose that it is working.
