Just to add more to my story..Hi again. I just posted about 30 minutes ago but I'd like to post again, in hopes that someone reads this and my other post and comment their thoughts.. I know I need help because I'm not ready to end my life but at this point, the pain is soooo unbearable.
My constant anxiety keeps me from going out and doing the things I once loved. I slept till 4 today. I'm disgusting. I'm living at my grandparents house because I lost my job due to a panic attack that landed me in the hospital on suicide watch.
I feel useless with my mental problems on top of my eye problems. Read my other post if you haven't already. You'll know what I mean.
I hate myself. I hate looking at myself. I hate breathing. I just want to dream all the time. I can't get a job because of my anxiety. I don't want to take pills to mask my misery. Just want this to end.... Will probably do it soon.
