Everyone hates me what the fuckI know it's true and its not shit being drummed up in my head, they give off vibes that they don't want to talk to me or have anything to do with me. In fact some of them even straight up told me i'm an annoying cunt and i should learn to shut the fuck up, which is actually true. I've lost countless amount of great friendships and i can't deal with this shit much longer. I'm such a stupid fucking worthless sack of shit that needs to die. What the fuck is the point in my shitty life when basically everyone i meet ends up fucking leaving me or treats me like shit. I'm so fucking stupid, because i thought i was actually making some progress for once. Is that why they hate me? Because i'm so fucking stupid?
I try to be as nice as i can with people, i have my limits yeah sure but i still try my best and what do i get in return, shat on. Fucking brilliant innit, that's how much people love or care about me. They're always out to take advantage of me and i fucking let them walk all over me like a right tool. It's all my fault my lifes such a mess and I just wanna slit my throat because clearly nobody would give a shit if i did and i can guarantee my circumstances will never get better, same shit different day. Fucking motto of my life


(Im a guy btw, just to prove how fucking pathetic i am)
