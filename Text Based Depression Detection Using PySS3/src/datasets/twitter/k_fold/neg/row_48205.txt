Kept my promise...I am still here. It is kinda still cloudy (it rained last night) but I can see the Sun.

Have a T appointment today and a Mother's Day Tea at my son's preschool. 

Fuck my life. Mother's Day...I told them not to fuss over me. I don't feel much better than last night. 

To the person in my last post: I Can't throw the pills away...they are my prescription antidepressant. Sigh. Let's hear it for being unmotivated!

Whatever.
