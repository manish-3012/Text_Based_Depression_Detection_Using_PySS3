I'm losing itI love this girl so much and I get led on then left and she comes back and it happens over and over its driving me insane but I cant stop letting her do it to me i love her so much I'm only 17 but I've gone through so much with this girl but I cant have her. My lifes fuxked my schooling has gone to shit I try to make music but it is never good enough nobody cares about me enough to help my friends stab me in the back constantly and use me but they have been my friends since day one. I quit my job for this girl to spend more time with her and now I can't get a part time job and just sell weed got money but it doesnt feel right. I just drink and drink trying to numb it but it doesnt work I smoke weed and it gives me horrible anxiety but I do it so I can't feel. I'm turning emotionless and I dont know what I'm going to do with my life. I can't end it i have family i cant do it to them but I'm struggling so hard I fuck everything up. I feel like I have no options everything I do fails I have nothing left I can't talk to people about my problems they just feel bad for me and I dont wsnt that. The only one who can understand is this girl but I think she has multiple personalities which she admits to and it fucks me up so bad. Help
