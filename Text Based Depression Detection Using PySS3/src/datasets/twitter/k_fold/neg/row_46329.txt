Don't know what to do...First off, I'm from Sweden.

Well, my story is...

About a month ago, my wife left me, wanted divorce. We signed the papers, since here in Sweden we have to think about it for six months until the divorce can get through - at least when you have children together. So not until late February next year will this divorce be for real.

I love my wife (technically she's still my wife) and I'm in love with her as well. But since I've done some really stupid stuff - put her in debts and other things, things I REALLY regret doing and would do differentely a thousand times over - she can't trust me and can't live with me anymore. The thing is, she has told me that we could try again later on - once I get my life together with a job, an apartment on my own and such things.

But she has told me that she's engaged in different dating sites on the internet and also some dating groups on Facebook, and she's trying to find a guy who she can trust and love.

And I'm here and can't get anyone to talk to me (this weekend I wrote to a lot of interesting women but not a single one replied to me), I can't start a conversation with strangers while being out. Well, you may think it's irony that I don't want my wife on dating sites while I am. I'm mostly there to try to get over my wife, to see where it takes me.

As I stated above - I'm unemployed and I hate where I live (I'm living in a filthy room in my friend's apartment) and close to every single day I'm crying my eyes out, hoping for someone to just shoot me so I don't have to endure this misery.

I just want to get over my wife or... as I've said to my friends; Want my wife back or I can just die. Don't see much reason for living at all.

Sorry for the rant... kinda.
