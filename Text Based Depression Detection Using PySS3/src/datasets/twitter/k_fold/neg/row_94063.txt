The Suicide - Jorge Luis BorgesNot a star will remain in the night.
The night itself will not remain.
I will die and with me the sum
Of the intolerable universe.
Iâ€™ll erase the pyramids, the coins,
The continents and all the faces.
Iâ€™ll erase the accumulated past.
Iâ€™ll make dust of history, dust of dust.
Now I gaze at the last sunset.
I am listening to the last bird.
I bequeath nothingness to no-one.

Jorge Luis Borges, 1975
