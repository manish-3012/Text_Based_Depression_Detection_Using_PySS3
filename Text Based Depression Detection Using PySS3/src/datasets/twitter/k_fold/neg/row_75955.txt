Want it all to endMy life's been shit the last 5 or so years, I'm only 20, with me getting a surgery every year and another one upcoming this week. My knees barely work and hurt like hell, I can barely move my right shoulder and my left wrist stings and aches all day. This physical pain just compounds the shit I feel mentally, my life at home is horrible, my parents make me feel awful for my medical issues and mock me anytime I mention how bad things are. 

I have, or I suppose had, a friend who I could count on to help me through things like this but I've found lately that she seems to have never been sincere in wanting to help. I did everything I could and helped her escape an abusive relationship and gave her all the advice and care I could, and now she will take literally 2-3 full days to respond to a simple text message and doesn't listen to my problems anymore. 

I've never actually met someone who ever returned the kindness I show others, everyone always disappoints me and fails to meet even the low standard that I set for myself. I just can't handle waking up any more and it's a struggle to make it through a single day. I narrowly avoided a car crash yesterday by swerving out of the way of an awful driver and immediately regretted saving myself.. I just don't want to go through life anymore but am also so scared to take any action towards ending it.

I don't like to speculate with health matters, but I also think my mental health might be deteriorating, I've always feared so from the years of playing football and multiple concussions I received, I'll flip from calm to genuine fury at little things, when I used to barely have a temper. I just feel worthless and like nothing will ever get better. Just like my life, don't really know how to end this post, so thanks for reading
