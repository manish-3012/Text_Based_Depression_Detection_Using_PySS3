There's a person behind that keyboard.I've started therapy since I last poured my sorrows out to you guys. While I despise the therapy, I want to be normal, and I want to do this for my family and friends. The therapist is incredibly nice, so I guess it could be a lot worse. 

Anyway, I was playing a game today (Town of Salem for those of you who are familiar with it). I always name myself Kyoko Mogami after a character in a manga I read. I've been called "weeb" before, and I've always defended myself against those who treated me unfairly for having an interest in mangas and animes. Today was a different story. Today someone told me to kill myself for being a weeb. I tried to keep playing after that round but eventually I gave in to that nagging feeling again and told my friend I was going to bed. 

Do "normal" people feel this way when someone, even anonymously over the internet, tells them to kill themselves? Because since it happened, the thought is stuck there. I tried doing some exercises I learned in therapy and I tried to just forget about it and tell myself his opinion should mean nothing to me. But it does. After 3 weeks without a suicidal thought, it's back and it won't leave. 

Just remember. There's a human being behind that keyboard, and that person might hate themselves enough as it is.
