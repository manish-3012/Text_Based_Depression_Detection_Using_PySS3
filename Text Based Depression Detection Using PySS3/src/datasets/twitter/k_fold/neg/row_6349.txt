Sometimes Iâ€™m envious of people who can get it done in one try.I donâ€™t envy their pain, and I know that the pain must be immense for those who carry it out. This sounds disgusting, but I just wish committing suicide was something I could do in one try with the method I have available. Practicing never works for me, so trying is just *another* thing I fail at. I get more depressed each time I fail an attempt.
