Do you ever feel like thereâ€™s absolutely no point whatsoever?Especially people in the 18-26 year old range? Itâ€™s considered â€œstill so youngâ€ but itâ€™s really not that young anymore. Iâ€™m 21 and my life is legitimately pointless. Itâ€™s set out to be full of complete disappointment. Iâ€™ve been thinking of killing my self for the past 3 years. All of my failures have set the stage for how the rest of my life is likely to unfold and itâ€™s honestly not worth trying to correct at all. I donâ€™t want to try, donâ€™t want to hope, donâ€™t want to care. I do not want to live. I barely leave the bed for the majority of most days. Iâ€™ve been constantly loosing weight because I canâ€™t keep an appetite. Wake up feeling disappointed that Iâ€™m still here. I donâ€™t blame anyone but myself, and I feel like I need to let it all fade away by dying, otherwise this dread and depression will stick with me for the duration of my life. I donâ€™t have a set date, but I believe it wonâ€™t be long from now. Do any of you feel the same?
