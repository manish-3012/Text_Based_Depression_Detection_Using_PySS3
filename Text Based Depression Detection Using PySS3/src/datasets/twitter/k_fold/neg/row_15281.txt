I'm going to kill myself. I've made up my mind.After much thought. I've decided that I will kill myself. I don't think anything can change my mind. I could care less about ending my suffering. It's not about that. I want death. That's all I wish for myself, an early death by suicide. The aftermath of my suicide is probably going to be the funniest thing ever. I'd love to see my families' crying faces after they lower me down. I'd laugh in their faces. Because they have to live the rest of their life scarred by my passing while I can just rest. My farewell present I'll give to my family is eternal PTSD.
