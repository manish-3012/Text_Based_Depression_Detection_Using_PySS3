I can't keep goingI'm 16, and i've been fat most of my life. It went from chubby to fat. I weigh 187lbs and i'm 5'9. I have big, almost scary big love handles, the rest of my body is, shall we say, okay. I've only been thin for like 5 or 6 months, it was like 3 years ago. This short period of my life led to where i am today, fatter than i've ever been. When i look at myself in a mirror, i wanna cry. So every shower is a pain. I don't wanna be fat one more day. I'm depressed, paranoid, and alone. Before going out wherever, i stay in front of the mirror for sometimes 30 minutes to one hour, looking at every angle, to see if i look don't that fat dressed that way, or to see if my hair don't make my fat look fat. I feel trapped, that's what is, i'm trapped in this terrible body, and i can't escape. If i sit down, i'm gonna go out of my way to find a position that doesn't make me look fat, and i don't look down so i don't have a double chin. That's my life, everyday, even at home. I can't keep going like this, i'm going insane, and that's only one of my many problems. I'll have to die if i have spend another year like this. My life is hell.
