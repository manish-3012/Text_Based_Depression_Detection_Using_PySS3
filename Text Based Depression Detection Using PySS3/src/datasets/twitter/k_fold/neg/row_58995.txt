Bye, momSorry for being such a disapointment. I know you wanted a different life for me, but to be fair, that was never your decision to make. I am who I am and the only thing you accomplished by trying to change that was making me ashamed of the only person I'll ever be. Now it's over and I never even had the chance to be truly myself.

I'm going to die now. I know you'll be better off, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't bitter about it. I guess none of those hard feelings really matter anymore, though. It's hard to justify being mad when you're moments away from the end of your life.

I'll end this by saying that I wish things had been different. If your family had been better to you, maybe you'd have been better to me, and we could have even become friends. There's no point in wishing for futures that will never happen, though. Goodbye now. I hope this makes up for how I let you down.
