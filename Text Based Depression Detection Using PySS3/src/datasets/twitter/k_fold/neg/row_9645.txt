Mistreating everyone so they can hate me and suicide will be easierJust been laying in my bed for the past 30 or so hours. 

Itâ€™ll just be easier to let go of everyone, and for them to let go of me if Iâ€™m just a negative meanie anyways, right?

I hate this. I wish someone could kill me because Iâ€™m even too weak to commit suicide just yet.

And so what if I get better again? Itâ€™s the same cycle right? â€œRecover isnâ€™t linearâ€. â€œDepression is a lifelong fightâ€. Then whatâ€™s the fucking point? This is where I ALWAYs amd gona. End up? Relaly. Thatsnawesome.  Nb!!!!
