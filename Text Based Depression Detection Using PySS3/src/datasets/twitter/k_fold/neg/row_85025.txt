Anxiety is sucking the life out of meI have so bad social anxiety, and nothing works. Neither medication, theraphy or group theraphy. Im a loser by Any means. Ive had to jobs i screwed up. I had not a job for Seven years. Im 25 years old. My dad have high expectations at me, and im actually avoiding him. Im avoiding ny whole familie except my mom. Im so emberessed by my existence. My doctor doesnt like med or listen to med cause om in wellfare. Like im enyoing being a loser... Ive had suicidal thoughts since i was ten. Im a really ugly girl, which didnt go unnoticed when i went to vocational school, which i droppede out of also. I watch Glee (thank you Ryan Murphy) and watch everyday go by. I have 1 and a half year year back in the psychyatric system for my diagnosis (which i dont even think is right). Being anxious all the time is draining my soul. I really wish i was never born in the finest place. 
I dont know where om going with this but Ive Linda lost hope
