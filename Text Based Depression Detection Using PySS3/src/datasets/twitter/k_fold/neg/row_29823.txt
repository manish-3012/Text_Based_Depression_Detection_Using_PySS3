I have no home, no family, no friends, no income, and every treatment available to me has failed.Like the title says, I've been homeless for over a year and my life just keeps getting worse. I spend all day every day by myself doing nothing. I'm too depressed to work. I feel like I have little motivation to get up in the morning because I know I'll have nothing to look forward to. I've tried over a dozen different medications and therapists/doctors and nothing helps. What am I supposed to do? I'm about to try ODing on heroin or something because I honestly have no reason to live or hope that anything is going to get better. And a heroin overdose has to be the nicest way to go out considering it's a painkiller and you just get really high and then die.
