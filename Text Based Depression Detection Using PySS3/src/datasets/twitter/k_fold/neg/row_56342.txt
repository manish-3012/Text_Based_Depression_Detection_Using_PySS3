When does it get easier?I am so sick and tired of life. You trust the wrong people, fall in love, get married, and they just dump you like you were nothing to them. Strand you in a foreign country. Nothing to go home to. And they think they are doing you a favor to give you money for a hotel. How do I come back from this? I havenâ€™t worked in a year so I could be with him. This is a nightmare.
