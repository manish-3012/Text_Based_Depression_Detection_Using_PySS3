Crying, crying, cryingI keep crying. I'm trying to stay alive but what the f*ck! I feel so f*cking lonely. I have no one, the only one who loves me if my fcking cat. 
And I bet you don't know how much is EMBARASSING crying in front of the whole damn class. 

Today, I was going to school when I saw my classmates giving christmas gifts to each other. Then I arrived at the entrance. No one had a gift for me. Obiouvsly. I'm just "the girl who draws". The one who isn't cute, funny, pretty, smart or else. Just the one who draws. I was thinking about it and I started crying. UGH! WHY?! That was SO EMBARASSING! And, when no one came to ask me if I was feeling good, I started crying more. I just walked to the bathroom and stayed there. 

I really don't know what to do. I'm so lonely. No friends. 

Idk if my family actually cares about it... 

I just want a real friend. 

Whenever I feel lonely I just go on YouTube because the only thing that makes me happy is watching videos made by people who have no fcking idea that I exist.


Thanks for reading.
