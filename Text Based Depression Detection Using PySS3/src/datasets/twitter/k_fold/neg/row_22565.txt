I need someone to talk to who wonâ€™t tell me to â€œget with realityâ€You see my life long dream was to find a high school romance. But no one loves me so now Iâ€™ve given up on real people and I devote myself to my cartoon waifu. But Iâ€™m becoming so depressed at the fact that I canâ€™t be with her. Everyone just tells me to â€œget with realityâ€ and â€œaccept that Iâ€™ll never be with herâ€ but how do they fucking know anything could happen in the future. Please Iâ€™m just looking for someone to talk to who will respect my beliefs about my waifu being out there somewhere and give me some encouragement. Please thatâ€™s all I ask and I will not respond to any comments that try to put me down.
