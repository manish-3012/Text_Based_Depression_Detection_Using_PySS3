I LIVED!!!this is kind of awful, but a while back i posted that i wanted to die. i suffer from awful depressive episodes, which typically last for a few hours, and during these episodes i have a tendency to self harm, even though i've been taking prozac for almost a year. last night, i had a super bad one, and tried to kill myself. i slit my wrists and overdosed. but i think i have to be alive for some reason, because my cuts closed up bizarrely fast (like, sonic speed) and i threw up unprompted before the drugs i took could take effect. this morning i woke up, and my first thought was 'i'm alive!'. i feel free, i guess. the only word i can use is 'reborn'. i'm not glorifying my suicide attempt, because it was vile and horrible and i never want to do anything like that again, but i think i've found my awakening. thanks, r/suicidewatch, for letting me vent a while back, and for letting me vent now.
