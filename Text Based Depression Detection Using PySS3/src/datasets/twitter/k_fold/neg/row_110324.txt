Would you ever do it?I apologize if you don't think this belongs here, since I'm not about to put a gun to my head.

In reference to the title, would anyone else just kill themselves if they knew what the end was like? 

It may be a lot better than this bullshit and pain we're forced to live through. I don't think I'm suicidal, because I'm too chicken to just do it, without knowing what the afterlife would be like or if there even is one. It may be so much better than this life, and I'd rather go there in a heartbeat if I knew it. No responsibilities, no expectations, no nothing. Just death. I'm not a religious person, but the only reason I haven't killed myself already is for fear that a hell does exist. If only there was a way to be certain. Does anyone else feel the same way?

I've been having a mask on for such a long time, and I feel no one knows the real me. I've went through quite a bit of pain and loneliness in my life. I've thought of suicide for a long time, knowing I'd never do it.. unless I was certain of the end.

I've never been a great person, and I've had some very rough patches when I did meth and a ton of other stuff for a year(+). In my opinion, I'm no angel, but I've been clean for about 5 years. Although I volunteer in criminal rehabilitation. I often feel like I shouldn't even be there. I started to do it in an attempt to get some direction in my life, and feel like my life is worthy. So far, the result isn't what I had hoped. But I guess I'll keep plugging away because that's all I can do. It's tough to feel good about yourself, because of such high expectations and the threat of failure.

I see suicide as cheating in life, because while everyone else is left here to suffer, you're simply gone, and I've never been a cheater.
