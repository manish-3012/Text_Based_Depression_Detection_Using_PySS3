For me, suicide is coming like a process.Iâ€™ve been suicidal my whole life. The older I get (F28), the more I realize thereâ€™s really nothing to me here. I wasnâ€™t meant to be here. I donâ€™t fit in anywhere. Every second of the day is like a torture to me, and itâ€™s been like this for years and years. A while ago I used to think â€œI canâ€™t kill myself, itâ€™ll crush my motherâ€, but then that feeling wore off when I talked to her about my mental health and she didnâ€™t make much of it. Same thing with my husband. And I think itâ€™s good, loosing those ties. I used to be a Christian too, but became an agnostic. I was afraid of drugs, and now I abuse benzos, alcohol, weed and cocaine in a daily basis just to get by, including at work. I never thought of buying a gun, and now I am starting the process to purchase one (you gotta have a license in my country). Anyway, I guess my time is coming and I am at peace.
