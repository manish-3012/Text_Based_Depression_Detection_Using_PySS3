I'm done...Thoughts of suicide are ever more present. I am always the one fucking up. Last night I took my folks car and parked it on the road... So, today, it was my fault someone took off the side mirror. I have a brother who is (by degree only) a Dr. My brother is an avid pill popper, and I'm not talking about Xanaxs, I mean OXY's...My brother has never worked as a Dr. and he has been out of school for 10 years. Me? I'm nothing. I seriously want to die. I'm sick of everything being m fault.... C, you should be smarter. C, you should have tried more.... C, why arent you like your brother...... I have NEVER said suicide "out loud" before. I am ready. No one can help. No one can save me. I was born into this shitty existence.
