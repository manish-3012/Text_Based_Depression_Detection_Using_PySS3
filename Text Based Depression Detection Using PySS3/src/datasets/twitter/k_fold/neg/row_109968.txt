I feel pathetic .For the past almost 2 years Iâ€™ve been depressed, anxious, and wanting to commit suicide. My goal is to be dead by the end of the summer. Tonight would be a perfect night. Iâ€™ve looked up how to do it but now I just canâ€™t. Dying scares the fuck out of me. I donâ€™t know what it feels like and worst case scenario, I go to hell. Plus, if my attempt fails I could get brain damage. Now I donâ€™t know what to fucking do. I feel so pathetic and such a pussy. Every option seems too painful and risky. I wish I could just fucking go out like *that* but nah. Plus, Iâ€™d like the possibility of living, just Incase. I know Iâ€™m asking for too much for something as simple as suicide, but now that im too scared I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like my only escape is death at this moment. I feel like without it Iâ€™m just this this pathetic fucking 3dgy t33n. At this moment Iâ€™m just praying for a fucking aneurysm to kill me. I hate myself so much, i donâ€™t know Iâ€™m on fucking reddit looking for essentially nothing .
