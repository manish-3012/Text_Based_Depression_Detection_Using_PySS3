AloneIâ€™m not suicidal. I guess Iâ€™m just living to live tho waiting for the last piece of the puzzle. A lots changed for me positively. I started enjoying life more and whenever I used to go out Iâ€™d just think of the end rather then experiencing it like I do. Iâ€™m very appreciative for everything I have. Iâ€™d just love to share this love of life and everything with a girl.
