On the brinkAfter reading the risk assessment, I realised I'm a lot more at risk than I would have initially thought.
I have my method.
I have the means.
The weight of burden is already there.
I already feel isolated.
I still want to fight.. but I'm losing. I'm swimming in hopelessness and I'm beginning to drown.
