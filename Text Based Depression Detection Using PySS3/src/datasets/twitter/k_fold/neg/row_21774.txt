I'm going to kill myself and no one can stop me.How do i even start with this? I don't know who can benefit from this post, I just hope some people can relate and I want to get my feelings off my chest to strangers. I am 21 years old and i have suffered from (self diagnosed) depression since i was 10. Life is like a big lie to me, i got stuck in the better side of it. I come from a broke family, i have two sisters and parents who dont work anymore. I always had to work for anything i wanted, new phones, clothes, list goes on and on. Finally after getting fired from my job on November last year, i realized that i will probably be working 9-5 with minimum wage for the rest of my life most likely, yeah this hurts me the most. I am a total failure, both of my sisters are committed to ivy league colleges and in reality even if i wanted to get to a college i doubt i would ever make it, i am just plain stupid, i am not book smart like them. I am just a disgrace. My parents probably dont expect anything from their only son anyway. This is just the truth. I used to be the brightest child in our family, but time goes on and people change and i have decided already that i am going kill myself and end this misery and do it in a way that anyone getting hurt. None of my friends probably know this side of me, but its all going to end this week. And if you made it this far reading my story, thanks. I hope you dont end up like a total mess and the worst brother what two beautiful sisters could have had. Just makes me sad to imagine their life without me...

I really cant say i dont care or value my life.

But its all going to end this week.
