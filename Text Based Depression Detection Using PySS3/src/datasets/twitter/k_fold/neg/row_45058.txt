Stopping Suicidal ThoughtsI keep having suicidal thoughts and vague plans as to how to go about this. I don't feel much of a compulsion to act on them but I've been having them since before Christmas and on and off throughout my life since I was about 12. Currently I feel a bit hopeless and lacking motivation but my enthusiasm fluctuates a bit. Been having a difficult time at work and really struggling with nerves before j go in to work. Feeling sick etc. I don't want to go on meds and don't see much point in therapy. Just looking for some advice. Would daily suicidal thoughts indicate a mental health issue? Thanks
