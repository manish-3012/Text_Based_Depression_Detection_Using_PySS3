The responsibility and expectations are too much.I started experiencing intusive thoughts during the school year and missed school and when i told my parent about it they listened for two days,the next day go off to school.Also did I mention they think i am a super genius kid which i'm not,sure my teachers say i'm smart but that doesn't mean i should score 100% on every test.Even when i do well i get you could do better.I'm done living other people's expectation.And the harm OCD hasnt helped either i dont know if i can do this anymore.I think i'm going to fail my exams and i can't shake it off and when it happens i think i cant carry on anymore
