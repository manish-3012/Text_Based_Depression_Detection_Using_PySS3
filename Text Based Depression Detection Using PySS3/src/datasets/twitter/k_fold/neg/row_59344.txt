The Empty Void"One should be afraid of life, not death." These words never spoke more truth. I'm a 20 year old male living in California currently. I've had depression and ocd for a while now. It has taken over my life and on top of that I'm put simply a shitty person. I'm unemployed living in my parents house and have no hope of going anywhere. I failed out of the Navy and let everyone including myself down. I couldn't take the voices in my head and felt weak for wanting out. I dropped out of college cause I'd rather get fucked up and not do anything at all. I've had plenty of jobs and I've either been fired or fucked it up somehow. I'm pretty sure I have some sort of chest problem because I can't even sleep on my left side without my chest hurting and feeling my heart pound. I lost my most recent friends because I was awful to them. I have no friends and I'm a burden to my family. I try to be productive but all I want to do is drink and sleep. I went to rehab for my drug addiction and I don't see it getting any better. I don't know what to do so I'm hoping in writing this I'll feel even a minute of tranquility. Thank you for reading.
