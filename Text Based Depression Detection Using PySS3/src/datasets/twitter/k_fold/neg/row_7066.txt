I donâ€™t see the pointTruthfully - what is the point in living if Iâ€™m just in pain all the time?

This feels like rational thoughts that I want to kill myself bc this life isnâ€™t worth it.

Everyone keeps saying â€œit gets betterâ€ well years of therapy and medication and itâ€™s not better. And NOT for lack of trying.

I just... donâ€™t want to live anymore. There isnâ€™t enough joy, isnâ€™t any joy, to make the pain I feel worth it
