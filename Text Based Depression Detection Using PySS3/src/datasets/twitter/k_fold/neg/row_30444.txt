I read something today that made me pause.I had made the decision a couple days ago to end my life in the near future. I still feel like it's an option. I'm not at the lowest of my lows right now and maybe that's why I can derive worth from this statement I found on reddit today:

[Why should you want to live? Because you have eternity to be dead.](http://www.reddit.com/r/intj/comments/17zhtm/i_dont_want_to_live_anymore_what_do_i_do/c8aahec)

I don't know why that forced a new perspective on me but it did and maybe it can help someone else.
