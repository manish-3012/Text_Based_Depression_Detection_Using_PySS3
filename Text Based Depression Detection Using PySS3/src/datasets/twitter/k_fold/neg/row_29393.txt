I just want to be lovedEvery girl I talk to just ends up ghosting me, and at my school there's a rumor that I'm gay and I just can't take it no more, I'm a pussy and I can't talk to girls, I just want to kill myself but I'm a pussy to do that too, my family doesn't understand me and thinks that I'm not old enough to date, but I just want someone to love me and tell me everything's going to be fine. I have OCD too and it's consuming my life, I literally can't take a step without getting intrusive thoughts that make me do things that make me feel/look like a complete idiot. I don't know what to do anymore and I cry every night. My sister thinks that I'm stupid when I try to talk about this and I don't have no one else to talk to. If you read  it all, I just want to thank you
