Dumped on Valentine's. Feeling like trash. Nothing seems to matter.So I had been talking to this girl online for about 15 days. We finally decide to meet on Valentine's. And as soon as we meet, I can see how disappointed she is. I knew instantly that she didn't expect me to be so bad looking. It was two long awkward hours. I felt like shit afterwards. Then she told me not to message her again. I feel suicidal. I feel like I'm not worthy of living.
