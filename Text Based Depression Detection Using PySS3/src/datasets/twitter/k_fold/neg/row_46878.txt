I decided to kill myself on 9th of July at the sunrise.There's a beautiful bridge and tall on my country. Is red and I can watch the ocean. There's a beautiful view, and easy acess. It's full everyday, but at dawn it gets empty. I won't draw much atention nor drama...
The sun will rise at 6:20AM. I'm gonna pack my stuff, I don't have much. Only a computer, a piano and books, on my car, that way my parents will not have to collect my stuff at my home.
I'm gonna compose for the first time a piece on the piano. I'll record and post it here on that day, and also on my facebook.
And then I'll close a story that is lasting for too long.
