What the hell am I even living for?No seriously, why am I alive? I feel nothing, i'm lacking any energy to at least pretend to be enthuasiastic about anything. All of it bores me now and i've seen enough. I just want to break out of this never ending cycle now. 

I used to think I was keeping myself alive for the sake of the people in my life but what the fuck kind of life is that? How can it be worth living if I have such disdain for myself that I believe I should be dead.

I can't keep up this facade anymore. I can't keep lying to people and telling them 'i'm fine'

It's pointless and I know it is, i'm never gonna have a life so it's best to put an end to it now before things get much worse down the line and I end up a pathetic lazy slob who leeches off his parent never stepping foot outside and living off benefits.

Please something kill me, anything. A heart attack, a car, some person with a knife. I don't care what it is. I'm just done i'm fucking done.
