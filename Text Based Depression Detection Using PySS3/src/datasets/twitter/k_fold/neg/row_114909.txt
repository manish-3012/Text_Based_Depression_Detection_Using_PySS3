I feel I'm delaying the inevitable.I've posted here before, and even took some of the advice that seemed to be impossible to me, and maybe it's my mindset that allowed it to fail, but here I am, back again. I can't shake this feeling that I wish I could hire someone to end my misery. This pain that's so emotional that it becomes physical. A hole in my heart that's like a singularity, drawing up all the good and bad, and leaving me hollow. I feel so lonely even though I have friends. I feel like anything I do doesn't really matter, because there appears to me that there is no reason in this life, for anything other than what we assign. Given that I feel hollow enough to stop giving a shit about most things, meaning in my life is near non-existent. The only reason I haven't tried to kill myself again is I don't want to start a negative ripple effect on my family and friends, and I don't want to leave my pets like that. I try and do positive actions, I try to make new friends, try to get a girlfriend, but much of that falls short. I continually become burnt out over things I enjoy, and I overall feel like a monster on the inside with so many dark fantasies. I guess I just want someone to understand this pain I'm in, to feel this noose around my neck that tightens every day, making it harder to breathe and focus, making my vision tunnel to the immediate. I truly don't want to die. I just want this pain and eternal loneliness to ease, for this bounty of love/hate to find some kind of balance, but it seems to always be in the back of my head at a minimum and even then it's often overbearing.
