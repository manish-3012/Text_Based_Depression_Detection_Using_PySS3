What's the point anymore?I'm so sick of the fact that the very second someone realizes they can hurt me they're going to take advantage of it. If I give any kind of sign that maybe I just might need someone I'll never hear from them again. I've thought about suicide a lot but never very seriously. Now I know that no one will give two shits until they know I'm gone. I'm tired of hurting because it never goes away and all it can do is get worse. I doubt I'll have the guts to do anything but it's nice to think there's a way out. A way to quit hurting and to be safe from everyone.
