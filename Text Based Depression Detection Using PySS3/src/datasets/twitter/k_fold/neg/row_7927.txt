Ready to off myself because honestly I wouldnâ€™t be missedI should be happy Iâ€™m only 21 I have a good job make good money I own my own house life is going great but I donâ€™t know I just want to die I wonâ€™t get into specifics how but it just seems the only option Iâ€™m not normally one to vent I try to bottle it up but in the end Iâ€™m lonely thatâ€™s what it is what a dumb reason for me to want to kill myself I get it itâ€™s a common reason but I just I canâ€™t process anything right now my mood swings all the time Iâ€™m one inconvenience away from crying I canâ€™t handle life anymore (sorry for the train wreck of a way I wrote this post it is my first)
