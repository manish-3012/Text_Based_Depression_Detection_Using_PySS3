Postponing my end because "if only -- happened, things would finally be better."(Just a little rant)

Been depressed ever since I was a young child, and I think I have had suicidal ideation (not diagnosed with the latter though) ever since I was this young as well (mid-late elementary age).






I have always told myself the same things over and over again, postponing my end in the hope that things change.

*"If I become friends with this popular girl, I'll finally be happy, and I won't have to do this."*

*"If I could just go out with this guy, I'll finally be happy, and I won't have to do this."*

*If I get this job, I'll finally be happy, and I won't have to do this."*

*"In -- years when I'm this old, I'll finally be happy, and I won't have to do this."*





Time flies by; I reach that age, I've been with that guy, I've got the job, and I'm friends with that girl. However, I am still completely obsessed with offing myself.




Right now, I'm waiting until I'm old enough to move out of my parent's house. I'm having home troubles right now, and I keep on telling myself that once I turn 18 all my problems will disappear and everything will be OK. Part of me believes this, but part of me knows that I'm wrong and I should just get this over with. Don't want to die, but my life seems to be getting worse and worse by the day. I really do believe that this is going nowhere.
