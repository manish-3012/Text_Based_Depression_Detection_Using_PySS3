Here's a list of reasons people tell me I should go on, refuted\&gt; Your (insert family member here) wouldn't want you to end your life

Nobody wants their loved ones to die. But we all will, inevitably. In my case, my mom is dying of cancer. According to other people I'm supposed to be okay with this because it's the "natural order." Uh..well, fuck that. It's not natural to me. It's the worst thing imaginable. Either way one of us suffers seeing the other die. Soon enough we'll both be dead anyway and it won't matter who went first.

\&gt; Suffering is a part of life and we all have to go through it and keep going on

Uh...why? To me if the choice is between suffering all the time and not existing at all, that's an easy choice. I'd rather be dead. Hell, even if I botch my suicide and my brain is all messed up, at least I'll most likely be far less aware of whats going on around me than I am now. But, I won't mess up.

\&gt; Jesus loves you

Yeah...no comment on this one. 

\&gt; You don't know what happens after you die, you could end up in hell 

I'm already in hell. At least the next one would be something different. But in all seriousness, I don't believe in any of this fairy tale nonsense so it doesn't scare me at all.

\&gt; People care about you. Even internet strangers here care about you

Nobody cares about anybody. I mean no offense when I say that I think people are mostly here either to make themselves feel better by seeing how awful everyone else has it, to seek help or at least be witnessed in our deaths. But I don't think strangers truly care about people that are taking their own lives. It's not their fault. We just aren't really wired to care about strangers. It's evolutionary. We care about people close to us.

All I can think of right now.
