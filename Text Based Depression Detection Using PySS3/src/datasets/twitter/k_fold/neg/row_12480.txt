I got fired.I got fired yesterday. I committed "fraud" by entering fake email addresses on an application and was fired. The whole time I admitted what I did was wrong. But nobody backed me up. They just looked at me like I was a criminal. I was taught in that situation telling the truth is better than lying. Nobody at the new location backed me up. Not a manager. Not a coworker. Nobody. 

I have no money. My girlfriend kept telling me I should go kill myself. My friends are telling me I shouldn't and it's going to be okay. But I just feel like I have no talent and my life is over. 

I can't even think of what I'm going to do. I can't believe my managers are spinless and couldn't even do the firing themselves. They had a lady on the phone do it. 

I was just a number. 

A number that doesn't have a job anymore or a reason to live. 

I hate myself. I hate everyone. I want people and things to die.
