I want to kill myself and have everything ready, but I'm not planning on killing myself because I don't want to die...Having everything put in place just makes me feel a little better for some reason. But I could never hurt my family like that, on the other hand there are some nights when I really really want to die. Should I be in a hospital? I hate the psych ward, and I don't really like the suicide hotline people, and if you talk with friends about it they freak out. Anyways, that's all.
