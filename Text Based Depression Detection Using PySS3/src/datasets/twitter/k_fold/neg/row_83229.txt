I don't care about anythingI don't care about my family, my husband loves me but i don't want to be with him anymore, and i really don't care that we haven't had sex in over 2 years

I quit college with 18 hours left and I don't care that I'll never finish

I don't care about my appearance

I don't care that I've stolen from almost every job I've ever worked at, i don't have a conscience about it, i don't care if i get caught 

I don't care anymore that my mom is an alcoholic and never loved me enough to stay sober or stay close by

i don't care that I'm so deep in debt that I'll never get out, it makes no difference

i don't care about anything anymore

goodbye
