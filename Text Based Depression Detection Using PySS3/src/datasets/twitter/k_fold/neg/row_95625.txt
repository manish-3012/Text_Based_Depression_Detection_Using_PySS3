I don't know what to say besides helpHi reddit. I need someone desperately and I just feel like giving up hope. I feel like this subject is too sensitive to talk to even my closest friends about, and I've fallen to the bottom. I don't want to lay this burden on them and say I need them right now, especially not my girlfriend, because she doesn't need this kind of worry in her life and she wouldn't have the time for this. She's fantastic but I can't help but feel guilty that she's dating me, because there are so many fantastic guys who could do so much more for her. I know she's supportive of me and helps me in every way I can but I love her too much to have her hear me say this. If that even makes any sense..
I've been thinking about killing myself a lot lately. For the past two months it's been a slow spiral downward, and I'm scared. I'm scared I won't find a way back up. I want to so bad but I don't see any way out of this. My friends starting noticing and they started worrying about me, and I don't want them to. They deserve a better friend than that. So I put up a wall. I felt so bad that I was weighing them down, and I don't ever want my friends to have to catch my fall.. so I try to act as normal as I can, which is terrifyingly easy. I'm just so ready to give up. I feel like a terrible friend, a terrible boyfriend, and just an awful human being. Like I've never amounted to anything and no matter how hard I try, I never will. So I think the best thing is to end it. I've already cut myself, though it was very small. I snapped out of it pretty quickly that time but I don't know how long I can stay away. I feel like I deserve punishment and I'm the only one who will give it.
So, from an internet nobody: thanks for reading, please help me
