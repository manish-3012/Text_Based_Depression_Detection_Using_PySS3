I wish I didn't fail suicideI tried at the wrong time, a time I wasn't ready and it genuinely was a cry for help. I felt too much guilt and I seen the sadness it will cause, it ruined it for me. The guilt is gone now but it's still always there when I start to plan. I feel like my body is shutting down and it's only a matter of time before I need to do this. I NEED to do this.
