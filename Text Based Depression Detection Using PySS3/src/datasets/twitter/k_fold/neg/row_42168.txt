I donâ€™t know what to doI donâ€™t think anyone would miss me if I died. Maybe they would in the immediate aftermath, but in the long run I think everyone I know would be so much better off. 

I had so much potential when I was younger and Iâ€™ve failed to live up to it. 

I have one person who I think genuinely cares and I canâ€™t count on them to always be available to help me because they have their own problems to worry about. They know Iâ€™ve been depressed and I have a history of self-harm but they have no idea how bad my mental state has gotten. I donâ€™t know how to ask for help. 

Iâ€™m so tired of fighting to get through every day.

Iâ€™m just so fucking tired.
