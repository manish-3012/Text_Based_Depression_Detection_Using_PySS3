I'm human wasteI'm almost 30, I'm homeless, can't find a job, can't start a family, have no one to turn to. My day is filled with making people feel sorry enough for me to give me enough money so I don't starve. The only reason I haven't jumped off a parking garage is that there would be no one to take care of my dog. I am sick to death of being a second class citizen that doesn't deserve respect as a human being because I'm surplus population under capitalism. I'm not eating tonight because it rained all day, so there were no passers-by to panhandle. I have no reason to go on living, my presence on the sidewalk is an eyesore to worthwhile people to and from their way to work.
