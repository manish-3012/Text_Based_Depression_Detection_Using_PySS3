Anyone from England here?I know it's a lot to ask, and I'm imagining there aren't *that* many British people on here but I thought I may as well ask.

I was released from hospital last night after my sister told my mother I was suicidal. My mum called an ambulance and I was admitted into hospital and released 9 hours later.

Pretty much the last thing my mother said to me was that I was a huge disappointment, that I'm not welcome back ever again and she would not allow the hospital to release me to her. She won't answer her phone nor will my sister. 

I'm asking if there's anyone i can talk to on the phone. Like a call. I know it's a lot to ask and I'm probably not going to get anywhere but I had to try. I won't invade your privacy, or keep you on the phone for long, and I won't drain you through negativity. 

I understand it's a big thing to ask to someone, I really do.
