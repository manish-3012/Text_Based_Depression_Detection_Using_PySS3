i want to diei dont want to deal with shit anymore. life is too much. iâ€™m selfish and lack empathy for people i love. my gf and i of three years are about to break-up. we were friends pretty much all through high school and started dating a year after. ive hurt her numerous times and have been a fuck-up. ive been selfish ive lied and partook in shit she is against. thinking of losing her makes me want to throw-up, thinking of her being with someone that isnt me makes me want to die. i dont have the energy to pick myself up and live life after her. ive always wanted her and i will always want her. everything about these last two weeks have made me want to die. i cant exist anymore
