Got arrested todaySo I got arrested today and cautioned for wasting police time because I went and tried to kill myself, but because when they found me I hadnâ€™t done anything I just got arrested. Yay. The mental health systems and law systems go hand in hand and donâ€™t work in the slightest. Iâ€™ve been locked in a cell for almost the full 24hours you have in custody and had 1 to 1 because I opened all my old cuts and bled everywhere. What do they expect, they put someone in a cell with nothing to do but to be left with your own thoughts and all my thought were I wanted to die....
Iâ€™m so fed up with these broken systems and Iâ€™m convinced that Iâ€™m going to die by my own hand, maybe not this month or next, or even this year but the statistics are not in my favour.
