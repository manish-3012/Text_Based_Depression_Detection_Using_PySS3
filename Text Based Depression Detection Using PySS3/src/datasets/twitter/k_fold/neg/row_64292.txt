I am so in painIâ€™m in debt 60,000 dollars, the girl I love doesnâ€™t want anything to do with me. The only thing on my mind is suicide. Iâ€™m a good looking guy, have some good things going for me. But I am so fucking broken and sad. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself before, wasnâ€™t successful. Iâ€™m so ready to fucking die. I give no shits. Iâ€™m 20 years old and am about to be homeless because Iâ€™ve been let go of my past few jobs due to covid and cutting hours. I need $5000 that I would pay back ASAP but canâ€™t get from anyone. Nothing in my life is going well. Iâ€™ve been hit by every possible misfortune. People think Iâ€™m this happy kid with potential to do big things but Iâ€™m minutes away from taking my life every day. I hate everything
