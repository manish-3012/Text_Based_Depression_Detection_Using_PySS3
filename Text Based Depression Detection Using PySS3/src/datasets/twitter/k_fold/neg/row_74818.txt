Thereâ€™s nothing left for meIâ€™m just not interested in anything. Gonna be forever alone. No passion for anything. Just pass the time doing absolutely nothing. I donâ€™t wanna puke out my life story if you want just look at post history. At this point I just want to die itâ€™s not worth it. I donâ€™t care if my family is sad when I go they are occupied by their own lives. Suicide is freedom. No student bills to worry about, no worries of growing up missing out of relationship and happiness, donâ€™t need to find passion or interest. Dying is freedom from all this bullshit and this dumb game I get a choice to stop playing
