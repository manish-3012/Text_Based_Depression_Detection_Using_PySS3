how the hell does anyone expect me to survive the next year.i start senior year tomorrow. school fucking sucks. the people there are shitty. i hate being at home because my parents are completely unpredictable and manipulative. one day theyâ€™re totally fine and the next theyâ€™re fucking awful. the other week my mom called me a disappointment because my hair was dyed a little too dark. iâ€™m never good enough for them. they treat me like iâ€™m such a fuck up. i canâ€™t handle it anymore. iâ€™m so sad all the time. all i want is to be happy. thatâ€™s it. iâ€™d have done it by now but iâ€™m a pussy. iâ€™m worried iâ€™ll fail and end up paralyzed and handicapped for the rest of my life. i just canâ€™t wait for this shit existence to end.
