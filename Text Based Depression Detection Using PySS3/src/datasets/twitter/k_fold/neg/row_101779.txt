I need helpI've had the worst year of my life. I lost all of my friends over something stupid. There are ridiculous rumors going around about me. This drove me out of town for the majority of the summer. I fucked up my first semester of college, then decided to take some time off school. I'm now so far behind that I have no idea where to start. I've been homeless since February. I've been sleeping on couches, and most of my belongings are in an unsanitary storage unit across town. I have no job, no license, and no motivation to get either of these things. I recently fucked up a very important relationship with the best thing to happen to me in months. I have a history of depression, anxiety, and I most likely have some form of BPD. I'm dangerously depressed. I don't know where my life is going and it's terrifying.  I have absolutely no one to talk to.

It feels like I'm slowly losing control. Suicidal thoughts are almost constant. I want to give up so badly. :(
