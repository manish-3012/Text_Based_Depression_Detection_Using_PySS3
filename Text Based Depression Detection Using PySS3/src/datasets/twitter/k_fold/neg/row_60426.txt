Why do I have a voice telling me to kill myself like a little devil on my shoulder.For the longest of time since 13 years old, 22 now, I have a side voice in my brain that tells me to kill myself. Literally a voice just telling me â€œkill your selfâ€. I donâ€™t understand. Itâ€™s like an angel sitting on one side of my shoulders and a devil on the other. But about a month ago itâ€™s been the only thought I have. WHAT THE FUCK
