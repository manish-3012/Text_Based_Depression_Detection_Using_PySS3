What happened?I was happy until I had to repeat the second grade. My friends moved ahead a grade and started to call me stupid and make fun of me. I've noticed that every yearbook photo I took from that year on has me looking miserable and pissed. I started getting fat in the third grade, and by fourth grade I was already morbidly obese. This naturally got me torn to shreds throughout the rest of school. Ninth grade was the worst. I lost all of my old friends, was pushed around, was made fun of, laughed at, girls feigned interest in me and teachers literally told me I was stupid. Near the end of the year I planned to shoot myself in the cafeteria in front of everyone. I had a page long note explaining the pain I felt ready, but I didn't do it. Instead I dropped out and became even more lonely and miserable. 

I missed a happy childhood because of my weight, I didn't finish school because I'm weak minded, now I'm stuck here. I recently got in touch with an old crush I had in middle school. She asked me to come see her Senior play but I didn't go because I was scared of how she'd react to how fat I had gotten since she last saw me. I want to lose weight, but that doesn't bring back my childhood, or my high school years. What the fuck happened to me? Why did I quit school? What's wrong with me psychologically that made me this large and disgusting?

Due to financial troubles my dad had to sell his guns, and I'm not about to go around asking to buy guns. What kind of rope can withstand 350 pounds at a sudden jerk from gravity? Knowing how idiotic and fat I am the rope I'd get would probably snap.
