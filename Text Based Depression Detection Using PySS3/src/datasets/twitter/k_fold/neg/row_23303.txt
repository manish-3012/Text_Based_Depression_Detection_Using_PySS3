I might off myself this summer.I think socrates or someone said "philosophy is learning how to die" or something like that. I guess I'm ready now. 

I don't feel any sadness or fear or anything, I was just lying in bed, and I realized I might just kill myself this summer. I had always made it my goal to be ready to die at the drop of a hat, and now I'm afraid that I've achieved that.

I look at my life and I see nothing I enjoy. And nothing I could enjoy in the future. No reason to stick around. Nothing but boring work, and bullshit. I considered being a hermit and living in the woods (which isn't much fun, mosquitos). Or getting a sailboat and sailing the world (which probably mean I drown). So really, dunno what I should do. I don't enjoy meaningless work, I don't want to do anything with my life. And no, I'm not depressed. I'm simply a person who has lived enough. There's no reason to be alive anymore.

Now there's still the question of when and how, and stuff like that. I have no idea why I even wrote this here, nothing any of you say will change my mind. I guess I'm proud of my decision and want to share it with you people? I've always felt that suicide is the most courageous thing you can do. So I don't know.
