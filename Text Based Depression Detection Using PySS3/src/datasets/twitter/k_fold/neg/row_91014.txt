I want to jumpI really need to just get this off my chest because Iâ€™m feeling so desperate right now. This might be a long story. 

So Iâ€™ve been really depressed lately and started considering suicide after starting Prozac a few months ago. I noticed this and stopped the Prozac but I havenâ€™t gotten on anything else as Iâ€™m currently living in a different state than my psychiatrist and the thought of going through the process of finding a new one is exhausting.

My husband has always struggled to control himself around alcohol and itâ€™s the only thing we ever fight about. We went away for my brotherâ€™s wedding over the weekend and we fought half the time we were there about his alcohol consumption. We came home Monday night and he was back to work (as a bartender) Wednesday night and last night. Weâ€™ve been having some financial issues and we had a long talk Wednesday before he went to work and he was in such a good place and so motivated to just put our heads down, work out our debt and start to save for a house and a family. Then he came home super drunk at 6am from work. I told him it made me so upset because it went against everything we had JUST talked about. We had a great conversation and he promised to be better.

Last night was hard on me because I found out that the doctor had detected cancer cells in a recent scan and I need to go in for a biopsy and my husband was at work, so I was dealing with it by myself. Then this morning I woke up feeling great. He had been communicating well, it was Friday, I had a super cute new outfit that I was wearing and couldnâ€™t wait for him to see. But he still wasnâ€™t home from work when I left (6:30 am). This is pretty normal, as bars close here technically at 4am but he will often stay open late because his boss comes and drinks with his friends and keeps him late. He had been saying it was a rough night as he had a disagreement with his boss, but he genuinely seemed fine and his texts were normal. He said he was finally closing up at 6:50am. But then he stopped responding to my texts and calls and I knew something was wrong. Finally a half hour later he answered and was drunk out of his mind and couldnâ€™t put a sentence together.

It was really my last straw and I told him I couldnâ€™t live like this anymore and that I was leaving him and going back to my home state. He got angry but then started texting me how I was a million times better than him and he hopes I find the perfect life I deserve and all this shit. And now Iâ€™m sat here at work trying to keep it together while my marriage ends. I donâ€™t know how I can stay with him at this point but I donâ€™t know how I can be happy without him. Iâ€™ll never find someone else, Iâ€™ll never want to kiss anyone else or be with anyone else or have kids with anyone else. So I feel like I canâ€™t win by staying or leaving.

At work I have access to a rooftop garden on the 21st floor that is empty all day. I keep thinking how easy it would be to just jump and solve all my problems. I wouldnâ€™t have to decide then, I wouldnâ€™t have to rebuild my life, I wouldnâ€™t have to deal with my heart pounding and the anxiety that come with his alcohol problems. It would be so easy. But I love him so much so when I picture cutting my life with him short, it hurts so bad. But I also know that jumping would end that pain. Iâ€™m just such a disaster.
