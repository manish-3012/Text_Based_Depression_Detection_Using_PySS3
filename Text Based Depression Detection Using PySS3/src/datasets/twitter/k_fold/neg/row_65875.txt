17 M, my life feels meaninglessI genuinely canâ€™t see myself being happy, ever. At 15 I had to deal with the emotional turmoil of my big brothers suicide, he had everything going for him, smart, attractive, he was employed, studying at university, had a girlfriend , there was no closure, he left no note or anything, he was just gone. Iâ€™m half of what he was, and Iâ€™ve just lost all motivation to do anything with my life, my grades are shit, and I may have to repeat another year, thereâ€™s no hope for me of pursuing higher education, I work a shitty retail job, and I when Iâ€™m not working Iâ€™m shut away in my room completely emotionally numbed out on xanex or weed. Iâ€™ve become almost completely socially inept and have pushed away great friend group because of it, I still see their stories on snap of them having fun, partying, they still even occasionally invite me to hang with them, but I am so cowardly and socially retarded that I just make up some shitty excuse for not being able to, I know Iâ€™ll just be a drag to be around anyway. I just donâ€™t see a better life for myself, once my parents force me to move out in a year ill have to spend most of time working my minimum wage job to afford some shitty apartment, I donâ€™t think im strong enough troops handle living year after year of a bug like existence just for the possibility that everything might get better, I used to rarely think about suicide, but now it occupies my mind every single day, sometimes itâ€™s the only thing I can think about, and I feel like everything I ever do in the rest of my life will only lead me closer to it. I know Where my families rifle is, I could drive out to a logging road and end it.
