Staying alive just because other people would be hurt by your death is a miserable existenceI think it's selfish when you tell people that you have suicidal thoughts and they say, "But it would hurt me so much of you did that to yourself". Really? You're that self centered? That kind of person isn't worth staying alive for. If we're honest, that's why many of us continue to live. Yet these people are often the ones that caused us to feel this way. They're just selfish idiots. Of course, they will say bullshit like, "Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem", or, "Your life is a film so don't end it". If I am truly in control of my life, then logically it follows that I can choose when to end it. Mental illness typically isn't a temporary thing either.
