Every day is a curseThere is no reason to feel good about waking up every day. There is no reason to feel hopeful or to feel like my dailey efforts matter. There is no possible way to believe that things will change for the better and it is not possible to maintain a real sense that I am going to succeed or that everything is going to be alright.

Every day is nothing more than a curse. A cursed day where I must do things in a timely manner. A cursed day where I must invest in the next day. A cursed day where I must face other human beings once again. I cursed day where I must desperate attempt to provide myself with the skills necessary to provide monetary value to others. A cursed day where I must attend to duties and responsibilities to others. A cursed day where I must earn what I have without any room for escape. A cursed day where I must try to improve myself and make a plan. A day where I must exert my body and refrain from frivulous spending of resources in favor of the mere hope for a better future or at least the maintainence of a life I am not emotionally invested in.
