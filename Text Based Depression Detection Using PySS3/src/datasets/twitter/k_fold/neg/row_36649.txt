I want to dieMy life's been on a steady decline for the past 5 or so years.  I'm tired of fighting, and I just want it to be over.  There's the possibility of it improving, sure, but I know better than to get my hopes up.  I'm in love with one of my best friends, but she doesn't feel the same.  I'm okay with that fact, and I've been putting on a cheerful facade so she doesn't blame herself for my suffering.  She's honestly one of the main reasons I get out of bed anymore, but I just feel so alone.  I fear that no one will ever love me, and I fear that I will lose the strength within myself to pursue my happiness.  I have no real plans to commit suicide.  I know the impact it would have on my loved ones, and I'm afraid of my consciousness fading away, yet I still wish for death.  I know that I'm not in my right mind, and I'm sure as hell not going to act out impulsively and do something rash, but I can't stop thinking about it.  I don't expect anyone to actually care, but it's nice to vent.
