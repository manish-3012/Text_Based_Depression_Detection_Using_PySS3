ConfusedNot sure what the point of this Subreddit is. I have posted about life situations I have had going on and have tried to communicate with many others going through issues in their own lives.  Why fucking post and pretend to reach out without respomlnding to anyone.  I have made friendships with people just dripping off and then it hurts my heart.
