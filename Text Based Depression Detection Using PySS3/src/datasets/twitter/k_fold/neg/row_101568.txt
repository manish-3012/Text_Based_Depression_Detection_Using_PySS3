Absolutely dead insideEvery day is a challenge when it comes to dealing with my â€œmental healthâ€ but is it my brain chemistry or is life truly miserable? I sweat and bleed to earn 11/hour while my lesser male counter parts are paid more. I live pay check to pay check. Every time i get a financial break, some expense comes up, such as needing new tires or something. The constant struggle just to stay a float, for what? This is only one part of my life i find completely exhausting. I also live with my boyfriend who has no understanding of my suicidal tendencies, but he knows theyre there. He makes comments to make me feel stupid on a daily basis, it brings my self hate to a new level, sparking my anger issues, sometimes i spiral. He says sorry only for him to do it again. This time i didnt accept his apology and now heâ€™s pretending i dont exist. Yawning, listening to music, walking around our apartment like its all good but heâ€™s acting like Iâ€™m not even there. I am currently a puddle of disappointment, self hatred Iâ€™m emotionally exhausted. I have no one to turn to. Please help.
