Isolation and ADHD are truly going to kill me.I am so alone. There is no one; no one who listens. Friends, family, doctors, therapists, no one ever listens. The life that I live is unending trauma. I can't force myself to do anything without feeling like it, without an impulse to do it, that's it. It's that simple but no one listens.

They expect a future out of me, and so they project strength on to me and tell me "you can do it!!!" They see me doing things that they think are hard, and so they go "oh that's hard, you should be able to do these other things!"

Just because I'm able to do the bare minimum to ensure I don't starve to death, does not mean that I'm able to do anything else. I ***FEEL*** hunger. That is the impulse that makes me cook for myself. After several days, I'm able to smell myself. That is the impulse that makes me shower.

Don't get it into your head that anything is equal. I don't feel my grades slipping, my dishes piling up, the messy state of my room. I have to do mean things to myself to get the adrenaline to temporarily repair my neurotransmitter deficit, to accomplish those things. My best year in school was when I was cutting. Are you telling me to go back to that?

I am so desperate for a win. For something good in my life. I need something to live for. I do believe that I may genuinely be at risk, but honestly, why should I bother saving myself? What fucking good is there? What do I have to live for?
