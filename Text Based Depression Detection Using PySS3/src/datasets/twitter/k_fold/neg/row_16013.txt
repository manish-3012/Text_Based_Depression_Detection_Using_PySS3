About to lose it.I know this sounds dumb and cliche but I broke up with my boyfriend and now I'm starting to freak out. We were engaged and living together and I left and slept with someone else almost right away. My boyfriend was abusive. Both emotionally and physically and while I know he had no intention of changing his ways, I just feel really guilty. I slept with someone else to try and get my mind off him and now I feel worse than I did before. I shouldn't though because I am not planning on going back, right? Because I do have no intention of going back it's just that abusive people have a way of making you feel like it's all your fault. Everything. I'm so overwhelmed I need help.
