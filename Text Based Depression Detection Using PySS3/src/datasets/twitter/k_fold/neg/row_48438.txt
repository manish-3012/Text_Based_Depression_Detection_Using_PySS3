Spreading the LoveI would kill myself if I wouldn't land in Hell for being gay. I have a great bf and we're planning on getting married soon. Part of me thinks I'm making a decent attempt at a good life, the other part of me wants to never to commit to anyone and be a really miserable person until I die. That way I can make other people as miserable as I am while I'm on earth.
