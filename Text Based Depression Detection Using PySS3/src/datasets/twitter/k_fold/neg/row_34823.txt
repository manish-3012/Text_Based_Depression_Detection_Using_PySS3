Iâ€™m trans, ugly, and pointless and alone and have no future so why liveIâ€™m a 34 year old trans woman, Iâ€™m ugly af and no one wants me. Iâ€™m just some freak to be made fun of or pursued by 65 year old fetishists it seems.

At the beginning of the year I met someone and we had an amazing relationship and plans for the future - thought life was finally going to be okay and then she decided to dump me out of nowhere to go do porn with some other trans chick who passes and i canâ€™t compete with.

So thatâ€™s all I am, is something to use and throw away.  Iâ€™m getting too old to find anyone again even if the world wasnâ€™t ending and people magically wanted to date trans people and treat us like human beings all of a sudden.

I give up.  Thereâ€™s just no point.  No one is ever going to care about me.  Iâ€™m sick of being alone.  Now Iâ€™m just a few years away from being old and things get even worse from there.

I should just kill myself.  This life is empty and I have no place I belong in it
