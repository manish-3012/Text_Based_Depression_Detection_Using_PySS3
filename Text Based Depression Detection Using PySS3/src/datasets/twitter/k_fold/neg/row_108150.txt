I'm feeling so hopeless rn that I can't even explain itI don't even know why I'm writing this rn. Because everything seems to be so worthless and pointless. I have a lot of stress about school rn and I feel like I'm breaking down inside of me. Like the only thing that keeps me going is to know that when it's end of the day and I can finally close my eyes and fall asleep.I hate the fact that I'm always crying about things that are so unnecessary or when it's not even about me, it's just so stupid. I would rather shut my eyes forever and never wake up again than to go to this terrible place ever again. And btw I'm dealing with social anxiety and depression, that's why everything is so hard for me. Idk if anyone will ever read this here bec it's seems so unbelievable lol
