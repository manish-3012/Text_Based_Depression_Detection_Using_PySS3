Iâ€™m really scared I want to dieI just want to die nothing feels real anymore. I feel like Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I tried weed a few days ago and since then nothing feels real itâ€™s like my soul has left my body and Iâ€™m so scared. I tried to speak to people about it but they donâ€™t care I just want this to stop. What do I do I feel like the only way to stop this is to die
