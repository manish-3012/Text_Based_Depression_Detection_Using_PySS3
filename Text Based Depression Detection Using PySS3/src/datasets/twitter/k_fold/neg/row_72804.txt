I hate myselfIâ€™ve just become the ridicule of everyone at my school. Every time I try to do something serious, my friends laugh at it or mock it. I used to hand out with them, now they exclude me from their hang outs. My privileges are slipping away because I used to work at a concessions stand at my school but because of an incident I no longer work there. Every time I hear someone mention it, I want to punch something. Iâ€™m thinking about a head on collision to end it all. I just canâ€™t go living like this
