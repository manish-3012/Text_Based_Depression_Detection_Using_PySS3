About 5-6 hours left now. I'm scared and I'd really love to talk to someone.What the title says. My plan is for some time between 12:30pm and 1:30pm EST. I've done enough research to be almost certain that it will work, which is both reassuring and a little bit scary. This really is it, which is what I wanted but it's also a really eery feeling to know that these are my last few hours. I don't know how to act. What do I say to my boyfriend when he leaves for work? Should I text my best friend, or not tell her what I'm doing? I still haven't decided whether or not I'm going to leave a note, but I'm leaning on the side of not. I'm feeling so much right now. Most of all, I'm so, so excited to know that I'll be out of pain soon.

If anyone feels like talking before I CTB, that'd be nice. I don't want to spend the last while alone but also don't want to cause anyone I love the pain of knowing I'm going to do it and not being able to stop me. I could use a friend.
