Open question. What exactly gets better?Hi,

Iâ€™ve been a lurker here for a while, and I can identify with a lot of the people who have posted in this sub. Iâ€™m constantly wrestling with thoughts of suicide. The only respite is sleep, which I now do for as long as possible. The first seconds of waking up are agonising. The realisation that Iâ€™m still here and have to endure another day is becoming unbearable. I continue existing as to not pass on this suffering to my mother. Thatâ€™s it. 

Iâ€™ve read a lot of responses to post from people that generally follow the same themes: â€œpermanent solution to a temporary problemâ€,
â€œThings will get betterâ€ etc. 

But... what exactly gets better? How? When?

If anybody can provide something tangible to hold on to Iâ€™d appreciate it. Right now everything I do seems to make things worse. Completely fucked my life up. Debt. No job. Friends are all long gone. Completely isolated. 

The thought of getting back into some dead end job that will bring in just enough to pay bills is more depressing than the thought of checking out. 

Anyway, just hoping to hear if anybody has actually come out the other side and how you got there.
