Just ordered a new razorThe kitchen knife I planned to use was too dull so I ordered a new razor. Tried to OD the night before last but passed out before I could take everything I meant to. Was drinking a lot yesterday and planning to cut an artery or two when my sister fell asleep, but again passed out from alcohol before I could actually do anything. Today I tried to cut with some kitchen knives but after sawing away for a few minutes I hadnâ€™t even broke the skin. So I ordered a new razor, it should be here in a bit under a week, then Iâ€™ll probably wait till after Christmas. So yeah, guess Iâ€™ll post again to say goodbye in a week and a half or so.
