Feeling like you don't belong anywhereFirst time using reddit because I'm unsure how to go about the things I feel. I've always struggled with the idea of death. I'm 30 now and its always plagued me. I've tried hanging myself when I was 10 years old but stopped myself because the idea of death scares me. Sometimes I love life and other times I dont want to even leave my house. Suicidal thoughts is something i constantly think of especially in trying times. I know these things arent normal but i cant help and i wish i never would bring myself to those thoughts. Recently I lost a brother in law and its been really, really tough because he was murdered and circumstances have been really sketchy. Life has just become really difficult to get thru and i dont want it to be, but every positive idea or moment I have, its like I have this overshadowing negative energy over me.  I guess my question is, because i feel like i already know what a therapist would tell me, how can I work through these issues or do i need more?
