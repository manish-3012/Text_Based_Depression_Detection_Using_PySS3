Friend beat me to it - not sure whether I am more sad or more jealousJust got a phone call from his sister to let me know.  K was a paramedic, no, not just a paramedic, a bloody good paramedic.  He was funny and kind and would help anyone.  

Apparently there had been some problems at work (his sister did tell me about it but she was kind of muddled which is understandable).  

K retained left over opiates from patients who didn't need the full dose and injected himself.  He was only found because he didn't turn up for shift yesterday.

I don't have that many friends that I can afford to lose one.  

On the other hand, I guess it's one less person that I will disappoint when I die.

Godspeed K.  I love you.
