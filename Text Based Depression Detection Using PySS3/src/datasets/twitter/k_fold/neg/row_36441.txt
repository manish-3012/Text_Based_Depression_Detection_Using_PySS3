Hah, my life is cursed.It's weird looking at my life, looking at how young I am, and how fucked up things already are. And part of me says that it won't get much worse, but I don't think I can know that. 

I guess I can't see my life being normal. I want it, but I don't know what a normal life looks like.
Ugh.
