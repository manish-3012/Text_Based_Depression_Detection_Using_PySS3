I want to meet my daughterMy daughter would have been born by now, but my girlfriend miscarried early this year. We had been having unprotected sex almost since the beginning of our relationship, not intentionally trying for it but it was something we both wanted - it felt like it was never going to happen. Early this year, she found out she was pregnant. We told our families, and within a few days she was bleeding heavily and found out she had miscarried. She took it hard initially and I was just eager to try again, it didn't weigh me down at the time.

Fast forward to a month ago, and we've broken up. Two days ago I do a delivery to a place and they left a note not to ring the doorbell as they have a baby sleeping. Well something clicked and for the first time I felt like my daughter was truly gone, that if me and the girlfriend had broken up then there was no real daughter anymore and she'll just be lost in time. But then, I got the thought in my head that maybe if I died I could meet her. I'm not religious, but this thought won't go away.

All I can think about is driving my car into a lake so that my family or nobody I know will have to find me. I just want to be gone. My girlfriend refuses to talk to me at all now. I don't want to tell her I'm suicidal because I don't want her to have that guilt, but I'd be lying if I said I don't think about maybe she would get back with me. I've never loved anyone as intensely as her and I don't know if I want to again knowing it's not her. I want her, I want my daughter but I don't think I'm going to have either one.
