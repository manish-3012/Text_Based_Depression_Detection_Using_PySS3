I've had it. No more.I'm sick of it. I'm sick of life. I'm sick of me. I'm just done my life is completely fucked it's a mess and so am I. I don't want to repeat myself too much so in summary: bullies, insults from random strangers, social anxiety, social awkwardness, depression, no money, no therapy, no friends, family members don't want to hear it, unhelpful advice, financial problems, can't find a job, failing grades and that's about all I'm going to list. I've tried to keep myself alive and improve things but nothing has worked, and I've really reached my breaking point today. So many problems that I have no idea how to fix or have so far failed to fix and no one wants to help, they just prefer to leave or just tell me it's my fault and that's about all the advice I get. I feel like a piece of lead. I cannot take it anymore. I'm not fit to live in this world I can't anymore. I feel like I'm burdening everyone else with my existence. It would explain why I always get bullied within the first week of school. I'm scared of dying, but at this point, I think death is better than constant, unbearable pain.
