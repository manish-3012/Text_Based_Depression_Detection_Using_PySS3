I just want to be told I did the right thing.I checked myself into the emergency room yesterday because I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be able to pull myself back from the edge on my own again. It was incredibly difficult for me to do. I still feel so ashamed and vulnerable. My friend had to drive me there and miss work for several minutes to do so because I lost my keys, and Iâ€™m so grateful to him, but Iâ€™m scared that heâ€™s exhausted from having to listen to me so often these past few weeks. Iâ€™m afraid when he reassures me Iâ€™m not a burden that heâ€™s just lying so I donâ€™t kill myself. 

My family is making it about themselves and I feel so raw and naked from taking the steps I did and Iâ€™m terrified that I did the wrong thing. Im having a hard time stopping myself from thinking I should have just not said anything about the danger I was in and gone through with it. 

Iâ€™m so scared that Iâ€™ve fucked up everything for myself by trying to get help and I know itâ€™s not rational but I canâ€™t stop myself from feeling that way. 

Nobody seems to understand how hard it was to make that decision to live. I did it for them, I did it so they wouldnâ€™t *have* to deal with the grief of losing me. So many people have been treating me like a cornered animal and the worst part is that theyâ€™re probably right to. I feel so shaky and so alone.
