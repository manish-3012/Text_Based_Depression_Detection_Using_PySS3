"Suicide is the easy way out"No, it most definitely is not... It is not always easy to pull the trigger or swallow the pills. The cowardly thing to do is wait for death to come to you. After life has ravaged your body and mental health. The brave thing to do is admit you aren't meant for this world, stand up, and punch death in the dick. Screaming "I go on my terms, not yours!" I am that guy. I don't fear death and I will go out on my terms. I will not die in an old decrepit meat suit in some nursing home... I'm going while I'm still sorta young. I'll never be an old man in anyone's memories, and that, to me, means something.
