I don't know what to do.I'm feeling so suicidal. My love life's a mess, my life is a mess. I feel like I have no one to turn to and I'm trapped in my own head, I feel like I can't express to my own partner and she just hates me and picks at everything I say. I want to die so bad and I'm so tired of experiencing anything anymore. Day by day I'm just getting closer and closer go ending it all. I tried expressing it to my partner and some how it ended in her storming off. I really just don't know what to do anymore. I want to die so bad.
