Does anyone else wish they had a disease?Every day, I wish I had inoperable cancer or another terminal illness because of the stigma from suicide. Suicides cause loved ones to constantly blame themselves and think the death was their fault, and everything they think they did wrong just adds on to that list of false wrongdoings. With a disease, that would make it so much better for me. No one can really put the blame on themselves when someone gets cancer so they wouldn't get mad at themselves. I'm not saying they would stop blaming themselves altogether, It's just that it'd be a lot less. And that's all I want. I just don't want people to blame themselves over my pathetic self dying soon and making my family blame themselves for my death that I've wanted for many years. I wish I can "take" someone else's illness and make it my own and cure them, the people that still want to live, the people that are in crippling debt for health treatment, I just don't think life is fair. Why give people who want to live terrifying diseases and just leave pieces of shit failures like me alive and well?

Life is cruel
