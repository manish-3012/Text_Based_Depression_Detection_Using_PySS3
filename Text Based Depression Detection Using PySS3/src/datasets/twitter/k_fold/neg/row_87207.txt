To Die or Not To DieNot, is the obvious answer

and yet, it's all I can think about

Self harm and suicidal thoughts is such a familiarity to me, it's here and it won't go away 

I want to die but I don't want to kill myself

I want to self harm but I don't

it's confusing and everything all reverts back to one person, one relationship years ago
I hate the power someone still can have over me
And I don't want to still love you but I do

And here I am, venting and ranting on a station to people who I don't even know

I just want the pain to go away
I don't want to feel 
But I don't want to be numb anymore 
I just don't want to be like this

The pills aren't helping anymore and neither is talking, cutting is all I can think about
