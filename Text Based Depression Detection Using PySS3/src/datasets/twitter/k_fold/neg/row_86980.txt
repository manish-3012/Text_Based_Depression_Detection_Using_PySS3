I'm so fucking angry.Fuck people.

Dont EVER trust a fucking soul. God I hate this place. Cold and ruthless and unforgiving. FUCK LIVING. 

FUCK existence. I dont even want a heaven-ish afterlife. I hope there is absolutely nothing but blackness when I'm dead. No memory or anything.

Living is not on your side. Life is the sole cause of all this misery. 

Fuck life

Feel like im already dead anyway.
