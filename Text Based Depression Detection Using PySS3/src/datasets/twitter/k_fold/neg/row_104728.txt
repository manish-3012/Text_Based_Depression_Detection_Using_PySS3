I hate myself so muchI cant seem to do right. I cant seem to succeed in anything. I just cant stop crying and thinking these thoughts. My heart hurts. Im so broken. I wanna be better but i feel so stuck. Im so fucking broken. I feel like shit. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. But i have to keep pushing ? And i have to be alive? And if i give up itâ€™s considered selfish. and if i dont wanna be in pain anymore itâ€™s considered horrible. And if i want a way out im considered a monster.but i guess itâ€™s true. just dont fucking make me suffer because of your disappointment in me. cause i already feel like shit for it. everyone gave up on me probably. im just so hurt by this loneliness that comes with it too. i cant stop hurting.
