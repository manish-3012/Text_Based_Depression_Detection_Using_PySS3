Struggling to find purposeHi all. I know I was here a few days ago but I don't have anyone to talk to and I don't know what to do. I feel like my future is clustered and I am not sure if I can do a good job of living up to my parent's expectations living a decent life. 

I'm afraid to tell anyone because I'm afraid I will drive them away. I've lost friendships before. 

I feel like there is no hope and I want to kill myself. I don't know why I feel like this. I don't know how to fix the relationship.
