Dont feel so goodI've tried suicide about 9 times now, in different ways, and I'm currently 14. I have a severe nut allergy so I always try to eat them. I wish I was born male, being transsexual sucks. I'm starting to have trouble feeling emotions, but I'm not entirely emotionally numb yet. I wish my parents liked me. I wish someone cared for me. Sorry for the vent.
