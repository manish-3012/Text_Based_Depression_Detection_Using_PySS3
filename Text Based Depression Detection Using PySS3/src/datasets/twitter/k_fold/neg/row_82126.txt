I live in a shitty country and I'm soooo frustratedI don't even feel like writing and posting because I've lost hope in everything........ I'm 25 years old living in a shitty country where I can't find communities and real like-minded friends. There's not even a single decent library, no festivals, no real concerts... nothing.... I'm a fucking virgin and this bothers me alot because I desperately want to have sex and feel love and companionship....... I'm dependant on my parents, not a single penny from my own because there are no jobs... everywhere are corruption, sanctions, fucking valueless money, inflation, etc etc.
I just dont' know what to do anymore.............. I think I'm lying to myself about a better future that I still don't kill myself.
