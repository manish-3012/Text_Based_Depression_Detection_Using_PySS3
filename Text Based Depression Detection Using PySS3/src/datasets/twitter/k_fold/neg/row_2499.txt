Ever just feel stuck?I've been thinking about this the past few days and its occurred to me more and more often. I've been feeling suicidal on and off since 13, I turn 17 in November. It just recently all came back to me and I've sat here and just thought. Right. What do I do? People have noticed something was up and yeah, there was. I told them all there was and what not. I just felt stuck, I have constantly ranted to people about this sort of stuff and I suppose I'm sick of having to rely on someone. I don't know. I keep telling myself it could be worse but again, I just feel stuck. I really want to feel like I have a friend, one that talks to me consistently and enjoys being around me. Everyone is way too busy nowadays, I suppose I can't complain. I don't know. This was sort of a rant, I just wanna see if anyone can relate at all.
