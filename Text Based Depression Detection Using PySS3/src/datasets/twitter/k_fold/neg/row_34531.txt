I don't know anymoreI dont know why i living anymore. I feel like a sinner and i cant be forgiven. I dont deserve the life I've been given. I'm 18 years old and im a porn addict i cant stop it. At one point my life i had gay sex with my cousin brother. I've ruined his life i feel like i shouldn't be alive he forced it on to me. I jerk off to my cousin sisters sometime and i feel like a pathetic losser I can't forget how much of a losser i really am. I am really dumb and fell like can't grown anymore. I dont understand if life is supposed to be meaningful to people or even myself but i feel like I don't deserve this life. I am just a hopeless dumb pathetic losser who can't get out of my addiction. My fiest encounter with it was in 3rd grade and here i am now 18 years old as i see everyone be better that me while i am just a failure. I think this world will be a better place if i just left besides i am a sinner who is worthless. I think I'm gonna kill myself..... I don't know what to do ppease helpj
