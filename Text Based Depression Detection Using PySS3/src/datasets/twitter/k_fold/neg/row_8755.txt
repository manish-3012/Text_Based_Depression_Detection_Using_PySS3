Going to jump off a bridge tomorrow morningI tired to join the US Navy last year and failed at it and got sent home from basic training , My family hates me and torments me everyday and they call me a disgrace and say a 19 year old should not be living at home with his parents, I cant get a job anywhere.... I cant even get a interview at McDonald's or Walmart and people call me lazy because I do not have a job when i am trying to get one. I have no friends to hang out or do stuff with... my life consists of sitting on this computer all day and playing games or talking to people online in a desperate attempt to have some form of human interaction. I do not have a car or a drivers licence.... I am going to community college and studying Computer science but... I am looking at at least three years to get my associates which is longer then anyone else and i want to transfer to a university but i know for a fact i do not have the money to do that... and even if i did.... I am stupid... I am horrible at math which means i have to take extra math courses, Hence why its talking me longer then everyone else to get my degree. The girl I am in love with loves someone else and only texts me when shes having a hard time and wants me to fix it..... I am going out tomorrow to walk around the city and try to find a high enough point like a building or a bridge where if i jump I can land on grass or water because i do not want to land on cement or rocks... I posted a few months ago but did not get a lot of reply's before my post go buried and i ended up talking myself out of it but everyday is like torture... just wanted to leave some record of why i did it even though no one knows me on here...
