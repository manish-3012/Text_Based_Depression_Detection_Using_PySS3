Multiple plastic bags ...Is it possible to be "successful" if you use 3 garbage bags, tightly bound, each with its own binding or tape, so that IF you tear the first bag, you might not tear the second before becoming unconscious?

Also, can getting REALLY DRUNK first help with this?

What about adding in some sleeping pills, plus alcohol, plus 3 bags - and wait to "bag" until near the point of passing out from the alcohol and pills?
