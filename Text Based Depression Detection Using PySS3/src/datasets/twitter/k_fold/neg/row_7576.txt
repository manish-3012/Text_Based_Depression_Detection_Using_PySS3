how do you feel happy again?How do you do it, whats the secret code?

Taking a hot bath looking at the spring sun didnt take those suicidal thoughts away.

Finishing my to-do list made me cry.

Going out to take a walk made me have a panic attack.

Getting accepted in college didnt make me look forward in life.

what the fuck am I missing, what the fuck am I doing wrong, why cant I stop crying every day, I just want to get rolled over by a car I just want to off me all the time
