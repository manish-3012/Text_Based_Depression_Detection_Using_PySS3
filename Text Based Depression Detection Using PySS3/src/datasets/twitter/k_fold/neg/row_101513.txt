I hate my life ( WARNING: CONTAINS A LOT OF BAD WORDS )Everyday is nothing. My two ugly brothers, my angry dad, and my dumbass mom. Me? A girl who wants to have an awesome life. Why am I even nice? Why do I try? Am I trying to make everyone happy? Who gives a shit. I don't want to be nice anymore. Everyone who is mean are the ones who has so many friends and they are beautiful. I'm just an ugly thing. My brother is a huge hypocrite. Fuck this. Fuck this life. Don't even say, "Everything will be alright!" Or, "Get some help!" That won't fucking work. Those are just some useless words. Why should I even get help? Fuck it. Too bad I can't kill myself because I'm too scared. I lost hope. Fuck you god. Fuck you. God, you never help. Why send people who kill themself to hell if you never helped? Patience sucks like fuck. Life is too stressful and 
depressing. I hate you god. Just because I have some friends doesn't mean that will make me all happy.
