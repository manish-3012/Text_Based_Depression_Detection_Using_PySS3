What is so frightening about death?When I think about it, suicide is what I mostly think about. Yet the only reason I don't is because I care about family and 1 or 2 friends that I have left. Does anyone just get to the point in their lives where its just too late to fix shit and make something of themselves?

Too be honest I hate myself I was a prick jock at school I never gave shit because I always felt sorry for people that were picked on. But now that I look back on it all, I can only think I deserve this. My leg is so fcked I can't run anymore and do sport like I always loved. I lost most of most of my 'true' friends by hanging out with wannabes. 

5 years on I live with my parents, Im not even on unemployment because I feel too ashamed too. I sit in my room and avoid the outside world. And the only reason I haven't ended it is because the only way I see it happening is in a shoot out so avoid killing myself or just putting a gun too my head. Yet I wouldn't even be able to get a gun.

I live silently alone and in the dark with the occasional moment where I say whats on my mind (eg now) I just want it too end...
