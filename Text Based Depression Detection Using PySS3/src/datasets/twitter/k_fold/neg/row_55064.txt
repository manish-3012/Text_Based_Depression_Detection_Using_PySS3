i feel like giving upi dont know how i want to kill myself but i want to be gone.  my whole life is waste. just people hurting me from the the moment i was born.  now everyones mad at me for not turning out better than what i was born into. of fucking course. only the strongest people can do that and turn into gurus or celebrities.  im not. im just a less than average person.  no one wants me to live. people want me to not die, because it would be massively inconvenient, but i dont make anyone happier. i don't add quality to anyones lives. i just help out with tasks from time to time.

whats the point.  i dont want to live for myself, alone.  it's not worth it to me.  i'd rather die, honestly, if no one loves me.
