Here I am againIâ€™m losing hope.

I was diagnosed as bipolar-NOS a few months ago, taken off Paxil after 5 years (it was causing cycothymia), and put on mood stabilizers that ended me up in the ER. Iâ€™m also a drug addict, although I recently started going to NA and Iâ€™ve been clean for 10 days now.

Iâ€™m messed up from a car accident a year ago, and got laid off a few weeks after the accident with like 100 others. I got hooked on meds, and pot, and now Iâ€™m finally off everything and reality is crashing down around me. I tried to find work but the stress and drugs fucked me up too much to be able to get anything done, and I was just simply in a lot of pain. I had to give up my apartment in LA and move back home to the OC, only to get kicked out in the middle of my withdrawals by my insane Mother who is mentally unstable and an alcoholic and a drug addict herself. I spent a month couch hopping lost like 10lbs, and nearly died because I revealed to her what I knew about her past and just how crazy she is. For you see she lives in a delusional paranoid universe where sheâ€™s god, and no matter how insane she is no one is allowed to question her. Oh, and only her past matters, and everyone else is scum including her own children who are fucked up because of her and all the fucked things she did to them her entire life. We should all probably be put in a mental hospital. My little brother is a drug and gambling addict, my Sister suffers from some form of mental disease but refuses to see doctors or treatment (same for my Mother), and Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with everything from abandonment issues, IBS, to bipolar NOS, to depression, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, ADHD, and a bunch of other acronyms. 

I finally came home when my Mom was out of town for 3 weeks getting fucked up in another country. She came back and all hell has broken loose. She just served me with a 30 days notice to move out, meanwhile I canâ€™t even afford food. Iâ€™m on unemployment but they stopped paying me 2 weeks ago for some phone interview scheduled on the 22nd, and if they decide to give me my money it will take a week to get a check. Iâ€™ve called a dozen times to try and get the interview moved up but its always an answering machine. Iâ€™ve sold pretty much all of my possessions but the essentials to buy food, and gas so I can go to my NA meetings. If I canâ€™t come up with $260 by the 19th they are shutting off my phone. Iâ€™m about $4000 in debt from medical bills even though I have had insurance, which is about to go away when I turn 23 next month so Iâ€™m not going to be able to see my new psychologist who has been helping me.

Even when I get my check, if I do get it, Iâ€™ll have so many late bills to pay I wont get to keep any of the money if I want to keep my car, and have insurance, and turn my phone back on. So using the money to pay for a room for rent is useless if I wont have a car, or a phone anymore.

I really donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve tried looking for jobs, but canâ€™t find anyone hiring for anything I can actually do given my physical limitations (I have a bad knee, and neck / back plus need access to a bathroom at all times because of my IBS). I had to drop out of school because of my health and when I did work I was able to do so because of the antidepressants which I can't take anymore and I had a computer job with access to a bathroom, but the kind of job I had doesnâ€™t really exist in this economy anymore.

Honestly, I don't see what hope there is for me.
