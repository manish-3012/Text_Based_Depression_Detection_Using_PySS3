theyâ€™re rightiâ€™ve been called out several times in both public and private over this.

iâ€™m an evil, abusive monster. all i really want is to make people happy but i do the opposite. iâ€™m a mean piece of shit who hurts everyone.

â€œget a therapist, get a therapistâ€

iâ€™ve been in and out of therapy for a cumulative of 12 years. itâ€™s never done anything at all for me other than make me both feel and act worse.

iâ€™m afraid to tell anyone how i feel anymore because iâ€™ve been told so many times iâ€™m manipulating people. that iâ€™m using suicide threats to get my way.

i truly wish it was that simple. i would love to be lying, actually. but every day i wake up and wish i hadnâ€™t. every day i try to concoct some new way to end it all.

but why am i hesitating? i should have died ten years ago.
