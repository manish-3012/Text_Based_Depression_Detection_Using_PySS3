I feel like I'm being pushedI feel like everyone around me is daring me to commit. I live in a care home with 3 other kids. They are constantly loud and annoying (I have a massive physiological problem with sound) and when I tell the staff they rub it in more, then make more sound themselves. They know I'm depressed and still take me as a joke. My mental state is getting worse, I am hallucinating and cutting myself, the kids at my care home keep me up all night and stop me from sleeping, they know what they are doing. Everyone I talk to finds a way to rub it in more, I have turned to drugs and any way to get high, I am getting closer to suicide every day.
