I fucking suck at everything i doYears ago thatâ€™s what my ex girlfriend said to me. Idc about her but sheâ€™s right. I literally suck at everything. I have no talents no skills Iâ€™m basically useless. What hurts me is i try to good but everything i do is wrong and Iâ€™m always criticized. Itâ€™s worse when i think i do a good job and someone basically tells me i fucked up. Allowing myself to be proud only to get shot down is fucking painful. Iâ€™m just blabbering here...this post is fucking stupid just like me.
