How to ask someone if they're suicidal even though they already admitted it to someone else?I'm planing to ask my friend tomorrow if he feels suicidal because he has been showing signs of wanting to give up and has confessed that he's planning to kill himself later in the year to another close friend. However none of my friends want to ask him because they believe that he'll get angry and shut us off, but I don't care if he gets mad at me. So I want to find out the truth if he really does feel suicidal and encourage him to seek help but he always says that he's fine when he clearly isn't. Can someone offer any advice on how to approach this question?
