Feeling like suicide is the only way out of college stressI posted here before about university being a tough thing. Iâ€™m in year 2 now and I just had my first lecture. I have so much stuff to do and itâ€™s x4 since thatâ€™s how many modules Iâ€™m doing this semester. 

I am a lazy student I never read books in year one only to reference but I never actually read a book. This year the professors want us to read a book a week and talk about it in class and if it isnâ€™t already bad enough, I have to watch films because thatâ€™s what my course is about. Not your typical films but black and white complex movies that I have to dissect.

When prof asked us the ideology behind this film we watched today, everyone had an answer except me. I couldnâ€™t even do a simple task of simplifying the learning outcomes. Also everyone in that class is so much smarter than me and I just donâ€™t feel comfortable at all.

Iâ€™m starting to think ending it is the only way out. I donâ€™t think anything can help me now. My parents want me to get a degree, I already dropped out of my first degree and student finance says if I drop out again, not only will they never allow me to ask for funds but they will harass me until Iâ€™ve paid back all the money.

Thereâ€™s nothing I can do except end it or running away. I donâ€™t know what else to do.
