Stuck in a battle of the mind.    Iâ€™ve been holding on because I truly believe â€œDonâ€™t make a permanent decision based off a temporary feeling.â€ But this temporary feeling is definitely permanent and it has been ever since I was a child. Even through happy moments, I understand the happiness at that moment and Iâ€™m truly grateful to be experiencing it.  But my mind keeps thinking of the best way to end it and how everything will be better once my physical body has expired. 
Iâ€™m still here coasting. Will power is an amazing thing because every day that goes by, it seems that the urge of dying gets so much greater. I hang around because love is the only thing that makes sense. I love the people in my life and the people that are not. I love everything in existence, I know itâ€™s all apart of me, somehow connected. Day to day I do what I have to do as a person in this world. I do it knowing itâ€™s not about me, itâ€™s about something much greater, my kids. I feel guilty for bringing them in this world because of my own selfish reasons. I realize that reality is subjective and they wonâ€™t necessarily have the mental issues as me, but  genetics are real and it makes me full of sorrow knowing that pain thatâ€™s out there and that I, in a way created these people that can and will see pain. 
Iâ€™m able to show people the positive in everything. I do this everyday with a smile on my face. It makes me feel better about myself when Iâ€™m able to help or make someone laugh. But after every interaction, Iâ€™m still the same inside. Empty &amp; alone. Incomplete from something that Iâ€™m still completely unclear of. 
Iâ€™m writing this not to alarm you. I just want to be honest about who I am and whatâ€™s going on with me. Iâ€™ve decided to keep on going with this thing called life even though I donâ€™t want to. Itâ€™s just one of me and a lot more of family and friends that want me here so you all win. 
I love you and I always will. Thank you for everything, especially being in my life. I havenâ€™t tried being 100% upfront about the this so Iâ€™m hoping this will help me accept and move forward from this stage of my life.  Thank you for reading.
