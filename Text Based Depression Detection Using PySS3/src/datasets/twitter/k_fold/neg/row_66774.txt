I just want it all to stopI'm just a financial drain on my parents, I'm too fucking stupid to ever get into med school so when I graduate I'll just have a useless fucking degree. I'm just waiting until the day when I'll have the opportunity to blow my brains out. My family won't have to help me pay my rent and tuition anymore once I'm dead, my dad will be happy cuz he thinks I'm a fucking failure and he's right, I've never anything right in my pathetic fucking life. He's calling me again to say what a financial liability I am, I'm fucking sorry I didn't ask to be born, give me a goddamn gun and I'll fix the problem myself. We're all gonna die eventually anyways and once that happens it doesn't matter if you were a success or failure in life or if you lived to be 10 or 100 years old. I always feel like a piece of shit anyways. Wish I could do it now, but I'll be damned if I fail at this too, gotta get a gun to do it the right way
