i can't take it anymore, i did all the things they said to do and nothing is workingit's been over 20 years of unbelievable pain. i just want it over but i'm too scared. i don't want my roommate to find my body, it would kill my father if i followed through, my brothers too. I can't make the pain go away.

i've failed every drug. every single one. I've read all the self help books and did all the things they said to do. and to make sure i was consistent, i made habit trackers. 130 days of repetitive actions and feeling nothing in my heart. why am i still here? why won't this stop? i'm doing all the things. it has to get better cause i can't take this anymore.
