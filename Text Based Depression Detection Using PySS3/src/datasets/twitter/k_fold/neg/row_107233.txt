Going to be a long day :(With a psychiatrist, I've been trying a new antidepressant and weaning off my high dose of another. Idk if its related....
But I feel horrible today..I barely slept last night, I'm at work but I want to just leave and never be seen alive again.
I could scream and nobody would hear me. I feel like an alien and idk if it's because everybody makes me feel like one or if nobody likes me because I act like one. But whatever it doesnt matter cause it wont change anything
