Im lost,help me pleaseMy story started with an  stomach problem (that doctors cant find a cure by the way)and that made  me drop highschool when i was 16, then i became an hermit. Now here i am a 22 manchild who doesn't know how to work as a  functional human being,still acting like a dumbass kid because never learned.....well nothing an young adult or adult , dont have education,no discipline,no sex,no friends,family thinks i am a loser and probably wish that i just killed myself to stop be an burden,and well i became pmo junkie to numb myself,to try to put away my mind from thinking how much of a waste of air i am. I cant remember the last the time i had any joy in this garbage life.Then i heard of this nofap that could help with discipline,but its not easy especially trying to get rid of the only thing that makes you feel good,even though it comes with a couple spoons of: Shame,regret and humiliation.O man how i wish to have a time machine to be a kid again,i guess is too late,but i will probably   keep trying trying to better myself until my hope runs out and it feels like i am almost empty.What should i do?
