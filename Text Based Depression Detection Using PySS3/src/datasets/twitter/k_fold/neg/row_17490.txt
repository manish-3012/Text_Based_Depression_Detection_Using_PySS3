Reached a breaking point...Past week Iâ€™ve been having Suicidal thoughts. Nothing seems to be going right in my life, everything is falling apart and I donâ€™t know how to cope. Jus want to drive my car off a cliff tonight but donâ€™t want my family to be sad. Sigh gonna quote Tupac here â€œDeath gotta be easy, cuz life is hard.â€
