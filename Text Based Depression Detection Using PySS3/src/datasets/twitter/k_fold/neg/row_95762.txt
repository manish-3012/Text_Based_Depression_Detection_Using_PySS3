How to suicide without hurting the ones that love you?I'm going to explain what's going on and keep this short because I don't want to be an attention whore. That's all I've been called every time I talk about me suiciding. I've been in a relationship for a year with a girl who I fell deeply in love with. Few weeks ago, she said that she had been using me and left. I've been so weak for the past weeks and I don't feel like doing anything anymore. I want to suicide, but I don't want to hurt my mom or anyone else.
