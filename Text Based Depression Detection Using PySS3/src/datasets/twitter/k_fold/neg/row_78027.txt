Not sure if this is allowed but Iâ€™m here if anyone wants to talkIâ€™m 33/female and Iâ€™m not gonna give you corny lines like it gets better. Life fucking sucks yo. Lol. And I hate cops so Iâ€™m not trying to pull any shady shit either. I just know how it feels. And Iâ€™m in a dark place right now and I know the only thing thatâ€™s gonna help me feel better is helping someone else feel better. Some people made me feel like absolute shit today when I did nothing wrong. Kicked me while I was in my lowest point. I want to die, but Iâ€™m not going to kill myself. 

On another note - WHY does the phone autocorrect it to milk myself ðŸ˜… 

Anyway. Iâ€™m gonna be online a little while longer tonight. If anyone wants someone to just listen, Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™m not biased. Not religious. Just an unemployed girl whoâ€™s alone. With a dog. If I donâ€™t answer, Iâ€™ll be back online in the morning. I am here for you.
