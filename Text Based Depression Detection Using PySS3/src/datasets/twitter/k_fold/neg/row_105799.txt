I fucked up bigtime. This actually started 2 months ago. I started dating my current girlfriend around then. I have a problem with meth. I could stay away from it for a long time but I end up doing it at least once a month even though I really fucking hate the stuff. When she first asked me out I told her that I was a recovering addict and asked if she had a problem with it. She said no but that I should stay away from it for her. I felt like maybe this girl would be able to help me finally quit for good. Of course in these 2 months of dating her though I ended up getting high. She noticed every time. Last night she told me that somebody sold her some the day before and that she got high. I could tell she was coming down...I kind of feel like killing myself now. I feel like I ruined her life. I know meth ruined mine. Her best friend is some 15 year old girl too. If her best friend ends up getting curious about it and ends up doing it I know that it's gonna be all my fault. I told her not to tell her best friend because she's young and impressionable and fucking meth dealers will sell to almost ANYBODY. I think if that does happen I'm just gonna shoot myself. I know for damn sure that I'm never gonna touch that shit again now. I've already ruined a friend of mines life by introducing it to her back when I first started. That was years ago, and now it's all she really cares about. I don't think I could live with this guilt. This is all so fucked up.
