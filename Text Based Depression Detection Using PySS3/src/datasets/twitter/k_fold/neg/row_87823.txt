I told her I'm her worst nightmareI told her I'm her worst nightmare  
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair  
My spirit floats around in the night air  
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems

i dont know what to do anymore. life fucking sucks. whats the point of trying if i already know for a fact i will fail? only a miracle could fix this, and i dont fucking believe in miracles.

fuck that. i aint brave enough to just go and swallow some pills but i hope i one day will, unless it gets better. but it probably wont.

fuck that.
