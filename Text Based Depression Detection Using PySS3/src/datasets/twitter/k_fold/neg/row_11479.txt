No one to talk to..Partner wants a break which I think is the end of our relationship and has taken my one yr old son with her, I have no friends or family. Those 2 were all I have.. I have no one to talk to and I dont want to be here anymore. I literally get through my day knowing I can see my son everyday and now that's been taken from me I dont know what to do.. I get the obvious my son will be hurt if I do anything silly but I cant handle the pain of him not being here anymore... I just want to end it tonight and maybe with a bit of liquid courage I will. Just needed to vent somewhere I guess, sorry.
