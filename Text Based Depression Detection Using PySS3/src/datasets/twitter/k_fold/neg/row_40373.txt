My impending deathThis is it. I can't handle life anymore. Every day I wish I was dead. People think that I have it all. I get good grades and I'm good at running cross country. I'm the "perfect" student athlete. But ever since last year I've been depressed. I haven't been officially diagnosed but when you're sad or feel dead inside all the time and want to kill yourself, you figure it out. Anyways, I have an emotionally abusive dad, who constantly calls my brothers and I jackasses, shithead, dumbasses, and he calls me a bitch all the time because according to him, "if the shoe fits, wear it". Sometimes he slaps me. He threatens to beat us all the time if we don't do what he wants. "I'll knock your teeth out" or "I'll slam your head into the wall". I also am under constant stress from school. I have to get good grades or I get yelled at. I put a ton of pressure on myself to do well, too, and I'm a perfectionist. Every night I get three to four hours of sleep after going from school to cross country and then home to do hours of homework. This isn't a life I want. I can't take it anymore. So tomorrow, I've decided to drive my car into a tree. I've had the tree picked out for months now, but I've never had the courage to do it. But its too much now. Nobody will miss me. I have no friends that actually care. I'm done.
