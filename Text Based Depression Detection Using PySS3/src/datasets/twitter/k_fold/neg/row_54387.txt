I feel disconnected from everythingI'm 20 at this point, and I've been depressed since I was a kid which was largely due to being a victim of child abuse. I've never had any real friends or meaningful relationships, I have fading interests and no connection to my family or anyone else. People don't like the parts of me affected by my mental illness (and have basically told me such) and I have always fely disconnected from my peers and social groups and always been miserable watching the people around me. I don't feel much of anything when I isolate myself but that feels better than being miserable almost every day of my life. Sleeping has become what I do with all of my free time and its become my reward for every interaction that drains me. I have nothing to look forward to, nothing I connect to, no one I really like and no reason to be alive. I'd rather just sleep permanently.
