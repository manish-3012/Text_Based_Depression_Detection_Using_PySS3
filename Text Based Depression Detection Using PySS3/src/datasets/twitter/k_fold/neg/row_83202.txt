I just worry about mumIâ€™m really considering it. I have everything I need, I have a date, my only problem is I donâ€™t know what will happen for my mum. Yeah I know about â€œit passes it onâ€ but I donâ€™t really think thatâ€™s true in my case, I donâ€™t think she could have had a bigger failure of a child. I 100% genuinely believe that it would be a relief. She always says she worries about me, she wouldnâ€™t have to anymore...
