Pushing the off buttonThats it.  I loved reddit.  If there is an afterlife, you all involved in this amazing media platform will have a spot in my heart.  Topping it all off with me being a lonely, depressed virgin.  My family doubts me and there is nobody to turn to.  My mother abandoned me and my father and his side of the family just dont have faith in me due to my quirkiness and personality.  They all get to experience love and the joys of life.  All the while im alone in my thoughts.  I always dreamed and aspired to be a scientist studying in the field of Biomedical Engineering (like my â€œfatherâ€) or even study Artificial Intelligence and itâ€™s practical usage/possible detriment in modern society.  But now....i quit, an ADHD/Depression/Social Anxiety inflicted son of a bitch who is unwanted by all but...I digress,

Working out is my only and final release, without that....im useless and unneeded.

not sure if this is the right community as i saw it says â€œsuicideâ€ so....to be blunt do the fuckin math...  ANY advice on death methods would be helpful to end this shitstorm of a so called â€œlifeâ€ i live.  Preferably painless and quick with a high success rate and or chance.  JUST GET ME OUT.
