All aloneI've thought about killing myself many times in the pat and once tried it but out of fear, didn't overdose as much as a fatal dose requires. I come from a family where I'm emotionally abused because it's the method of parenting known and I've had depression before. The last 3 years of my life were the best of my life but my parents forced my boyfriend and I into a situation where it led to him being unable to handle it and he broke up with me. I know I have no interest in being with anyone again and my dad has forced me into a career of his choice too. There's nothing that gives me hope that the future will be bright. I've wanted to leave home for years. It's almost harder to want death than it is to wish I was never born. I don't know what to do anymore and I feel so alone with so many emotions and nothing to look forward too.
