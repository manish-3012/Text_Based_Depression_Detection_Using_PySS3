I just want contactI posted on here with essentially a concern and breakdown thread. Where i essentially described the fact that im stuck in my room all the time because of both social norms and my own decisions, yet its still driving me deeper in this dumb hole of depression rather than inspiring action. Its went from being a thought when im emotionally distressed but now thinking about my isolation all the time. 
I absolutely hate this lifestyle, i sit and paint, not even to relax, just so i dont kill myself from lack of action. And with my parents and everyone else going on a vaca this weak besides me, i had the opportunity to do whatever i wanted, go visit friends (no friends asked to see me or for me to visit), go shopping (went shopping before the day they left, which happened to have been me and my twins birthday, woo) and anything else. Nope! Stayed in my room and went to classes. It was the best feeling to actually talk to someone for the first time on Tuesday when some people i happen to be in class with drove me to class and took me to buy stuff. Its sucks that that experience is the best in a while. 
I want more contact but theres none to find, i feel its getting worse. 
I just need social interaction at this point
