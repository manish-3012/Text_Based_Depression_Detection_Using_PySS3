I feel like everything is just falling apart this year...I just want to go home and take care of myself for once, but I have no home to go to. 
I try to be grateful for what I do have but Iâ€™ve lost the spark to try to be hopeful. 
Iâ€™ve left a bad relationship from cheating and now Iâ€™m paying the price for constantly worrying about my current so cheating on me.
Iâ€™ve allowed others to dictate what I should become when Iâ€™m an adult and now Iâ€™m jobless without a clue of what I want to pursue or qualified to do. 
I have no self-esteem, no longer attractive anymore. The only one thatâ€™s useless is me. 
I only think about suicide because I just wonder if itâ€™s better than wasting away like this.
But the image of my sibling keeps me alive. 
I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m lost and the only person who can help me is myself.
