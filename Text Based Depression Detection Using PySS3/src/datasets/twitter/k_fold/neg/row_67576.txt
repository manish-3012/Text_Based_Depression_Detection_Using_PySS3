Who do you guys tell?Hey everyone. New here.

I watched a truck coming 65mph down the road this afternoon, and for a second or two, I thought about pulling out in front of it. Letting it t-bone me right at the drivers side door. But I thought about what could happen to the other driver.

Who do you tell when you feel like you can't tell anyone? I tell my girlfriend, she leaves me because I'm crazy. I tell my family, they lock me up in like a psychiatric hospital. I have roommates. But I know they'll escalate it to their parents or my parents or people I don't want knowing. And if I lose what little I have left, I'll go down and probably won't make it back out.
