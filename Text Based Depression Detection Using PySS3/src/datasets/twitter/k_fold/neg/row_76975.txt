Sad alone and living in the pastI still haven't forgiven myself for things I did when I was 13. Horrid, horrid things.

I'm still the same person I was when I was a teenager.

I don't want to die. I want to kill the life I'm living. I want to be a kid. I want to have been normal. I feel like my life is a joke. I feel like every around me is fake, and they're playing out this shit life to see how far I can go.

I want to kill who I am, and lead a different life. I know I won't get help. I miss being a kid. I wish I wasn't so fucked up. I'm a joke. I'm nothing. I'm worthless. I'm ugly. I'm gross. I'm fat. I'm stupid.

Edit for clarification.
