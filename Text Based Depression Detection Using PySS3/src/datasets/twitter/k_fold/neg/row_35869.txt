Finalization workingI'm an alcoholic. It's at this stage that I know. You never know until you know. I'm sure some of you have felt what I feel. I'm not coming out of this free. I can't break my cycle. I leave behind my beautiful partner and her 3 kids. I leave behind my estranged ex son. I leave behind a lot of people who have overlooked and shunned me including parents and siblings. They won't look here. Its comforting explaining this to strangers. You can judge. Keyboard warriors. I am weak. I am emotional. That's my curse. 3 packets of nurofen tablets should do it. Then I don't have to worry anymore
 Relief from my brain. Relief from it all
