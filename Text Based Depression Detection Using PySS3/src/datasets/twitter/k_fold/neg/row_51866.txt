Just a rant.My life isnt even that shit. Its my brain that is.
I have an easy time making friend, have a lovely family that loves me and im atleast pretty average in the intelligence departement, so i could realistically do pretty much anything i put my mind to... 

But I just dont want anything. I dont want material things Or money, i dont want sex, i dont want popularity Or lots of friends... Ive experienced all of those things and none of them really meant to much to me. I just dont wanna do anything cuz i dont want anything.

Im so apathetic, I wish I could care about my life Or about ANYTHING but i just cant. I just have this sinking feeling in my gut that it really is over for me this time. Its just so stupid, after fighting so many years to just give up... 

Existing cuz i dont want to Hurt the once i love, but im so tired of doing this shit. Im so sick of it, and I cant wait til it ends. And god I hope it really does end. Sorry about the rant, just feel so tired today. And just knowing tomorrows another Day makes me want to cry, im just so Tired of this. 
Im really not sure how Long i can take this for.
