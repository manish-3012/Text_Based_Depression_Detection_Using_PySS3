What happened to me?Hi , thanks to everybody who reads this. I just wanted to say last year i got depressed cuz of my stupid ex.. she was fucking psycho. I broke up with her because i knew she had bad impact on me, i got my antidepressants ... they were working for a few months , but now i feel like shit again there is no day without suicidal thoughts even tho im on pills. Sad thing is that only weed makes me happy , its my escape from reality. I noticed i lost interest in all things basically nothing makes me happy i can't even talk to my family normally , i feel like a fucking robot everyday... like i become heartless to everybody but only animals no &lt;3. I wanted to suicide multiple times but never actually did and when i was thinking about my dogs mostly the one who is addicted to me , he can't be without me .. i would just feel bad leaving him here. So i changed my mind into this i'll wait till my dog dies naturally (hope) and then i'll suicide. In last 2 years my view on world changed so much for me it's like place in hell. Hope y'all doing well guys peace.
