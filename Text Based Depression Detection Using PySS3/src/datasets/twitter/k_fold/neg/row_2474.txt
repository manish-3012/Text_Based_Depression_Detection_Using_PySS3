I really don't want to get into it, but, I'm more depressed than I've been yet.I just want an out. I want a way to be freed from life and all its bullshit. Right now the only thing keeping me alive is wanting to know what the final results of the Grand Prix is gonna be. I'm living in the hopes that something will change, but if it were going to, it would have already.
