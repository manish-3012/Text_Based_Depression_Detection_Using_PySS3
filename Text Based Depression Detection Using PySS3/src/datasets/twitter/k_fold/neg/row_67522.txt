Think I'm doneHaven't figured out when, but I've mostly done the math on how. I have access to oxy, alcohol, and weed (to prevent throwing up). If my math is right it won't be painful, I'll just pass out and not wake up. If it's wrong I'll wake up with a hangover. And then I can try again. 

I'm just so tired. I'm tired of my medical issues. I'm tired of not really living.  Just existing isn't enough. I can't hang around like some half remembered pet just because others will be sad for a little while if I die. 

I no longer get any pleasure from reading, writing, watching TV or movies. I have to get high just to make the day bearable.  These aren't temporary problems that will pass in days, months, or even years. My medical issues are permanent and debilitating.  If I had access to a gun I probably would have done this a while ago.
