Why The F is it so Hard to Kill MyselfI'm so frustrated because it is so damn difficult to work up the courage and motivation to go through with it. I need to die, there is no doubt about that. Life is miserable and will never ameliorate. But despite this, I cannot bring myself to actually do it 

The odds are stacked against me and I hate it. 9.3M US adults have suicidal thoughts each year. 2.7M make plans. 1.3M attempt. Just 40k succeed. Only 0.43% of those with suicidal thoughts manage to kill themselve, 1 in 232.5 each year
