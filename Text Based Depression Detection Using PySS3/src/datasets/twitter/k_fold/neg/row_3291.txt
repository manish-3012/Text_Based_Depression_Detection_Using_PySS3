Please, please snap me out of thisTonight got to the point where it seemed as if my suicide was a forgone conclusion. I have been fantasizing about this for years. I feel as if this is what is supposed to happen. Tonight, something made me realize that when I die, it will be by my own hand. The only reason it isn't happening right now, at this moment, is because I don't want my roommate to go through seeing his best friend dead on the floor. I didn't used to be like this. I don't know what happened. It's been years. How do you make it through years and years thinking these things without acting on them? I've tried so hard. I am so tired of not killing myself. What makes it so bad is that I'm a full grown person, with a life. I'm not an overly emotional teenager, or someone who fucked everything up. I'm educated, I'm successful. I have people who care about me. Why do I want to die? I can't stop it. I didn't used to feel like this. Please. Help me understand how to feel like I used to. I'm so tired of fighting this.
