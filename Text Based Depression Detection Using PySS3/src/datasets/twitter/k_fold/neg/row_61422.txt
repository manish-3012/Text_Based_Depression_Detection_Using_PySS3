exhausted ventI'm so unbelievably frustrated with myself, my life, and everyone else. all these people i thought i could trust are hurting me and acting like im the bad guy because im getting upset that theyre mistreating me and its leaving me confused and making me feel like im crazy and like i dont have a right to be upset about anything 

i left home to get away from an abusive mother just to be unhappy there and come back, so now im just as stuck as i always was. i dont have any income, i dont have anywhere to go or anyway to get income because im disabled buti cant fucking apply for disability because my mom doesnt want me to and i just. i genuinely dont know what to do. i know why people offer me advice, i really do, and i appreciate it, but its starting to wear thin on my psyche. i run these circles in my head. i go through the options. they all run back to not knowing waht to do or not having anything to do. im so fucking tired of being sad and in pain all the time, its not even that i want to die, im just tired of existing like this, but dying is as close to that as ill ever fucking get . i dont have anywhere else to put these thoughts and i cant take keeping them inside all the time either so sorry if this sub is the wrong place or anything
