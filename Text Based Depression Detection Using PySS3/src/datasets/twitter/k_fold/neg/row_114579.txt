I can't wait any longerMy alcoholic father is a tormentor and fiend by night, and has made me into a nervous wreck, always afraid that something bad is going to happen. Each night he gets wasted on Vodka, and treats me like a slave. The work is never particularly grueling, but humiliating and stupid. Particularly, he'll have me scratch and massage his feet every night, usually for at least an hour, sometimes more. 

Among other things, he'll always decide to do major projects like cleaning the car or one time he actually wanted to start tiling the floor at seven PM at night. Any resistance I put up with is met with anger and accusations of being ungrateful and being made fun of. 

The worst part is, I love my father when he is sober, I used to stick by his side and help him do everything. That's what makes it crushing for me, because in order for me to be happy, I know I have to give up and abandon him, and I don't think I have that inside me.  But it's foolish for me to think he'll ever get better, any attempts made by family members to help him is never effective.

He doesn't understand why I look so depressed all the time, even as he's buying his liquor. He thinks I should be cool with him yelling and screaming with family members, blaming them for all his problems why he himself is flawless. 

I keep imagining just how much easier it would be to end it all, leaving behind a note telling him it was his alcohol addiction that led me to it. Knowing that he could no longer deny he has a problem and the overwhelming guilt that maybe he'd either better himself or take his own life, bettering the lives of the rest of my family. 

If only I wasn't such a coward.
