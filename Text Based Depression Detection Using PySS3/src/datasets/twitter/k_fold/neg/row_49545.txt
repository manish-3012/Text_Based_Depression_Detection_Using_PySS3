Destined for failure and tragedy2010 = Mom dies when I'm 20.years old. I'm beside her as she dies from pneumonia (from breast cancer chemo)
2014 = Fail law school after 2 years. $230,000 in debt at the age of 24
2020 = Got pregnant, gave birth at 5 months. Daughter dies after 6 hours of being alive. My cousin at the same age gave birth to a healthy baby after notifying us at already 7 months. She constantly cheated on her boyfriend, did coke and heavily drank up until then so no one even suspected she was pregnant. 

It's true what they say: the happiest people are oftentimes the saddest. I've been told that I'm funny and witty but I really do think that's my coverup. I'm sad and lonely. I feel like an evil woman that is using me as a piggyback and is happy by all the pain shes inflicting on me-almost like a scary movie with a sad ending...one where I kill myself. I sit here on the bathroom floor of my in-laws house, in a cute lime green bodysuit, with ripped jeans and numb legs. I tried a therapist and all she wanted to do was refer me to a psychiatrist instead and give me magical pills. All people have told me is  "you're so brave, you're so strong" but can I just stop going through all these big life-changing scenarios and fight a few smaller battles instead? Happy new year. Something very very bad will happen to again this year. I can never just have an easy win in my life.
