Anxious and not depressed, suicide thoughts.Sorry that I'm writing here, sorry that it is not structure, I am confused, I am so anxious these weeks that I am seriously thinking of suicide just to get rid of the anxiety, the pressure and the pain that I am enduring, life is pointless and temporary, I just want to end it faster. I don't wanna hurt my family, so I noticed that it's been more than a week that I am obsessively googling ways to commit suicide without looking like a suicide, and was noting down and doing research on them, and suddenly I realized something must be wrong with me, as this is not really me. I'm not depressed, I am 32 and living alone, I'm very social, I don't have any major life problems except for loneliness. I have a good job and I have very dear friends, But I don't wanna share my thoughts with any of them, they would probably freak out or think that I am an attention seeker, I just asked them that I need to see them, but it seems that everyone is busy with something in these days. I haven't gone to work since Friday and I called sick. I don't know seriously what is wrong with me, why these sudden thoughts, cannot eat much and constantly crying.
