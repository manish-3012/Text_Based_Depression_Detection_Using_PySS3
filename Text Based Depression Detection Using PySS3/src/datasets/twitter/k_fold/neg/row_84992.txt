What can I do to help an online friend who's in another country?I've got a friend who I chat with regularly who lately has been saying that she's going to have to kill herself when she fails her exams within the next couple of months. She's been telling me that her parents have slowly been taking away any de-stressors she has, like her phone and art supplies, and is refusing to let her have a life outside of school work. 

She's been saying that she has no time for anything but school, studying, and homework. She wakes up, goes to school, comes home to study and do homework, and goes to bed only to have to do it all over again the next day. She has been getting so much school work piled on her that she's often up until four in the morning trying to finish it. She is routinely only getting about three to four hours of sleep a day. She keeps messaging me saying how tired she is and that she just wants to end this. 

She has been messaging me less and less lately and her personality has completely changed over the last year. While we used to talk about a lot of things, nowadays all she talks about is how school is slowly wearing her down. All of her humor has become fatalistic at this point and she's constantly making jokes about how she'll be dead soon. I'm really worried for her but I don't know what to do to help. She doesn't live in the US so there's almost nothing that I can do for her. I try to encourage her as much as I can but in the end I mostly feel like I'm useless and that I'm going to lose her soon.
