Nothing helpsI'm just about at my wits end with what ails me. I'm taking medicine, I'm going to therapy, I'm trying to talk to people I don't know, getting outside and still I want to die. I'm beginning to think these thoughts and miserable feelings will never go away. I don't want to keep going if this is all I'm able to feel.
