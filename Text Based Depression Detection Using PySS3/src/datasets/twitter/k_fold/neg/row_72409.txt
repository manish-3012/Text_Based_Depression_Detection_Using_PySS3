For parentsMy 5 year old has a "worry monster"- a stuffed toy with a mouth that can shut with a zipper.  The idea is, you say the things you're scared or worried about into the open mouth, then zip it to keep them inside  and protect you from them.  I saw her telling her worry monster her worries the other day.  She said, "Please don't let Mommy die, and please don't let Daddy die."  (Then she continued on with other little-kid worries)

If you have a little kid, they probably think something like this, too.
