The only way to stop everything is to end itIâ€™m supposed to be at work in an hour but I canâ€™t help feel like it wouldnâ€™t matter if I never went back. 

Iâ€™ve exhausted the one person I can really trust about these feelings. 

I want to kill myself. I want to tie a rope around my throat and end it. 

I canâ€™t function as an adult, Iâ€™m constantly asking for help and everyone would be better off not having to help me out.

Iâ€™m a burden. I canâ€™t accomplish any goals I set out for myself. I canâ€™t make anyone happy, not even myself. 

I canâ€™t stop thinking about how much I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. I want to die. 

They wonâ€™t stop. They wonâ€™t go away. I donâ€™t matter anyway.
