I feel worthless and I don't know why I'm still tryingMost day I walk around pretty numb and don't let myself feel anything at all. It's better than the truly down times, I tell myself. But then some days, like today. I feel worthless. I don't know what's the point of pushing forward. I've lost control of every part of my life. I've pushed everyone away or they left before I could push them away. I have no friends. No job. No money. Nothing. And not for lack of trying. I've tried a lot of things, a lot. It pains me to admit it, but I'm jealous of my recently deceased cousin bc I wish I was him. No doubt, he probably wishes he was me. But I feel like I keep trying to live and do things. Even little things and I get rejected and kicked when I'm down every time. I wish I could disappear as though I never existed. I know that's not possible and I'm not going to try and kill myself. But I do wish I could magically disappear. Idk how to make life better or make it feel like it's worth living or make others see my worth. It feels like a lost cause.
