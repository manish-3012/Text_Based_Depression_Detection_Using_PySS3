Broken MemoriesI've always been broken.

I often wonder if my mother should have aborted me, she has always stated she almost did when she learned I was in her. Sometimes it makes me wonder if she let the neighbors rape me when I was 3 on purpose, because of the horrible things that happened to her when she was just a child. It was 20 years ago and I have no real memories. Just dark thoughts that invade my head when the lights are off and I see the open closet door.

I do remember later when in school how my p.e. teacher watched me change, and asked me to shower. How he had the others run laps while I was in 'time out' in his office. I remember it happened twice before I told him if he touched me again I would have my friend Carlos kill him in his sleep. I thank God he never found out I never knew any Carlos, or anyone willing to commit murder at all for that matter. I remember my best friend asking me out, and than getting very mad when I told him no. I remember when the doctor said I miscarried. I remember not being able to accept this and creating the persona of my unborn child to keep from losing myself more. I remember the many times I've told my family i want to die. I remember them telling me to suck it up. I remember my mom telling me to stop threatening her with it. I remember how I just wanted her to say that it will be ok. I remember the moment I realized I was different, I remember learning the word that changed the way my parents looked at me. I remember the day I realized I was a man in a woman's body. I don't remember feeling love, from anyone, including myself. I don't remember what it feels like to be happy. I don't remember what it feels like to have someone who cares. I don't want to remember anything anymore. I don't want any more memories. I just want to finally put the knife through my wrist and watch my life fade away into the nothing it has always been.
