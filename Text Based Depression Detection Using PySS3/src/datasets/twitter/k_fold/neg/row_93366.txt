Came Close TonightI wasn't serious about it; I was just experimenting with my method of hanging (I won't go into any specifics other than the sensory experience,) but I nearly blacked out in the middle of it. It was surprisingly easy to reach a state of near-helplessness, and had I waited any longer to stand back up I'm not sure I'd be here right now. I was in slight discomfort, but I could've easily willpowered through it and let myself completely black out. Fortunately, I didn't. My limbs were nearly numb for a few minutes afterwards, and I was dizzy, barely able to stand. My neck is also rather sore now.

Oddly enough, I now feel slightly more tolerable of what's been driving me to consider suicide all this time. Perhaps the hard reality of â€œOH MY GOD, I'M ACTUALLY GOING TO DIEâ€ helped me, I don't know.

(I am *not* implying that desperate people should get a taste of hanging themselves to make themselves feel better, of course. Like I said, I *don't know* why I'm feeling slightly better.)

Anyways, I hope this doesn't come off as me simply pining for attention, but I just really want to talk to somebody. Now that I know how easily I could follow through with my method, I'm starting to get scared. Why? Because I enjoyed it. The numbness, the aurora-like lights dancing across my vision, all my worries and everything slowly fading away â€“ it was profoundly euphoric, a high I've never experienced. I basically played the choking game with myself.

Also, I posted here a few days ago, but the only person who replied appears to have had his account deleted, so I was unable to talk to him. You can read my original (extremely long) post [**here**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/370pjy/21_and_despairing/) if you want to know more about me and why I'm considering suicide. Here's a TL;DR version: I'm a 21 year old male suffering from depression and *severe* social anxiety, and I feel trapped by my symptoms to the point of not being able to get help.

Please, I'd really like to talk to somebody. Thank you.
