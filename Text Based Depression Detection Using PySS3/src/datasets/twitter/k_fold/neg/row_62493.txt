I give upI don't know how normal people do it... how do you just.. smile and keep living and get throguh tough situations with barely any trauma? how do they do it? I'm ashamed of the way I feel and my mental problems. I wish I was never born, or I at least with one of my severeal suicide attemps would have worked because it could've prevented me from hurting people and just making my life worse. I've tried getting help all my life. I've been hospitalized like 15 times since 2012. I've seen therapiste and psychatrists and they either call me names or just completely ignore everything I have to say and I don't know why its just me! so many people manage to overcome their mental illnesses and get good professional help so why can't I find one decent fucking doctor!? I keep getting shit on by everyone. I am openly suicidal. Everyone knows I want to kill myself and I've tried reaching out to people and I just get shut down and ignored. People say they care about me but they don't act like it.. and I swear to god when i do finally kill myself they're all gonna come running to my obituary saying how they wish they could've helped me or they cared about me so much and missed me and its so fucking hurtful because the only thing I need to stay alive is for those people to tell me those things now.. they know I need help. they know I'm going to kill myself and yet no one says a word to me. but as soon as i die everyone will just magically start to care and its such bullshit. why cant they care now? why cant anyone help me now? i dont know when i will do it but i will soon. im just so exhausted and tired of it all. i fight every day all day just to fucking keep breathing in this miserable stupid fucking life that no one wants me in.
