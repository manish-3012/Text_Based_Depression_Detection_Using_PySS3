Last time I'll see my friends this weekendWe're having a barbecue on Sunday for a bunch of friends coming from surrounding states. They are a lot more successful than I am, so they were able to get out of here.

Any tips for acting normal or fighting the emotions to make it through? I used to be good at it but I've gotten worn down over time to where I don't notice until my wife's asking me "What's wrong?" over and over.

I've considered just canceling but I haven't seen some of them for years. It's something I'd like to do before I go, but I may cancel anyway to avoid acting happy for the weekend.
