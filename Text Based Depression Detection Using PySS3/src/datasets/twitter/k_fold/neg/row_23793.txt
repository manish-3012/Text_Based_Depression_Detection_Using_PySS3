im 16 and im ready to end iti don't know how to do these stupid things and i don't know what to say. ive had chronic depression since i was eight, ive been physically (not so much since i dragged CPS in), emotionally and mentally abused by my dad for my entire life and my mom stands to the side and does nothing, i was raped and abused by my ex boyfriend, sexually abused by as a child and im only realizing that now during therapy, ive lost every single friend but two in two months and im going to lose my only two friends because every morning i wake up it feels like a mistake and i cant even respond to them, im failing college, my boyfriend lives on the other side of the world and i feel so fucming pathetic bevause he deserves so much better than this. ive spend the last half an hour cutting to try and build up to fucking end it but i cant do it. every morning i wake up mourning the person that i want to be but the entire universe is doing it fucking best to make sure ill never get the opportunity to feel like anything other than a mistake. im so lost and i dont know what to do or if it will ever get better. i know that i need to get away from this house, get on antidepressants, find friends and learn to love myself but ive been trying so fuckinf hard and its gotten me nowhere. i just feel like this fucked up ball of mess and its killing me. i dont know why im posting this. i think it hurts so much that i cant keep it in. or maybe i just want to talk without risking bridges being burnt.
