i sent my best friend an audio message of me sobbingand i fucking hate that this is going to be the way sheâ€™s going to remember me when i do it. i donâ€™t see myself living past tonight, i really donâ€™t. everything that was good went to shit and sheâ€™s all i have left and iâ€™m so tired of living for other people. iâ€™m in so much pain. &amp; iâ€™m p sure my bf is going to leave me.. so 

iâ€™m sorry alley, and if he still cares, iâ€™m sorry zay.
