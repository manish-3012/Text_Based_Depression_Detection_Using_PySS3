Thereâ€™s a specific spot where the train picks up speed and canâ€™t slow down in time. I walk by the spot everyday, getting closer to stepping in front of it.Iâ€™m 23 and have nothing to show for it. I spend a good majority of my time planning how I should die. I know I can do it, and I should be scared, but the wave of relief that comes over me when I do think about it only entices me to finally do it. I only matter to my immediate family, and though we are large (7 siblings and speak to all of them) itâ€™s just not enough. I feel that in my death it will allow my family to change for the better. 

I have anxiety so bad that I will start shaking in public for someone simply looking at me for an extra second. This has manifested into paranoia which causes me to almost believe everyone is either out to get me or they know something personal about, just waiting to tell. I donâ€™t believe I have a purpose in life and to not have a purpose is a waste of resources, energy, and space. 

Depression has manifested itself into impromptu mood swings, a decline in hygiene, and the desire to have someone use me with malice intent. I have lost all self-respect and donâ€™t feel it may be fixed. I thought I would be on somewhat a path by now, but Iâ€™ve come to realize that Iâ€™ll never fit in with normal people. 

Please donâ€™t think I need pitty or this is hollow. I have every intention of dying, but I need someone to know why. I just canâ€™t tell my family; theyâ€™ll stop me. 

Thanks for reading. Good Night folks.
