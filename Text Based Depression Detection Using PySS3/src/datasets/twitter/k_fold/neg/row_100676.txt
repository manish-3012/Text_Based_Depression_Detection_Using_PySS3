I can't stand being sober: My depression cure is any kind of drug in meI live in misery most of the time. My only escapes are chemical: alcohol and drugs. While the depression and anxiety are always around, a joint, some pills or some liquor make the feeling go away. It's a reprieve from the feelings that haunt me every day.

I enjoy altering my mindstate with substances so it's not something I'm willing to totally give up. But I hate that there's nothing else that can keep the anxiety, depression and suicidal feelings at bay. 

My muses are benzos, alcohol and marijuana. Not hard drugs, but they work. Benzos are great anxiety killers, and alcohol and marijuana are great for just excaping from everything. My mind divorces itself from the shitty feelings under the right circumstances. It's a better cure than anything.

I just feel so hopeless. I am sick of masking the feelings. I want to just be able to live without needing chemicals to help me survive on a daily basis. I want to be normal.

I always want to die. I know how I'd do it. It's a comfort knowing that I can just exit if things get too much.

I'm really not addicted to anything, but I think it's slowly getting that way. Living without high levels of depression and anxiety is amazing. And self medication is the only thing that's helped that. Traditional medications haven't.

I just want to be happy. I want to wake up and be happy to be alive. To look forward to the day. My life sucks. I wallow in misery, knowing that it's such a long crawl out, and mask the pain with outside substances. Sigh.........

Sometimes I really, truly just want to die. I think I have a plan that will probably work. I need to stop thinking right now. I don't believe in an afterlife and think we're all slowly but surely heading toward nothingness. Why deal with years of misery to get to the same end goal that could be reached instantly right now?
