20 year old virgin contemplating suicideHey I am 20 and already attempted suicide a few months ago, because I was so lonely,  and ended up in a phsyc ward for a full month, ouch, not fun at all, and now I managed to move on telling myself I will get a girl some day but at this point it seems like that day is not happening, I've never been on a date to screw up, I just never managed to get a girl to go out with me, and here's the thing I am pretty good looking smart and a nice person, but for some reason I am just different, not sure what it is i really badly just want to be normal but that just doesn't seem the case, there is something about me that just keeps girls away and I can't figure out what that is, and then because I get frustrated that I am alone I get more depressed and then girls don't want me even more and on and on it's a vicious cycle with no help in site, and then people say just hook up with anyone and get it out of your system, but really I am not like that, I want a real relationship not a hooker especially not for the first time but even in general I want an emotional relationship with someone not just sex. And the worst part about it is, is that I am from this stupid religious community so the girls I see on a daily basis will never go out with you because we are brought up with this stupid idea that sex is bad unless your married, so you can't go out with people you know and when you leave your community it's hard to get in with other girls because now we have a cultural issue between us plus it's not like I am In college so where am I meeting them at the bar/club that never works plus I am under age so it's harder to get in, and it's hard for someone my age to find love at a bar, my type is 18 year olds. so I have my boxed in parents just tell me I am sorry you feel that way that you need a girl, everyone else feels like that but everyone else controls themselves which makes me want to smash there head into the wall, like I said in my community wanting love is looked down on, like oh so sorry for this guy he wants love like what the he'll why should I wait till I am 23 to have love I live in the most screwed up community ever, and now I am stuck with this stupid cultural issue, which I tried to avoid but is clearly why I don't work out with girls out there I hate my self I hate my life I feel bad for my family and feel bad for my stupid parents who choose to live in a 2 bedroom apartment and have 10 kids which I am the oldest of which doesn't make my life any better and they just naively believe that god wants them to have alott of kids and he will just give them money and a house, well he clearly didn't and it's been 20 years, and a rule in our religion is that if something is one way for more them 3 years then it generally will not change so my life is screwed, and if I do try to kill myself again I will have to make sure that I don't mess up.
