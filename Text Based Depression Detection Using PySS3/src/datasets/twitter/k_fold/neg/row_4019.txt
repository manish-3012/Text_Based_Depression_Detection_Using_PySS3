Constant NoiseI have both Tinnitus (a constant high pitched noise in both ears) and Visual snow (Static in my vision pretty much all the time). Ever since the 22nd/23rd it's been really intrusive and this has brought up panic attacks. It may sound stupid but this brought up suicidal thoughts because the constant noise is hard to concentrate with and because of my GCSEs coming up soon this has made it hard to revise. I don't know if this is a knock-on effect of the pressure for the GCSEs or it's something else but I'm finding it hard to cope
