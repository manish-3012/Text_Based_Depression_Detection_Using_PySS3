I'm going to be meeting with a friend in eight hours, but I'm not sure I can pretend today.I've been doing well, but have had a small relapse of sleep-deprived madness the past few days. I'm not being hyperbolic, either,you would be appalled at how I have been conducting myself in private.

Usually, when we hang out, it brings me such joy, and I can match the energy. I am kind and friendly in the most genuine ways, but I deliberately avoid showing even the slightest sign that anything is wrong. Why?

Because she's a girl.

That reasoning might make you upset. That's fair, honestly. I've just found that on a subconcious level, girls will only tolerate negative emotion from other girls. There's probably other factors at work, of course, and I desperately want to be wrong, but... Gathering more evidence isn't worth the risk.

But it seems like that will happen today anyway. She will know something is wrong, and perhaps she will ask. No matter how much I refuse, it is inevitable I will let something slip. She's a very smart girl, so it's decently likely she may be aware of her instincts and be able to compensate for them, but again, I don't want to take that risk. At any moment she could cut off contact, badmouth me to mutual acquaintances, and disappear. She knows where I live, but the same can't be said for the reverse.

She must never find out how lonely I am, must never find out she is my only true friend, must never find out how desperately I need a literal shoulder to cry on...

I want to be vulnerable, but I have too much to lose.
