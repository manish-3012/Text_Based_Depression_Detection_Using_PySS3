I thought things were okay againBut I can't stop crying and I can't tell anyone my struggles right now. I'm ashamed of how far I let myself slip, but I didn't notice it until now. I want to tell you or someone, but I'm just scared of what you'll think. Maybe I'm going to be too much too handle? But I don't like lying to you, even if it's just me saying that I'm happy and I feel okay. You're not back yet though, so I'll wait a few more weeks. 

I tried to draw again today, it came out okay, but I hate it now. They look happier than I could be. 

My mind is slipping back to that dark place and it's so hard, I hate it. 

I can't help it though.
