Iâ€™m tryingI wish others knew how hard I fight every day to stay alive. No one understands. Iâ€™m using all my energy to get through every single day and fight these thoughts but no one cares. People say itâ€™s a permanent fix for a temporary problem. Itâ€™s been a permanent problem for many years. You see all this crap that says â€œtell someone.â€ Well, Iâ€™ve told many people that Iâ€™m not ok. They say, â€œthings will get better.â€ But things donâ€™t get better. Things get worse and I fight harder every day. Iâ€™m scared that one day I wonâ€™t be able to fight anymore.
