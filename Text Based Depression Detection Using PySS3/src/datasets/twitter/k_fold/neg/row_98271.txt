What the hell is wrong with me?I self-sabotage every single thing I do. My diet, my studies, my friendships/relationships with family... As soon as something I care about comes along I ruin it. It's like I'd rather not try at all and fail than put my heart into something and still not be good enough. And I know this isn't a healthy way to look at things but I can't stop. I don't know how to stop. It's pushing me over the line. This has been going on for so long and I just don't know how I can cope for much longer. 

My life is going nowhere and I'm increasingly left to wonder what the point is when this is all there is. Crushing disappointment at every opportunity.
