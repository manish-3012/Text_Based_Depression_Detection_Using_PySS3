Im doneI'm done being here. I survived one year from my last attempt and so what? No improvements in my life. Less friends. I rarely get to see ny son because my attempt caused me to lose him. I'm just so tired of being here. I wish I had the courage to just end it. The pain is overwhelming.  I dont want to be around anyone anymore. I'm just a burden. I feel like such a pussy feeling like this but its deafening
