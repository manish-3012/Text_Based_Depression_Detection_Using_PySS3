Deathbis comfortingIve been doing pkay for a little while, i went from posting several times a day at times, to not feeling the need to vent anything. But then suddenly it came rushing back. 
The feeling of wanting to die didnt go away, but it diminished. And now its back. Now i cry all day again, i cant stop. Everything makes me want to cry, everything is a trigger. There is so much sadness in the world. But also, there is alot im envious of too, that makes the tears shed. I keep seing people having what i want, and it makes me cry. I keep seeing people laugh, spend time with their family or friends, things that i dont have, they are enjoying, they are looking forward to summer, they are going on hikes and skiing with their family and friends, they are getting engaged, theyre starting a family. 
Ill never have anything of this. I dont want summer to come, i have no one to spend it with, no one. It breaks my heart into pieces. I wish i was loved, i wish i had someone. But no, my life is empty. Im so depressed by the life i live. And i dont wanna do anything to change it, ive lost hope, all i want is to die. Death seems like my only way. While i know i could do this and that to make a change, i dont want to. Im done with it all.
