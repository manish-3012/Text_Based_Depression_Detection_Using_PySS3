My legacy is ruined.I thought I would be a great writer. I thought I would be a great friend. I thought I would be a great son. I thought I would be a great partner. Instead, I'm a depressed, manipulative wreck that does nothing but sit around all day, occasionally writing stories that no one will ever care about. I alienated all my close friends, hurting many of them. I'm an embarrassment to my parents. How long does it take before the question "So what is your son doing?" becomes humiliating? I've barely had a chance to even be a partner to anyone. But each time it's been made painfully clear that I am not enough. For anyone.

My parents are leaving town next week for a few days. I think I might try swallowing as many pills as possible while they're gone. I don't want to live anymore. If the last few years have taught me anything, it's that the longer I live the more I'll fuck up and ruin everything around me.
