I always liked my Smith and WessonIt's a Canadian mark II hand ejector, over 100 years old. When I first bought it the finish was gone, it was full of gunk and grime, the action was as rough as could be, the grip was broken, and someone had labeled it as an m1917. I hand polished every speck of what was left off of every crevice and corner, someone had altered the cylinder to except 45 ar after the war so it it didn't have much value. I learned how to reblue the steel, smooth the action, and clean 100 years of garbage from the inside. Gave it a vintage franzite grip and a polished aluminum grip adapter. I was really proud of the work I did.

I haven't felt proud in a long time.

I have a job where the sum of my knowledge and capacity to learn is boiled down to two things 1.push button 2. Lift wood. While I fill orders for luxury goods in excess of $20,000, I struggle to support myself and my mother while she waits for her disability. Everyone else is either dead or disowned, I have no friends, I hate the financial burden, but I love my mom and she's the only person who ever loved me or cared about me. 

I can create beautiful things, or at least restore beautiful things, or at least create useful things. I am a human being, not a spreadsheet marked "Profit and loss" at the top, but that is how I am seen. I can fix things and make them work again, just not my family, not myself. I can't kill myself, believe me I tried many times. It's almost worse knowing you can't kill yourself, there is nowhere to run. No plane ticket, no train ride, no Greyhound can carry me from my shame or my guilt. And now not even a bullet. 

I don't know why I'm here posting this, I don't know if I want the attention or if I'm looking for a mature, adult replacement for screaming like a toddler in a Walmart who didn't get his way. That's how it feels.
