Friend has a severe addiction to the internet, got suicidal when taken away. How to proceed?Not sure if I should tell the whole story but if you guys think that it would be helpful in finding ways to help him, I will post it. Like the title says my friend has a severe addiction to the internet and his mom is trying to make him quit cold turkey. This was fine until his mom found out that he was using internet from a friend and during that time he was talking to someone about suicide. Who knows whether he was serious or not, but his mom is freaking out and thinking of giving him the internet back. So right now we are not sure how to proceed.
