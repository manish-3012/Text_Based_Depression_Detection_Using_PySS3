I want to die, but I can't do it.Today my parents found out about some stupid things I had done and they are devastated.

Hearing them say how disappointed and heartbroken they were really fucked me up. 

I am too ashamed for what I've done and I can't face them. I want to run away but I am only 19 and have no money. I live with my parents.

I had already fucked up my relationship with them but this one really was the last straw. I just a burden to them causing unnecessary stress and problems for them. 

I grew up into a good for nothing piece of garbage that I just want to kill myself but I am a coward. I dont even know where to start. 

I know it sounds ridiculous that I want to kill myself for such a reason but I have never been so humiliated before in my life that I dont know if I'm going to get past it. I dont want to face my brother or sister, I dont want to even know what they will think of me. I love them too much that i dont want them to see how pathetic i am right now. 

I want to kill myself but I always think that my siblings and parents would be hurt.
