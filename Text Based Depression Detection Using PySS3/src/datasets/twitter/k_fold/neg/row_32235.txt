Kind of weirdSo I've been dealing with self harm since 6th grade (I'm now a senior) and I haven't thought about actually killing myself since my sophomore year. Recently I've been getting closer and closer to actually doing it. I've recently been sent a psych facility in November 2018 too (I was diagnosed severely depressed since I've had more than one plan of suicide plus I have anxiety lol) and I thought it was a awesome because I would finally get help and I'll be happy but I've always had this thought that my thoughts of suicide are normal??? Like I feel that everyone thinks about killing themselves or something and that I'm not actually depressed. I asked my younger sister about this (2 years younger) and she said she's thought about killing herself but not seriously like the thought occurs but it's just a thought and she never plans how and when. Which honestly made me felt ashamed for asking since suicide is constantly on my mind and I'm always thinking up different ways of how to killing myself. I feel like I could possibly be in denial or something. Idk any thoughts on this???? Does anyone relate?
