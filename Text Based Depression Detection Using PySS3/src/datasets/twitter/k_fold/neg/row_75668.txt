I hate my life !!!!I'm 20 years old and I live in Israel but I don't like it here at all , I live with my mom and six siblings and they always fight , every morning they gotta fight it's a a curse . 
I thought I got used to fights in my family cause they been fighting ever since they were kids , it started as a fight between my parents after my dad secretly married a woman ten years ago , my mom asked for a divorce and they been in courts ever since . As a kid I didn't knew what to do but to cry but as I got older i thought I can fix a lot of stuff but I stopped giving a fuck even if they killed each other , because of those problems I was always ashamed to take any friends and bieng alone is all what I want and it was just fine , two years ago I went to college to study English and damn I was so nervous , firstly I used to mumble all the time and just keep sitting in the back and never participated in any kind of group work , I'm the second semester I had a lot of free time , but I didn't know what to do. No friends nothing interesting to do , I was all alone in while seeing the others having fun with their friends , I never had a girlfriend or a friend and in college I realized that , it made me feel worthless piece of crap . I didn't want to go back to college but my mom whom I hate so much was pushing me so I had to go . I felt 10 times worst than I felt before I just needed someone to talk to but there is non . My summer vacation after was even worst than what I had in college , I spent 3 months at home without going out even once , people around were traveling abroad and I wasn't able to explore my fuckin country , I spent those three months with no job , completely broke and no one even from my family asked if I was alive or dead , in the first of October I had a message saying that I failed in four courses and I should start as a freshman, I couldn't believe it , I don't want to spend anymore time in that college or in any other college , like two hours later my mom came into my room she yelled at me telling me you're a loser worthless failing kid who will be like his father then she spit in my face and left . College start for two weeks now and I just don't want to stay here no only in this college but Israel .
I been looking for a job but hey who would hire a short 20years old ugly kid .
I feel like I'm over 
Just asking for death also for my family
