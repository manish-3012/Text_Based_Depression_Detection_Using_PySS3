I think it is my [M22] time to go...Medical bills from the first time I tried to end it all are in the mailbox. The love of my life left me after 6 years. I have no passion in school and no friends. I feel so pathetic and lost. I keep wishing the first attempt was successful... I jumped from three-stories and broke my pelvis and ribs. I lost my best friend. My girlfriend is gone- she cheated on me while I was recovering then broke up with me. I was going to propose to her once I recovered because I saw the absolute beauty in her. I can't go back to the apartment we shared. I live with my dad now. What the fuck am I supposed to do?

I have so little to contribute to this world and it hurts so much. I ruined my girlfriend's life with my depression and drinking. I wasted so much of my life. I just wanted to make the people around me happy but I failed. I want to go peacefully, but I don't want to hurt my dad.
