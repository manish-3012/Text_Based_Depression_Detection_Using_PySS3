suicidal thoughtstwo days ago i had a conversation in which i explained that I would like to do programming as a job after i graduate (mostly because its the only semi interesting thing i found over the last years). this person then told me that i could give up on that idea if i wasnt good at maths (which is true).
i dont have any real alternatives and my finals are also in about 5 months already.

i've had suicidal thoughts before but now,, idk,, i dont see any future for myself and doing music wont cut it either. the only thing that helps with these thoughts and feelings is my boyfriend but i dont want to fully depend on him emotionally and financially.
if he wasnt around i'd be in a way worse state..
