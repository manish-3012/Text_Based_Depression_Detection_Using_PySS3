I HAVE NO ONEI have lumbar disc bulges and I can't even walk, sit or even sleep without pain. I have no one, literally no one. My parents are abusive and also I'm a bad daughter, I go on guilt trips everyday because I shout, scream, throw things at home and it makes them sad, I cant fucking control my anger. I have no one I can talk to, I feel so lonely. I have ocd too, dont remember a time when I was free of this fucking illness.

 Everyone I have ever loved left me or I fucked it up. I have nothing to live. Fuck life, fuck this fucking thing
