I have a bad case of helicopter parents, and Iâ€™ve decided to run away for the night. I canâ€™t stand their constant nagging, nor can I stand their lack of empathy.I donâ€™t know what to do now.  I donâ€™t have any friends I can stay with for the night, my dogâ€™s with me, and Iâ€™m in the woods.  

Iâ€™ve always been heavily watched and sheltered by my parents, and I forget why I ran off in the first place.  Iâ€™ve been having a rough few weeks with my parents, and the argument that happened 2 hours ago finished it for me.  

Any tips on what to do from this point on?  I really feel like crying.
