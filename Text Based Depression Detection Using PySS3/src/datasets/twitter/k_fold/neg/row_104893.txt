Never realized how easy it is to die(trigger warning, please don't read this post if you are suicidal)

I'm too tired and sick to go on, even though I want to go on and I don't want to die.

I have so much to live for, I do, but I fell into this black hole, and I can't get out. I want to get out.

And that is why I'm terrified right now. I watched all kind of gore videos last night, which wasn't the best idea, and it makes me want to hang myself. Now however I try I cannot get rid of the idea. 

I know from experience that in this situation I need to get someone to snap me out of it, someone who makes me see that I'm doing this because of the pain and desperation, and that my perception is impaired by depression. But I just can't. I don't want to burden the people around me anymore and I don't want to burden anyone anymore. Because enough is enough, I can't take advantage of others and drain their energies and resources forever.

Mostly I fear that my thinking is so much affected that I'm going to lose this battle. Even if I know that it's the depression talking I'm ashamed of myself, and I hate myself, and I'm starting the believe that it would be better for everyone if I would just die. 

I want to escape so bad, and my stupid, confused brain thinks that this nylon rope is the way to do that. It isn't. But I'm terrified that it might come to that, because I already want to do it. I think I crave it the very same way one would crave releasing any other tension, like sexual tension. I want to put down the burden so much.

How would I convince myself that it's not the time to give up, and no matter how hard it I have to keep resisting the urge, I must soldier on. How would I convince myself that this battle with depression won't take forever and that there is hope. Because I know that there is, yet I'm so close giving up. I guess nobody has answers to such questions and that sucks.
