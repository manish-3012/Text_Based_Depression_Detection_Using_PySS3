Does the urge to kill yourself ever end?I've been suicidal for YEARS now. Always been one of those things at the back of my mind. I haven't ever gone for therapy  and every time I'm about to or I consider it, something distracts me from pursuing the idea. 

Plus there's also the whole concept of me afraid that I'm making all this sadness up in my head and I'm being childish with my problems and how I'm going about them. 

But the thought of and the urge to just end it all is impossible to shake off.

So does it end? Or should I buckle up with these feelings till the day I actually die?
