I want to distance myself from loved onesI feel so hopeless for the future. Things haven't gotten better in 3 years. Therapy didn't work the first time and this time around its impossible to even schedule in a meeting, unless I want deal with time conflicts for schooling.

I feel pointless in my existence. I think my mom loves me as her child, but I don't think she loves me as a person. I know my boyfriend cares for me. I don't think I can name a friend who would realize I died, beyond me not showing up to school, and they might message the first time

I want to distance myself from my family, my boyfriend, to make it less painful when I give up and kill myself. But I don't know how. I don't know how to make it less painful for them, but I can't go on like this anymore

I just want to slowly stop being a part of their lives. Not leave my room as much. Don't join my mom on anything. Stop talking to my boyfriend as much, become less important, cause issues and distress until maybe we'll break up eventually and that'll make the process so much easier.

I don't want to keep living like this.
