Im strugglingHi, 

I'm from Spain and I'm 20. I know many of you kinda feel the same but I think that my time here is almost over. I've been always a sad and dark person, even when I was little. I am extemely sensitive and emotional. I'm not good at hiding my feelings or emotions. 

When I was 16 I lost my mother to cancer. She was the only person in my entire life who understood me and loved me. I was (still am today) so devastated that when I had to move with my moms family I started drinking and smoking heavily. Then a couple of years later I got into a relationship with my current girlfriend. Everything seemed so nice, I could not believe it. I could see my mother in her (sounds kinda wierd, i know). The way she talked, the way she took care of me and loved me, and so on.

My girlfriend has a mental problem, she has borderline personality disorder.
I embraced It from the beginning and helped her out as much as I could.
I was the only one she had. I moved back to my town where she lives and quit studying to help her. There was a point that I didnt even have money to eat, and still I stood by her side and took her to dinner ,to the cinema, and so on to try to make her Happy.

Turns out, she cheated on me, last summer with an older Guy (53) who was the ambulance driver she used to go to teraphy with. I could not believe it, the she left me for him. I knew this Guy had money, a new car... I was devastated, to this day I am. 

I can not cope with the pain, my insecurity, nothing. I have harmed myself before just to feel something, but now I hurt myself to end It all. I attempted suicide 3 times before.

Btw, I still am in a relationship with her. Feel free to ask me anything.

Thank you

Edit: My story is way way deeper than the written above
