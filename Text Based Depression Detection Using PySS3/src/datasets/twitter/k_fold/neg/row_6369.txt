i need serious help.iâ€™m [19M] and basically i feel like shit mentally and iâ€™m completely exhausted. i need help but i personally donâ€™t think professional help would be my thing. especially since iâ€™m in the military, theyâ€™d just end up separating me. i want to talk to my friends about it but i donâ€™t want to be the one to strike the conversation. iâ€™ve tried giving hints and clues that iâ€™m depressed and suicide prone but they havenâ€™t caught on to it. i joke about offing myself not frequently but when i do itâ€™s a cry for help that maybe theyâ€™ll notice. iâ€™ve been dealing with this for far too long and iâ€™m scared that i wonâ€™t be here much longer. i want to disappear but i donâ€™t want to leave my family in that situation. i just want my friends to notice how bad itâ€™s gotten. i spent over an hour breaking down in my car the other night with a knife in my hand. iâ€™m scared iâ€™m getting a little too uncontrollable. help me pls...
