Anyone with BPD please talk to meI want to talk to someone who is officially diagnosed with BPD by a therapist , I have many problems and I have been diagnosed with OCD by a therapist but now I notice after months that I could also have BPD but my OCD was so intense that I only talked about those symptoms

Pls anyone?
