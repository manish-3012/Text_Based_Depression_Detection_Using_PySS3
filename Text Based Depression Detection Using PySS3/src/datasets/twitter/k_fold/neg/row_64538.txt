I need helpOkay, actually I'm not happy about my life since I'm 14 yo, I never felt good about myself, had a hating mother-in-law, a dad-in-law that used to beat my mom everyday and even if I hated my life somewhat I found a girlfriend, in the last few years I dated few times, but I always end up alone, it is really hard for me to find someone who I'm happy with, and now she let me, she wanted to move away because of her college, and she said to me that she is bissexual, she wanted to date some girls to know how she feels, I know I need to respect her space, but since we are in suicide watch, I really want to kill myself, I don't see any reason to stay alive, I hate myself and I hate college, my work, I hate everything about being alive, I just want to donate everything I have and hang myself at Mt. Fuji, waking up everyday coming to college and than going to work spending 6h behind a desk, I mean, life is so depressing, and when I try to share the little bit of happiness that I have within myself the one I love always go away.
We broke up in 12th October, I spoke to her 29th October and yesterday, she is happy, I feel completely stupid by not being able to let it go, a 21yo male who can't deal with being alone because his ex needs to move away, I never felt that I'm loved, my friends in college aren't really friends, I pretend do like them, my other friends are super rich kids that I can't relate with and the only person that I love is moving away from me, hope is dangerous.
I know I can't deposit all of my happiness in someone else or this is always going to happen, but everytime I fall in love the person seem to be happier after leave. 
I'm really sorry for my bad English, I'm Brazilian and crying while writing this.
