Only a matter of timeI'm done...

I have lost too much to life already.

I'm almost 24 and...

- I've lost the love of my life. She broke up with me

- I never persued the dream degree (animation) I wanted to because of what I thought would make my parents happy (health professional) and I ended up quitting it because I was so bad at it. and I'm too old and too anxious to go back to school

- I can't find a job

- I have severe OCD, social anxiety and depression

- I'm ugly

- I'm always thinking of others and being considerate to the point they keep using me and controling me because I don't give a  break to them. Use me until I break!

- I have a BFF who always manage to change the conversation to himself

- I have patents who don't understand my disease...

- I'm a disgrace for my parents.

I am better off dead than alive... I have too many regrets.

I have nothing here. I have zero... I have too many "what would happen if I had persued my dreams?"

I can't handle these regrets! There's too many!

I so regret not going into animation. It was my dream... Now, it's just unreachable... I'd have done things I liked... People I could connect. Be actually good at something.

Im going to end it. Soon.
