Alright guys a little question. What the hell is the point of living? Can anyone give me a decent answer?Ok guys answer this for me. Why should I stay alive? 

Come on now give me a good reasonable answer and not some bullshit about tomorrow COULD be better or people care about me or its selfish to take my life. Now hang on here can't I just twist that around and say it's selfish for them to want me to stay alive even in constant pain? 

All those arguments for staying alive are crap. Ya I get it someone cares. Sure I can implant the lie that tomorrow could be better in my mind and fake my happiness but I don't want that. I want a genuine fucking reason to stay alive cause I don't see the appeal of life. 

Now you're going to say if you've got no reason to stay alive why don't you just end it. 

My answer to that kind friends is I'm 16 and don't have a way to get ahold of a thick enough rope for a long drop hanging. That's the method I've chosen and I'm sticking with it.
