i just want to sleep...forever..god...is that too FUCKIN MUCH TO ASK YOU???? ARE you EVEN THERE? 
do you even exist? 
i know most of us are selfish little bitches 
i know most of us are tearing each other down with our ego and insensetive talking
i know we are bad and we deserve to get punished for what we did
but please ....in the end we matter nothing to you? right? our suffering are nothing to you...because you are the king sitting back watching us destroy ourselves slowly....we are just your toys?
we are your exsiting show? then why not just step in and fix what we destroyed? and dont comment down
"iF yOu cAnT rEaCh gOd yOuRSeLf He WoNt hElP yOu,yOu mUsT sHoW fAiTh In Him"
really? how many of you are still going to pray to someone wont help you or watch over you?
you think a HIGHLY depressed ass like me wouldn't brush their teeth to just practice in a religion? spending my whole life praying to something that might just exist or might not AT ALL?
is it my fault that im that depressed?
IF IT IS my fucking fault THEN LET ME FIX MY FAULT AND PAY FOR WHAT I DID...
"lol dont kill yourself,life is good,it will get good"

my ass
