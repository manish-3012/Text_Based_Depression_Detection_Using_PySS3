Fully planning it outStarted feeling suicidal around six-ish months ago. Things took a turn for the worse when my mom got sick about four months ago. Since Iâ€™m in the military I (sadly) canâ€™t pack up my bags and assist her. Iâ€™m trying to get stationed closer to my mom but itâ€™s clear as day the Air Force doesnâ€™t care about me, they just care about the work I produce. Thereâ€™s still a few options for me to get stationed closer to her, but if those fall through Iâ€™m fully committed to carry this out. If I canâ€™t be there to take care of her, I may as well be dead. If my last chance to get stationed there doesnâ€™t work Iâ€™m going to buy a gun (definitely a .44, wouldnâ€™t want to take any chances of me surviving), clearing my bank account and sending it all to my mom (probably at midnight when sheâ€™s sleeping so I donâ€™t get a call from her wondering why I sent her all my money), I live in the dorms so I donâ€™t have any remarkable possessions or anything like that, which makes the process a lot easier as I donâ€™t have to worry about getting rid of my stuff. Spend my last few hours watching basketball highlights and listening to music, and then when I feel ready Iâ€™m gonna write the note and then blow my brains out. Really sad it has to end like this but I canâ€™t keep living in this state of misery for much longer, I really wish things were different and that I wouldnâ€™t have to go out so young, but if these past 6 months are a forecast of the rest of my life, then I really am better off dead.
