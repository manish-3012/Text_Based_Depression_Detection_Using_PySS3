Suicidal thoughts seems to be a weekly thing.I just hate thinking about school. My mom applied to special ed class without telling until the day I went to school. Now I'm not discriminating or hating against people with mental disabilities and I respect everyone but I do not belong there... They are children in a teenagers body and it drives me insane that I'm isolated from the whole school and will never get any friends. I feel like shit walking through the corridors to class feeling like less of a human. Seeing everyone living a social life while I'm just gonna spend 3 years alone with no social interaction just rotting in the classroom then going home emotionally drained and sleep as soon as I come home and wake up in the night with so much anxiety. I hate being home because I hate being around my parents that lied to me and put me in this mess. I bottle up all my emotions pretending that everything is okay and that school will be fine when it won't. I will be miserable to the point where I finally will kill myself. Every weekend I get shit-faced just to get away from my problems. I'm stuck in this mess. School was fun when I had friends and I did good on all subjects and were motivated. Now I hate every little part of it and I hate being isolated. I hate my parents and I hate life. I do not have any friends and I want to kill myself.
