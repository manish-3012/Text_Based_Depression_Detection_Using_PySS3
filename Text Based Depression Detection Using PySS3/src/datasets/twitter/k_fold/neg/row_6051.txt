love is terminal(x-post from depression, off my chest)Not sure if anyone is interested in my story so to keep things short, I love a girl thats miles, borders and countries away. I was depressed. She can make me forget about my depression. I love her more than anything but I would never be more than a bro to her. We could almost never meet. When reality sets in everything makes me feel helpless as fuck. I dont dare tell her i have feelings for her again, she will just stop talking to me thinking i can forget her. There are many issues in my life right now, but thr seems to be some form of solution to them. Meds might be able to cure my emptiness. But nothing can replace her, this pain is unbearable i feel like killing myself to end this pain. Im so desperate im writing to 2 subreddits, talking and not talking to her hurts, have been suicidal for 6 months and now im afraid ive reached my limit
