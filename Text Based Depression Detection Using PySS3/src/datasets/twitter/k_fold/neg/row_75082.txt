Running out of ideasI feel like my entire life has just been distractions and  procrastinating until one day I'll run out of ways to put off suicide. Im sick of saying I'll just wait one more day. I don't want to try anymore, I'm so exhausted. I cant remember a time before I was depressed, there has always been something wrong with me. I wish I could rely on someone else for a few moments but I'm too much of a burden to carry. I ruin everything I touch and have no future. I can't keep doing this.
