when everything seems to fall apartit can be really hard to find any good meanings or reasons to stay. it might seem like thereâ€™s nothing left. but then again, even the smallest reasons could hold you back. 

i always want to help others and i get help back. but i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s stopping me from accepting the help. it just doesnâ€™t feel right.. i wish i knew how to let people help me, just this once. everything is going wrong in my life right now. i just want to feel happiness one more time, then iâ€™m fine. iâ€™m not asking for anything else.

if any of you are going through a similar situation, please stay strong. i know how hard it can be. i just lost contact to the most important person in my life. i guess it just wasnâ€™t meant to be, i donâ€™t know. maybe the situation was just too rough.. i wasnâ€™t okay, and it might have started affecting him too with time. i wish him all the best.
