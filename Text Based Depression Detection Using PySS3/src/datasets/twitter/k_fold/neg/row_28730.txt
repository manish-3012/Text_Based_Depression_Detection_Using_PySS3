Please help meI've been here for so long, everything hurts. I can't eat, haven't eaten except for coffee in 3 days. I can't leave the house, can't even get out of bed. I've been lying on this piece of foam on the floor because I can't afford a mattress, I can't even move to get up. Everything hurts, breathing hurts. I haven't smiled or laughed in so long. It feels like it's over, this is the end. 
I've been struggling with major depression for almost 10 years now and I can't get out of it. They keep saying hold on, it'll get better, but it's been a fucking decade and it's only gotten worse. I don't think it gets better for some people. I don't want to struggle my whole life, it's not worth it if it's going to be like this. I want to stop eating and see how long it takes, my body is underweight and pretty weak right now anyways.  My nearest family member is 4 hours away and I haven't made many friends in this big city, no one has the chance to stop me or even notice what's going on. When I think about it I feel very calm, like I'm thinking clearly. They won't have to deal with me calling them crying anymore, reminding them of my stupid mental issues while my mum is going through cancer. They'll have more money for the other kids, maybe one of them can use my school money to go to school. It feels right. I'm really suffering. I don't know how I'm going to do it but I don't want to be here anymore where every waking moment is a struggle. I'm tired of late night panic attacks that I have to go through alone, I feel so alone all the time. It's not worth it how is this possibly worth it. I can't I feel so hopeless I just want it to stop that's all. I'm ready to go home. Please give me a reason to stay, I want to believe it can get better so badly but I truly don't believe anymore
