I Should Be HappySo, I know I should probably see a professional. However, as a college student still residing in my religious,conservative parents' house and under their health insurance, asking for this would backfire. 

My parents are good people with good intentions. But to put it bluntly, they don't believe depression exists, they think that the people who are "depressed" are attention-seekers who need to stay overnight in an "asylum" to realize how sick they aren't.

I know I'm only a year and a half (hopefully) close to graduating, and once I finally apply and get a real job, I have the potential to finally get help. Despite this, I have this idea that I'm only one step away from screwing it all up. 

I have supportive friends, who are very open about their feelings and experiences. But, every time I open up to them, I feel like I'm just word vomiting. I'm worried that by clumsily shoving my personal baggage onto them is making them extremely uncomfortable and sometimes I wonder if they are slowly trying to fade me out of their lives.

My boyfriend, who has always been my voice of reason when it comes to these subjects, always supports me. He reminds me that the things I worry about are so far ahead and very trivial (based on the situation), and to take life  one day at a time. I feel like I rely on him so much, and even though he reassures me that it's okay, I keep thinking that one day he's going to have enough with my attitude.

I know that the people who matter love me, and I should be grateful for that. 
But as grateful as I am, I've thought of disappearing to avoid the possibility that I will become worse and probably drive them all away.
