First time posting here, thought maybe it'd helpHi everyone. I've been depressed for a long time. Even been hospitalized for trying to end it before. Things are just so tough nowadays. I had two amazing friends who I thought cared about me but now I feel like they want nothing to do with me and I'm just a burden. I failed out of college and now I can't see myself having any real future. I'm miserable constantly and feel bead inside. What's really the point? What am I sticking around for? I'm not even sure anymore and I honestly just want to give up.
