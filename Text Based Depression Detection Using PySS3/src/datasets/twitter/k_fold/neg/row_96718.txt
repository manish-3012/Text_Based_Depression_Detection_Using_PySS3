I wish I had the nerve to kill myselfMy life is going nowhere but downhill. I was always supposed to be a high achiever. I had great grades in high school, killer SAT scores, captain of my sports team, NHS, all that shit. I got in to my dream school, but now it's all starting to come apart. I got super depressed last semester, and I would've failed out if I hadn't withdrawn from my classes at the last minute. I'm taking this semester off, but I don't see myself ever getting back to a mental state where I can be successful in school, so I'll probably just end up flunking out. If I can't graduate from college, I'll never be able to achieve any of my dreams, so I'll just end up back in my hometown working a shit job and being an emotional and financial burden on my family. I'm desperately in love with a woman who'll never love me back. I've tried to hang myself on many occasions since September, but every time I just end up bitching out one I have my head in the noose. All I want at this point is to find the courage to actually kill myself.
