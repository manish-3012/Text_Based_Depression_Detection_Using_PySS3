Youâ€™ve caught the carrot at the end of the stick, now what?Everything thatâ€™s dangled in front of people to keep them wageslaving away: fancy cars, nice houses, potential partners, etc, what utility does it provide? How can you justify always trying, always striving, when it all becomes a novelty after prolonged familiarity? What can this world offer, other than fleeting moments? You got the promotion, got yourself a big raise, youâ€™re ecstatic, and now itâ€™s 7:30 AM tomorrow and you need to begin again. For what exactly? You mad out your 401k, you retire and begin to collect, only to find itâ€™s far past the time you could enjoy that money to its full extent. Try hard for today, and today disappears and the efforts to get to today are rendered fruitless. Try hard for tomorrow, and tomorrow cannot be enjoyed as much as today. 

Why does anyone march on?
