Help?Hey, r/suicidewatch. I was sent here from r/AskReddit.  A good friend of mine is extremely depressed, has mentioned suicide frequent times, but I know from experience that telling adults will just make him feel cornered. Telling someone is not an option right now. For those of you who have been suicidal, what did you need to hear to talk you down?  What did you need? Some background, he's a teenager, well-off financially, smart, good-looking, but he feels unloved. He has chronic anxiety and takes meds for it, but it doesn't seem to help. I want total honesty, reddit. Brutal honesty. What should I do?
