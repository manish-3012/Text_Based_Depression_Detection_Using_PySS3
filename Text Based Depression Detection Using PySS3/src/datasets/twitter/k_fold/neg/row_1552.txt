The night is the worstEvery night I stay awake
thinking about the things in life.
Thinking about the light to come
when I really need it the most.
But it doesn't come it hides away as I lay there in terrible mental pain. I hope one
day I tie the rope and jump. Can't focus on school my find is filled with suicidal thoughts, completely polluted with terrible thoughts. My parents know about my depression but they just don't understand so I bottle in my depression. I put a mask on around my friends and family hoping it ends but it never does.
