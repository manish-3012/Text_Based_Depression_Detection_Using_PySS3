AdviceWhenever I bring up a genuine problem or concern of mine I have with my girlfriend she always shoots my down and turns it on me. I told her to stop mocking me and she in return said donâ€™t get frustrated or some shit. It makes me lose interest in her and it doesnâ€™t help Iâ€™m already mentally unstable. Soon I may either break up with her or remove myself from the picture. I donâ€™t wanna do either, could someone give help/advice
