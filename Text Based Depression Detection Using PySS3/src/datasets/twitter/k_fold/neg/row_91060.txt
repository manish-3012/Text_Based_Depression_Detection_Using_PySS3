Could need an adviseSo this is my first post on reddit ever but I just need an advise. I don't even know where to start but let me put it this way... My parents divorced this year after a long time beefing around. I'm still living with my mother (she's diagnosed with depression and burnout) she isn't working for like 9 weeks now, laying on the couch, doing some shit with her sewing mashine and going out with her friends drinking and doing whatever she does, actually i don't even care what she does when she's out with her friends I'm just happy when she is not there. Me and my gf are happy together and she decided to come over for a couple of months and trust me this was her worst decision in a long time. We are doing everything in the house, from cooking to cleaning and still hear shit of my mother like "You never clean up" "you are just laying lazy on the couch" "you are not helping me with anything" and guys trust me, im working full time, some days up to 13 hours, doing all i can for my gf and me to be able to get us our own flat, but it all seems like I can't do it. So today i told her (my mom) I'm done with this shitshow and won't be there on Christmas and now she is super pissed told me the same stuff as always so my gf decided to not coming back to my house ( im at her house which is an hour far from me) i don't know how to handle everything anymore. I have to work but don't want to leave my girl alone here, I want a flat but I only get refuses. Everything is just super fucked up and I'm getting in this super suicidal mood again. I just want to end everything, forget all the pain, forget all the anger but I don't want make this step but feeling more and more happy with the thought if being there anymore. But then there is my girlfriend who's always been there for me, my sister, my best friend who lost his cousin to suicide 2 years ago and i simply can't do it. I don't even know what could help, I mean I'm definetly not dumb but I feel so useless. I was in therapy since I was 6 but nothing was helping. I never cut myself or something but this constant thoughts about killing myself won't go away, it was better a long time but now it's worse than ever. My options atm are to leave my family behind me and try to start a new life with my girlfriend, simply go into stationary therapy (this means i can't work, won't get money and won't be able to afford a flat), keep on fighting which will maybe destroy me, take a break from everything around me to calm down a little (this won't solve my problems but delay them). 
And excuse my bad english it's not my native language. So u guys have any ideas what I should do to feel better again? To get rid of this thoughts? To simply smile honest one more time? Im clueless.
