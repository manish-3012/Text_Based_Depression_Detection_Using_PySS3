The only reasonEveryday I wake up and make breakfast, send one little off to school then spend the day doing my mom job. I love my children so incredibly much to the point it hurts. But everyday when I go to sleep I hope I don't wake up in the morning... Imagining how their lives would be without me is the only thing that keeps me here. Thinking how they would feel I abandoned them or somehow like it was because of them, I couldn't put that on them. Sometimes that isn't enough though. There are days where pulling myself out of bed takes so much effort I just lay there for half an hour in the dark. If it wasn't for those three littles I would lay in bed all day, not shower, not even exist.
