an obsession has wasted 4+ years of my lifeive been obsessed with a girl who does not share the same feelings towards me. we talk, we're friends, but our relationship isnt what i wanted. my craving of her opinions, needing to hear her voice, and jealousy of her doing things without me hurts and i dont know what to do.  its some strange addiction that kills me a little more everytime i come back.  i supposed ive been able to put these feelings aside until recently. 
 when i look back over the last 4 years, i realize how much ive changed. i can hardly recognize myself. i dont know what MY opinions are, what my voice is.  ive been so consumed with trying to be someone im not that i dont know who i am anymore.  it pains me to look at old photos or texts as EvERY SINGLE THING reminds me of her and a shadow of my former self. the thought of her moving to another state this august feels like a rusty knife stabbing into my chest.  ill probably never see her again.  i get there are other people in the world, but as of right now, i dont know how to get over this obsession, and i dont know who i am. i know my problem isnt as severe as others here, but ive really struggled with depression in the past and can feel myself relapsing into a bottomless pit. please someone tell me something i wanna hear
