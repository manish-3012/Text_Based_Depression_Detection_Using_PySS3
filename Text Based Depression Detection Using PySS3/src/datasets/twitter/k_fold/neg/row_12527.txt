I want my brain to stop workingall i do is think. my mind is constantly racing at 1000 mph. at 20 years old, i should not have dark bags under my eyes that are THIS big, 24 hours 7 days a week. i am in so much pain, and i am under so much stress to succeed. i canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. i am so close to just running away from everything and killing myself in a place where no one can find me. i just want all of this to fucking stop
