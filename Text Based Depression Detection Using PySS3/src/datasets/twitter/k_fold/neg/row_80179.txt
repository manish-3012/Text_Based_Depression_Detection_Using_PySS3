Being born ugly ruined my life and there is no point torturing myself by going on.I'm only 21 years old, but I  look like I'm in my late 30's. I have never been able to wear stylish clothing I've liked, no hairstyle would ever look good on me that isn't copied from your average office worker. My face looks like I've been run over by a truck, there's no fixing it, not even plastic can re-build my face. Why do I have to live like this? Why does my life have to be restricted because of things I can't control? I can't do anything I want because I'm so ugly, not even camming. Nobody understands me because all of you are fine looking, nobody understands me I can't just shrug my face off I'm stuck with it for life and there is no cure.
