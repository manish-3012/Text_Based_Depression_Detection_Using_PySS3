My head hurts every dayIts not even like a headache its just head pressure. Ever since last year since I did Magic Mushrooms and got paranoia n some pyschosis my head feels very weird. It's very unsettling. I hate this pressure in my head. If I meditate it makes it worse. How cursed am I ?? Magic Mushrooms can bring people more peace and it did for me at first. But then it showed me a type of hell I never knew and well , now everyday is more hellish. I csnt smoke weed anymore due to that experience or drink. Theres no happiness or pleasure in my life. I'm trapped in this body :/ I already failed ever going through with suicide i cant bring myself to do it
