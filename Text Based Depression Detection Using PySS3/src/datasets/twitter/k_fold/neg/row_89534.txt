Perfect music to go with my methodI already have a method planned out since last time I posted that is foolproof. The success rate is 100% and shouldnt be all that painful and will be quick if nobody finds me within a few hours.

I have been listening to all my favorite songs that I have liked and listened to since I started being a music fan at 14 and have been trying to find the perfect song to match the occasion when I do die and also be a good reflection of the totality of my life and personality. 

It's been fairly warm here in Southern California and winter is finally over. One last thing to enjoy before I croak. I have been listening to a lot of Jazz music, funk, alternative, indie, pop, jrock, and video game soundtracks too. 

In the face of all my problems that persist everyday, I get a deep sensation of happiness and also intense sadness that I wont be here anymore to enjoy the things I used to enjoy anymore. But I plan to be at peace with everything. It won't be very long until this life is no longer mine.
