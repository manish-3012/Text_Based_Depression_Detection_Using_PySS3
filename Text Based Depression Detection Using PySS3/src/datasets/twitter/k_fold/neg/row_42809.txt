My post got removed and they don't even answer whyI posted this yesterday and i didn't even finished reading all comments, 

https://old.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hp07wh/be_good_at_school_think_of_your_career_make/

yet they dont even answer why when i message them. One Mod answered me it was because "it was giving advice", when it obviously wasnt giving advice, so a bullshit reason.
