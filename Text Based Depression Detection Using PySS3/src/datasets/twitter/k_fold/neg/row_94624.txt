ByeI'm tired of feeling the way i do, im tired of being me. I was sexually abused for 7 years. emotionally abused my whole life my family doesnt want me. oh and i cut. i have had 4 miscarriages, i am far from perfect and it pisses me off i had such a crappy life when i look around and see happy people it hurts, its like a knife stabbing me over and over again. i have everything i need to die. so why not just do it... im sure everything and everyone would be okay without me im tired of pretending im okay. im tired of being me. its over.
