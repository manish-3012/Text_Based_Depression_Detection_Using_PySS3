My family constantly invalidates me and I'm so tired of itI just got off 2 weeks from work because I'm sick. I was coughing and had the chills in 90F weather. My boss thinks I might have covid. 

But here goes my grandmother saying "You shouldn't have had off. I don't think you're that sick." 

Being in this toxic family has caused me so many issues. I hate it here. I'm tired of my feelings and now physical sickness even being invalidated.
