The Thought of SuicideI posted here about a week about saying I was gonna kill myself. There were some major problems going on in my life but as of now they seem to be resolved.

 But now, even though I donâ€™t desperately need to die I still think about Suicide. Iâ€™m worthless i hate the person that I am and their is a constant voice in my head repeating all of my insecurities and mistakes. Iâ€™m constantly stressed out and in pain, But, when every I think about suicide all those feelings go away. I donâ€™t care that Iâ€™m not the smartest or the most handsome or that I have messed up my life. Because it doesnâ€™t matter anymore when your dead. Iâ€™m posting again because Iâ€™m against a wall and I feel like itâ€™s only a matter of months before I go though with it.

Please help me
