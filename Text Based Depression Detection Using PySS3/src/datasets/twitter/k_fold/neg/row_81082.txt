Parents (maybe?) think I donâ€™t actually feel this waySo I (18f) hate talking about my emotions. It took me 3 years before I mentioned suicidal thoughts and actions to my therapist, who unfortunately switched agencies right after I told her. 

Due to me telling her this, my new therapist asked to see me monthly instead of every three months.  

Okay so some background: A few weeks ago I was overwhelmed by everything I had to do with college/school/extracurriculares. My dad ended up yelling at me that I should have done all of it sooner and started comparing me to him (he worked, played varsity sports, took only honors, and hung out with his friends almost every night). This isnâ€™t the first time heâ€™s compared me to him and I blew up. I am a relatively calm person and I have never gotten this upset before. I ended up confessing that Iâ€™ve wanted to die for the past few years and â€œdid he ever consider I wasnâ€™t him and I could never be perfect like he wasâ€. 


Since then both my parents have completely ignored me saying this and I think they may think I made it up in the heat of the moment and exaggerated. I am really good at pretending to be happy and sociable most of the time so I guess I wasnâ€™t surprised. 

Tonight my mom texted me and asked why I had to go to therapy again and asked me to cancel so I did.

Iâ€™m just so annoyed right now and I know itâ€™s horrible to say but i if I ever do kill myself the last thing I would say to them is â€œdonâ€™t you wish you believed meâ€
