My suicidal and self harming tendencies are constant and come in great wavesI beg of anyone to reccomend coping activities, I cannot go outside where I live, I habitually find myself unable to complete the work that i desperately want to complete due to these constant waves of depression and suicidal thoughts. All I can do is lie motionless while every bit of work I've put in slowly goes to waste. My partner is suffering from my inability to be emotionally present and I am so tired of this. I have been to multiple therapists and I have not had much progress with any, am I just doomed to accept this. I don't want to die, I know there would be so much suffering but I just want to leave this body, I don't want to be weighed down by this existence and I know just by thinking that, it is, in a way seeking suicide. Im So tired of everything I work for going to waste. It's so unfair. I'm just so tired, please does anyone have advice on what to seek or actions I could take when I hopefully climb out of this. I truly feel like I should just get enough money to pay for my funeral and pay off my debts and then walk into the ocean. It's selfish and it's a cop out but I just don't have the fucking energy, I'm being sucked dry by my own mind and it feels like I'm swallowing concrete everytime I have to get up in the morning to continue this existence
