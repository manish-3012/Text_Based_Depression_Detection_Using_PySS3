Has anyone ever gotten their 'spark' back?..While I was in highschool, the constant interaction coupled with my long distance girlfriend gave me loads of energy. I would get on Xbox and be yelling out the attack names on NarutoStorm with my friends, and IRL I made alot of people smile with how I acted. Well, I graduated highschool, and couldn't keep up keeping in contact with my friends. My girlfriend and I broke up, and my grandma killed herself before the end of the year. Around the same time, my mom's bipolar disorder got out of control. She started doing drugs and I had to practically babysit her. It ended with her falling asleep at the wheel of my car and busting in the headlight. This whole time, I've just been in my room playing Dragonball Fighterz. I work at FedEx too and have to wake up at 2am everyday. When I go in to work, everyone asks if I'm ok. People all around me have this inside joke about my depression and how it reflects off my face. I honestly have no idea what to do. I've never been in a face to face relationship, and I've lost the myself in depression. When I wake up I feel horrible, and have almost driven off the road angry at my shitty self reflections a few times. I just want my energy back. What am I supposed to do?...
