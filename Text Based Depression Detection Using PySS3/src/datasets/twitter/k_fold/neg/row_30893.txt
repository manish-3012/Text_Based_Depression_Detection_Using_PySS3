When will I ever do something right?I just made toast for my grandmother and she complained how I didn't do it right and how one of these days this 'house's will get something right.

Just last week I was writing my suicide note. Iwas crying to myself of why god had to take my mum away when everyone liked her and I am just the opposite.

My aunt told me the stuff I did last year when my grandfather took a heart attack was not god enough such as failing my course,picking up my cousin from school which meant taking days off and cleaning before picking her up,restless days and sleepless nights and it was just not enough.

I just feel like I should of died not my mum.
