:((feeling depressed, the guy iâ€™ve liked for so long and he liked me back just wants to be friends w benefits and i went into it only because i have so many feelings for him but my heart is so broken, itâ€™s ruining me, i want to quit my part time jobs outside of school and just do nothing, my parents are in the process of getting divorced and my dad keeps drinking too much, they get violent and iâ€™m the only adult in the house sometimes, iâ€™m so spiritual and positive but i feel like everything is always just faking it. iâ€™m so sad. iâ€™m so lonely. i just wanna be hurt so people will love me and care . no one cares. iâ€™m just crying in bed in the dark. :(
