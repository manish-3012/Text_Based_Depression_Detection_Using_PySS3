I [19NB] don't know how to help my best friend [20NB] not to commit suicide... Please help me, I don't know how much time's left.My best friend [20NB] is struggling with depression and anxiety (they were already diagnosed with it).  Last saturday they told me they hadn't gone outsite for like 2 days and that they hadn't eaten anything in 4 days.  I [19NB] brought a pizza to their house but, as they didn't want me to see them like that, I just closed my eyes, gave them the pizza and left (they wanted to be alone).  They told me that if they were to kill themselves, they'll tell me first.  On Sunday I took some food for them but they didn't open the door, so after waiting for an hour I took the food to my place and ate it. 
 Yesterday they just asked me to ask for an uber for them but I couldn't as I was on school.  After some time, I found out they ended up in the hospital (they haven't told me why).  They're "fine" now, in their place.

I don't know how to deal with it.  I feel so powerless...  I would help them all the time if they let me, but they don't.  I am so scared they would kill themselves.  What can I do?
