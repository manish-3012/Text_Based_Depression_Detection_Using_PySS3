When you want to die, but an errand is more important.I cannot help but laugh at the comedy of errors this life of mine is. 

I was supposed to be dying today, had it all planned. There was a time window of several hours when I was going to be alone, and therefore popping 80 crushed pills, would have ensured my demise.

But no, my parents rang up this morning, there is an errand which needs to taken care of, which will take a better part of the day.

Death is cancelled. Smh.
