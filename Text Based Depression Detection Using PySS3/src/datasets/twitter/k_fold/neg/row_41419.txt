Thinking about killing myself.My mother is suffering a lot. The one thing that stops me from doing it is her. But at the same time, she is the one that makes me want to do it.

I'm a victim of covert incest. My father died when I was four and I had to take on the role of "protector" for a mother who was 38 years older than me. She can't live without me, and vice versa.

I sacrificed a lot for her. And she for me. But I don't see a reason to go on anymore. I sometimes think she is losing her mind. Bit by bit.

I don't want to start a family. I don't want kids. I care for my dogs and cats. And that is it. I see women and I don't feel anything. It's amazing. I used to be such a horny teenager lol.

I can't stand the guilt trips. The insane logic. The emotional actions.

I've thoughts of different ways to do it.

Ok. I took her sleeping pills that she didn't want to take. I got some Johnny Walker and I'm thinking of just mixing that shit. I'm just scared that I'll wake up with nerve damage or something. I don't wanna come out of it even worse.

Another option would be to hang myself. Seen how to tie a hangman noose on YouTube. It seems quite lethal. But again, I'm scared it goes wrong.

...Suicide isn't that simple!

Thought about standing in front of a moving train, but fuck, that seems really brutal.

I sometimes think about not killing myself. To hold on. I'd wait for my mother to die. Could take years. Decades.

I think I'd resort to alcohol to deal with it. Or drugs.

I've even thought about committing crimes to get to prison in order to get away from her. I dunno.

It's fucked.

I dunno. Is there someone else out there, that just doesn't see the point either? The nihilism?
