are some of us suicidal because we're intelligentI have low IQ, im terrible at language, memorizing and math but i have very high EQ. 

ever since i was a child, i always noticed ppl said unusual things. things that didn't make any sense at all. when i grew up and started to work, i noticed that things aren't any different. ppl are still saying things that just doesn't make any sense. 

i think people are delusional and stupid. not stupid in a sense of academics or career but their way of beliefs, thinking and reasoning. 

two reasons why im' suicidal is because i cannot connect with majority of population. their way of thinking is so off putting to me. ppl say silly things and think they are being funny. I just can't connect with most ppl

second reason, everything we do is pointless. do ppl not realize this? how do ppl put in any kind of work when it's pointless and stupid. life just seems meaningless when ur working all the time.
