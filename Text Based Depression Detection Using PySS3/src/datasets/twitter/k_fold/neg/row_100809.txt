I just wanna be non existentThis is just getting too much for me. Yesterday i had a doctors appointment, who told me afterwards i had a development disorder (I'm 18), just because I see no sense in living, feel like the government and society is dumb as fuck, and the system is unfair for normal people as well. How's going through the world with open eyes a development dysfunction?
It just broke me down to a point i don't think i will recover from anymore. And please don't say something like we can talk, you matter, bla bla. I've heard it all and it's all just empty words.
I wanna end it so badly, i think I'll get my stuff soon and just do it no matter the result.
