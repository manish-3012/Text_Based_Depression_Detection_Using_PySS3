When will it be enough?I'm living my life on autopilot, dragging my feet head down through the days hoping that something terrible will happen to me. Mostly because I'm too weak to take my life myself, just another thing added to the long list of my failures and shortcomings. Nobody listens to me, nobody cares about anyone other than themselves. I've confided in countless people, and the extent of my support ends as the bottle does, as the lines fade away into obscurity. I am a part-time friend to many and a full-time loser to most.

Accomplishments, I have none. I failed my red seal, something I've been training for years to do I couldn't even succeed in. I didn't even care enough to study, I don't give a fuck about anything anymore, it's hard to care without a heart. Failed musically, not even good at that, just a fucking phony. Failed at lifting, I can't dedicate myself to anything.

I have never been good at anything.

I didn't even graduate from high school for fuck's sake, I should have given up back then.

...then I wouldn't have had to go through the pain of losing you... The agony this past year has been so incredibly severe, and, despite everything I've tried, it won't go away.

I just want to go back to where we were but we never will.

**How could I trust someone like you? Better yet, how could you love someone like me?**
