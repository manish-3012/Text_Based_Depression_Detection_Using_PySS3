Life is so just so hard.It's not hard in the sense to me of eventually being able to live on my own or 'make it' per se. It has been hard in different ways for me. It all really comes to friendships and relationships. I've always been an awkward person, I guess you can say, perhaps a bit shy. But if people ever gave me a chance, I feel I was decent at conversing and being a good person. The friends I had from high school, we all pretty much went are different ways, and now I don't really have that much friends. Moreover, I am starting at UC San Diego as a senior (skipping junior year by taking many classes), and I want to finish as soon as possible because I am 23, and I am a math major, so I essentially will be studying everyday for the next 350 days. So I am older than most of my peers, so I feel it would be very hard to find a good friendship here at UC San Diego.

Moreover, with respect to relationships...they have been bad besides my last one.

Essentially, I met all 4 of my relationships online from dating apps, either ok cupid or meetme. the first 3 relationships...well they all cheated on me. The fourth relationship I had, it was amazing, but I fucked it up big time. I was insecure and mean to her a lot because I was just facing issues. I just feel I fucked it up so much. She is such an amazing women, and I really hope she finds a guy to love her for her because she was the best thing that ever happened to me and I just feel horrible. She cut all contact with me, rightfully so. I am not going to stalk her or be a crazy person and make a fake account to add her or something or use a fake number. As much as I just want to talk to her again and hear her voice one more time, I know it is over. I would wait forever for this lady, but I know she is so amazing, that she will probably find someone else within a couple of months.  I just kind of don't want to live anymore. People will always say there is someone better out there for you. But is that really true? She was non-materialistic, kind, nice, funny, loving, everything you would want in a lady and I ruined it. Given after this year I graduate, and then I either work or go to a masters program, and then find a good job, I will have a good job and a good livelihood, which is what we all aim for as humans, but this hurts the most. I am not sure I can find someone amazing as her again and it just sucks. I don't think I deserve to live anymore.
