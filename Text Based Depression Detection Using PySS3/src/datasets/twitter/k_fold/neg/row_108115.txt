Donâ€™t know what to say hereHey everyone here if you read this,
Iâ€™m not here for pity or people trying to tell me to do otherwise or anything.
I donâ€™t really know what to say or what to write. But Iâ€™ve been thinking of ending my life a lot recently. This isnâ€™t the first time and I know it wonâ€™t be the last of these thoughts. Itâ€™s been years. Years Iâ€™ve been living and accepting these thoughts. But recently they seem more viable. When ever I thought about suicide before there were little options, such as shooting myself or other quick/painless means. Recently itâ€™s changed. From jumping off of buildings to medicated assistance to planty of others. At this point I do but donâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to because of how my family will feel: how my sisters and mother will feel. But I feel I donâ€™t have avenues to talk to anyone about it, not at least anybody whoâ€™s opinion will REALLY matter to me. I recognize this as a problem but I donâ€™t know a solution. Iâ€™m lost without a prupuse and the thoughts are getting rampant. Iâ€™ve been drinking so much which so no help and Iâ€™m drunk now. Iâ€™m in the military and I feel like things like this will be shamed by those around me and my friends. I just donâ€™t know how to cope anymore and donâ€™t know where to turn. I didnâ€™t used to be like this, I used to have fun in the simplest times and enjoy as much as I could. I just learned to fake joy In most my interactions. The people around me are great, Iâ€™m just not anymore.
