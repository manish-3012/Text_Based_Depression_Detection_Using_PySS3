I can't remember what I'm fighting for.I've had my ups and downs for as long as I can remember. I go long stretches of being ok then I'm rock bottom. I use to tell myself I had to live because of my kids. I realized tonight though that I'm a really shitty parent and they don't need me by any means. I'm a SAHM. I don't contribute to their financial care, I can't even keep the house clean for longer than a couple months at a time. I'm terrible at teaching them discipline and self control. Really, just a shitty mom. My partner pointed out to me that I'm a shit wife too. It really made me stop and think. Do they really even need me here at all? Would they benefit from my absence? 

I'm down to two options: get better or be gone. I know how to be gone. I have no idea how to get better. What the fuck am I even doing here?
