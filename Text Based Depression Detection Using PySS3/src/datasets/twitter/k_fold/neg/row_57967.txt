Still not betterI made a post 4 days ago and have been watched rather extensively at work and at home. The therapist I see cannot prescribe medicines. The earliest psychiatrist appointment is at least 3 weeks and no way to get the medicine I need sooner.

I am an ultradian rapid cycler with BPD type 1. I am fighting a losing battle. I've attempted it 4 times at the end of last year, the last two times found with the blade still in my arm. I have no desire to fight any more. I have no true anchors left to want to stay alive. I am broken and hollow.

Why do others insist on me staying alive when it hurts so much?
