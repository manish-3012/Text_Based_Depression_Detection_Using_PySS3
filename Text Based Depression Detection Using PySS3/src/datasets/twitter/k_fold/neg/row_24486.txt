Really lonely. No anxiety, no immediate pressures, just really, really, really lonely.I've been this way since I was 10 or so. I don't think it's going to end. I have no friends, no family. My birthday is soon but I have no gifts (I bought myself one and wrapped it... #foreveralone.)

I don't really entirely know why I'm posting here. I found out that I can't go back to school this year because I have no money and I already can't make enough at my job as it is. I'm so tired. I'm so, so tired. 

I want this to end. I'm not in immediate distress, there's nothing pressing on me except the things that have been there for years and it's coming to a head because from now on, I'm coming home to an empty apartment, a gigantic fat body, and a useless everything-else (brain, body, etc.) I just don't think I'm going to be wanted, so what's the point?
