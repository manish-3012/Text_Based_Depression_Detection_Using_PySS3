Help with a suicidal childHes 12 years old, he's on reddit, he wants to slice his throat, i, don't know what to do, came across eachother by chance, 

So far ive just been getting him to talk about himself through PMs, we live in separate countries as well and theres not a lot of information i have to work with.

Im no good with this, im not a great person, i can't empathize which is making this hard because i cant see any physical cues to work with.

I just need advice
