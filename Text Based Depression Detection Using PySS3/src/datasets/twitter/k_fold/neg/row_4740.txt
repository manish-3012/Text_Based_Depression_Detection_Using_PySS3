I'm breaking up with a suicidal partner...My partner is depressed and has some serious problems with alcohol. Thankfully, (following an extremely dark night) she's been taking medication, seeing a therapist, and has been controlling her drinking. It's been great to see her make progress.

But, here's the kicker - I don't want to be with her anymore. I love her so much, like family, but the romantic relationship isn't working out for me. 

A few days ago I told her exactly that.

Since then she's admitted that she's been thinking about suicide often. Mulling over the 'best' ways she can do it, the 'right' cocktail of pills, the 'right' technique. She's mentioned trying to change her will, and has been making a lot of references to killing herself. We still live together for the moment, and every time I come home I brace myself...

I don't know what the fuck to do. I love her, but don't want to be in a relationship. If I move out I'm terrified that she'll try to commit suicide. She's capable of it - I've seen her in that state before.

I really need advice. How do I help her? 

I'm sorry if this post is in the wrong place. Please tell me and I'll take it down straight away. Thank-you.
