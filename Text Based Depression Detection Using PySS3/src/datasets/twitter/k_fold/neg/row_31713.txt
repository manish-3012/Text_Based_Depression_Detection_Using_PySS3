I feel trappedI just feel so trapped in my life. Between my depression and my medications my body is destroyed.  I can't leave my house.  I have no friends. My family doesn't care.  All my dreams, hopes, and goals in life have been destroyed.  I feel so alone and broken.  I don't have anything or anyone.  

I can't get on disability, I can't afford psychiatric care that I would need.  I spent my whole childhood being abused and shattered in a million different ways.  I just want this non existence to end.  I have spent years in my room out of fear of everyone and everything. I just can't do this anymore. I can't. I refuse.  Everything just hurts and nothing is distracting me from the pain of being alive anymore.  I don't want to die, but I have nothing to live for and no one really cares.  

I'm unimportant and I'm tired. Tired of the hallucinations, tired of the voices, tired of being scared, tired of feeling just so overwhelmingly miserable all the time.  
I just can't do it anymore.
