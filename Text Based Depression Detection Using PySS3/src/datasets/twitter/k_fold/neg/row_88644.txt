This could be itI am worthless, I am nobody, I am undesirable. Pretty sure nobody would even care if I took my own life. I'm just wasting away, I don't have anyone to turn to anymore, probably because I scared off/annoyed the ones I sought for help. I might just do this afterall. Time to take my life.
