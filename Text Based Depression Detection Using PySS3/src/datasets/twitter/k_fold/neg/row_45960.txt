Question about going to the hospitalSo I'm incredibly depressed and I have noone to talk to. Call me pessimistic, but I think talking talking to someone via Reddit does not seem like it would be very helpful. If I were to go to the ER right now to speak with someone, what would the entire process be like? I have suicidal thoughts everyday, but I don't have the courage to actually follow through with it. If I wanted to be discharged, would I have to be picked up by someone (I'm 19)? Also, would they not discharge me? The last time I went to a hospital with suicidal thoughts, I was transported to a psychiatric ward at some private clinic. But I actually called 911 and told them I was at risk to kill myself. 

TL;DR: I want to go to the ER, but I do not want to be held there or transported elsewhere. What do I do?
