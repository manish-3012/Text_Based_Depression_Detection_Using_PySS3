Just a vent maybe it will helpWell it's been a bit since I posted, life's been looking up. The only problem is, why am I not happy, I mean there's short bursts that give me hope that I've got this problem under control. I mean I have everything I need to be happy. The worst are the thoughts that won't stop. Your not worthy, why do you expect things to turn out any different than they have before. Why try, you will only fuck it up. At work I'm the one that jokes around and makes everyone laugh, when I'm home, I don't laugh I just sit here and try to reassure myself that I'm doing all right that I can do this. It's getting harder to think like that. I just want some fucking peace.
