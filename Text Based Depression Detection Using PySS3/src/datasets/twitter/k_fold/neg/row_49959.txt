I feel like thereâ€™s nobody there.This is probably going to sound so stupid but honestly it really just has me feeling like maybe I am worthless. 
FaceTiming this person I like tonight and for some reason â€œnice guys finish lastâ€ was brought up early on but was never expanded on. 
Fast forward to the end of the conversation, she proceeds to tell me that I am a super nice guy and that I wonâ€™t always finish last and thereâ€™s someone out there for me but itâ€™s just not her. And that just really broke me. She isnâ€™t the first to do this, it happens oh too often. I guess just hearing it this time just really made me feel worthless. 
I just wish I could disappear. 
See how the world wouldnâ€™t change without me. 
If I donâ€™t know, I just know that later in life I will just pass away alone. 
I could be in a crowded place and just feel like the only person left alive on earth.
