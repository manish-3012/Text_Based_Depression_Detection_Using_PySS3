There's No Reason for me to Continue to ExistThere's no reason I should be alive or continue to live.


I have no dreams.


No aspirations.


No passions.


No interests.


No friends.



I'm nothing but a burden on my family and the world. 


I make a mess.


I leave things to rot.


I cause contention with my loved ones. 


I contribute nothing

.
I use up resources.


All I do is spread my misery to others.




I'm nothing valuable to this world.


I don't go to school.


I don't work.


I don't volunteer.


I have no desire, drive, aspirations or passion.


I only leave my house to go to doctors appointments.


I live in constant pain.


I don't know how to deal with anxiety, so I tear open my skin till I am covered in painful wounds, lesions and sometimes infections, so I may litterally rot.


I take over 15 pills a day.


I spend all day on my phone and computer, looking at reddit and YouTube, chasing the feeling of grasping at distant happiness.



No future.


No future.


No nothing.


I'm worthless.


The one person who truly understood me and was always there for me, more than a best friend, more like a platonic soulmate, broke her promise to always keep trying to live as long as I did; to talk to me if she wanted to die. Our most sacred contract and promise.



She broke it, and killed herself.


And all I want to do now is go be with her.


The trauma that has contributed to the wreckage of my life I can't even describe truly. My brain has locked it away as a foggy distant concept spectre to haunt and torture me, but to never access or understand.


I simply go on so I don't break my family's hearts. But in the end theyd truly be better off without me.


I don't know how to keep going. I'm losing my grip and no longer see a reason to hold on.

Let go


Drop into the void


Embrace the end


The only logical action is to die, as I was meant to.
