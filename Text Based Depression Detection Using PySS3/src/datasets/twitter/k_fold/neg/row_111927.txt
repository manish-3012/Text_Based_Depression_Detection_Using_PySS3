Reddit, I'm scared. I've never been so low in my life and I can't stop myself from daydreaming of jumping off a roof. I just need encouragement or something.Reddit, my whole life has been punched in the nutsack. I was set to join the military, ready to commit myself to something I didn't really believe in to get where I wanted to be, an ends justify the means sort of deal, when it was found that I have a condition that disqualifies me from joining (I don't want to get specific, it's a physical problem, not psychological). All at once I realized that not only do I not have a plan B, I put EVERYTHING I had into plan A. Basically what I'm looking for is advice. I'm going to try to remove as many specifics as possible because I'm terrified one of my friends or family will find this.

First, some facts:

- I have done about 52 semester hours worth of college, but my grades were terrible (mostly Cs, a few Bs, I'm not stupid I'm just an idiot when it comes to applying myself)

- I have roughly $152 in my bank account, and my $342 car payment isn't due until September 9th.

- My car is worth $13500 (roughly) and I owe $16200 on it.

- I am currently living with my Dad, who will let me live with him for free as long as I'm going to school.

- My Grandma will pay for me to go to school if I can prove I'm a [state I live in] resident and get the [state I live in] resident tuition, which I can't do because I never got a Driver's License when I moved here and all of my bills are online.

- I pay $60 a month for my cell phone, which I absolutely will not get rid of.

- My insurance for my car is roughly $90 a month.

- I have absolutely no skills. I am decent with computers. I'm good at pretending I'm not depressed. I have no certifications, and the only classes I've taken have been general education stuff (English, History, Biology etc.)

- I have a $900 laptop, but it wouldn't sell for that much. I could probably get $750-800 for it tops. Selling it would only be a temporary solution, and I'd have to buy something cheaper to replace it.

- I also have a custom-built desktop that I could probably sell for $400 or so. It has an overclocked Athlon II 245, 5670, 4GB Ram, and I have a 19" 1440x900 TV/monitor I could include with it for like $100 more. Again, selling this would only be a temporary solution.

Basically, shit doesn't add up. I have $500 a month in expenses, and if I'm going to school full time (if I can even pull that off) in order to stay in my Dad's house, I won't be able to work much. I'll basically be a slave to school and work and I'm just completely sick of it. I want to go to school but I want a little financial freedom too. I'm stuck with my car and it makes me rage that I can't do anything about it except deal with it.

I'm sure I sound like a whiny little bitch that has it better than a lot of people but that doesn't change the fact that I'm completely more stressed out than I'm used to, and it's really wearing on me emotionally. Agh, I'm not sure if I captured my situation completely, I just feel like my only choice is to go through life, and I don't get the option to be happy. It's draining.
