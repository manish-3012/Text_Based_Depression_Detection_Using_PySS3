I won't kill myself. My feelings will kill me.I fucking feel wrecked. All the time. Since my parents divorced. Since I got bullied by my "friends" on literally all the schools I've been in. Since, because of my stupid emotions, I stalked a girl on high school and lost all of my friends except an edgelord who is still doing that meaningless RPG things. Since my video game addiction starts ending and my senses are coming back from blur.

I feel like an absolute loser. An abomination. On the surface things are going really good in my life. I'm in a very good university in my country and finally feeling like a human, not like a ruthless robot. But I can't help myself to do going back. Thinking about what they have done to me, what would I say them if I ever see them again. Playing same video games again, again and again only for feeling that nostalgia and forgetting all the weight of failures. Because of this, my class repetition draws near.

I still clearly remember that girl's fear when she looked at me. When I think them, I feel like I don't deserve to live. Even  they punished me back there, I must be punished more and more. They should bully me. They should not talk with me.

They should kill me.

I know all of this are in the past now, but the past is still living inside. Like everyone. I know that all of this case is like a feather of a bird compared to all sub, but this is what I lived.

And I've been trying, and will try to make an end of this feelings. Before they kill me.
