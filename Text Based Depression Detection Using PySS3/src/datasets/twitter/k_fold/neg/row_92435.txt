Fuck life.This isnâ€™t going to be coherent. This is just a rant. Someone, please read. Iâ€™m sorry.

Iâ€™m a gay male in highschool.

I was talking to a boy on discord (yeah, laugh at me all you want), and we were good friends, as good as you can be with Internet people. Heâ€™s really lonely and sad like me, we both lament our lack of a boyfriend. Anyway, he only lives an hour or two away from what I can tell, so I was really happy. I donâ€™t even know any gay people in real life, i was so excited because I thought he might be interested in me. I kinda confessed my feelings to him, and he didnâ€™t reciprocate. 

Why??? Why wouldnâ€™t he? Heâ€™s just as lonely as me? He complains about not having love all the time!! Iâ€™m right fucked here and he throws me aside!? I hate being gay so much. Why does no one love me? Iâ€™ll never have a boyfriend, I know it!! He was perfect for me, and I should have been perfect for him! I want to kill myself so badly. Why fucking wait? Why wait to die alone? Why suffer looking for the guy that doesnâ€™t even fucking exist? Iâ€™ll just end it now. Iâ€™m killing my self before 21, Iâ€™m promising myself. God, I hate everything. One fucking guy could save me, and life wont even give me that. Sorry for being incoherent. Thanks for reading my bullshit.
