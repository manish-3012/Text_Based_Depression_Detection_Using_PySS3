Song by Jacob NashSuicidal by Jacob Nash

I do not care about my life!
I cannot lie; I want to die!
Everybody hates me. When I'm gone, they won't miss me
I don't contribute to society; it would be better off without me
Everybody hates me. When I'm gone, they won't miss me
I don't contribute to society; it would be better off without me
