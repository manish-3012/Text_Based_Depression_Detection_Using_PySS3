There's actually no good reason for anyone to live.Evolutionarily, our purpose is hard wired into us, to find a mate and procreate. We've moved so far past that as a society that we don't have a reason to live, and relationships are flippant things that people use to satisfy their own selfish needs. Is the purpose is not to find love, and love no lingers exists, nothing is worth living for.
