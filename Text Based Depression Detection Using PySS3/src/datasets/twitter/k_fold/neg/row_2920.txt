I wish I had a single person I could confide inWhat a sad indictment on my life, that there's not a soul I can confide in.

Every single person in my life is a 'fair weather friend', when things are going well I'll see them.

I guess I'm a really shitty individual and I'm getting my just desserts.

On a positive note, at least when I get my shit together and end this god-awful existence, I won't have to feel guilty about people mourning me because they never really cared in the first place.
