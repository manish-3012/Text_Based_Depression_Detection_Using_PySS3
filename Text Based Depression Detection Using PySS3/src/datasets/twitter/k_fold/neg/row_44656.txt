Everyone talking about â€œvalidâ€ reasonsYet I want to kms because I hate myself. Legit Iâ€™m stupid, lazy, Boring, Poor with social interactions, overweight, bitchy, whiny, slob, bipolar, intense, canâ€™t commit to anything, irresponsable, anxious, donâ€™t know how to cook (I am a full grown woman), and so on.

I have zero other reasons as to why I want to die. I have a â€œgood lifeâ€. I just donâ€™t want to live with myself because of all of the above reasons, itâ€™s like living a nightmare within myself.

I probably wonâ€™t act on it, I just wanted to vent. Other people have it much worse than me and Iâ€™m just a weakling who canâ€™t handle anything.
