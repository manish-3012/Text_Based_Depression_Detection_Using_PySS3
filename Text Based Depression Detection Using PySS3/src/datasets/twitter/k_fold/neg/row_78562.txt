Well, Hereâ€™s the Truth: An Introduction and ConfessionI suppose I might as well introduce myself which is kind of ironic because I love privacy. 

I am:

* Constantly afraid, suicidal, and my body is almost always in flight or fight mode, giving me high anxiety and insomnia.
 
* Living with a high possibility of having a chronic illness that has been progressing over the course of my life. In the past months the progression has been rapid. 

* Young and should be getting new experiences, making friends, doing what I love (biking, hiking).

* Currently unemployed and unable to do what I love-work as a CNA/LNA-because of lightheadedness, a high heart rate when up, and intolerance being upright.

* Resistant to medications. They often donâ€™t work or my body creates tolerance fast.

* Living with a learning disability that makes me forget the previous sentence I just read. I am also dyslexic. 

* Heartbroken. I lost someone I loved more than anything in the world. I do not think I will get another relationship like this, if I even get the chance to have another relationship because of my health.

* Lonely, feeling disconnected because of what I am going through.

* Exhausted physical and mentally.

* For now, still hopeful.

I have:

* Made an unsuccessful suicide attempt early this year.

* A second chance at the cost of physical health that is not related to the attempt. 

* No friends. I lost them all because of my mental health. I moved far away.

I was:

* Diagnosed  with major depressive disorder at 13 and have always had anxiety.

* Bullied in school

* An outcast

* Raped

I wonder:

* What I will lose next, my body is falling apart. Itâ€™s now happening rapidly. Today, my fingers started to shake slowly uncontrollably. 

* How independent I will be in the future.

* If they will ever get to giving me a diagnosis in time. Iâ€™m in that deep.

* Why I couldnâ€™t be grateful for my past health, why I took it for granted.

* if Iâ€™ll ever meet my dream of becoming an RN or even work again.

* If I will be able to meet and have friends again.

* Will I ever get better? I know it could and that other people have it worse than me.

If I could:

* I would stop going through this.

* Iâ€™d be following my dreams and have the ability to do what I love.

* Ask for only one thing it would be for people to be kind and listen to each other.

On the surface I appear healthy, normal. Iâ€™m not. Thereâ€™s so much invisible about us and the people we interact with.
