my mom hates meI tried to wish her a happy mothers day today and all I got was a cold "thanks" in text form. I hate myself for not being the son she wants and I hate that I can't fix myself and I feel like it would be better if I just went away so she doesn't have to deal with me. she loves my step brothers more than she loves me and it's all because my shit stepfather hit me and scared me away. now I'm too scared to go back. 

I'm scared
