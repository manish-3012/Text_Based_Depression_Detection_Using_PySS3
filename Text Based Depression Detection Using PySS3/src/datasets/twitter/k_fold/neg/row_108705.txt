I wish I could just kill myself without hurting my family.I have a loving family I could never hurt by killing myself. But I just don't feel cut out for life. I want so badly to die. I've never been able to be happy by myself. And I'm not emotionally healthy enough to maintain a healthy relationship where I don't get utterly dependent on my partner.

My girlfriend and long time best friend just dumped me out of the blue. Just a couple months after we were making plans to move in together in the coming years. How do you continue after that? She's an amazing person and our relationship was beautiful and fun the whole way through. I just lost the best thing I've ever had and can ever imagine having. Even if I found someone else and built up another amazing relationship, I'd still be as dependent on it as ever. I don't have whatever it takes to make myself happy. 

My family and some not-that-close friends are there for me, but I just wish they weren't at this point. I feel fundamentally broken and I just don't want to continue anymore.
