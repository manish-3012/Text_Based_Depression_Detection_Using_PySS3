Day 2I made it. I made it through the day.. You know my story. I'm  the one who woke up with his arm and penis stuck to the floor in dried blood. I made it out of that, and I'm clean, dry, clothed, wrapped, taped..befriended..by people I'd never have met if I had cut just a little deeper, made the bath just a little redder.. But! i didnt. And yet, now I have the nagging wonder, the terror I might lose it and see how much it takes, the void. The loneliness.
