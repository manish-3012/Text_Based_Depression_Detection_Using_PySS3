Thoughts Are Strong TonightI feel like there are two sides of me which are always in conflict with each other. One wants to be a compassionate, proud and productive human being who loves his family and friends, but the other is an irritable, lazy, selfish  asshole who is indifferent to nearly everything. 

 In the past, I feel like I could always lock that asshole me away in order to seem normal. However, in writing this, I'm starting to recall how often I've been told I look unhappy or appear sad, so maybe I was't so good at locking him away. 

Anyways, in late January, I was laid off and after a little over a month of unemployment I feel like that asshole me is now my dominant personality. My condo is a mess, I haven't talked to anyone in weeks  and before today, I was on track to just sit at home until being unable to pay my bills at which point I was planning to order the parts required to make an exit bag.  

This negative feedback loop of depression that I was in should have ended today when I was finally contacted by a potential employer, yet I feel worse about my prospects than I did when I had no hope as I now have an opportunity to lose and I'm not sure if I'm in the right metal state to capitalize on it.

Not sure what else to say besides I've been thinking about suicide a lot lately.
