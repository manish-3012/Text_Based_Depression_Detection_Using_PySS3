Got a plan but have to wait til mid day tomorrow...Not a lot keeping me from just getting it over with. I guess this is a last ditch effort that some stranger who knows nothing about me will find the words to change my mind, but I think I'm going to finally do it tomorrow. I feel strangely proud of myself for finally having the courage to do it.
