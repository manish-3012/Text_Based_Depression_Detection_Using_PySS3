What else are you supposed to do?I've got a serious problem. A few years back I became very antisocial due to my daily interactions with people at my job. I quit my job because I couldn't deal with the death threats, how negative everyone was and how no one was ever in my corner. I was always the punching bag for the other employees and customers. My job which I went to extensive training for, was apparently to be abused and be blamed for everyone's problems. My last day I was stabbed in the chest and left for dead. My boss tried to twist it and say it was all my fault. I'd had enough of everyone's bullshit so I walked out. I didn't realize the mental damage that had been done by years of abuse. Now I can't talk to people face to face or on the phone. I've have until tomorrow to pack my stuff up because last month I was served an eviction notice. I'm not capable of interacting with other human beings because of my mental illness. I don't have the ability to ask for help. I've tried for over a year now to get help for my mental problem but have failed to do so. In all honesty I would rather die than leave me home. I don't like the world which I'm forced to live in. I don't like people and I don't know how to interact with them anymore. I probably won't even come back and read the responses to this. This is my last moments of life. I am far too gone for help now.
