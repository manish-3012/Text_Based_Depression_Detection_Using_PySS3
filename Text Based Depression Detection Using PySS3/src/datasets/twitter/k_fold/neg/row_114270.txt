Not related to suicide but everytime I remember this it makes me sad.So one time i was working in a tire repair  shop one of my customer ask me.

CUSTOMER: do you still go to school?
ME: No sir, college is too expensive for me, plus I  don't want to fall in a student dept trap. 
CUSTOMER: Well my son still go to school he's taking law, what about you what career choice you want.
ME: I wanna be an pilot
CUSTOMER: that's a good career choice, don't give up aim high ok.

At that point I want to cry! I ask myself  why a stranger... yes! Why a stranger cheering me encouraging me to reach my dreams and achieve my goal. But my own family pull me down telling to stop, telling me to forget my dreams, and forcing me to choose the career path that I don't wan't. 

After he leave I smile but deep inside I'm crying, I tell myself "yes I will reach my dreams even my family is against it"
