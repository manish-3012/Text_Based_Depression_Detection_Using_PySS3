Looking for reasons that I should keep trying. I guess whatever happens it is meant to be. Life has become so hard. All I want to do is scream or cry until my pain stops. I have had really bad nerve damage for more than 5 years. I don't want to say what type, because anyone who knows me or my normal reddit account will know who this is. I try to be happy, I really do; I put on a brave face for the world and tell everyone that I am okay, but I'm not. I'm really not. This disease has has put so much stress on my relationships and work life. I feel I am a worthless and a financial drain on the two people I love and depend on. I want out. I want the pain to stop. I want everyone to stop being stressed and angry. I get in fights with my husband and mom and sister, and I think they all could be avoided if I wasn't sick. 

I have never been one for cutting (I have always burned myself in the past to deal with the pain and stress) but maybe now is the time to start. I am just looking for a sign from the universe that I should keep trying to get better. So if I don't die, I guess I should try a little longer. And if I bleed out.... Well maybe that is the right answer.
