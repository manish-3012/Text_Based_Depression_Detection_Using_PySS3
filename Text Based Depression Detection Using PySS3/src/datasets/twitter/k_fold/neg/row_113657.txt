Iâ€™ve been okBut Iâ€™m slipping back again. I can feel it. As I walk down the hallway at work- that voice comes back in my head that says â€œhang yourselfâ€. â€œNo one will careâ€ â€œdieâ€ â€œgo awayâ€ â€œyouâ€™re uselessâ€. Itâ€™s been gone for awhile. Iâ€™d forgotten about it until recently. Iâ€™ve been really thankful for it being gone. I donâ€™t know. Maybe I should talk about it. - but the same voice tells me not to. You guys would probably understand. What do you think?
