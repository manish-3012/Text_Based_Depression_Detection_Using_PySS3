I figure it's a good time to finish my life, if there is such a thingA friend of a friend type person, pretty well known in the community and at his alma mater just died in an accident at age 22. This was just a few days ago. Most of the people I know are grieving him and everything. I didn't know him well at all but a lot of people I know were really close to him. I know he was a great person and a few things about him but not much. Anyway all the talk of death around me while I've bad suicidal thoughts for probably close to 6 months now made me realize I should just do it soon. 


1. I was kicked out of college, which means losing my job on top of that because I worked for the school at a students-only position. That's literally the only thing I had in my life. Now I just wake up at 12pm at my parents' house, play skyrim until 4am, go to sleep and do it again. I literally have $3.44 to my name, no health insurance, no car, no job and ~$18,000 in debt. 


2. Everyone around me is grieving a death already anyway. It's way more courteous to do it now than wait. Sure grieving two deaths may be harder but how much really? You can only feel so much and everyone says it's the worst they've ever felt already and as fucked up as it seems it's better to do it now than wait for them to accept his death then throw another one at them and make them relive the whole grieving process. If I figure I'll commit suicide eventually anyway, now/soon is the best time.
