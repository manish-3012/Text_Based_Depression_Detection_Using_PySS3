Iâ€™ve never done heroin before, this will be my first and last time23 years of my life and it was all for nothing. Being in a relationship with my father, a relationship that heâ€™s throw away now, not being able to tell my mother that I liked being with my father sexually or it would crush her, never be able to have a relationship because men want me for a few weeks as a thrill but dump me for being â€œcreepyâ€ or â€œfucked up.â€ Despite being perfectly broken, it was all for nothing. Daddy gets out of prison in 4-years, I wonâ€™t be there to greet him. He made his choice and listened to the headshrinkers. 

As I type this I just shot up. Needles always sting and Iâ€™m use to doing coke, this will be a new experience for me but alas my last one.


Goodbye.
