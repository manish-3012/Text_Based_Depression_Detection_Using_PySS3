My country (not US) is going to ruin my life. Please tell me why I shouldn't kill myself before that happens.I'm 16, and I'm about to be forced by my backwater country into an extremely traumatic period of interacting with bureaucrats. I don't think that I, being very introverted, will ever mentally recover from talking to so many incredibly hostile people while sleepy, and being constantly forced to go on.
Please tell me why it wouldn't be better if I just died now.
