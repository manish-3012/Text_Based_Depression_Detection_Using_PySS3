i don't understand why i'm not good enough.I know there are a lot of people in this subreddit who are in impossibly hard situations and I feel like my problem is so small in comparison. However, it is one that is weighing on me and I feel so low that I want to die. I'm a 30 year old woman and have never been "lucky" when it comes to dating or relations, however I met someone last year that I felt I connected with. We had so much fun together and I loved to be around him, and we "dated" but I felt like I was not good enough to be his girlfriend. He was hungup on an ex girlfriend and when he talked about her it would hurt me each time, I felt like I would never be good enough compared to her. Why was she good enough for him to date but not me? It messed me up so much. He would say things like "I would be the luckiest guy if you were my girlfriend" or 'you would be the perfect girlfriend". At the same time he would brush off discussions I've tried to have about relationships and would say "you deserve a nice boyfriend" and things like that. The whole ordeal made me feel awful about myself and I have been in such a depression. We still text but I don't try to have serious conversations anymore since he moved for his job anyways. I feel like a fucking idiot for putting myself in this position but I don't see any hope.
