What if this is how it's supposed to be?I've been thinking that I'm just depressed.  That this is wrong.  But what if this is what I'm supposed to do?  What if my way of actually contributing was just to provide an incubator for my organs?  Liver, heart, two lungs, two kidneys, pancreas, everything else they can take from a person.  It's all being used to keep me alive, and instead of one person, it could save several.

Isn't it more selfish to keep wasting resources on me than it would be to just spend one bullet?
