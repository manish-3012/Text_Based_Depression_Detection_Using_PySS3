Best Way to Get a Recommendation for a Neurologist?Maybe it's a stupid question, but I feel like I'm running out of options. I need someone to look directly at my brain and tell me what's wrong.

Should I ask my Psychiatrist for a recommendation? Should I go to a general practitioner? A walk-in clinic?

Thanks friends.
