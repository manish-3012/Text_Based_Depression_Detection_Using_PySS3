Born to be a loser?Born by a loser?I really hate it when people asked me to 'stop caring about what others think/do'. This is such a futile respond when I vent to others how
inferior I am compared to my peers.You could have said something nicer,like 'work your ass off to win then' or 'let's work hard together'.
I really hate it when my mom said 'stop caring about what they do' after I told her how my peers were lavishly travelling around while I was locked in a dungeon worrying about my future.
I really hate that.
