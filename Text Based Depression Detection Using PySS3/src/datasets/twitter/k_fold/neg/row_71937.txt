Planning on taking my life by the end of this week.Why? Well, honestly I don't want to be here anymore. I wanted to take my life last week but then I thought of my siblings and how devastated they would be, so I didn't but then come today, it's just been so shit that I'm not bothered to make an effort for life. Future isn't looking great and I have 0 aspirations. Also, another reason is because I want to know what's on the other side, call it seriously morbid curiosity but for some reason Death and beyond has never frightened me, just always intrigued me. These aren't the only reasons why I want to die but I'm not here to write an auto-biography or whatever, haha. 

Come Sunday, this is it for me lads.
