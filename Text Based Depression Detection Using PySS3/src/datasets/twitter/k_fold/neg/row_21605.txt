I have a normal life butI am a 39 yo male and have a pretty normal life albeit lonely. Normal family relationships, stable job at a bank, girls wanting to talk to me, sufficient cash to build a future with someone. I am more of sensitive type of man thinking a lot about life, trying to make sense of the world where news is either about billionaires building space rockets or about people with nothing risking their lives in crappy boats to reach the shores of Europe. But the list of things I stop doing is becoming bigger and bigger and it seems i cannot stop this process.

Iâ€™ve stopped looking at people in the street 
Iâ€™ve stopped caring what people think of me
Iâ€™ve stopped loving my cats
Iâ€™ve stopped liking watching movies
Iâ€™ve stopped talking to my family
Iâ€™ve stopped learning spanish
Iâ€™ve stopped dreaming of a holiday in the sun
Iâ€™ve stopped dreaming of having a relationship
Iâ€™ve stopped trying to keep my house clean
Iâ€™ve stopped looking at porn  
Iâ€™ve stopped trying to keep my job
Iâ€™ve stopped going out
Iâ€™ve stopped looking around me
Iâ€™ve stopped feeling sorry for other peopleâ€™s misery 
Iâ€™ve stopped wanting to buy a house 
Iâ€™ve stopped saving money for the future
Iâ€™ve stopped buying new clothes
Iâ€™ve stopped trying to hang on
Iâ€™ve stopped being ashamed of being suicidal
