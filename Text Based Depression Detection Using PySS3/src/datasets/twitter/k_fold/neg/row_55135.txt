My life and why I want/need it to endSo I'm 31, im schizophrenic and suffer with pretty bad depression/anxiety (don't we all though). I've heard voices in my mind for 20+ years since I was raped as a child. No one in my family knows this happened and they likely never will either, I've spoken to a few people about it over the years, mainly doctors and what not, speaking about it helped a small amount to begin with and then I realised that they didn't care. The last 2 years I have tried so hard to rebuild myself, I tried to meet new people, I tried reconnecting with old friends, I've tried things like cooking classes, yoga and no matter what happens I end up the same way each time, the voices in my mind push me to hurt myself and then eventually they start to takeover. I've had parts of the day just disappear from me where they've got control of me and they've shut me away. I have been fighting this for so long and I just can't do it anymore, I don't want to do it anymore. I don't know why I'm bothering to write this to be honest maybe I just want someone to know the pain I'm going through. I'm due to go away weds with some "friends" but I don't think I'll be able to do it.
