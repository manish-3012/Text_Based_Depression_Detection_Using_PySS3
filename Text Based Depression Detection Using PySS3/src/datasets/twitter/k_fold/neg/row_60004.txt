How i tried to kill myselfIt has been 2 years since i thought about suicide first time, when my grandma (58) passed away. I have no other grand parents and im an antisocial person and bring to my family only problems. Yes i have some good days too but not when my parents dont yell at me because im not fucking reading a book. I was 12 when my grandma passed and she meant all to me. Im 17 now, im bad at school, i get bullied A LOT and really have no purpose. I was raised in church and i enjoyed going just because i could drink some wine after the service. I tried to hang myself today but im scared because if i do so my parents will miss me and probably die. I have no friends, and brought only shame to my family. Please help
