A battle with reality.This is my first time ever publicly admitting i had any sort of problem (even though its anonymous its still scary to me because it makes it feel all that more real),

I have always felt somewhat uncomfortable with the world around me, and reality in general because i have very irrational thought patterns, however they were identifiable, and somewhat helpful when i was using a creative outlet,

I am now 22, with the life i've always dreamed of, i have amazing friends, a beautiful girlfriend, amazing and supportive parents, but every day that passes by i feel like im being pulled more and more into a very irrational and scary place, to the point where i feel like im screaming but no sound is coming out. My sense of identity is failing, my perception of the world turned me into somebody very paranoid and withdrawn and after a long time, im doing a horrible job at hiding it, people are noticing and i feel that i am trapped. I don't have any peace of mind to focus on a creative outlet for this irrationality, and im at the point now where im so swallowed up by my paranoid thoughts that im afraid to wake up the next day. I feel no human connection anymore which is something that ive always lived for, suicidal thoughts are becoming my only rational thoughts because they seem to be the only way to escape this feeling, and quite honestly myself, because im scared of who i can become. I'm posting this in hopes that people can connect with me and share anything possible that have helped them. I don't want to die, but i'm mentally exhausted from living.
