My planned expiration date is soon...I've planned to die on my birthday. Everything is ready. A historical figure was born on the same day and I always thought it was cool. That person also happened to die the same day. I always like to say that "fun fact" to people so why not follow suit?

I'm tired of going entire days not talking to or seeing a single person or no one reaching out to me. Whenever I get a text it's the dry cleaners telling me that my stuff is ready or some automated message from my phone company. I feel despised everywhere I go and all my attempts at getting help have failed. My life is as empty as it could possibly be and there's no proof that it can get better. So I'm going to leave, and I've picked a good day to do it. People who say that "life is precious" are people that have precious lives.

It's not like anyone will be wondering where I am or what I'm up to on my birthday. I'll probably have to date the note so that they'll know when it happened.

No one has to respond, I just wanted to write this somewhere.
