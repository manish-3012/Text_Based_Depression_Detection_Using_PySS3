I feel like I'm doomed for a lifetime of failure. Can I just disappear?This is my first time posting on reddit, so I apologise if there are some formatting errors, but I need to vent and hopefully get someone to help me. 

I don't remember the last time I was truly happy with myself or my life. To be honest, I wonder if I've ever been happy. When I was a child, I didn't grow up in a loving home - my dad was very physically and emotionally abusive towards my mum, sister and I, and that as a result has left scars on all of us. My sister also has a slew of issues as well; she used to kick me and call me worthless until she managed to move out when I started the seventh grade, so right now the only family I have is my anxiety ridden mother and even she doesn't want to help me here. 

The thing is I've suffered from depression for most of my life and it's sad because I'm 19, pretty and quite intelligent yet I can't seem to feel happy with anything. Hell, I can't even aim to achieve my dreams because I live in a country where the job market for people my age studying at university is terrible, so I just feel like I'm destined for a lifetime of failure and I just want to die. No one even understands how I feel and yet, every day I have to pretend that I'm fine when in fact I'm far from that. 

Can someone please help me? I just want to be happy.
