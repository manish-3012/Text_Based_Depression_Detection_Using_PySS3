Everything got better and now it's back to how it wasI've had depression for about 4 years now, and for most of that time it was really bad. However, ever since the summer it had been a lot better and in the past few months I've been the least depressed I've been in a long long time. All my passions were back, I had motivation, I was even happy. Now I'm out of school, and I'm all alone again. At first I thought it'd be great and I'd start working on all the things I want to do, but I pretty much never leave the house now except for when I work (which isn't even very often). I don't really move as much and I think it's affecting me physically and mentally. I've lost all motivation and life seems meaningless again. I feel disgusting right now. I just want to end it. It's been so long since I've wanted to kill myself, but now I'm right back where I was. I'm going crazy being stuck inside all day but I have nowhere else to go. The few friends I have keep cancelling on me. I feel awful. If things keep going this way I don't know how much longer I can stand it.

TL;DR I never leave the house and feel mentally and physically terrible. Life is meaningless.
