the only thing stopping me from killing myself is that i have no way to do itive decided that i probably will just end all this bullshit, but im not because i have no way of doing it. whatever i choose to do i dont want to leave whoever will find me with a gruesome scene. i want it to be quick, painless, and private. the only thing i can remotely think of is a gunshot to the head out in the forest or something.
but i suppose fortunately, i have no access to guns, lethal medications, or bridges in my city. i dont want to die in my house and i dont want to be found. i guess in time ill be so fed up with myself ill just want to get it over with no matter how. im at the point where im trying to form a plan and i know i should get help but i dont want it. because even if i did, id still be living the same life and id still be the same person, which is the entire problem. i have no hope anymore. im never going to be interesting, or beautiful. im never going to be loved by anyone, my parents are never going to be proud of me. some people just arent born to be happy and the fact i was born at all was a mistake. i really can't go on
