I'm so lonelyI feel like I don't connect with anyone, like I'm just a casual aquantence and co worker, never a friend. My therapist told me that's normal and that adult life is often lonely. I've never been touched romantically by someone, not even a hug, I'm not terrible looking but my anxiety has stopped me from doing anything involving dating. 

I want someone to look at me and think of me as theirs, to love me. My therapist also told me I'm hyper empathetic, I just want someone to care for me the same way I do for casual people, at the very least. But I want to be loved for once, genuinely loved, to be someone's person. It seems so attainable to others but so far away for me.

If I could end it and stop my mind from running in circles I'd do it. But I don't have the balls
