Help..Hi. I'm 16, I'm a girl, and I'm ready to die. I'm so lonely, I just, I can't. Everyone I love doesn't listen. I'm screaming, and the worst part is, my mom knows I'm depressed, but my dad doesn't listen. Our roommate, one of my dads good friends, even sees it. He talks to me all the time. It makes me feel a bit better, but it's never gonna be enough. There's been a boat load of traumatic thing happen in my worthless life, and it's starting to get to me. I can't handle it. I'm tired all the time. No matter how much sleep I get, it's never enough. I'm emotionally and physically exhausted. I've cut, I've burned, I got tattoos, I stretched my ears, I have piercings. Everything I could do to possibly hurt myself, I've done. The most traumatic thing I've ever done, is gotten an abortion. It was such a stupid idea and I punish myself every day for it. I can honestly say, that if it weren't for my dad, I'd be dead. He's the only thing that keeps me alive. I love him too much to hurt him like that. Well, that's the end of my rant, I'm not looking for pity, I'm just looking for some help.
