Has anyone had experience with family members suicide?My big brother (29) committed suicide by gunshot in April 2019 and you can imagine how traumatic that is. Even now, months later, sometimes my mind plays out how it might have happened and i really donâ€™t want to think about it. Iâ€™ve experienced so many mixtures of emotions this passed year. Right now Iâ€™ve been in this â€œfuck everything and everyoneâ€ kind of mood, I think about how much I want to die but at the same time I want to have a future. Iâ€™m really not happy. I try to distract myself with various stuff, like reddit and music. But I donâ€™t have it in me to stay focused on anything for more than a few minutes. I feel blank and empty, I just hate life. I know I need a therapist or psychiatrist and probably would benefit from antidepressants. But Iâ€™m 22 with a shit job and canâ€™t afford medical insurance or a doctor, so Iâ€™m just fucked. I remember my sister telling me after my brother passed, that our chances of suicide sky rocket after a family member does it- I think about that all the time and I donâ€™t want to be a statistic but I kinda feel like i will one day... maybe I wonâ€™t but itâ€™s a feeling. Iâ€™ve already had my own problems before my brother passed, but now everythingâ€™s worse. Actually in Jan 2019, I had planned and prepared to OD, but obviously didnâ€™t do it. When it first happened it felt like no one gave a shit. still feels that way. Iâ€™m just wondering if anyone else has had something like this happen in their family. And your experience with it. I know our experiences will be different but I guess I wanna see that Iâ€™m not alone? I donâ€™t know... maybe I need advice on what I should do. Some dialogue would be good.. Iâ€™m sorry this is probably nonsense
