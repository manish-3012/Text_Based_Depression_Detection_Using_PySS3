It's Not Like I'd Ever Do It.Pretty much since I was 8 I've had a history of suicidal thoughts, not tendencies or actions.

When I was 8 I got put in therapy for writing a list of reasons to live and reasons to die (there were several more reasons to die than to live).

Something shook me to such an extent as a kid I've been ruined ever since. I don't know what it was, and at this point it's probably so embedded in my other neuroses that it'd take a team of dedicated psychiatrists and several drugs to get to it.

The constant theme has been that I don't enjoy being alive, and the things that do bring any joy, bring so little for the trade off that I can't fathom getting a job to support a losing cause.

The BEST part is I can't talk about it, because why would some middle class kid with a healthy scholarly history and parents who pay for everything ever need help. Even when I acknowledge it's okay, I get so pathetically nervous about talking I just sit awkwardly and say nothing.

Ever since January when I started cutting, I fantasize about just lying down in a hot bath, and letting myself slip into the void.

I never would, I have things I want to do. Just, nothing that brings me joy.
