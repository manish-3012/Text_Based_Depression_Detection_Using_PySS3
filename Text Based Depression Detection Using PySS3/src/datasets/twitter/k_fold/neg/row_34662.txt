Ending my pain once and for all on the 30th....My birthday just past a few days ago, and I wish I had gone through with it then. If only I was alone and no one was home I could drink it  and be done with this ugly, sad, miserable creature.  Well we learn from our mistakes right? At least it gives me time to sort things out, throw things away, and pack my book bag to leave out and never comeback. There is nothing I will miss, there is no one I will miss, and there is no one who will miss me. I'm perfectly ok with that, makes it easier to disappear from the face of the earth. I quit my shit job today too, I'm just completely done at this point. I don't give a fuck anymore, it's not going to matter anyways once I'm dead.  I've been depressed since I was 12, bullied throughout all my school years and even by my own family. From that experience I've truly grown to hate and despise people. Is this all there is to life? Go to school, go to work, slave away for a rich bastard, get fat, get ugly,  old, then die? Why even bring life into this shit world? If I had the button to erase my existence, I would have pressed it a long time ago.  I'll play videogames, read some books, catch up on on some anime and then I 'm checking out. Life isn't for everyone, and it doesn't magically get better no matter how long you wait. Some are lucky, others like me were just doomed from the start. I'll be seeing ya again on the 30th     - from a Bottomlessnothing
