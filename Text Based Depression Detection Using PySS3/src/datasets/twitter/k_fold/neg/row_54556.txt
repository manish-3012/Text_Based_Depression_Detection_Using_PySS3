1000 miles from anyone i knowi dont have much to say. i dont really care to even talk that much. but i am stupid and lost the only girl i every loved. now i am stuck in tampa florida. no way back home. no one close enough to help. and when i told her what i was considering she went to sleep and stopped talking to me or just ignored me idk. i want to be angry but im not i want to feel sad but i cant. i just keep searching for my emotions but they seem to have abandoned me as well. i mostly just want to stop feeling alone. and the struggle is so much work. and for either no gain. or something like this where i just feel like i am back sliding.
