We are all fucked.Your life has objective value, your value is not created from within yourself, it is determined from other people this almost works like a job where the more skills and the more useful you are the better you are treated, well this is how life works too and Iâ€™m sick of people sweeping it under the rug, Iâ€™m not going to kill myself but I just want to tell everyone that while some of you may believe itâ€™s your fault if your stupid or ugly itâ€™s really not, I will not lie to you and say that you are not fucked if your either because you can be fucked in life just by the way you were born. If your not smart enough you might not be able to finish university or if your ugly you would have a harder time dating. There are millions of fucked up people on this earth in many ways, we are all suffering together and it fucking sucks, I just lost my job my apartment and my mother died from Covid-19. Everything i have ever wanted and loved was taken from me within 1 week. I wonâ€™t be killing myself because of this however because Iâ€™m going to be dead an eternity right so fuck it on I March. The world sucks fat horse cock if your not lucky, Iâ€™m not going to stop you from killing yourself because frankly the world does not objectively give a shit if you die or not itâ€™s got billions of other fuckers here too, So fuck it, Fuck it all. What are we going to do now Iâ€™m homeless and without my fucking mom with me. Good luck to all of you and always remember that many people have lived and died and in the end it doesnâ€™t matter, if God is real maybe when we die he will explain all of it too us on why he did what he did to us if for a reason.
