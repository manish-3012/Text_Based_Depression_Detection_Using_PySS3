Failed Highschool and contemplating suicideI just failed 2 classes at highschool and just turned into a bigger dissapointement than i already was
I was never a smart kid or a lucky one, my family doesnt care about me and im dealing with severe depression, insomnia and hallucinations
I just had enough of this world and i cant deal with this anymore, ive been forced to live a constant humiliation and it all bottled up and im just tired of this all
Im sorry for any mistakes in my text, english is not my main language
Please
What should i do..
