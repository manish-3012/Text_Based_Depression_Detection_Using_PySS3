Things are bad.Doesnâ€™t feel worth pushing. 

I havenâ€™t told anyone yet, Iâ€™m really not ready to tell my family, but I have been diagnosed with a neurological disorder, an auditory processing disorder, a memory disorder, transient aphasia, and something else. TIA, TAI maybe? Something about temporary lack of blood flow in the brain. â€œAltered alertnessâ€ was something else they said. I didnâ€™t mention to them the voice Iâ€™ve been hearing. Iâ€™m not sure I couldâ€™ve handled any more bad news. But â€œaltered alertnessâ€ is right. It gets bad. Sometimes I find myself in a room in my house with no clue how I got there. I remember being elsewhere. And then Iâ€™m somewhere else. But no memory of the transport. (Thatâ€™s not the right word. I canâ€™t think of what word I want. Travel? Transfer?)

Iâ€™m not supposed to drive. Tremors in extremities prompted me to go back to a doctor. Sometimes they get so bad I canâ€™t hold my phone or a pencil. Wasnâ€™t prepared for all the news I got. They said itâ€™s likely permanent. 

Result of an accident earlier this year. 

Have to have further screenings done due to a bleeding disorder. Mixture of coughing up blood and realizing I donâ€™t clot on my own after trying my hand at *something*. 

Thereâ€™s really only one person I want to talk to about it. But I canâ€™t. 

Idk. Last month I almost jumped out a high rise window. Probably shoulda just did it. 

Not really something I want to do. But I feel like it might be my best course. Iâ€™ve lost more this year than I ever thought I could. And alone though it all. I mean, where it counts. I *felt* alone. No one gets it. Well, one person gets it. But I donâ€™t feel like I can talk to her about it. Unsolicited vehicle makes me think I was so much better off a year ago. 

And I did it all to myself. Knew exactly what I was waking into but blind faith kept me walking. I canâ€™t have faith anymore. Sometimes the universe just tries to tell you something. 

I miss the life I could have had. So tired of the storms. Just so tired. I just donâ€™t like myself anymore. Iâ€™m not the person I thought I was.

Thereâ€™s never a safety net. Even if there was one. It promises to be there. But then decides you arenâ€™t worth saving. So it leaves. 

A lot happened today. I think Iâ€™ll just drink for tonight. I donâ€™t think I can do much else.
