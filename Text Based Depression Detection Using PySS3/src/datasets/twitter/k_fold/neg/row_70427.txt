Scared of my own thoughtsI've been with friends for the past 10 hours, but for the past 5 or so I've been having fleeting thoughts of killing myself. It's been this way for a week or so. Just random bursts of things from "you can end your suffering" to "you should google if your parents can claim life insurance from a suicide". Nothing I can do will help keep these thoughts out of my head. Thought a day with friends would be enough but it wasnt. I'm too anxious to talk about it to a therapist and I think I'm too focused on the negatives for my family to actually do it but I'm afraid of my impulsive ways. I dont know what to do or who to reach out to. I'm just so tired
