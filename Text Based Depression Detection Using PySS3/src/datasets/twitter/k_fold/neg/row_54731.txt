Gone so downhill after getting better...I've been doing so much better for the past few months, got myself a job, stopped hurting myself, was able to think about the future without shaking and started planning what I wanted with my life. 

But my boyfriends depression is getting worse. He's in contact with his ex and she's getting him high and drunk. He tries so hard to help her but just shouts at me if I show any emotion. 

I've stopped taking my meds because he refused to take his. I'm hurting myself a lot, I haven't ring my therapist and am putting off seeing my social worker. 

I was talking to my boyfriends ex the other day about her suicide attempts and now I'm so fucking determined to success where she failed. That way my boyfriend doesn't have to deal with me anymore, and I would have finally done something better than her in his eyes. 

But I'm not sure which one to try out, I know (because I've been better) that it's possible to recover from this state. Which is why I haven't gone ahead and done it already, I feel like posting here is another way that I'm trying to get better. If I'm talking about it then at least I'm not doing it....
