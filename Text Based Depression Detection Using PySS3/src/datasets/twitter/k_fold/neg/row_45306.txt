I just want someone to hold meHey 
I already texted something here before but I need to get something of my chest 
I just want someone to be there for me that tells me I'm not alone and who tells me I'm loved 
But since I'm a man I can't tell it to anyone 
The last person I told what I was feeling just used it against me and I'm really tired of feeling like shit all the time and beeing lonely
