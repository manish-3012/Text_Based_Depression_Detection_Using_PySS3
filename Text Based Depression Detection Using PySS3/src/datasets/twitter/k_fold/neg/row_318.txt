Chambered.Some days I feel like dying, some I feel like I'm doing it all right, and somedays I just wish I could start over, it comes in randomly. I had no easy childhood, a father who left when I was born, a bipolar alcoholic mother with ptsd who constantly made attempt on her own life, and a stepfather who didn't know how to deal with my mother which made him constantly angry. I was beaten, yelled at, locked in my room, had my thoughts and opinions constantly invalidated, my babysitter(an ex of my moms) molested me, my brother did on a few occasions as well, I've suffered from depression and self hate my whole life, I've hurt myself a lot through various means and tried to kill myself on multiple occasions to no avail. I can't have a relationship to save my life because my examples of love and compassion were so fucked up. I try and try to fix what damage has been done to me. I've tried everything I can imagine, meds, therapy, meditation, drugs, ignoring it, pretending everything will work out, and I still feel lost and isolated. I don't want to die I just want to be OK and feel something other than pain and hate. I love someone and I can't tell them because if they know what I deal with it will just bring them down. I've spent so long being lost, and isolated, trying to fix myself and the damage that's been done to me, I'm so tired I just want to sleep, to close my eyes and dream forever.
 
I'm sitting on the edge of my bed. In front of me is my mirror and miscellaneous Items that I keep there, keys, wallet, change jar, random knickknacks, stereo, and this time the other 7 rounds from my gun. After all, all I need is this one in the chamber.
