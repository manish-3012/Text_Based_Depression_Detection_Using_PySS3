gimme one reason to stay here and ill turn right back aroundthere are much worse off people than me. they are stronger than i am. i'm in a loveless marriage. shitty job. carefully planned suicide was interrupted. (i have since found a better way). i have no future. i have a shitty past. ive been out of pot for a year (the only thing that ever made me stable) and i'm running out of patience with life. no insurance. no therapy. no motivation. no hobbies. nothing interests me. why keep stealing other people's air?
