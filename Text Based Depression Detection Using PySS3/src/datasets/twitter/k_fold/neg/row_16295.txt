I've started (again)I've started it. I told one of the few people who care about me that I'm okay. But I'm not. I'm so not okay. I feel like I'm drowning in this stupid pain and self hatred and exhaustion. It's hard on my friends when I'm depressed. It would be easier for all parties involved if I were dead. I don't think I'm going to make it to three years. I hope it's soon.
