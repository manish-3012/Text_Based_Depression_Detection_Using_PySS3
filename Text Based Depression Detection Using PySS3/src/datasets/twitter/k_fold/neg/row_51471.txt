Being eaten alive by worryI recently posted in r/anxiety...I have been accepted to uni a few hundred miles away and I'm so nervous that I'd rather just end it all instead of having to deal with the pain of leaving everything and everyone I know behind. I'm so scared I won't be able to fit in or get help for my PTSD. My heart feels like it's going to burst from the fear and I haven't even left yet. I keep thinking about suicide and hanging myself. I keep thinking about my selfish need to leave this place. I wanted to leave so bad and now I'm absolutely terrified. It's so hard to breathe sometimes. My chest feels so tight. I'm so afraid I'm going to be raped again and not have anyone to turn to this time. It's so hard to remain positive when my body and brain are constantly in survival mode. I just want this feeling to end. I just wish I could be who I was before. I wish I could feel safe again, I wish I could trust myself but I don't even feel safe at work with the men that make me uncomfortable like it's their jobs...two of them were already terminated because of me...I feel so guilty but I just wanted them to leave me alone...I am harassed at my job day in and day out and all I want is to be left alone. I spend every break and lunch alone in my car but it doesn't help. Strangers think it's ok to grab me and tell me what they think of me...and all I do is freeze up...I can't even stand up for myself. How can I go on if I can't do that? Trust myself? I'm so scared...I'm panicking and everyone is asleep. My SO went to a party and hasn't answered in hours and now their phone is dead...I can't help but think the worst. I'm a mess. I want it to end. I wish I was never born. Please help
