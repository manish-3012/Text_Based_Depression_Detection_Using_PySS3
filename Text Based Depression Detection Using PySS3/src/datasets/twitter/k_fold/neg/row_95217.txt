How do I ask for help without worrying the people I love.Essentially all of my friends have disowned me because Iâ€™m a stupid fucking asshole, I lost my job, I gained all my weight back and I feel like Iâ€™m back to square one, Iâ€™ve come full circle and I donâ€™t know if I can do it all over again.

Iâ€™ve got a crippling alcohol addiction, killer anxiety and I just want to die right now. I canâ€™t bring myself to it though, itâ€™d kill my mum and I ainâ€™t about to put her through that but I need help man.

This shit is hard and at the time I need my friends the most, I ainâ€™t got nobody apart from my mum. How do I even go about explaining to her that Iâ€™m a fucking looser, how do I tell her all these things and explain my concern without worrying her. I feel fucking isolated and itâ€™s all my own fault, I canâ€™t blame anybody else other than myself. 

The alcohol has ruined me, and my closest friend has essentially said he doesnâ€™t give a fuck, now Iâ€™m left without anybody because of my self destructive behaviour. Iâ€™m confident that soon Iâ€™m gonna get black out drunk like I always do and just say fuck it, maybe even this weekend.

I get like that when I drink, hence the reason itâ€™s ruined my life, I have a fuck it attitude and almost always regret it. Itâ€™s inevitable that Iâ€™m just gonna off myself soon, everything going really bad and really fast. This shit sucks.
