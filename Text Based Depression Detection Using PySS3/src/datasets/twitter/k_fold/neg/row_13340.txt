Suicidal thoughts are becoming too strong to handleI've been having self harming and  suicidal thoughts for the past month. At first it was just my depression coming back, and then I started thinking about a date that I could kill myself, then how I would, and then who I would write a note to, and whether it would just be worth it to text everyone instead. Some days have been better than others, but when I'm off schedule, or sleep badly (which is half the time), the suicidal thoughts seem to get stronger.     
I've been able to be productive, which is different, because previously when I got depressed and suicidal, I just pushed everyone away and laid in bed for weeks and months.    
Last night while I was showering, I had this really strong desire to gather money bit by bit from my account in a way that wouldn't alarm anyone,  take a train or hitchhike somewhere, and live there until something bad happens to me, or I take my life.    
I haven't opened up to anyone except crisis lines about how I've been feeling, and they weren't very helpful. I was asked by some family members if I was okay, but I deflected because I never really open up to them about my emotional struggles, except when I was hospitalized for planning to kill myself in 2013.    
I can't see a therapist because there's none where I live that match my schedule, and I don't have money for copays or, if it comes to it, hospital bills, and I don't feel comfortable asking my family to help me out financially because they have enough bills to pay as it is.    
I just can't keep living like this. I don't want a day to come where the urge to kill myself becomes so strong that I make an attempt, and my family finds my body somewhere. I just don't know what to do.
