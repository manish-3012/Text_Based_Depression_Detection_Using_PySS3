LostI'm in an incredibly dark place in my life. I have anxiety and depression. Both pretty severe. I'm on meds but with my life in shambles they can only do so much. I'm unhappy in my marriage but trapped. We have a 17 month old daughter I refuse to leave and we're 2k miles from our home state because my husband is active duty army. I left college and my job to follow him down here. I deeply want a divorce but there are so many daunting hurdles in between me and what I perceive as a happy future. 

I'm beginning to think I'm one of those souls destined for nothing but pain and sadness. At this point, more often than not the only solution I see is suicide. I feel as if the world would be better without me in it. I don't mean much to anyone. It would, at most, be a minor inconvenience. 

I called the suicide helpline yesterday and the woman with whom I spoke was profoundly unhelpful. All these years of pain and perseverance in the hope "things will get better eventually," only to realize they won't. I've been too scared to actually do it but I can feel myself moving closer to the edge every day. 

I'm an organ donor. These days I think my death would do more good than my life ever could.
