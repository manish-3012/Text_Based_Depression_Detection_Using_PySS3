Suicidal thoughts and can't tell anyone here.Hey. 

I have had a history of depressive episodes, with suicidal thoughts. Fortunately have managed to be ok. The last was about 3 years ago.

Right now I'm with my husband and 11 month old visiting his sister and her family, and his parents. There's a bit of culture clash, which I'm managing, but also trying to deal with small comments about us being first time parents, people not respecting her need for sleep, and some other things.

It seems now that they have trained her down to one nap, and not a full night's sleep either, what with dragging her around everywhere. I'm losing my mind trying to deal with her. It seems so petty and small, but it's just the straw.

Tonight I sat in the backyard, holding my screaming daughter, and wanted to set her down and drown myself in the pool.

I can't tell my husband. It's his birthday tomorrow. I can't tell my friends, I hardly have any. This fucking sucks.
