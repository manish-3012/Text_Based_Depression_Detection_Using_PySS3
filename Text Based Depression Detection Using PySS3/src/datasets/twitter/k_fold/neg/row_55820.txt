Story of a 32y old loser...I'm in a very dark place right now and have to vent. I had a serious fight with my mother last night, and she told me maybe I should just end it all because I'm a worthless loser.  
 
I had to move back home at ripe age of 32, I lost my job because layoffs half a year ago and couldn't pay the bills anymore. Mostly because of my huge debt that I have, some from college, some from family related matters. I dropped out of college to work on my family's business, by request of my father, so I didn't even get the education. Family's business went belly up once father died but I got lucky I found a job in IT, but now even that is gone. So here I'm 32 years old loser with no job and no college education, debt-ridden fool who gave up on his own dreams to help out the family which now wants me not to exist. Since teenage, last night was the first time I have ever raised my voice to someone of my family, because I had it enough of the guilt trip, and now I'm pretty sure I'm getting kicked out. Knowing my mother she will throw my things out when I'm somewhere else. I kinda wish I was a drinker now, because the stress is killing me.  

No one will hire me anymore even though I'm not picky and I'm really hardworking, I'm just too old, too competent or too unskilled, too educated but not enough educated. I gave everything to help out my family and now I'm even losing that. I have no idea wtf I'm supposed to do now and sometimes the empty void of my future just feels too much...  

Thanks for reading, I just needed to process it myself by writing it down, and feel free to laugh at me, your words can't hurt me anymore than this situation is hurting me.
