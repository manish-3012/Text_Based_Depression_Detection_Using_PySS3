I'm supposed to be dead right nowFebruary 26th 2018 was supposed to be the day I killed myself but I was too scared. I lied to myself and said I'm glad I'm alive but that fell apart tonight, I realized I fucking hate existence and the only reason I haven't killed myself is I'm too scared of dying. I'm in a situation where I'm forced to exist because of my fear of suicide and I fucking hate it. I hate constantly feeling like shit in the  background. We're going through Hamlet in my English class and I think [Shakespeare said it best] (https://m.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/hamlet-act-iii-scene-i-be-or-not-be)
