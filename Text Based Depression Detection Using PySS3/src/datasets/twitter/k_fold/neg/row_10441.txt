My friend is suicidal. What should I do?I know, pathetic. I'm coming into reddit to ask how help and support my suicidal friend. I thought I was being a good supportive friend and that she was getting better but she nearly committed tonight. I was thinking about bringing her a care package full of ice cream, blankets, and somethhting else she'd like but I'm not sure. Should I tell her sister? Would that be invasive? I'm just at a complete loss because I've never felt the way she does so I don't know how to help her. Any advice is appreciated.
