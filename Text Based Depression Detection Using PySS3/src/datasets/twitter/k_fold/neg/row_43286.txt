Who knows when I'll have the courage to hang myselfLife's just been the worst lately. So much more to say but it's just whiney. This is the only community i have tbh bc I'm a negative person. I deserve a horrible death bc i missed so many chances with women, friends, careers, hobbies. Now I'm just a stressed short hermit.  Meh could be worse.
