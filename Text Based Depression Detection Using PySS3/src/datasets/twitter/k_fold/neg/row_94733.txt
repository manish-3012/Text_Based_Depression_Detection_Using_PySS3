My Gen-X Monster"Why are you still here?" It whispers. "No one wants you here."

And I donâ€™t listen.

"But really," it insists. "Youâ€™re not like them. They donâ€™t want you here."

And it hurts, but I donâ€™t listen.

"Look around," it says. "Your mother talks about you. Her sisters listen. Even they donâ€™t want you here."

And I cry, but I still donâ€™t listen.

"Think about work," it prods. "Remember when you used to matter? Remember when you wereâ€¦middle class?"

I remember. Iâ€™m trying not to listen

"No more," it purrs. "You donâ€™t matter, anymore. Theyâ€™re all younger now. Theyâ€™re all educated and pretty andâ€¦spectacular."

I know. And itâ€™s getting harder not to listen.

"Your bodyâ€™s failing," it says. "Remember when you could see and hear? Remember when you could recall little details and relay them, flawlessly? Remember when you could stand up without pain? Thatâ€™s gone now. Youâ€™re getting old. Andâ€¦irrelevant."

I steel myself. I refuse to listen.

"You have nothing left to offer," it sneers. "Nobody wants you. Nobody likes you. Youâ€™re not like them. You have no value. Youâ€™reâ€¦odd."
 
I hold my chin up and try not to listen.

"Your kids only hang around because you let them take from you," it says. "How many times have they told you they hate you?"

My lip quivers.

But still, I refuse to listen. 

"You should go," it says. "Itâ€™s time to go. Your time is past, their time is now. There is no room for you. Itâ€™s time to go."

And I know itâ€™s right. Itâ€™s time to go. My time has passed. They have everything and there is nothing left for me. 

Iâ€™m listening. I hear you. 

Soâ€¦tell me how.
