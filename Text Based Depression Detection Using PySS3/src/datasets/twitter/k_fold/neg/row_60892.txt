I just want it to be overIâ€™ve been suicidal a lot in the past. Iâ€™ve overcome it every time and I probably will get through this. But my medication stopped working. Iâ€™m having horrible nightmares every night. I can barely sleep or eat. I just want to die. I long for someone to care about me. I want someone to love me. I feel so alone even with my friends. I just wish I was gone. I keep getting these horrible morbid thoughts about death. I am trying so hard not to do anything but it hurts so much and I have no one to talk to who cares.
