A close friend is considering suicide and I'd love some adviceDepression can often make people feel like absolutely nothing works, and this is what's happening to my friend. It's scary, she's very scared, she doesn't know what to do anymore. Yesterday she texted me while in crisis and it was heartbreaking. She told me how she thinks of herself as an unloved person, as a failure, and how she really cannot see any future and was considering ending her life. I understand that she needs therapy, but she doesn't have access to it, and therapy won't be enough either. She needs support from people close to her too, but I have no idea what to do. I can't just tell her that "everything is going to be okay", I really can't. I'm going through the exact same thing as this girl and it's heartbreaking that I don't have a different perspective on life, but I truly see her as an amazing person, and she really deserves to live, only not the hellish rollercoaster-like life she's been living up to this point.

Are there any recommended hotlines she could call or text for free?

Could you let me know about something that comforted you during a moment of crisis?

Thank you very much for readingðŸ’š
