My only optionI can't do this anymore. I hate opening my eyes in the morning and struggling to get through the day.I hate this feeling of fear and dread panic,stress and worry. I'm sick of living this life. I'm sick of being ignored by everyone. I'm sick of being alone. I don't think I can do this anymore. I hate my family for doing nothing to help me. 

I have lost 10 years of my life living like this and they did nothing but give me dirty looks. I see everything so clearly now. I used to think I was the problem. I would always blame my anxiety for making me think certain things but it wasn't. I can now see that no one cares at all about me and everyone treats me like crap.

I hate the stigma surrounding mental health. Like fuck it's 2017 shouldn't this be normal now. I wish ppl with mental health problems were treated like cancer patients. Cancer patients get love and support. Ppl will stand by your side and hold your hand and pray you'll get better. But with mental health you get treated like an attention seeker. You get nasty looks from people. I'm tired of it. And
what do you do when your family knows you're suicidal but they don't care. When they just continue their normal everyday lives like nothing happened. Talk and laugh like there's nothing wrong.

 Listening to my family laughing and living their lives happily knowing how I feel,just tears me up inside.Maybe they want me to kill myself because I'm a burden. I know they don't like me.

I can't even explain how I'm feeling right now. I don't know how I'm going to live. I don't want to live anymore anyway. Killing myself is my only option now..
