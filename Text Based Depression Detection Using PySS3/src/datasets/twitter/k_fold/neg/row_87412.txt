I don't know what to do.I'm going to be 26 this year, and I'm still slogging thru university. I'm about to fail a class for the third time, which has a high chance of me being expelled and losing 7 years of my life. I'm not even sure if I want to keep studying what I'm studying (I actually hate it now, can't stand to read anything about it), but I've spent so much time and money on it, if I decide to quit and pursue something else I'll be wasting my parents' and my girlfriend (who is depending on me to finish my education and get a decent job to help her get out of her shitty family situation, she works and pays for all her stuff but doesn't make enough to move out). I have few skills other than a knack at languages and my enjoyment of video games. And the last one is not marketable.

Hell, video games used to pull me out of the world for a few hours, now they don't even do that. I still enjoy playing, but the thought of failing my family, my girlfriend, and myself, creeps on me every single moment. But I can't do anything about it, I have a test in 4 days and I've barely read and understood 20 of the 150+ pages I need to read. If I get expelled or have to start over, I won't be able to stand the shame of having spent so much time and money doing basically nothing, living like a leech and having nothing to show for it. 

I don't know what to do. I can't even talk to the people close to me about it, because I don't know if they'll understand, and I just... I can't do that to my parents. It would kill them right then and there. If I don't have a degree, I won't be able to live a decent life, or not be stomped around by people with degrees. How do I get out of this hole...
