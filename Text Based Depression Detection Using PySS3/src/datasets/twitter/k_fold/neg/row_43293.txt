I need help but donâ€™t know who to turn toThis is my first time posting here and I need help. Iâ€™m 16 and Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts for a really long time, ever since I was 6, but have never had the stones to anything about it. I have these nightmares that are so violent that I literally donâ€™t want to sleep. My dad is also verbally abusive to me and my family so that doesnâ€™t help anything. I recently lost a really great group of friends because I said I was going to take my life. They had no concern for me after I said that and my girlfriend is really trying to help but what can she do, she is there for me when I need it most but she canâ€™t truly feel the I feel and on top of that I always feel alone and isolated, like I talk to my girlfriend everyday and she makes me the happiest person in the world, but yet I still feel alone. I could be in a room with a million people and Iâ€™d still feel like the only person in the room. If you have any advice, please tell me, I donâ€™t know much more of this pain I can take.
