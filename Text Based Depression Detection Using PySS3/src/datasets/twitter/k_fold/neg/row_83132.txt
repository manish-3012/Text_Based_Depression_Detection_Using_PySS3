I had a chance to be run over by a car... but I instinctively pussied out. I'd had a green light at the crosswalk, but some idiot, didn't care. If only I was more absent minded... 
It would've been a perfect way to get rid of the life I've never wanted and to have my funeral expenses covered by insurance.
