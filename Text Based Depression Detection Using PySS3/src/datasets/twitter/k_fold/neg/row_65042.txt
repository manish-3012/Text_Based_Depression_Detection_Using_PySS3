Idk just somethingHi idk what Iâ€™m saying. Iâ€™m just lost, Iâ€™m hopeless inside, I feel lonely yet I have people. Iâ€™m a mess to be honest, I donâ€™t understand what I feel or how to grasp the emotions happening, itâ€™s been like this my whole life. I donâ€™t know what I feel exactly. Every time Iâ€™d cry, I feel as if Iâ€™m being judged even tho Iâ€™m alone like Iâ€™m weak and vulnerable and I just stop crying feeling nothing. I question why I cry and why Iâ€™m even feeling and try to brush it all off but it comes back. Iâ€™ve thought about killing myself so many times, every day the thought makes its way across my mind. I try to understand why Iâ€™m like this but canâ€™t, many things have happened with my past and parents lying through divorce from birth and never having that real care from them, itâ€™s always been like a lie. I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m typing this, I appreciate if someone did read this or look at this but I doubt it. Iâ€™m scattered everywhere and Iâ€™m sorry. I just want it all to end, itâ€™s constant feeling of just like unknown hurt, despair, and I canâ€™t grasp the emotions. I donâ€™t understand myself very much. Iâ€™ll just leave it at that
