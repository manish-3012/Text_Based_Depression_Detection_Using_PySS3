Chronic suicidal ideation has worsened significantly since my ex abandoned meI know that there are resources for me to use if I need help, but right now I just need literally anyone to tell me Iâ€™m not alone with these feelings and that Iâ€™m not a huge fuck up for feeling this way. I havenâ€™t slept in almost 48 hours now and Iâ€™m so tired and depressed that I canâ€™t even do my school work. Iâ€™m supposed to graduate in 3 months but with the way Iâ€™ve been feeling, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll last that long, let alone be able to do this rigorous course load that my university has gifted me with. Literally every week for the past 4 months Iâ€™ve thought about death and the most effective way to die and how pointless my life is without my partner in it. I miss them so much and they want nothing to do with me, because they were a narcissistic abuser and they got bored of me. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Itâ€™s literally 2 in the afternoon and Iâ€™m having really bad thoughts about hurting myself. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll really do it or not, itâ€™s a 50/50 chance at this point. Honestly I donâ€™t think I even have the resources in my apartment to get the job doneâ€” iâ€™d probably just seriously injure myself and since I live alone, there no way anyone would be able to find me and help me, so that would suck..just being paralyzed or having excruciating pain and being too fucked up to move or call for help, and also knowing I was too much of a failure to even get this one last thing right. Idk what to do anymore. People keep telling me there is more to life than my ex, but he was my favorite person (a BPD term used to describe someone who you idolize and who you feel totally dictates your feelings/worth), and now heâ€™s abandoned me. So like, whatâ€™s really left? Idk. Iâ€™m literally stuck in a different state from all my friends and family (bc of school..I moved back here exclusively to be close to my ex and as soon as I found an apartment &amp; got moved in, he admitted he didnâ€™t love me). So now Iâ€™m here. I feel like I have nothing. Does anyone else feel like this? Have you or anyone you know ever felt this way? Itâ€™s been almost 5 full months since our breakup and nothing has gotten better. Dare I even say itâ€™s gotten worse since we recently went no contact? I feel like shit. Sorry if this was difficult or annoying for anyone to read.
