im gonna do itwell hi i would need some help from somebody sitting behind computer the problem is i have no reason for nothing i havent got real friends all ex-gf fucked up ( she gave me sleeping pills and she fucked my ex-bestfriend etc.) with me so i have crippling depression and i cant talk to people normally anymore ( I cant talk) I failed at high school not because of im very stupid but because im lazy + problem with speaking. I love helping others but im giving up this whole thing because noone helps me because i have no idea how to talk about feelings to others. And i dont want to do it because family which doesnt know about this problem because i dont want them to know this yes ill tell them if i want. Im 16 and i love making fun of my ironically(but its true) life.I have no idea how to express myself. Last time i was happy is forgotten prob as child.Like yes im happy buts thats only when i see some funny meme but thats for while.I make memes.Whole this thing is cringe yes i know it but its true. I wish somebody ever loved me....I have no hobby only at making memes thats are not funny at all like the other ones. Im only good at helping others...Also i hate this world because its not for people like me . i have psychopathic tilt because i hate others for being happy and their stupid sense for everything everyone starts judging me for everything i do and i care about it and when somebody laughs me i feel really really bad and i would do everything to make him stop smiling me. Im proably gay because boys that i ever met were nice to me but girls werent. thats all i got in my stupid head
