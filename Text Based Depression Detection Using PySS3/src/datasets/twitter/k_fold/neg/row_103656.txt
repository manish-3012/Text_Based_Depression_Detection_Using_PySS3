Not sure if I can do this anymore...Nothing is helping me. Not meds, therapy or family. Iâ€™ve lost all of my friends and I donâ€™t wanna keep living like this. Iâ€™m so unhappy that even saying that is an understatement. Iâ€™m not sure if I want to die or just not be me anymore. If that makes sense ?
