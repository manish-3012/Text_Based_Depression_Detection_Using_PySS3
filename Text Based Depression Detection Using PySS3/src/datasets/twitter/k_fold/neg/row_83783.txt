I had an experience undergoing a procedureAfter waiting and waiting to finally have my colonoscopy done, they finally wheeled me into the operating room. I can remember everybody was in position, the gastroenterologist was sitting at his desk doing some last minute things, I imagine.

They were getting me into position to have it done, and the anesthesiologist was this kind woman with golden hair. She made light conversation with me as they were preparing me, and she was preparing the anesthesia. I was finally in place, and how I was facing I was looking at her as the dim lights shone behind her. I remember she wore a soft smile on her face, and her expression was one of genuine comfort as she put me to sleep. 

I was nervous...I tried to explain trivial things about myself because I felt I was in the presence of an angel, of someone that held so much more humanity and beauty over me that I felt I needed to justify myself, who I was to her. She just continued to smile, as I felt my eyelids growing heavy. Her face was the last thing I saw before I succumbed to sleep, and I remember thinking I wished I would never wake up. For all the pain in my life, for all the suffering I've been going through...she made me feel safe and comforted, she was like a mother from some distant past come to see me one last time.

I miss her, I miss her so much.
