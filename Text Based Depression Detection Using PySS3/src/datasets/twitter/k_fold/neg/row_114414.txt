Getting worseI feel like I'm starting to get worse everyday, I feel worthless, empty, I can't figure out why I'm still here and how life is becoming even more pointless. But I can't take my own life either. I want to die but at the same time I want to live. I feel trapped, like closed in this world with no way out. I feel like I'm going insane and I don't want to lose grip of reality but at times it feels like it's fading fast. I'm thinking about selling everything and running away somewhere else, away from my mom and siblings who are more like toxic than any kind of help. I don't know what to do anymore.
