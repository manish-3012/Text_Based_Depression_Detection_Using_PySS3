My birthday is coming upI will try and keep this short.  I have been struggling with anxiety / social anxiety / depression for some time.   Things have gotten worse in the past year, must worse...  I have lost my last remaining friends, I am lonely, cannot think strait or concentrate on anything.  Writing this post in itself is very difficult.   It's hard to put the words together.

My birthday is coming up in a few weeks.  I know it's going to be a very low point for me.  I have no friends or family to celebrate with.  I do not leave the house unless it's to go to work &amp; back.  My anxiety is too much to deal with at the moment.   Everyday I am constantly thinkong of suicide and how I can get away with doing it,  I think I will finally be able to get to my lowest point on my birthday to do it. 

I do also admit, as much as I think it's selfish I kind of want to hurt the people with my death who haven't been there for me,  as bad as that is.   It's almost a sweetener, if you will, on the whole deal.

well thanks for letting me get that off my chest.
