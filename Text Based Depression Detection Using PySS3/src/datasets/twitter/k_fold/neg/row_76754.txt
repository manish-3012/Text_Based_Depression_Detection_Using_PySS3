what's the least painful way to kill myself?hi, my names hannah. im 13 years old turning 14 on november 12th (4 days from today) i'm currently suffering from ptsd, depression &amp; anxiety ( all professionally diagnosed) i don't want to explain my whole life story other than the fact that i'm currently in a abusive crappy household.

i've been cutting myself for the past 4 years because its the only way to get the weight of all this pain that's dumped onto me everyday off my shoulders. i'm tired of crying everyday, i'm tired of getting called every horrible name in the book and starving myself just to make my mom happy. i'm tired everything, life in general. i want to kill myself so badly but im so afraid of death its crazy.

does anyone know any semi painless ways i could end my life? i can deal with a little pain, i get beatings everyday so i've learned to deal with a little hurt. please don't give me any of the "your life is precious please just survive and live another day, your loved" bullshit. because that's what it is, bullshit. i get enough of that from my cheap crap therapist.

i have bottles of pain meds, antidepressants and anxiety pills. i also have ibuprofen and other basic meds. is overdose painless? like i overdose, go to sleep and die peacefully? my second option was to just jump off my school (4 stories) or any other tall building. i would probaly feel impact but once my head splats on the concrete its done with so i always kept that idea in mind.

please dont reply if you dont have a genuine answer to my my questions, thanks.

anyways that's about it, tysm if u can help me get this over with as fast as possible. i cant deal with this life a day further, i just want to fucking die and be happy.
