When Will I Not Be Held BackThere's no way out of my situation. I am so sick and tired of feeling scared in my own home. I'm sick of all the fighting. My sister and her boyfriend are the only ones who treat me the way I know I deserve to be treated, and even then it's still not enough outside of the moment. I still have to come home to this shithole place full of shithole people. I hate it here. I come so close everyday to just going vertical. I know it would hurt like hell but I deserve it. I want them to come in and see it once I'm dead. I hope it fucking traumatizes them. I hope it keeps them up at night. The bastards.

I wish it could be done without hurting my sister. That's the only reason I am staying. I am barely hanging on but I'm turning my knuckles white for her. 

I wish I didn't have to.
