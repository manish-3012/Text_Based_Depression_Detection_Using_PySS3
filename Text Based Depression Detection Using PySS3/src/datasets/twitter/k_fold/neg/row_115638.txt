I haven't posted here in a whileNot because I am better tho. I haven't felt like i have to the words to say to y'all. I don't see a happy ending in my life. I have broken nerves from fibromyalgia. i have a body that causes me so much despair. in my life i get more and more exhausted from every little thing. I never get energy back. Im dragging myself around everyday. I feel like i'm ruining everyone's day by being near them. I spent a while today holding all the meds I hoped to OD on and decided to look it up and see if it is enough. it wasn't. I don't even have an easy escape now... I wrote a poem on how I feel. 

Why shouldn't she? By Serena [Redacted]

She looked in a mirror 

The horrifying images always reflecting 

The room echos the bass that harms 

She doesn't understand why a god made her 

like some joke

I don't know where to go

What to even do.

I am supposed to live a life

Happy and like others 

I'm not like others 

I'm wrong. 

That word fits too well

Wrong. 

I'm not worth the effort

To become like them

She glaces down

â€¦ 

Little chemicals and a bitter drink. 

Just one bad moment

She will ease the pain of everyone else. 

Why shouldn't she?




I don't see a reason to be worth it. I don't want my own life...
