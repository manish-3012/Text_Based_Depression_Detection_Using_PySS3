Whatâ€™s the point of anythingI donâ€™t get enjoyment from anything, Iâ€™m on 3 meds and my anxiety and depression are still through the roof, I have no motivation for college or anything else, Iâ€™m lonely and yet I hate being around people, never had a girl be at all interested in me at all. I donâ€™t see the point of living. even if I do well in college and get a good job (which is already unlikely) Iâ€™ll still be ugly, asocial and depressed
