I hope to god this feeling is only because of seasonal affective disorder. I'm tired of wanting to die or get high every day.This is so fucking draining. The suicidal ideation is so invasive, it's getting real old. Same with wanting to get loaded all the time. 2 years is a long time to not use drugs or alcohol to any extent, and I'm not sure how much longer I can keep it up.

But I only feel like this during the winter though, so I'm *hoping* it's just SAD. We don't get a lot of sun out here in the PNW. I ordered a sun lamp and I started taking vitamin D supplements. If this doesn't work out I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do.
