I can see myself doing itIt happens with a surge of emotion. I fall into this vivid imaginary vision where I'm hacking at my arm with a knife, then yelping in pain as I would be. It's... satisfying... and terrifying at the same time. In moments where I'm hurt by the situation around me, the vision comes again. This violent daydream always accompanies any bad feeling that leaps out in my life. 

I know death is final, and irreversible. I know it's selfish. It doesn't stop this desire to just end it all. You may not like this thought, but I won't be around to care if they're crying or not. 

I know the direction I'm headed. Whether I'll land there or not is a mystery. Some will be quick to note my terror. As though something in me is recoiling, and preserving myself. Perhaps, but if a car and a tractor pull in opposite directions at the same rope, the whole system will move in the direction of the tractor. I know there are many who can slowly cut the tractor from the rope, but they're not here. I haven't gone to them. The preservation is subdued by this powerful thing which appears every now and then. It's enough to keep me moving in that direction. 

I don't even know what I want from this post. Other than to say: I feel like I'm moving in that direction.
