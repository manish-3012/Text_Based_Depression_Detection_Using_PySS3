23 yo, convicted of child pornI'm now 23, just spent a year in prison after being found guilty for accessing CP. Will be on the national sex offender registry for 20 y.

I don't know if I'm normal or not, but my pathetic social skills definitely have done it. I was supposed to wor an AMAZING tech job in the USA. I worked insanely hard in my younger life for that, which is why my social skills were so poor.

Now my future is gone. I have no hopes and dreams left. Only my really nice former friends pretend to be supportive, but I can tell they want to get away from me. I'm all over the news.

After reading about the Glee actor Mark Salling, his CP conviction and his suicide early this year, i was shocked to see there was no sympathy for him. I want to die now too.

I've been told my actions of viewing CP have hurt victims somewhere. I didn't want it to be true, but the institution keeps telling me it's true. At least it's SUPPOSED to be true. If it is then I don't want to live anymore.
