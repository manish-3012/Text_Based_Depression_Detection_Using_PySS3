im devastatedyesterday, Chester Bennington passed away

He was my biggest inspiration in my life, he saved me in the worst moments of my life

i had the oportunity to talk about this face to face with him a couple of months ago

And he suddenly dies. im devastated.

I was already feeling deppresed weeks ago and this is the last thing i would have expected to happen

Its almost like losing a father

Since these bad news, i havent been able to sleep, havent been able to eat. All I can think about is what would have gone inside his head for him to commit suicide. Im destroyed.

The guy who saved me from suicide killed himself.

It probably sounds like im overreacting, but my life, my friends, my work, my dreams, they all exist because of him. And it feels like all of that, even me, died with him

i cant stop thinking about commiting suicide,
even tho i probably wont, is all my mind is about these days.
