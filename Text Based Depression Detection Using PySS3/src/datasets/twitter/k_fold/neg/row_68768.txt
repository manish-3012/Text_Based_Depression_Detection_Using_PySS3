I feel hopeless. Itâ€™s not rational, but I canâ€™t imagine getting better.Iâ€™ve never posted on reddit before, but I donâ€™t know where else to go.

Iâ€™m a 21-yr-old woman who recently graduated from college, despite not thinking Iâ€™d make it. I finished my thesis, peer taught a course, worked, etc. Now I have a 9-5 job at a major non-profit.

Iâ€™ve been severely depressed since high school. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide once, and I think about it every day. The only thing stopping me is not wanting to put my parents and brothers through it. Over the past year Iâ€™ve developed a major drinking problem. I drink at least between a bottle of wine and a pint of gin a night. Iâ€™m usually hungover at work. Iâ€™ve gone to the hospital for alcohol poisoning a number times, I broke my arm because I fell down the stairs drunk, Iâ€™ve gotten behind the wheel, went to court for being publicly intoxicated, and I often self harm when Iâ€™m drunk. 

I told my family I was becoming sober over a month ago, all the while continuing to drink every night. Iâ€™ve been living with my father, and today he found all the bottles in my room while I was at work. He said they filled a trash bag, and that was just from the past 4 weeks of me living here. Heâ€™s pissed and worried, called my mom (theyâ€™re divorced), sheâ€™s pissed and worried. Iâ€™m embarrassed and ashamed but I also donâ€™t want to stop drinking. 

A big factor here is that Iâ€™ve been off my meds for over a month. I hadnâ€™t been going to my psychiatrist for a long time because I donâ€™t have motivation to do anything, and I just donâ€™t want to see her, but she wonâ€™t prescribe my meds again until I do. Iâ€™ve set an appointment for this Monday. I know being back on meds will help a bit with things, but I also know Iâ€™ve never felt right or like Iâ€™m made to be alive. 

I donâ€™t know if anyone will read this all, but I donâ€™t know what to do. I just feel like thereâ€™s no hope for me.
