Whats the point really?Why is Starving to death socially acceptable, but not offing yourself before you starve to death? Im going to die either way. so whats the point. you wont feed me, if I steal food, youll put me ina  box for a few minutes then put me back exactly to where i was starving but now with even less ability to feed myself.

Why, the heck, is a slow painfull death prefered over a short simpler one. Death isnt pleasent, but when its the only option, why care how the person dies?

I try to get help, and i try to escape my bondage, but its useless, when I attempt the only surefire way to end the horror, i am stopped, and scolded. told pretty lies like "it gets better"

it really doesnt.

maybe if you have a family, or freinds, or a bank account it can be somewhat justified to prevent the loss to society.

but if you dont give a shit if im alive, why care who kills me?
