Why did I still not kill myself?I will. My demise will be of my own one day. When I think I had enough of this shit, I will just end it.

Do I have any reason to live right now? Nope.
But I also have no reason to die as well.

I don't enjoy life. I'm either depressed or having mental breakdowns or so "overenjoying" it in a maniac way that it becomes unenjoyable. But still, I don't think I had enough of this shit.

Nothing in this post makes any sense, I know. But life doesn't make any sense also. And so death doesn't too.

Thanks for wasting your time reading this unnecessary post. And thanks for still not killing yourself to be able read this post.

Well, Imma go and have some more shit until I have enough of it.
