I don't have any reason to keep trying.The only reason I don't just stop and end it is because I owe my oldest friend money.  But in a couple months I'll be paid up.  Everyone I used to call a friend has given up on me.  When I moved in to a new rental house with two friends, one of them told me the one thing my previous roommate who I also considered my closest friend at the time had said about me.  That there was just nothing else there.  That basically i was a hollow person.  He was right.
