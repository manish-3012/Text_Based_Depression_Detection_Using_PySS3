Opened up about my suicidal thoughts and was told to get over it. Don't know what to do now.I'm truly at a loss. What do I do now, that I've finally opened up and was told to just get over it? I don't even know how to go on living when my pain was just completely ignored. Is that what I'm going to get when I seek help?  Do people really care if you're suicidal? Do people care if you're in pain?  Or do they just see that pain as a sign of weakness that you need to get over? If that's all the help I'll get, when I'm suicidal or even just struggling, I might as well do it now.
