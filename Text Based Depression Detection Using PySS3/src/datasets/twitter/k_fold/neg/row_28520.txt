Iâ€™ve never wanted to kill myself more than nowI got so fucking upset over such a stupid thing today, and Iâ€™m honestly such a selfish fucking child.

My parents got me a dresser and we had to put it together, currently in the process of doing so. But I was doing literally nothing all day because I need help putting it together. My sister was working on schoolwork all day and I got upset because she absolutely promised we would do it today but I know we wonâ€™t. 
My room is covered with nails and wood, and itâ€™s kind of driving me insane.

So I got upset and started complaining about it, to which my parents and my sister defended themselves and they were all right. 
I feel so horrible for getting upset, itâ€™s not their fault at all. Itâ€™s completely my fault and I feel so fucking selfish and like a total brat. I feel useless and inconvenient, but I mostly just feel horrible for getting upset in the first place when honestly Iâ€™m just being selfish.

And the thought of killing myself makes me feel like everything would be so much better. My parents wouldnâ€™t have to spend so much money on me anymore, they could use my room to make our house more spacious, they could go on more trips with all that extra money. And they wouldnâ€™t have to deal with me anymore. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m going to actually do it, but I canâ€™t be sure right now. 

Idk I just needed to vent or something. At least if Iâ€™m dead, i canâ€™t be a selfish little bitch anymore.
