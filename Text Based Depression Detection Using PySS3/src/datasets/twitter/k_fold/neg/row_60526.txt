Feeling very low and not a good outcomeWhen I feel bad, I usually come here with my real account and I tend to help people, but today I really don't even feel good enough for that.

I am 33 years old, and my birthday is in September. I am currently on financial distress, single and in a big house all by myself. Basically I work for commission and had a base salary, which I counted to barely survived. I closed a deal, but for unforeseen circumstances, even when it closed, I couldn't get paid. It might not sound bad, but this was suppose to represent this years salary. Also, the company took a hit and they can't even pay me my base salary. I also got in debt trying to survive and spent over $1,000 with my AMEX on company expenses which were never returned. There still a slight chance I might get my money at the end of the month, but if I don't get it, this would mean I will not be able to make any payments and I will not have money even for gas or food. It will be the first time I haven't paid rent and AMEX might send my bill to a collection agency, damaging my credit terribly. Finally, I postponed my tax declaration to October, since I was suppose to get the money to pay them, but I don't know if this might happen.

I don't have kids. I don't have a wife, I don't even have a dog. This is both a curse and a bless. It is a bless because I would not like to have other suffering for me, but at the same time, I feel very lonely and I see as if the goal of having a family disappears each day. I really hate having worked so hard and risked so much and yet I have nothing to show.

I have been thinking about buying a gun and just blow my brain out. I would like nobody to blame itself for my death. I just feel like a deer in front of a pair of headlights, paralyzed while that car comes closer and closer.
