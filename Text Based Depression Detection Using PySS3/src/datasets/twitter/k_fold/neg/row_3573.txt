Is there really any hope?Iâ€™ve wanted to die and seen it as my only real option for years now (at least 7 years and Iâ€™m 20). I donâ€™t see any way I can support myself financially and be happy. Working 8+ hours a day and all the stresses that come with it outweigh the good in life. Iâ€™ve already failed out of school once so Iâ€™d probably have to work multiple jobs to support myself in any city that I can be openly gay in, and the one job I did have was already super stressful and hard for me despite being an entry-level job at under 40 hours a week.

I just donâ€™t see any options for me. I donâ€™t think that itâ€™s possible for everyone to be compatible with the world. With 7.5 billion people, suicide must be the right answer for some of us, probably including me. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m wrong to feel like life is hopeless for me.
