I feel bad for those who care about me.I feel bad for the people who waste their time on me - I've been completely fucked for years and yet there are still people who remain around me by choice despite myself, and how I've treated them.

That's not really why I feel bad though. I feel bad because I know eventually that I'm going to end my life. Not today, maybe not even soon, but to me saying I'm gonna end up dead by my own hand is like saying water is wet or the sky is blue. I feel bad for these people because they hold out hope that my opinions on life will change and that one day I'll be happy and have the things I clamor for... it will never happen, either because of its inherent impossibility or because I will prevent it by killing myself.

I'm not even remotely upset while typing this, which further cements how much I believe this. It doesn't even scare me, it's just reality.
