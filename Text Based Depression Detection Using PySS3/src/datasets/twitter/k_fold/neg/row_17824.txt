overwhelmed by emotion.iâ€™m in a constant state of panic and i canâ€™t find relief. my head is a mess and the thoughts of death are the only thing that seem to make me eerily calm. 

today has been worse than others because itâ€™s a holiday without the people who mean the most to me. i lost my dad last year. family canâ€™t be here because of covid. my girlfriend and i recently broke up (my choice, i regret it). i donâ€™t know what to do. 

itâ€™s taking everything in me not to do it, but then i think of how it would impact my family... how my stepdadâ€™s suicide crushed my mom and my sister, how my therapist would feel, how my (ex) girlfriend would be impacted by another suicide in her life. i donâ€™t want to hurt the people i love but iâ€™m afraid my inner demons are too strong today.
