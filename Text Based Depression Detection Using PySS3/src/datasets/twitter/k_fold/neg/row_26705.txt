I Didn't Get Any Responses In r/depressionI had big dreams of becoming a film maker. My teachers and family have always encouraged me and got my hopes up. I actually believed that these dreams would come true, but then it all fell apart before my eyes. Whenever I came up with a good idea for a movie to make, I couldn't do it. I couldn't find actors or I didn't have access to fancy props or sets. I didn't have a lot of money or special effects. I didn't have what I need to bring my visions to life. My hopes and dreams are ruined. I've tried replacing film making with other things like drawing, writing books, and song writing, but none of those really worked out for me. Now I have nothing to do with my life. My life has no purpose.
