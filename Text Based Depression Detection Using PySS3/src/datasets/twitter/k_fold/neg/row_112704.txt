I have lost all hope.I am a 25 years-old guy who injured himself... right *there*... out of sheer curiosity and by doing so I've probably forfeited any chance at having a successful love/sex life for what is probably the rest of my life. Jeezus.

Yes - I've ruined my penis by jelqing. Peripheral nerve damage (axonotmesis). I feel very little sensation although it's "only" day seven and sensitivity isn't supposed to return before day fifteen; due to the kind of trauma I've sustained, my fella is also slightly bent. Everybody's telling me not to worry - that everything will be fine - and my urologist too agrees. Parents have become sick of my concerns and won't listen to me. Friends turned out to be fairly useless.

Everybody just minimises my condition; I just can't see no progress, no hope, no nothing! Sensitivity is so low I can almost piss myself sometimes and have to carefully time loo breaks as a result. There's no joy in living anymore.

Before that fateful evening I had plans for the future... joined a gym... hung out with friends... even planned to enroll at university and getting a G/BF. No more. I've always been depressed but this is the straw that broke my back. Cried all the way to work this morning, thinking to end it once and for all. The only thing keeping me from doing it is the thought of my parents, family, friends. I honestly can't bring myself to break their hearts.

On one hand I still want to live; I've got so much love to give. On the other my body just won't let me to. 

Can't bear living among all those happy people and their enjoyable sex lives!

I'd kill just to get a time machine and stop myself from doing that.
