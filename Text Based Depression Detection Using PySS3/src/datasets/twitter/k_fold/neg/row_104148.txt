Planning to kill myself this semesterI just don't feel like living. Wasted the first two years of my engineering, now my classmates are doing ML, CP and whatnot while I am just wasting time like an idiot. Don't think I will get any job offers. Coming from a developing country and being an average guy sucks.
I tried finding interests but I couldn't move past even the basics.  I tried but I just couldn't. 
Just finding a way to make it easier for my parents. They don't deserve this waste of space. 
Any suggestions would be welcome. Gun laws are strict in this country and there are no buildings higher than 10 floors.
