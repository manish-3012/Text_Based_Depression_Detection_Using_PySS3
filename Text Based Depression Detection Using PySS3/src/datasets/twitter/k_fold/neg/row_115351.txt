the only reason iâ€™m alive right now is because i canâ€™t think of where to dieiâ€™m really really sorry if this is triggering to people, i just need to get this out. 

ive been having suicidal ideations for a few weeks now but iâ€™ve been depressed since january. nothing specific triggered it that i can think of. iâ€™m just not interested in continuing to live and i havenâ€™t been for awhile. only one of my friends knows about this and sheâ€™s 3 hours away by car and i feel bad about putting this on her so iâ€™ve just stopped talking to her about it in hopes that she thinks everything is better. i talked to a crisis counselor via text today and it really didnâ€™t help me at all. i donâ€™t really enjoy talking about my feelings in general and i donâ€™t think i know anyone who would handle the situation in a way that would make me feel better. ive looked into therapy and i called a bunch of places and they werenâ€™t taking new patients so iâ€™ve kind of given up on that.

iâ€™m planning on hanging myself because i think that would be the least painful but it means i canâ€™t be like mobile and iâ€™d have to find somewhere to do it. my first plan would be my room but i really donâ€™t want my roommates to be the ones to find me. i was originally looking into the sleeping pill route and i was going to smoke weed and go to a park and give a crisis hotline my location as i was passing out so that EMS personnel would find me, but since no one really wants people to kill themselves itâ€™s hard to find out how to get them and how many iâ€™d need to take online, which sucks for me i guess.

iâ€™m writing a note after this to bring with me wherever i end up doing it. i might still go to a park but i really donâ€™t want to scar someone forever and i think itâ€™d be easier to find my body just asleep on the ground vs hanging. iâ€™m probably not going to do it tonight because i want to clean my room and do laundry so that itâ€™s easier on my family to pack up my stuff. iâ€™m scheduled to work tomorrow but iâ€™m planning on calling off and saying that i have food poisoning. at the moment, iâ€™m planning on doing it tomorrow night. i just wanted to write this all down as kind of a last ditch effort. iâ€™d rather exhaust all of my options and iâ€™m down to the end.
