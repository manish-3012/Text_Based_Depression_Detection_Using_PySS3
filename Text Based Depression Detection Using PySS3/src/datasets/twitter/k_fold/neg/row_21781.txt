I keep seeing &amp; speaking with my dead girlfriend, and I don't know who to turn to.Im not a threat to myself, just couldn't think of anyone else to talk to. About a week ago someone came through my front door in the middle of the night. I then armed myself thinking it was a brake in, but when I found it was it was just a girl sitting beside my door. I asked who she was and then she took off her hood to revile it was my girlfriend who died a year ago in a house fire. 

After that I said I must be dreaming but she insisted I wasn't, but i then confronted her about being dead and she told me that she did go to the hospital for the reason she died (caught in house fire) but that i was the one who was there longer for a head injury, and I was mixing things up. I then started to ask her questions like how she knew were I lived and why she was gone for a year, and she told me that she &amp; her family (all died in the fire) had to change their identities to start a new life and she looked me up since a old friend told her were I was. So after talking for awhile I decided to make breakfast (about 4 hours had paste) and she asked of she could have a shower, which I said yes.

After a hour of hearing water running I checked on her and the shower was dry with the lights off and the sound of rain coming through the pipes heavily. I then just shook it off as a sleep walking thing.Then, it happens again today when I was shopping for groceries. She kept telling me to get the things she liked and how I should eat healthier. thankfully I was able to ignore her.

She said she had to go home before I could ask her questions like why didn't the cashier look at you or why you went behind me so i went through the automatic doors first. I'm just curious if anyone has any advice for me, thanks for reading through my a wall of text and maybe helping me.
