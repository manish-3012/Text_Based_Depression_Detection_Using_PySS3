I wish I was depressedI just want to get some things outs cuz I really can't talk to anybody about this.

I'm not depressed. I mean, I want to die, I'm going to for sure, but I don't feel sad or anything like that.

I just don't want to keep living, I don't like it, I don't enjoy being here. It's like this feeling of not belonging.

I wouldn't say I'm super happy and everything is great but I don't feel depressed. And I kind of wish I was, because if I was at last I'd have an answer about why I feel this way. 

I used to have things grounding me and keeping me here but I've stopped caring about them a long time ago. I quit school (and that's saying something) I was always the A+ good girl that never misbehave but I just stopped caring, I stopped caring about my family, my friends, I don't like the things that I used to, I don't do anything all day. 

The only reason I'm here it's because I don't have money to pay for the funeral or whatever is  cheapest. 

Idk, what else to say, I just needed to get somethings out before going to bed. So bye I guesssss
