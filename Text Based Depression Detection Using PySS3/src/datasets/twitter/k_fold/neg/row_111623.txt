When will time tellOne day ill do it. No question about it, been running through my mind my whole life. The only thing that has stopped me is how? Some ways scare me, some seem entertaining but more difficult. Idk what to do anymore honestly I don't like talking to people I have never felt like that has helped also have never been entertained by complaining to others and burdening them with my problems. Idk my rope is getting thin its just a matter how much much longer it will be.
