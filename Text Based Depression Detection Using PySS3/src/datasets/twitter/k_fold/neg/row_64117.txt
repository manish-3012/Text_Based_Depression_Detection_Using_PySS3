I'm trapped, I'm stuck and I'm suffocating with no way out.I'm like the most unfortunate person ever. Bad shit kept happening to be again and again to the point where ending my life is the only option left. I worked so so hard to make things better but nothing happened and things got worse. I can't sleep. I can't even breath freely. I'm drowning in misery. I just want it to end so badly. My life has already ended and I'm basically dead. I'm just waiting till my birthday to kill myself which is a month from now. I really my afterlife or next life will be better. Here's to hoping for a better next life.
