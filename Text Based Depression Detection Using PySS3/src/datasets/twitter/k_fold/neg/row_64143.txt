Too Negative to FunctionWas anyone else raised by toxic/negative parents? Iâ€™m only just now realizing what an effect mine had on me. I am such a negative person and I donâ€™t know how not to be. Itâ€™s honestly exhausting and sometimes it just feels like, why do people like me exist? It just feels like an experiment both I and my parents have already failed. Makes me want to just live the rest of my life in a cave.
