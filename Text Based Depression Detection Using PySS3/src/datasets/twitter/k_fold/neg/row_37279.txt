It's happeningHi, first off greetings to every other human being in here. I'm going to die tonight. I'm a couple of minutes away from the local train station. I'm going to walk up the tracks until I'm about halfway between the stations and I'm going to kneel between the tracks when I see the next train coming. I'm posting here because I have a shred of sadness in leaving this world and would love to have seen it get better. However I believe I'm ending it before it gets worse, and it will. I think there are amazing people out there who if there's such thing as an afterlife, I will try my best to protect and help. I'm ready to go. I just wish I could have said my goodbyes. I'll say goodbye to you guys though. I'll truly miss you.
