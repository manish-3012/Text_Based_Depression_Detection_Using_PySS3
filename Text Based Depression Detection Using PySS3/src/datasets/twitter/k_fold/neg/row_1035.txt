Hotline called cops on me :/So around 1 week ago I contacted the hotline saying I had a plan to kill my self tomorrow and how I was going to do it, after talking with her for 2 hours without my notice she called the police on me, This gave everyone in my house a shock especially when the police said they where investigating a suicide.

Eventually this leads to me being evaluated at a hospital which I lie to them about basically every question they ask me, I constantly denied that it was me who said they where suicidal even though they had some sort of solid proof.

So after lieing through an evaluation I'm discharged, Easy as right? Well thing is is I'm still suicidal and looking at a bunch of pills that I just want to fucking chug right now, Pretty stuck and it's 6 am dk what to do.

I also don't trust the hotline right now as they might pull the same shit on me so here I am.
