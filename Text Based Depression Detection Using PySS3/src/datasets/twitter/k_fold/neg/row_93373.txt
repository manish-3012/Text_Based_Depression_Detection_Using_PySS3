I'm just a zombieThis is just a throwaway account cuz if anyone around me knew what I was actually felling I would hurt them, knowing in the end I haven't changed, and haven't gotten better despite what I say. 

Anyway i fell so lifeless, like a dead zombie with no emotion, who's just lying and putting on smiles, and jokes, despite me instentally trying to stall till I can find a bathroom, to go cry.

Apparently I'm a genius for a 13 year old, with a iq of 152, and people constantly putting all these expectations on me because of it, I have all advanced classes, everyone around me thinks of me as this genius, great musician, funny bright kid, while I barley pay attention in class, yet still get staggering great grades. Everyone around me has established me as the once suicidal kid, seeing as I opened up to them once, and told them how I was felling. I felt like a attention whore for doing it, and regret doing it immensely, The thing was I didn't want to trouble them, and to stress them out, so I lied about felling better, now everyone respects me, to high standards for me just lying. And then everyone comes to me for there "depression" and I just idk, I fell like a lie. Sorry I just needed someone to know.
