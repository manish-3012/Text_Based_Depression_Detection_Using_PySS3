Not feeling so great anymore.I have thought about suicide since I was about 15, 25 now.  I've only ever expressed it to two people, both of which were my girlfriend's at the time, and it was during our breakup.  I've heard from a few people that the types that actually kill themselves are the people that don't say they are, not the ones that talk about it.

I've not been diagnosed with anything, but I know from research and family history that I suffer from bouts of depression and bi-polar disorder.

Some back story on why I frequently think about doing it:
My girlfriend of 3 years broke up with me recently and started dating her ex, who I found out was never really out of the picture.  I have a job at a decent company, but it prevents me from going back to school and attaining a degree, thus keeping me from moving up in my job.  My daily job activities are dull and I don't like what I'm doing, but I love the company and it's benefits. I'm in a lot of debt.  I don't have spending money, it all goes to bills.  My car got messed up recently and I don't have money to fix that.  I feel like my friends aren't good enough friends for me to ever mention this to or that they would be supportive if I did.  I don't have the gumption to try and meet new people.

My home life (I'm still with my parents because of my money issue) isn't great.  My dad suffers from bi-polar disorder but refuses to accept the fact and can become verbally abusive to my mother and brother.  My brother suffers from it, but takes medication for it, so it's not so bad.  My mom seems to be at the end of her rope with all of the problems in her life.

I posted in r/relationships under a different account a while ago, but my post was removed for whatever reason, so I didn't get any help there.  Either way, this is a different subject all together.

I just wanted to write this down somewhere where someone could see it.
