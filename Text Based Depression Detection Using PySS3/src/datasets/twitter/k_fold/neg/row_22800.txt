My nieces boyfriend took his life this morningPlease think of how taking your own life affects the ones you leave behind.  My 22 year old niece now has to live each day with the regrets and guilt of what she might of done differently to have saved her boyfriend but it was beyond her control. 

I know Christmas is a time of year that is very hard on people and suicides happen more often. 

 To go from watching a video of her, him and her 18mth old daughter open gifts this morning to an hour later after an arguement she finds him hanging in their apartment.  The devastation that is not left for everyone to endure is unthinkable. 

Christmas now for his family, our family and those known to this will forever bring nothing but sadness and self blame. 

Please rethink thoughts of suicide.. it leaves more damage then staying to fight to live.
