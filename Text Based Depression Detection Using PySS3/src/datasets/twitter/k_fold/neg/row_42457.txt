unwilling to live, unable to die....I guess the worst of my desire to kill myself started a few months after my ex left me ... that was almost 7 years ago. emotionally i guess i never got over it, mentally i've always hated life. people never really liked me for long periods of time. so i've tried to die a few times. sliced open some vital spots, stabbed a few places, even tried alcohol poisoning... i've been alone, although i have people i call friends none are close me to geographically so i don't have anyone. tried to meet new people and they just don't seem to care. tried therapy and that didn't work.
don't really know why i even wrote this, it's rather pathetic of me to do so since it really doesn't matter. i'll wake up to the void that is this world, go to my job and fake being alive, then go home and sit in my cold, dark apartment and dreading going through it again. I had a car accident 4 years ago too and my body is a wreck on top of it. tried to OD on my painkillers and strong liquor and still woke up the next day in my bed.
*shrug* this is a waste of time i guess since i don't have a point other than to sound like a disjointed rant.
