Please i need urgent helpI opened up about my social anxiety this morning school is abojt to begin in like an hour and i've been restless and can't sleep aince a week now. I had a panoc attack while callinv my mom and she went upstairs and told her about my anxiety that's been bothering me for 1.5 years now. She didn't even try to understand she said i just need to get pver that hurdle and just walked off angrily. I feel like killing myself right now. It's like no one cares for me. No one even tries to understand. If my mom keeps axting like this by evening i'm going to the park to drown myself while taking medicine and od'ing. Nothing is stopping me. I've been suffering for so long. All of these feelings are piled
