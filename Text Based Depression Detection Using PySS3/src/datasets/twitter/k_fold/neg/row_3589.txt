advice pleaseI had a pretty good childhood, my parents were divorced pretty young, I don't care so much. I was pretty depressed my 8th grade year up until my first year of high school. My life has been amazing ever since. I have a purpose in life. I have had a hormone condition from very young, it ruined my life. It pains me every morning to see men in general, no one will ever love me like this. When people said it will get better I never believed them and called bullshit. Life did get good. I couldn't even go in public at some point because of how disgusted I was at myself. I can walk outside now, talk to people. My mother won't let me take hormones until I'm 18, It kills me because I'm embarrassed how I look when I was outside, I feel disgusting, like a woman. It never fucking leaves me, it comes back every second of the day. I can't do 2 more years until I go fucking insane. I feel like a pussy all day, like I'm not a man. I'm going insane. It's driving me mad. Every single day I wake up and ask god why he's fucked me, what did I do to deserve this?  I can't handle another day of this bs
