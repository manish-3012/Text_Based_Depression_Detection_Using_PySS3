I'm back home... now what?I went to Poland 10 months ago to change my life. Partially because I thought where I lived and went to school was boring, partially because I thought I might get better there.

I got back home on Tuesday. After being sick from probably catching something off the plane, I'm well physically, but... apathetic. Sad and lonely.

None of my friends know I'm home yet. Don't really know if they are friends. People I used to go to High School with over two years ago? More that than anything else. I don't really want to tell them either.

My family is great, I'm glad to be back,  but... well, my brother doesn't like to do stuff with his sister. My mother and grandmother can only so much be my friends. Dad's a truck-driver, so he's not home at the moment. My dog doesn't even like me that much.

Some of my OCD issues are coming back. I was OK in Poland for the most part, but home with a dog (that prefers my grandmother, which makes me sad actually. He's supposed to be my dog, but... :/ I used to play with him, but since the OCD I can't really pet him that much even) I'm starting to wash my hands more.

Poland didn't work, coming back isn't working. I can't go back to school until summer at earliest and it'll probably end up being the fall semester anyway.

Also haven't spoken to my long-distance fiancÃ© in a few days. Not properly for a few weeks, even. He actually has school and a job, and I do barely anything.

I still feel so lonely, but I don't even know if I want to be near people.

SW has been coming up on my main page all day, and I can sincerely tell everyone that they're worth it and good and should try to fix things, but when *I* think about it... I don't see a reason for me.
