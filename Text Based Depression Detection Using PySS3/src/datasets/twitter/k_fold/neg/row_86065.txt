Another fucking yearWhy is it so impossible for me to kill myself. I seriously thought I would have this over with five years ago but here I am. And Iâ€™m really tired of people platitudes, Iâ€™ve been getting told since I was 14 that it would get better but the thing is it just doesnâ€™t end up like a movie for some people, for some it just doesnâ€™t improve or gets worse
