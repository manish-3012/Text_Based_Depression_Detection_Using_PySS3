I should be DeadI have been majorly suicidal for a few years now. I have tried many times to kill myself, but nothing has worked so far. Last time I took 20 pills of Lithium and drank a ton. Woke up the next day fine. I've done stuff like this a lot. I tried 20 pills of Oxycontin with booze, same result. I've tried 60 bars of Xanax with booze and 10 pills of Hydrocodone. It's like my liver is imortal. And I have done a lot of drugs and drinking, so it should have been shot after one or 2 of these sort of attempts. I'm probably closer to 20 now, some are hard to remember. I don't know when I will try again, just felt like I should put down something to give an idea to someone what I am going through. No one else knows the full extent though. even my doctors at the mental hospitals I have been stuck in.
