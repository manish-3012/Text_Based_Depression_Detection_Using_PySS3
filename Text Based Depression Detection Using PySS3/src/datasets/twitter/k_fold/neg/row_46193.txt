I legitimately can't think of a reason not to, anymore.I have a shit job I hate working for shit money, and this is the only thing I know how to do.

I work with dogs and was recently traumatized by a large dog who turned on me, so I'm bringing nothing but anger into the workplace and it's showing. 

I can't even bring myself to text my boss back, who gently tries to guide me into doing what I need to. I want to say sorry and I'll do better, but I think tonight is the night. And I don't know how to explain to her that I'm collapsing in on myself and none of this matters anymore.

I'm 35 and my mother has to give me money so I can pay my rent, I live in a shithole apartment in a shitty part of town in a  room full of trash because I'm too lazy and depressed to even consider cleaning up after myself.

I'm a fucked up embarrassment, a burden, and a total disappointment.

And yeah there are people I can call, but why bother? They definitely care and will probably be devastated, but they're not the ones living like this. They'll be sad and eventually move on with their lives like you have to, because these things...just happen, sometimes.

I'm mentally exhausted, physically exhausted, I have 400 dollars to last me until the end of the month when I get my next check that won't be enough. 

I just want to rest. I want to be insulated from all this. I'm tired of being a loser, and I'm tired of losing. 

Nobody has ever really loved and needed me. Not really. And I'm done waiting for somebody who will.
