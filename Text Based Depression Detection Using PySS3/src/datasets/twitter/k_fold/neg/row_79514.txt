Iâ€™m a defective human beingI donâ€™t deserve to be a part of this world. I donâ€™t want to do anything with my life except kill myself. I have zero life skills or interests. Nothing in life is enjoyable anymore. The only way I can resolve everything is if I end my pathetic existence. Iâ€™m destined to be a failure in society. Might as well end it early so that no more time and resources has to be wasted on me.
