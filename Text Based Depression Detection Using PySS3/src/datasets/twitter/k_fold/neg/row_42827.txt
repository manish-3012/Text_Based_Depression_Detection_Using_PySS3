I want to so badlyIâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make sense and sounds like rambling but I (18F) donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Every day feels like such a struggle to me now and I donâ€™t know how to get better. 
Iâ€™ve been taking 10mg of lexapro for depression and anxiety for almost a month and Iâ€™ve been going to therapy along with taking it but I honestly feel worse. Iâ€™m cutting again (a lot) and Iâ€™m currently sitting here on my bed writing a note saying good bye. I just feel so tired and done with life. Getting out of bed, going to school/work, going to practice, fuck even breathing feels like such a chore to me now. Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™m going to do something, I donâ€™t have a plan but thereâ€™s definitely a drive to do it. The only thing stopping me is what itâ€™ll do to people around me but Iâ€™m kind of starting to not care anymore. 

Im not going to do it tonight or any time soon. I donâ€™t even have a plan as to how Iâ€™d do it but Iâ€™m worried because I really want to. I donâ€™t know what to do
