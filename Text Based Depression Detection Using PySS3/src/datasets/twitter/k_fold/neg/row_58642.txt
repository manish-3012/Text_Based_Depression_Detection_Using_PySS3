I have tried to kill myself before.... Just got divorced and breakup.... And I am relatively calmI had an affair. During the affair the other woman was manipulative. She talked about cutting and jumping off a bridge. 

I drove down 3 hrs before to this really tall gorge. And was going to jump, had called my then wife and kids just prior. 

But I chicken out. I thought of my kids. How I had been sick before and came out of it.

Now, the divorce is finalized. The other woman has started fucking someone else. 

I feel calm but I fear I might break. I might do something terrible. 

I am in the profession of knowing life and death and have the means and resources to end. 

How do I get help when I am low? 
I'm depressed as fuck. I lie in bed all the time, worried about the other woman. I am obsessed with her for almost a year. I can't get out of this rut.
