I am considering suicide as a solution,what should i do?At this point i have no idea why I'm making this post but each day i find myself contemplating suicide more and more,asking myself if i should do it or not and every single day I'm thinking about it. 

For those that are going to ask i do am taking medications. (However i don't think they work) And also talking to a therapist. (But he doesn't know about these toughts)

What should i do?
