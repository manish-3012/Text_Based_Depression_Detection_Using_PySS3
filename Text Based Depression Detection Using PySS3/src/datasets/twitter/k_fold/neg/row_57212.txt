Today is the closest I've been to suicide.I've dealt with depression for a very long time and an eating disorder for a time shorter than that.  I fucked up big time with the girlfriend yesterday and since then have been spiraling.  Today we talked on the phone for over an hour and it sounds like we may be able to negotiate a relationship that works for both of us, but it sounds like a lot of work.

I guess my biggest concern is that we both made lists of what we need out of the relationship, and in her top 5 was great sex (like we used to have).  I relapsed into the disordered eating rather suddenly and haven't really wanted sex or to be naked since then.  I know it has been really hard for her and I *do* love her a lot, but right now it seems like something impossible to give her.

I've also fallen back in to self-injury (which I hadn't done since 2006).  The locations have become more visible and a bigger pain to hide.  I just want to close myself off from everyone and sleep for a while.  Suicide just seems like such a comfortable solution right now.
