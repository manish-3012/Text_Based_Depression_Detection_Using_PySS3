Abandoned by family &amp; friends...so alone, some suicidal thoughts :(Though this is long-winded it is a nutshell...lots left out.

I was in an emotionally abusive relationship for 23 years. When I finally found the courage to leave, the only person (supposed family) around to support me (who knew he was abusive) was my stepmother. 

In a nutshell, over the next 3 years, while my narcissistic, somewhat sociopathic ex strangled me financially, my stepmother slowly started to abandon me. A couple examples: when I told her I was suicidal, she ignored me (she used to work on a crisis prevention hotline), when I told her I was so scared about money I was considering porn, she supported the idea without hesitation...as she travels and gives to charity using OUR family money my deceased father made. 

THEN I have not had any relationship, and barely a date in the 3 years since I left my ex. I am fit, and attractive, and put out a very positive vibe (even if I am crying inside - a talent I've perfected over 45 years being taught that if I show any pain, anger, negative emotion, I will be looked down on and abandoned....so smile :))))

THEN I was laid off in April...still no job.  Have to move within next cpl months because I can't afford to stay.

THEN my sister turned her back on me. She decided the anniversary of our father's death an appropriate time to say. "I can't have a video chat with you because I am not comfortable, and no, I won't say why because it won't help." No clue what's up. She had a gathering to honour our father and never did a call or video call with me.

THEN my 18 year old daughter and I had a **basic** 20 second argument, after which she left my home, asked me to "...refrain from contacting her...", then 10 days later tells me she's permanently moving to her father's and now again its been 5 days...no word, even though I just send a heart...nothing.  Sadly, she has similar communication style to my ex, passive aggressive, does not want to ever discuss and sees ANY correction/negative comment e.g. if I offer to show her how to complete a chore she's struggling with more easily, as an attack, and I get nasty looks.

THEN my very good friend who I have been leaning on, and her on me (in fact I recently helped her while she was ill and rushed her to hospital). After she was released started to, 'ghost me', and when I inquired as to what was going on, I got a VERY aggressive reply with statements, such as "...we owe each other nothing...", and "...I have no room in my life for anyone's else... I do not like any expectation of me".

 No clue where ANY of this came from...there was more, cruelly stated jibes...I thought I knew her. She knows about all the above pain and yet she stabs me in the heart....and again with no reason.

Most of this transpired over the past week (though I have a life history of people abandoning me). I now have NO family and NO friends to lean on. I am **completely alone** (say for one GF in the US and I am in Canada), watching everyone else have lives, go out for meals etc., and I sit at home, or wander the streets alone.

Suicide has definitely come to mind :(
