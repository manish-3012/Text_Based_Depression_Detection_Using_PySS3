Never thought I'd be posting hereI find myself saying that I want to die pretty often. I feel miserable. I don't want to commit suicide, but if like... A meteor squished me into oblivion I actually wouldn't mind that much. I'm lost, confused, scared, and mainly tired... Tired from not knowing what to do/what I'm doing with my life. 

Anyways... Keep your chin up, and look for the light even in darkness I guess. Much love, guys. &lt;3
