Feeling suicidalI've posted here before, so I guess I'm back and feeling a lot worse than I have in a long time. I don't and can't feel a connection with anyone. I don't see a purpose to this life that I have. I understand that I have loved ones that will feel pain when I die. But it seems so unfair because they could never comprehend the pain that I feel to come to this point where dying is a better path than life for me. I'm exhausted and altogether tired of living. Cutting only stops the pain for the while, but then it only floods back even stronger than before.
