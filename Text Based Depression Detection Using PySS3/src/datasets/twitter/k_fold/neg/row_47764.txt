Idk how to handle anything anymore..Idk how to handle anything anymore

Just a vent cuz Iâ€™m really stressed and panicking rn cuz idk how to help myself and I just feel like crying all the time (alone ofc). Basically I feel corona has ruined my life rn. This semester i signed up for a couple courses to see if theyâ€™re of any interest since im still figuring out what to do. I thought i mightve been interested in engineering but only to realize how much work it involves so now im back to square one. Just note ive already done 2 full years of college before this semester. I felt like i tried all different courses for the past 2 years but nothing seems to click. I just felt all of them as an obligation to do rather than an interest. I also suck at school meaning im not naturally good in any specific area. I have to really work at it to do well. in addition im also working part time. However i feel all of its getting stressful and i have to drop everything cuz im too tired/lazy to do the work. I also want to quit my job but i dont want to disappoint them (aka the telling part, id rather just quit and dont come back after that).
Forthe past 2 years the only thing that motivated me to work hard/study hard was playing soccer but now that i cant do intramurals or club, or even play on the turf fields i feel like i have nothing. No motivation to do anything. Theres nothing in my life that means more to me than playing soccer. Please dont suggest being a soccer coach becuz i know that i dont want to do that since im not really good with kids and i just plain dont like teaching in general. I really feel that i need a therapist but i dont want my parents to know, i just dont know how to get one either. Plus the fact ive never been to one so i feel it would be very difficult for me to express how i feel also including how i feel about suicide cuz I definitely dont want to get sent to a psy ward nty.
