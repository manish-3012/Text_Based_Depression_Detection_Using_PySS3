Why Bother...?I'm gonna be dead in x number of days or years anyway, and things keep getting shittier, so why participate in this cycle of fighting just so you can keep suffering. Fight so I can suffer more? seems pretty counter-intuitive to me, I wish I could transcend the damned innate biological instinct for survival. Sometimes I think I would like to see a therapist, but losing my ability to own guns concerns me much, much more. 

Also, is it possible to get a DNR order as a physically healthy 20-year-old?
