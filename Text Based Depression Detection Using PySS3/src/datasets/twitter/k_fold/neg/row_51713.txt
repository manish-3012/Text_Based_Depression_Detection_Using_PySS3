Being told that I "overshare too much" made me lose hope again.So, I've been feeling pretty motivated for the past 2 weeks. I wouldn't say happy, but I read some chapters of an old book, i cooked some food, and didn't stay in bed all day, as I usually would.
There was this guy who has been asking me to go out with him, so I said to myself "this could be your chance to make a new friend or possibly more. Maybe things changed! Put yourself out there!.". 
Everything was going great, until he saw my arm which has some pretty visible scars. I get the typical question "how did those happen?", and i told him the truth. Of course I didn't get into graphic details, I just said that it was me who did it.
He looked at me disgusted, and he started yelling "you're oversharing too much personal stuff !!! It's JUST the first date. I've been through bad stuff too, like, my grandpa died 2 months ago but you don't see me talking about it!". I just slowly nodded and waited for the date to end.
I feel like absolute shit. Not because of the guy, I couldn't give less of a shit about him, it's just that, right when I try to find the tiniest bit of hope, I fall into shit again. I didn't know that I was supposed to lie about my scars. Either way, I feel like I can't talk to anyone without getting yelled at. I feel like the  biggest fucking idiot.
