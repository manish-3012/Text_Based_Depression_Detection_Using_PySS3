So lostI'm drowning in debt. My job feels dead end but I'm getting rejected by everywhere (for years now), regardless of having a degree (in business and a separate one in music). I can't do anything. Then I got sick and had surgery that helped me gain over 50 pounds that my family loves to point out. I hate myself and I hate all that I can't do. I know all problems are temporary but they just keep leading into more. I can't do it, I can't keep up...
