WHY CANT I DIEI had the gun right in my mouth. There was a bullet. I swear to God there was! THEN WHY THE FUCK DID IT JAM. WHY DID I HAVE TO SCREAM. IM IN NOW LOCKED UP IN MY ROOM WITH NO HELP. I HAVE BEEN BARRED FROM GOING ANYWHERE. 

I don't deserve to live. The world'll be much happier place without me. The universe always conspires against me. And it did here too.
