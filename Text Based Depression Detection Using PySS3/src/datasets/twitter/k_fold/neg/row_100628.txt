so emptyi don't know what to do anymore, i'm 23 and i've been living with this void of emptiness and hole in my heart for 6 or 7 years now, i've avoided life as much as i can and get stuck in negative thought patterns every day until i get exhausted. i'm looking to end my life but i just cant find the courage to actually hang myself or jump off a bridge so i'm stuck suffering through this meaningless life
