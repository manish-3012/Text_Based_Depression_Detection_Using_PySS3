I want to sleep forever
I don't wanna die but I don't wanna live either. I just want to sleep and never wake up. I haven't been able to remember my dreams for a long time but I know I'm happier in them. I feel better while sleeping. Without pain. Maybe not happy but even just getting rid of this feeling is enough for me. I want to just go to sleep one night and sleep forever
