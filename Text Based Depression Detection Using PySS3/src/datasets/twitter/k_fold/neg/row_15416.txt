I attempted suicide 6 months ago.This is a message to all of those who are considering suicide. 6 months ago I was extremely depressed, I had no motivation to do work or be around those who love me. After months and months of sadness and lack of hope, I told my friends that I was going to commit suicide and I headed for my car because I was about to drive into a lake. My friend tackled me and force me to calm down and from there I did my best to pull myself out of the Abyss. Here I am after working through my issues and I am healthy motivated and happy in everyday life. I truly have felt better than I have in years. What I'm trying to say is I have been through what a lot of you are going through now. I know that you're thinking that this is your life now, and things won't get better. But I swear that they will, so please please please don't give up, and keep fighting. Please seek help, and know that you will be okay.
