Existence is a burden.I binged so much, worsening my self-hatred. I would cut myself more, but I canâ€™t find my razor. I have to go to school tomorrow, but I think Iâ€™d rather fade from existence than to face a single human being tmw. At this point , Iâ€™m only here for my dog, and my parents.

Sometimes I fantasize about what life would be like if I died, and how others would react, and how fast it would take them to forget about me and move on. I think the only person who would really be affected is my mom. And my dad. It also hurts to think that my dog will sit at the door waiting for me and Iâ€™ll never show up again.

Or if I attempted suicide and it doesnâ€™t work and I end up in the hospital. Who would even give a shit. At least Iâ€™m not dead, right ? I donâ€™t know.

Iâ€™m at a really low point in my life. Iâ€™m so emotional and Iâ€™ve been cutting more than I used to. My binges make it worse. I could be doing great and actually making progress , and then a single binge will fuck it all up.

I hate having to keep up with life. I just want to roll up in a blanket in my dark room and spend all of eternity there.
