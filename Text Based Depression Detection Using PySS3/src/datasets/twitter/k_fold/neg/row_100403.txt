I donâ€™t feel sad when contemplating taking my lifeWhen I was young I was raped and tortured sexually many times. I have constant flashbacks to these moments and each time they cause me terrible agony as if Iâ€™m reliving it again. I see the man who did this to me in other people faces and Iâ€™m paranoid that he might come back and hurt me again. He brainwashed me and my mind is forever scarred. Iâ€™m sick of people telling me it gets better because my life has been a nightmare for as long as I can remember and my mind is showing no signs of healing. Death is my only way to be free.
