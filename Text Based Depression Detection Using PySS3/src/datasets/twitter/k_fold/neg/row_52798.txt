I feel like there's no hope left for meIm so fucking lonely in my life despite having my family here. I've never been able to make or even keep friends all my life. I have so many trust issues along with overreacting to things. I've had relationships before but they only lasted 1-3 months maybe. My recent relationship ended because I cheated and I hate myself so much for becoming a monster. HE WAS SUCH A GREAT GUY . IDK WHY I WASNT HAPPY STILL. Id go psycho on my ex when I overreacted calling him and calling him. After I cheated, he still wanted to stay but became colder and colder. Recently, he'd send me teasing videos and stuff just to fuck with me. I hate what I've become. If I could go back I'd change everything.
I don't have any goals at all. No likes. No wants. Idk wtf im even supposed to be doing at 25. No degree. Dead end job. No life outside of work. Im going crazy cause I just don't have any motivation or energy to do anything anymore. All my siblings are all doing so much better than me it hurts. They even hang out together without me. Im so tired of all this shit. I really fucking hate myself so much I sabotage all the good things just to stay sad. I don't like being happy because I don't deserve it. I got nobody in my life anymore. No one to talk to. Despite all the therapists I've seen I haven't even budged an inch as to why im like this. I feel like there's nothing to look forward to anymore it's all the same
