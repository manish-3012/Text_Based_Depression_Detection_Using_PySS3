Just kinda need to talkIt might just end up being word salad. I've accepted that suicide is my ultimate end and at this point It's just a matter of how long I can put it off. Aiming for a pretty long life but I feel like I'm rapidly falling short. Everyone has a sad story and I'm no different. Anyone in my shoes would feel this way. I'm alone and no one needs me anymore. I don't have much worth remembering these days. I'm just kind of existing because I know I'm supposed to. But this is getting old fast. The pointlessness gets to me.
