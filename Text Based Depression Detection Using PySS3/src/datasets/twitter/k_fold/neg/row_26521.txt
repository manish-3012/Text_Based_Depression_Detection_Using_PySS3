I really just want to die.Hello everybody. I just turned 18 last month and have been wanting to kill myself for quite some time. I think the only thing holding me back is not wanting to hurt my mother, but the urges have become unbearable recently.

I guess my life just isn't really heading in the direction I'd like it to - last year I had to switch to an "alternative" high school because of my lack of attendance and I'm really regretting it now. All of my old friends are out partying and getting laid, and I've never once even been to a party.. I'm not about to complain about them moving on, I know it is my fault, but I just feel like I'm missing out so much on life by staying cooped up in my bedroom while everybody else is out enjoying their high school years. I have pretty bad social anxiety, so making new friends at my new school is pretty much out of the question.

So I'm not really sure what to do.. I could wait it out and get through this year to see if things get better when I graduate. But every time I think about suicide I get such a euphoric feeling of relief - I won't have to worry about talking to girls and making friends if I no longer exist, right?
