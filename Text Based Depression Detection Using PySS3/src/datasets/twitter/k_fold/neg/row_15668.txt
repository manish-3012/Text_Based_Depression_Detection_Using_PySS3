Final attempt looking for advice[Linking my original post asking for advice.](https://redd.it/7m1k60) 

I first tried /r/mentalhealth but only got a troll comment.

Tried /r/needadvice and I got banned for using a throwaway account to try to remain anonymous. 

It's really disheartening that the only reactions I get for asking for help on how to stop wanting to die are a troll comment and nearly immediate ban. If this posting doesn't work I guess I'll just give up again.
