My Friend Just Dropped This On Me. Need Help.[Skype Screenshot](http://imgur.com/I10OygR)

I have little clue what to do. He is a friend of mine I only know on the internet so I can't meet him (he is also across the world) but I don't want him to do anything awful. I know he had an unfortunate childhood and his parents are no help. He has a very pessimistic attitude about his life and only finds some happiness in technology, which is how I know him since we were making a videogame together, but it seems it's not enough. Help.
