Today was the last straw for me. I want to run away into the mountains and starve and dehydrate myselfMy mom stormed up into my room screaming at me for procrastinating and not doing my homework. She ordered that I go downstairs to do it, but I refused since I wanted to be independent and not have to have someone look after me (although I never told her this). My brother comes storming in, shoves me down the stairs and tells me to listen while screaming at the top of his lungs. My cycle of procrastination had repeated day after day and today I had to pay the price. This is the last straw for me. I want to die. I've wanted to die for years, and the feeling kept emerging over and over. But this time, it stuck. My decision is sealed, and I want to die. I want to run away to the nearby mountains and dehydrate myself so I can die peacefully knowing that I have no school or parents to worry about, and this suicidal attempt will sadly earn me a one way ticket to the fiery pits of hell. God doesn't like people who commit suicide, so I imagine I won't be any different. I can't shoot myself with a gun because I don't have one, and getting one is unlikely at the mere age of 14, but if I can run off and dehydrate myself and go unnoticed, I just might have a chance.

I will be just another statistic among the hundreds of thousands who have killed themselves, but at least I can escape this painful ordeal people call life. I wasn't meant for this world. I wasn't built for it, nor did I ask to be in it. My parents just had to have 3 children, and I could imagine I would be in so much more peace if they had decided to stop at 2.
