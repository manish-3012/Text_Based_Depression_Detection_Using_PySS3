I want to jump
I donâ€™t know what to do right now. I want to feel loved I donâ€™t want to feel the way Iâ€™m feeling I donâ€™t want to be in any more pain I didnâ€™t think I was asking too much from my boyfriend and then it became an argument and then I went into an episode and he said I was being abusive but I was just hitting myself and crying and screaming because I just hate myself so much and I can never do right I have a balcony at my house I was thinking about maybe going downtown but I see the balcony and part of me just wants to see what it would feel like if I jumped I donâ€™t know if I would die or live or get hurt or be fine. But Iâ€™m not OK. I donâ€™t want to feel like this. Iâ€™m alone. Everyone would be happier. I want to jump I want to disappear and stop disappointing everyone
