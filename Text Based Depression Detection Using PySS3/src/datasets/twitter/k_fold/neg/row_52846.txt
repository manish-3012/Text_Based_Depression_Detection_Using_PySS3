22 year old unemployed broke college dropout nearly homeless. Seriously, why bother?In 22+ years of my meaningless life, I have never had a non-shitty job, never had a girlfriend and only a handful of friends whom I have lost contact with.

Barely got through high school but went to college on advice of my parents to study some stupid stuff before inevitably dropping out. Ever before covid, my finances were tight and as it stands, I am two months overdue on rent with no way of paying it.

My parents are so toxic and overbearing that I would prefer staying in streets to living with them but honestly, everything seems so futile by this point.

What's the point of all this? Why bother living at all? Everyone has to go one day, why not now? The only reason why I haven't killed myself is because I am a coward and can't figure out a painless way to go.
