I don't know where to startI'm 42. All of my life I've been insecure about my friendships, thinking no one really likes me, wants to hang out, I was that girl people made over in middle school. 
I'm not much to look at. I have been in the same job for 10 years. It's been bad for the past 3 or 4 because the supervisor I have really mucromamages and will quibble over things not done exactly her way. We got into an argument earlier about spending $20 on nothing and we're working for a large university. I think we'll be ok. 
I decided to take today off. I feel so unappreciated there and know how my weekends will play out and want to move back home to be closer to family, even though I've been saying that for the past 5 years and am pretty sure my problems and bad feelings will follow me there. 
I really just don't want to keep on feeling so stuck and sad. I'm trying to get a therapist. My meds will be adjusted next week, but I don't want another 40 years of being too broke to do fun things, not having a partner, not being close to my family, being in a lot of debt, and just reliving all the stupid things I've done and the bad things that have happened to me. 
Right now my pet is sleeping on me. I've thought that she's young and someone else could adopt her a number of times. She'll end up being ok. I'm really stupidly trying tonhold on for her. I'm going to be a fucking cat lady.
I want to be able to enjoy things again but I've been in this funk for at least the past 2 months and it sucks. I just want that to go away. 
I'm too scared to do anything deliberate to myself but I hope for accidents. I'm scared that I felt relief when I realized I had stepped into the street with a fire truck approaching and thought that would be a good way to go and I probably wouldn't feel anything.
