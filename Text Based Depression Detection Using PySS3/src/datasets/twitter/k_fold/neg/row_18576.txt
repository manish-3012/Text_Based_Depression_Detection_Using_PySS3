Iâ€™m really tired of living with chronic pain, and I have more than enough to take care of it for good, but I fear my irrational familyâ€™s grieving process would include going after doctors who have not wronged meI donâ€™t want to be here anymore. When I was younger it was futile bs. Emotional misunderstanding within myself. Childish, really. 



Now and for the last 3 months or so, I just donâ€™t think I want to live my life with incurable, life-long flaring, very painful disease. Iâ€™m a monster in this much pain. All of the time. 



But I feel like theyâ€™d start going after my internists, rheumatologists (one of whom sucked but still), neurology consults and my psychiatristâ€” none of whom deserve to be bothered by the aggressive familial efforts of a dead woman who wouldâ€™ve never gotten better anyway.
