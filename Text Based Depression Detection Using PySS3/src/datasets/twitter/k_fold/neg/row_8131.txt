Goodbye everyone. I lost.I lost everything.

I lost the love of my life. He doesn't love me anymore. It's ok, it's already a miracle that someone could fall for me.

I lost my best friend. We're distant and after a year or so we aren't close anymore. We don't click anymore. I lost her.

My family -- I am not sure. I'm sad I'll let them down by committing suicide. They were expecting me not to. I'm sorry I'll disappoint everyone.

Uni... Not for me. I don't like anything of what I do.

I spent the past week in my room wishing I could die.

I promised I'd change, I promised I'd get better - for what, though? I've been left by everyone. I have no reason to stay strong whatsoever.

Some will say... You gotta do it for yourself. Stay strong for yourself, get better for yourself etc. I've never understood these statements. There's nothing left for myself. No love for me. No one around me. Completely alone.

Not sure yet how I'll do it but it's gonna be today. Well, tonight. Don't wanna overdose because I know it won't work. I'll probably slit my wrists and see how it goes. If anything, at least I will punish myself one last time for ruining everything I touch. If it doesn't work, I'll go for the train station. Or I'll jump off a building. Who cares. So many options. Life is fragile. I am fragile.

If life was a game, I'd say I lost at it.

Game over.

Thank you everyone for listening to me. Thank you for your advice. Thank you for being here when no one else was. You can't fix what's broken forever.

AdiÃ³s.
