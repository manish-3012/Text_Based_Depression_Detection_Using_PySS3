Today is the dayI just wanted to say good bye. Thanks for trying to help me. It's finally going to be over and for the first time, I feel at peace with it. I just want the pain to end. I didn't want to ruin lives, but I can't keep using that as an excuse. So this good bye. If my family somehow reads this one day, I'm so so sorry, I love you all so much. One day when your grown up, I hope maybe you'll understand. I love and I'm so sorry. You all were my everything. I'm sorry I wasn't a better mother. I'm sorry I couldn't get myself together or even hold a job because of my mental illness. I'm just so sorry ðŸ’”ðŸ˜­
