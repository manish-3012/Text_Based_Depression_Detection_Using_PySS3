[UPDATE] Iâ€™ve decided to finally end it all.https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/gn3rm9/19m_ex_posting_half_nudes_of_me_on_a_group_chat/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf

I wrote a whole note on my iphone and iâ€™ve shared it with someone close to me. Told them if i die then i want them to post it. I mentioned why iâ€™m doing it and the personâ€™s details.

Iâ€™m posting here, perhaps because i want people to see it after iâ€™m dead. 

Itâ€™s odd because I know iâ€™m going to do it but I feel pretty calm. My head feels clear, everything too.
