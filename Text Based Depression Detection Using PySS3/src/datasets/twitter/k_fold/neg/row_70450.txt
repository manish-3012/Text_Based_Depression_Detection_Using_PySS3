I just want to feel something realI can post here all I want but Iâ€™m taking my 15 at work just to cry and try to reset so Iâ€™m not gonna type a lot. All I want is to feel something real. And I feel selfish because everything is real and people care for me. My boss cares, my friends care, my family cares, itâ€™s just that I donâ€™t feel it. I donâ€™t get why I canâ€™t feel the care. I just wish somehow I could appreciate how people care. I want to get some sleep. I havenâ€™t slept well in so long. Everything feels like a waste. I just want to feel confident again. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m going back to work
