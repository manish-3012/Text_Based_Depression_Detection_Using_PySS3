Thought I had my Dream JobI finally left the torture of serving of 3 years to finally a job I can finally use my degree inâ€”-only to find out during orientation that my position does not have a garauntee schedule. I am now terrified and my parents do not financially support me whatsoever. I am broke and have nothing. I just want to end it all because I cannot take it anymore. I am not worth shit.
