TiredI always feel like Iâ€™m not enough for anyone. Like my girlfriend, family, friends. Iâ€™m never enough and Iâ€™m not even what I want to be and I never will be. Why am I still here? My girlfriend told me if I kill myself whenever I told her once that I was starting to have suicidal thoughts that it would hurt her and I would be taking the easy way out. But Iâ€™m so tired of everyone being mad at me all the time and always doing the wrong things. If I died I would just be nothing anymore and I couldnt ruin things anymore.
