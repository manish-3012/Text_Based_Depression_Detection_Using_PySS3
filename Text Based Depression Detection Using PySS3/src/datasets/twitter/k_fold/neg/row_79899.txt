Nobody listens to me.I'm sure you guys will.
Whenever I tell my friends or family that I'm feeling sad or suicidal, they just say, "Be happy!" I try to pretend that I'm happy because it's not that easy to just /feel/ happy.
Sometimes they tell me to stop because I'm making them mad. And that makes /me/ mad, because it's sorta selfish. 
None of my friends are mean to me, they just don't listen or believe me.
Have any of you ever gone through this?
