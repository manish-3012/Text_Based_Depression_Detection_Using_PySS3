Just need to get it all outIâ€™m in so much pain but nobody can know. Itâ€™s due to my own stupid mistakes so I Know I deserve it. In the last 2 and a half years Iâ€™ve lost so much. My partner and I have grown apart and half the time I wish we had never gotten married. Iâ€™ve lost my only child. Been diagnosed with a major mental disorder. The subsequent meds have taken a toll on my body and therefore my self esteem. I ended up having an affair with a coworker and because of it had to leave my dream job. I know I know, Iâ€™m a horrible person. I was hoping to leave my current situation and be with my coworker. They told me they loved me, everyday, for 2 years. But when everything came to a head, they didnâ€™t choose me. They never meant what they said. They only said it so they could use me for their own pleasure. For 2-3 years. I know Iâ€™m better off away from them, but I truly loved them and Iâ€™m heartbroken. How could I not see that I was worth so little?! I shouldâ€™ve known they saw me as worthless, just a piece of trash to be used and discarded. Everyone has always seen me as worthless. It hurts so much. 

In the last 2 years Iâ€™ve made 4 attempts. Wrist-slitting, overdosing, and hanging. Iâ€™m trying to stay strong but I think about trying again everyday. Maybe my child died because I didnâ€™t deserve to be a mother. Maybe the coworker played me for 2 years because Iâ€™m just a stupid worthless whore anyway. 

I canâ€™t tell anyone in real life these things. This is my only space to do so. Thanks for reading.
