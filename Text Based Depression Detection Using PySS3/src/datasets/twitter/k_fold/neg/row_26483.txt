I might not turn 26 this yearTo be frank, Iâ€™ve lived a rough life...Mom became paranoid schizophrenic and Dad had no other option but to divorce her while my grandma enabled her behavior. I was diagnosed with OCD as a result and autism before all that. 

Iâ€™ve been having suicidal thoughts for quite awhile the more I suffer and the more I live... I just donâ€™t even know if this life isnâ€™t even worth it anymore. I had some really high expectations for myself and failed them all spectacularly. 

Canâ€™t join the military, havenâ€™t had a gf since middle school, several jobs screwed me out if a payraise and Iâ€™ve been working as a janitor for almost a year. Hobby wise? Writing, gaming, and reading. 

Iâ€™ve started a bunch of books that might not get published until after I die... either this year or further in the future. 

So far: my grandpa died in March and my landlord died of COVID in September. I have no meds left and I have a crap ton of bills. Bills I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to completely pay this month. 

Combine all that with the stress of the job and you get one of the worse cocktails in existence. For crying out loud: Iâ€™m mentally and emotionally dying here every single day! When the time finally comes, I never want to be back here on this planet ever again. In spirit or in renewed/reincarnated body if possible.
