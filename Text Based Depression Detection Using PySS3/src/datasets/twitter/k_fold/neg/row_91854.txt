I'm fake. I don't matter. No one knows who I am.I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I wake up feeling empty, go to my job where I fake not being empty all day, and come home to a house where I sit in my room all day to avoid having to act like I care. I hang out with my family and I smile and make polite conversation but I feel nothing, just that I'm a fraud. I'm living a fake life to make people happy, to make my family happy. I don't really have any friends here. I was away at university and now everyone's moved on, and I'm a different person, and the friends I had in university are all doing their own thing in different cities. I want to do things. I want to feel happy and alive and free like I did back when I was in school, but I have no idea how to get there. I hate everything about who I'm pretending to be, I hate myself for not having any fucking courage to do anything to fix this, and I really just want to not have to live another damn day this way. Of course, if I try living the way I want to live, I'll have to deal with everyone hating on me, making my problems worse, and using everything they can to manipulate me - fear, love, anger, hell, I don't doubt that they'd take a post like this and spin it into something akin to 'she's crazy, and can't take care of herself' so that they can even keep me here forever. This isn't urgent, I'm not going to die tonight. All I'm saying is that if I don't do something soon, I'm going to do something stupid, and there's no telling when I'm going to implode or run or start to engage the self harming behaviors. If there's anyone out there, who doesn't think this is stupid, or something like that, I'd love advice. I don't know what I need to do to get through to myself enough to motivate myself to move forward. Being stuck like this will kill me eventually, and I'd rather not die yet. I know I have to face this down sooner rather than later. Anyways, thanks for reading this. Sorry if it sounds nonsensical in parts.
