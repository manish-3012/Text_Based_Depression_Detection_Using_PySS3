i have no will to live leftI am terrified. I've been having a rough past months but lately my mental health is close to unexistant.

I wanna kill myself so badly and i wish i had the guts, in the end, no one would find me possibly in weeks. I live alone and i pretty much have 0 contact with irl people other than my building's janitor and the girl that has the market next door.

I wanna slice my arms and neck open. I've been hitting myself hard enought that i have little bruises in ny face. 

i'm desperate. i dont know what to do anymore. I dont wanna die but that part of me is desperate to hurt me enough that it'll kill me.

I feel so alone.
