Please help me find carbon monoxideI have constant fear of abandonment due to experiences Iâ€™ve had in the past. I only have one friend now. She was extremely depressed and she has someone who loves her, who take care of her. I never really see her anymore but Iâ€™m happy she found someone she calls the one. I asked someone out for lunch after they asked me for favors and they didnâ€™t even respond. Someone I recently met was so into me and she pretty such switched up after 3 days. People respond so badly to me I lose the interest to even try. As for male friends all of them either want sex or a relationship from me. I donâ€™t want them. Every relationship Iâ€™ve had has been the same itâ€™s like I canâ€™t escape the same patterns. 

Iâ€™ve have plans of buying carbon monoxide but didnâ€™t think it would be this difficult. Can anyone help me find a place I could get some? I live in Atlanta GA.
