I have never felt so alone in my lifeI feel like a complete outsider. Every social situation is awkward or worse, and I don't know why. I have no close friends, no one to turn to. I have no idea how I found someone to date me and move in with me, but I feel like they don't even like me. On top of that, they've been close to leaving me multiple times this year because of how much of a fucking mess I am. Even interactions with them have become increasingly difficult for me. I feel so fucking awkward all the time and I just wish everything would end. 

I don't know how anyone progresses in life or gets a higher paying job they actually like. I have no fucking skills, and I can't stand to work my job anymore. Every day I embarrass the fuck out of myself and everyone there thinks I'm stupid and useless. I don't think they're wrong, but I'm just trying to make enough money so that I can pay my rent. I know this going to sound like some dark knight joker shit, but every day I feel more and more alienated from the rest of society.

I can't stand being sober anymore so I just drink and smoke every night until I'm a stumbling mess. My life has no direction, and I feel like it is time to end it. I probably won't because I'm a fucking pussy but I wish someone would do it for me. I wish I would just die already so I wouldn't have to wake up every morning knowing I'm just going to go out into the world and feel the same way I do every other day.
