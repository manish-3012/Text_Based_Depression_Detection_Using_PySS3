I just lost the girl I've loved for a few years now, and I can't handle this.This is worse than any pain I've ever felt. It took me so long to get her, and there she goes. Gone. I don't know what to do anymore. She was my everything, my other half. I can't take this. I can't fucking do this.

I don't know what to do. I just want to sleep.
