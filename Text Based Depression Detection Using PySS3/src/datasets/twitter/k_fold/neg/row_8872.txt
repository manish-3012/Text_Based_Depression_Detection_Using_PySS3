I have psychosis and SAD and I can't stand winter anymore. I had a heartbreak today. I don't have any hope to live.I have taken a medicine course related to my psychosis and I don't hallucinate like that before but last two winters were unbearable. Even yesterday, my gf broke up because I caught her cheating and this is the third time I've been in love ans my partner cheated on me. Winter makes me sad and the thought of killing myself always comes to my mind. Even today I was thinking about all emptyness and betrayal. My GFs never had to face any of my mental problems nor have I ever abused them or been rude to them. I gave my best yet I'm not that charming or the alpha male type. Had Xanax a while ago but If I have to depend on medicine I guess I don't know what to do anymore. I'm a 5 ft 10 guy and a bit obese but girls don't like me. I don't have enough friends too. My absence won't hurt anyone except my parents.
