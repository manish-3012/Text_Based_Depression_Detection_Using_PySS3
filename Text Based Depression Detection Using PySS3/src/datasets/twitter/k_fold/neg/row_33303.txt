I have lost reason for livingI feel like my life is a big joke,  and that no one will actually love me, my grades are failing. I just don't wanna go on living. I am scared  [UPDATE] 
I wen to the hospital, and I have an appointment with a psychologist in april, so I am gonna get perscribed somthing 
(not just because he is a psychologist, but because my therapist told my parents to take me to one that will give me a perscription) so, yeah. But I am feeling a lot better
