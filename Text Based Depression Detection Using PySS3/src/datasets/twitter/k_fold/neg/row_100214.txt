I am completely at breaking point and feel like I have no one to talk to.I don't even know where to begin, I've just lost the will to live.

I'm 22, unemployed and living off of unemployment benefit which gives me â‚¬100 a week. I'm a college graduate and can't seem to find a job anywhere and it's really taking its toll on me.

My boyfriend and all my friends have also finished college and have gone on to start their careers. My boyfriend is going to Germany next week for 6 weeks with his job, I was originally asked to go and thought it would help me clear my head but now he has said he doesn't want me to go. I'm not exactly comfortable with him going on his own and flying home every week with everything thats happening over their at the moment. But he doesn't care. My opinion never seems to matter and it feels like we're living separate lives, everything revolves around what he wants to do.

My mother thinks I'm a complete waste of space as all I do is leech off her as I can't get a job. I live in a shitty little city in Ireland where jobs are just non existent unless you want to work in a call-centre which I can't even get an interview for. It seems my only way of having a life is to move out of the country which I don't have the funds to do and my family put me down about it all the time which means zero help from them.

I really don't know what to do anymore. The mental health services in Ireland are a piece of shit and unless I have the money to fork out for a councillor I get put on a waiting list or antidepressants. I've spent the last 2 nights drinking and tried to drown myself in the bath last night and broke down crying when I couldn't. I don't know what to do anymore, I don't have guts to kill myself but I have no hope left for the future. I guess I'm just typing it all here so I can get it all out as it feels like I've got no one else to talk to.
