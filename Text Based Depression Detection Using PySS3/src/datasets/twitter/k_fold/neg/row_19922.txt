Pretending to be happy isnt funI would usually fake my happiness and hide my feelings around others. I always wanted friends who im comfortable with to go out or talk to throughout the day. I'm in 12th grade now and for every year of highschool, I feel more and more lonely. Im shy and not as smart as everyone else, but Im try to be nice to everyone. I tried many times and ways to make close friends but it never works out how I want, the only thing I want is a close friend I can talk to without making it seem like im bothering or an annoyance. But it looks like Im an annoyance towards everyone. I go through school looking at people having a nice day with their friends, come home to be yelled at by parents, and cry at night thinking about how lonely I am. Ive thought about suicide for everyday, but I read I really shouldn't and I should continue living.. I will but Im in a lot of pain :( i wish someone knew how much im suffering, i feel pain everytime I cry now
