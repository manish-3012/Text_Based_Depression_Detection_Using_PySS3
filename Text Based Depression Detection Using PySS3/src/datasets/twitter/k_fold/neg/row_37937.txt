Hi my name is Matt [17M] and I want to dieAll of my friends up and ditched me for a person I got a restraing order against. The reason I got it against him is because he sexually assulted me, I tried to tell them but they wouldn't listen, and recently tonight I had one of those old "friends" message me and say that I'm "a poor excuse for a man" and I'm "manipulative" "attention" and "seeking". And that I'd be "better off out of everyone's life." He threatened to beat me up on multiple occasions because I got back together with my ex. Who was also his ex aswell. And she left him in the first place for being to possessive. And he told me he wanted to "beat my a**"  just because I gave my ex a ride home from school. And he belives tgat now that he has her back as a girlfriend he can say this to me....you're probably thinking at this point that I'm just rambling about someone but bare with me...I was actually beginning to feel happy again prior to this night and all my suicidal thoughts from earlier in the year and years pass have finally subsided. But tonight they all came flooding back as if a dame of emotions broke. On the surface I seem as if I have my act together 1.) I own a small business. 2.) I have a stable job. 3.)I have a car. 4.) I was voted homecoming king. 5.) I'm well respected throughout the school.
But with all of that comes living with a bipolar mother, sister who is never around, not having any true friends, the memory of being assaulted, the message I was talking about earlier, the lack of sleep, the lack of having no antidepressants or ever having them, the thought in my head that I'm not special if I talk to a therapist (I've done that before with minimal to no results)....I've feel like I'm alone I have nothing and no one to lean on, my mother and teachers keep saying "throw yourself into your school work" but that doesn't help and its  became a repetitive saying that means nothing to me....I feel like my only option is to die
