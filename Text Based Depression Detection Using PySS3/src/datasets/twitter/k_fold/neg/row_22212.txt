i am scaredi am scared to ask for help. i dont want to bother my friends by this, i think they wouldnt like me if i did. i dont want them to think i am crazy. they surely have a lot of problems on their own.

i am scared people hate me, that they are making fun of me, that they are watching me.

i am scared i will never be able to be good enough

i am scared of going outside, i am disgusting and fat and ugly and i dont want people to look at me. i am scared i will do something wrong and everyone will laugh at me

i am scared to speak, i hate my accent, i hate my voice

but most of all
i am scared to sleep
i dont want to face the nightmares again, i do not want to cry again, i am so scared and i domt know what to do

i am sorry
maybe this is not the right sub
but im scared and i do not know what to do
i just want it all to be okay again

at least one day to be okay
