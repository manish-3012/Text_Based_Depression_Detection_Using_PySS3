Time to see if I wil go through with it.So here it goes.

Everything is going to shit. My parents and I have had a major argument for the first time in 3 months. My grades are falling flat and there's nothing I can do haha. I've alienated the people who I called friends for the last 2 years or so. My sister hates me. I have nothing to lose.

So, after class tomorrow, I'm gonna throw myself off a bridge. Even if the fall doesn't kill me, I'm going to drown.

At this point, in my opinion, its probably the most bloodless method of suicide other than a suicide bag, and I dont want to cause more pain than I already have.

The world has given me so much time, and yet I've done squat with it. Yeah, I may be 15, but I'm tired of trying and trying and trying and failing over and over again.

Hopefully this time, I won't fail.
