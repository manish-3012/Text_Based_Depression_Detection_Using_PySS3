I was overdosed on sedative as a child So it happened when i was like 2 years old, my father fell asleep right next to me and i somehow found the pills. I took i don't know how many of them( they don't really talk about the incident) And when my mother came home is was lying on the ground. They did mostly nothing, as i know. Could this be the source of my never ending depression and that i can't form any types of relationships with peoples.
