im not sure theres much reason left for me to continue livingI wish i has some wise sage words in my head that make me want to stay alive, but alas i do not

I've been thinking about this alot recently, i'm been on estrogen 9 months, strongly thinking about how SRS and some of the other things i want are seriously out of reach because of cost, and inability to afford the time off from work for it, I've cried over it alot recently, being transgender is not a walk in the park, especially being MtF

the only reason i'm still breathing right now are the hormones and the fact i don't want my passing to hurt any of the people i deeply care about...i don't like being toxic but i feel as though becoming toxic, removing myself from their lives, distancing myself from my sister, distancing myself from society. I love my friends, and the person who has let me into their life romantically...but i continue to struggle to see a reason to continue to live, to wake up in the morning, go to to my dead-end job, eat, make time for friends.

To be brutally honest, the hormones are probably whats keeping me going at this point as i do finally feel like i belong in this body now, that i deserve to have friends, a loving partner.  They give me a reason to keep getting out of bed, going to work, living.

Sadly i don't think they will continue to work that way for much longer, nothing ever does.  I've felt this way since I was 10, when my mom died, the voice saying do it keeps getting louder and i think the time for me is about up, the voices telling me i don't deserve to live are going to consume me before 40. I have a strong sneaking suspision when my cat dies, i will be going soon afterwards, he has been my rock through multiple relationships, and he's been here for the begining of my transition, but he's 10, he's probably got another 5 or so years left

My plan now is to save enough money to go back to Milwaukee, back to the place i was born, buy a plot of land in the cemetery near where my parents are buried, and then jump into Lake Michigan, with a note explaining everything in case my body ever surfaces 

I'd hate to hurt my sister, my person, my friends, but they are stronger, they will survive me passing, my ex-wife saved me at 30, gave me the strength to accept who and what i was, there isn't anyone left who can save me now, i can't see a future with me in it, either as a man, or as a woman and it hurts so much
