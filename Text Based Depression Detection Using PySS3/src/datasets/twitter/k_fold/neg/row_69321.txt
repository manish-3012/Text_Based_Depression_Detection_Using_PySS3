Hello FamilyIâ€™ve been reading and following along with this group for over a year now - I have serious issues with suicidal ideation and have never told anyone. Iâ€™ve got a great life and wonderful family- a successful career, too. Iâ€™m a cancer survivor - 4 years NED now. I think about killing myself daily - I probably wonâ€™t but I am plagued with these thoughts ever since I got cancer. Something in me just went wrong in my brain I guess. Iâ€™m a psychologist and I cannot help myself, apparently Iâ€™m not that good, huh? Anyway- Hi, I am here with you, I love you all, maybe it gets better...
