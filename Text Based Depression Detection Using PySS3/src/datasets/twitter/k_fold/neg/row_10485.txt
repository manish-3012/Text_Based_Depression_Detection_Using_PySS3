I canâ€™t handle this anymoreI fuck everything up, I canâ€™t make friends... I made some, and I really love them, but they donâ€™t like me anymore. One of them just said â€œGo and make real life friends, and learn the meaning of human relationshipâ€ â€œStop bothering us, youâ€™re really wasting your time. Why are you so obsessed with us?â€ It hurts, I know itâ€™s my fault, but... it hurts..... I want to kill myself, not just over this, but because... this is not the first time that this has happened. Except, this is the first time that someone finally said these words to me... I want to die. Please help me, what should I do? I hate myself, can I be happy even if Iâ€™m alone? How do I stop caring too much? How do I stop feeling emotions?
