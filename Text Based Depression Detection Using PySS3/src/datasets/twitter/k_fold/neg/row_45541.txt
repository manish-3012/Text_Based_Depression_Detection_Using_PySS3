I dont know anymoreIm clearly an ungrateful shit, my parents are good people, yes they fuck up sometimes but who doesn't? Its obvously hard to live with a sad moody teenager, and yeah Im just a kid, so i guess its not that serious to most people but, i just self harm when i overthink or when im just to lost in my head, i used to cut but i just didnt want blood evidence so i turned to hitting myself and scratching (i have dogs so it would make sense to have scratches). I just dont feel in place anymore and im unsure of my status in other poeples lives and 2018 was a hard year and i dont want tobe in 2019 at all, i dont know why im making this, ill probably be dead before anyone even considers answering to the edgy teenage dumbass, 

Thanks for atleast reading this, sorry if i drop a suicide bomb on my first post.

I hope i didnt violate any rules? Sorry

And sorry if my grammar just hit you in the face im typing as fast as i can.

Thank you :)
