I just dont know, wish i could afgord helpI have depression for a good 5-7 years. Mosley because of my parents. Iets been a hell for me.
I had to stop school, my parents say my lack of motivation made me fail, but in was there pushiness i had to go to them every night to tell them what i die and what i have done. But last weeks since i'm out of school they are forcing me to get Ã  second job, that is in my next possible major that is cooking. So they force me to do Ã  full time job als Cook just to say: "we knel you couldnt do in listen to is The next time".
