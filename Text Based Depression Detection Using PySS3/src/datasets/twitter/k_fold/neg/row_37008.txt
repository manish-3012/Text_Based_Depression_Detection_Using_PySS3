My one year planI've been depressed my whole life for many different reasons and I didn't even know it since I didn't know about the existence of depression and my family always brushed it off as me being lazy and slow.

My next year in university, I plan to get the higher grades than anyone and once the year's over overdose and leave a note saying "Am I still lazy?"
