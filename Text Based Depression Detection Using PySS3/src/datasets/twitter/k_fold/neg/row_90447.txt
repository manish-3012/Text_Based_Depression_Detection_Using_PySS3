Procrastinating.I feel like I am procrastinating CTB even though i know it's in my best interest to do so. I know things aren't going to get better for me and it will be nearly impossible for me to survive another 20+ years to see my parents through their final years. My life now is miserable and the older I get (34) the more lonely and pointless each passing year becomes. Because my family is still alive I think I am scared to CTB because if I fail to die, with my method, I could wind up a vegetable and that would be worse for my family than if I was dead. I dunno, I feel terrible, this isn't what I want to do to my family but I'm so trapped in my life even considering the alternative to live, just winds up leading back to killing myself being the best option. If I had a pill in my hand that would kill me instantly without pain, would I swallow it today, or would I just keep putting it off? I want things to end, but I don't want the people I care about to suffer. Feeling so trapped.
