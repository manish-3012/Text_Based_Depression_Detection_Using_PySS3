Am I okay?I'm suicidal, but I'm doing just fine.

I always think that the world will be just fine without me. Not saying that it'll be better. I just think that I don't really matter.

I'm doing fine. Yes. I'm in my mid twenties. Doing fine with my life. Doing fine with my study. Doing fine with my family. Doing really fine and I'm grateful with my life. Yet, I still have the urge to disappear from this world. My question is, is it normal? Am I really doing fine? Why do I have these suicidal thoughts when I can't even find any reason to end this OK life?
