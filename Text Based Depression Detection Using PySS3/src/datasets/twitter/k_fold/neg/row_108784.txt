I could kill myself right now without ever having my â€œfirstsâ€ in life....Iâ€™ve never had a relationship. I havenâ€™t had my first kiss. I donâ€™t have a car, a job, or my own house. Iâ€™m still a teenager. With every day that I live, I care less and less about those things. Iâ€™m still in high school. I should care about them. But I donâ€™t, because all I can think about is trying not to die. It sucks. I want to enjoy my youth. I want to have my childhood. I want to know what having my first relationship would be like, what college I would pick after I graduate high school, and what car Iâ€™d buy for when I finally get my driverâ€™s license.

Instead Iâ€™m stuck trying not to cry everyday in class. Iâ€™m a would-be-A-grade-student who barely gets past a 1.5 GPA for the semester. Iâ€™m trying to convince myself everyday not to overdose, and I wake up wondering if today is the day that I finally post my suicide note online and text my friends and teachers goodbye. Iâ€™m so tired of living, but I donâ€™t want to die. I just want everything to stop. I feel lonely, but I donâ€™t want to try and text or call anyone I know because I feel like Iâ€™ll just bother them and Iâ€™ll only add more to worry about on their plate. I keep buying things online so then I can convince myself to wait until they arrive, and I can fill that emptiness with materialism for a short span of time before the sadness sets back in. I canâ€™t talk to my parents because they donâ€™t understand how to deal with a depressed child, and I donâ€™t think my teachers would really want to deal with me during the break even though they gave me their numbers in case I needed to talk. My friends arenâ€™t serious enough to comfort me, and they wouldnâ€™t know how to approach me if I told them I was about to kill myself. Iâ€™m trying so hard to keep convincing myself to live, but I keep burning out and Iâ€™ve been on the end of my rope for weeks. Iâ€™ll be surprised if I manage to live to my 16th birthday, because I was already surprised when I lived to my 15th.
