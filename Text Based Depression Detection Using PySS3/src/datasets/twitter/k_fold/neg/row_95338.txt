The pain is unbearableHow would you feel if your wife tells you that you aren't her husband, how would you feel if she points at someone else and says that person is her husband. What if you have taken every risk to save and help her, taken loans after loans just support her. That amount of loan which will take more than a year to repay. When you have fought against everyone for her when everyone told you that she would leave you, but you fought for that person, you stood by. And at the end that very person punch, slap you again and again. How would you feel? What would you do? Is it that easy to forget?
