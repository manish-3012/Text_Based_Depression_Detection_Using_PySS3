I feel I will either be so succesful in life or end up killing myselfIt's 5 am in the morning and I've been thinking about my childhood traumas for 5 hours now. My childhood was totally ruined that I can see myself, after becoming successful, on a tv show talking about how miserable it was back then and how it made me who I am now. Or i could also see it written in suicide notes explaining how I got there.
