I want to die but I am too scared to kill myself.Title says it all. I want to end my life as soon as possible. But I just can't. I'm bombarded with suicidal thoughts constantly and would act on them if I wasn't so scared and worried.

I've tried every trick in the book. Finding meaning and purpose in a subject/activity, therapy, medication, drugs, alcohol, women, gambling... really anything. While I do derive some sort of happiness from some things, it's not enough. Even if I had everything I wanted in life, I still would feel the same way. A person can only take so much, you know? My mind is fractured from reality, I'm delusional, obsessive, I am paranoid and it sucks all the energy I have out of me. I know, for a fact, that me killing myself or dying as a result of self destructive behavior isn't a matter of if, it's a matter of when. I just don't know what to do or when I'll finally lose that little shred that's keeping me alive.
