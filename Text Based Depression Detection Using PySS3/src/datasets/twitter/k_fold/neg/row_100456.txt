I wish I had the strength to let goI haven't ever been completely happy or really carefree, even when I was a kid. There was just too much on my mind always. When I was thirteen, my mom died. I thought I knew sadness before but I must not have. I broke into a million pieces and people just watched. I picked up self harm and suddenly it just dawned on me that I'm never going to be the same. People treated me like I should be over it, as each year passed, I felt their exhaustion with my deterioration. Then I lost my grandfather. I was gaining weight rapidly, binge eating, my quality of life and self-esteem somehow got lower. A few days after my 17th birthday, I was done. I was in enough pain and I was done, but I failed. I got put in therapy and meds. My dad stopped driving me to therapy after a few months, told me that I "should be good now". 

At 18, I lost my sister. She was my best friend right after my mom. I watched her kids with her husband, moved in with them so he could work and adjust to being a single dad. Soon he wasn't going to work as often, likely also because of depression, which meant not a lot of money or food. I was eating less so the kids could eat and suddenly I went from binge eating to starving myself. I lost 100 pounds and they all applauded for the fat person who seems to be getting their life together.

And now here I am, 21, I keep talking myself out of it but all I want to do is die. If they all knew how badly I wanted to not exist anymore, they'd probably help me.
