This is how I feelI feel like no one is there

I feel like no one even tries to understand

I feel like I'm waived away

I feel like what I have to bring to the table is less important than everyone else

I feel like whenever I try to feel confident, people view it as obnoxious and douchey

I feel like my boyfriend doesn't love me

I feel like he doesn't know the half of this

I feel like I'm drowning

I feel like every time I see my mom I get irrationally angry

I feel like living with her is slowly killing me

I feel like I can't wait for college

I feel like I'm going to die before I turn 23

I feel like a kid shouldn't have all these thoughts
