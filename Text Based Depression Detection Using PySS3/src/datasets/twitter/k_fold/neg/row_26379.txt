there's no point in me being aliveI've been strongly considering suicide for over a year now. I'm planning on going through with it before I graduate from college. I have finally decided that I do not want to be alive anymore. I don't want to slave away at some job that I never even wanted in the first place. In fact, there is no career path that I want in life. My only plans for the future involve various methods of killing myself. Thinking of suicide actually makes me feel happy. I am planning on harming myself so that I can prepare for the day I finally commit suicide. Planning on killing myself before turning 22
