why do people just get angry when you talk about being suicidal?Everyone's all like "reach out it's good to get a support group" mf I reach out and I just get 'you're being dramatic' or 'oh nice threat lol' 

   nobody gives a fuck unless I'm doing good, if I'm not doing good all they want is for me to change doesn't matter how I feel as long as it looks good.
