Why don't we careI had a loaded gun to my temple, finger on the trigger but I just couldn't. I thought I could go to the hospital and check myself in but I can't afford the bill I would get not to mention wonder if I lose my license because of it it would always follow me around. But why is that why don't we care about people that hurting it's all about money or pushing a new drug or the label of being damaged. It's like you're in a hole and you're sinking faster and you try to help yourself up but everything is just Out Of Reach
