Preparing myself after years of sufferingHello! This is weird. I donâ€™t really know how to start this as Iâ€™m fairly new to posting on Reddit... however my time has come and I want something there to prove that I did indeed exist. Iâ€™m sorry if this doesnâ€™t make any sense... Iâ€™m sorry.

Iâ€™m a 22 year old (f). I was abused for the majority of my childhood and adolescence, both emotionally, verbally and physically, along with some sexual abuse. Iâ€™ve had depression ever since I can remember and have fantasized about dying since I was about 5. About four years ago, I got really sick and nearly died. Even though I should be stoked, I feel cursed that I recovered. 

I hate myself... I hate myself so much. Iâ€™m a burden and weight on everyone. All I do is get sick. Iâ€™m useless and pointless. I donâ€™t have anything to contribute or any good qualities. I am literally the very definition of a waste of space. I want to die. Iâ€™ve always wanted to die, but now I donâ€™t care if I have to be the one to do it, because I need to free myself from everything. I genuinely believe I deserved everything that happened to me and that now all thatâ€™s left to do is die and leave everyone alone for once. The urge is so intense, that I feel the need to do it today, but Iâ€™m going to wait until Wednesday. 

Iâ€™ve thought it through, for a while, and Iâ€™m ready. Iâ€™m not scared anymore, or sad... I feel at peace. Iâ€™m seeing my friend tomorrow for coffee, I want to see her once more and then Wednesday, Iâ€™m going to jump off the roof. Iâ€™m going to look at my city one more time. So with that, goodbye. I genuinely hope the best for everyone here. Goodbye to my shit mother who tortured me for 18 years. Goodbye to my loving father, who kept me going this long.  Farewell.
