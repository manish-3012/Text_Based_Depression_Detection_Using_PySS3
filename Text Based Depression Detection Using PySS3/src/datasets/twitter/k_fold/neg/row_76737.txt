Would this look like an accident?I have decided that I donâ€™t want my death to look like a suicide. Of course how people perceive my death is not something I have full control over, but I sure as hell can try. 

So, humor me for a second, I go on a camping trip for the weekend. I set up my tent with my sleeping bag inside and everything. I have a cooler in the trunk of my car with, I donâ€™t know, burgers and hot dogs. And then I have the grill running in my car.

Of course that raises the question of why I would be grilling inside my car, but Iâ€™m hopeful that people would think Iâ€™m ignorant enough to do that. Iâ€™ll try to time my trip with the weather so perhaps it would look like Iâ€™m taking shelter from the rain or whatever, but the weather can be unpredictable and unreliable.

I donâ€™t know. I doubt it would actually work, but at least I tried, right? I know my friends and family care about me and I have a â€œgoodâ€ life with nothing in particular that I can complain about, but Iâ€™m tired. I donâ€™t want to live because it would make other people sad if I died. I have lived my entire life trying to please other people, trying to make their lives easier and Iâ€™m tired. I think itâ€™s time to make my own life easier, to be selfish and do what I want. 

However, the last thing I want is to have my loved ones constantly questioning why I took my own life or having them blame themselves for not being there for me. I want my death to look like an accident rather than a suicide. Would I be able to accomplish that?

In the end, I guess it wouldnâ€™t really matter. I wonâ€™t be there to see the aftermath anyways.
