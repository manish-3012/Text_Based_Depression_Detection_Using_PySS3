There is nothing for me in this life.I truly just want to kill myself. It seems all I'm here for is just to be a waste of flesh. I am done living like that and wish for death. I've thought about getting rope and walking in front of cars (which I have done a couple times within a span of few years) No one will care if I'm gone. I am worthless. I just want to die.
