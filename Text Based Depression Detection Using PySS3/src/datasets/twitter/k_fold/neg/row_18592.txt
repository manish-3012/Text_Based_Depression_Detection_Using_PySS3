I'm just a wreck right nowI've been fairly emotionally stable for weeks now but today it has just all come crashing down. It started with a zoom meeting for work earlier, I started to feel a bit manic but I thought I had it under control then by the end of my work day I was crying and trying to think of ways to stop existing.

I've been completely sober for months but I've spent most of my evening pacing around my house trying to find literally anything to numb the pain of being alive. 

I don't know what has caused this, I think it's just stress and an overwhelming sense of loneliness. I'm sick of being told to just get on with it, I'm sick of living alone during lockdown, I just want a hug and I want to cry until I fall asleep.

I'm sick of existing. I know this feeling will pass, I just wish I knew when it would pass because I don't know if I'm strong enough to deal with this feeling.
