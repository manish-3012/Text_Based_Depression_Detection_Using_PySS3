Canâ€™t go on7th September 2018

I want to die again. For a year plus now Iâ€™ve been going nowhere. What I have been doing is encouraging my partner to carry on after my impending suicide. I know it will hit her very hard. I will try to help as much I can by granting her all my possessions and money. With the right tools she will go far. Sheâ€™ll go further with me but I cannot go anywhere. Sheâ€™ll have to learn to live without me. 

I have felt this way on and off for years. I really donâ€™t know what to do. Our situation is horrible. I canâ€™t carry on any more. 

I have mental health problems that prevent me from employment. The job centre thinks Iâ€™m okay enough and when I contested their decision they still thought I was okay. I want to die. I was successful in my own business but that came to an end due to my mental health. This year I finally got therapy but it isnâ€™t helping. My money is running out and I canâ€™t get more from the government. I live at home with my parents still (30) and with my partner. We constantly feel under pressure from everyone else to get jobs or pull more than our own weight. Itâ€™s destroying us. We can stay at her house but itâ€™s really messy and unliveable for me. Her parents have mental health issues too (dad: immature, ignorant, grumpy, belligerent, very lazy. Mum: untreated depression, doesnâ€™t think/plan when it comes to money, physically incapable of much. Their house is a mess).

Today I helped my dad with his work. I fixed not one but two computer problems for him. Moments later and the first thing I said to me since I helped him was that the food I was making smelt bad. 

I canâ€™t carry on. It feels like this is it now. Iâ€™m planning on places and methods to die. Normally I get here and think HAH I canâ€™t actually do it. But this time thereâ€™s nothing stopping me. 

Update; I wrote this but it never posted. Now Iâ€™m outside and just waiting for these thoughts to go. They arenâ€™t. I have a belt on me.
