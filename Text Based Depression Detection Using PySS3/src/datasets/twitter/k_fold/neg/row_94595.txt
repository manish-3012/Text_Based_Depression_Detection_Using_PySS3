I'm suicidal again...After a week in psych and a new batch of pills I find myself in the same predicament. I don't really know what is wrong with me, I saw what happened to the people I loved, I saw the pain and fear in their eyes but yet here I am... Wishing that no one would have busted in on me shaking and crying as I held a gun to my head. I told them I wouldn't try again, but I feel like it was an empty promise. I don't want to be this selfish monster that I am, but I can't seem to find anything that matters. I don't care enough about myself to try. I am at a point where it's like I know I will never be anything so why should I keep doing this... I've been taking my medicine, not drinking and seeing my shrink... It's like after I've failed at everything for so long I don't have the will to try and succeed... I'm ranting and I'm just really frustrated because I've become something I never intended to be... I miss being 10 when all I cared about was if I had enough time to play kickball and 4-square...
I hope you guys are doing ok, sorry for my repetitive rant.
