A few final statements.Hello everyone. I am standing in front of a train track, and several trains will be passing by shortly. If that fails (it does seem rather gruesome and the trains are traveling slower than I had hoped) then I have an overpass directly above me that I could climb onto and use as well. I've been helped on this subreddit before, unfortunately I was unable to solve my problems in time. Before I go, I wanted to say a few things. First off, I don't really approve of suicide. Almost all problems can be addressed eventually. What I would encourage everyone to consider is their honest willingness to go through the process of recovery. This is my problem. I am too far gone, both mentally and practically, to face the prospect of living on. If you are like me, then perhaps you should go through with it. Just remember that life is an incredible opportunity. Unless you're completely sure you've wasted it, as I have, then please reconsider. Also, I want to say to those who know me, who will find this post: I apologize for this. You don't deserve to go through the suicide of a family member/friend. At the end of the day, though, I am not capable of caring enough about you to convince myself to stick around. This is due to my own flaws, rather then any of your own. Mostly, at least. Some of you are dicks and need to rethink your whole existence. You know who you are. So yeah, there we go. Make sure to not worry about stuff more than you really should. Land a guy on Mars for me, if not for yourselves. That would be pretty cool. Bye now. I'm looking forward to a long, long sleep. I hear a train coming.
