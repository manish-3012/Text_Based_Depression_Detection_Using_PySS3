I've been pondering suicide for years, I don't think I can take it anymoreGreetings, people.
33 year old uruguayan here. I'll try to be as concise as possible, so that I don't take much time from you.
I used to be "creative" when I was younger in several areas, but since I never dedicated myself to improve in any of them, I abanoned them all and now I create nothing. I hate creative people I know - to the degree that I almost felt comfortable when I thought a drawing prodigy I knew had died. Then I felt like shit for being such a bad person.
I also hate couples. I had my only girflriend at 23, that lasted for about a year. Since then, I didn't have contact with anyone, even though people say I'm attractive (???). All my friends are becoming fathers, but I never had the chance to live my twenties -- and I feel like I'll never have "girlfriends", explore the world so to speak. That destroys me.
I've a degree in animation, a degree in audiovisual, and I am currrently studying video game design (although I have a more solid base in board game design). But that's just paperwork; I'm mediocre at everything I do.
I've spent the last ten years in bed. Almost enterily.
I've been taking pills for years... over 15 by now.
I've been commited, and I've been into shock therapy.
I've never worked in my entire life, and thought it makes me feel sick, I cannot imagine myself in a position of responsibility (panic attacks).
I've been described as a "nice guy", "thoughtful", "amiable", "funny" and other crap like that --- I don't wan't that, I want the will to power, I want to transcend, I want to have everything within my grasp and more. But I know I'll never have anything.
Sorry for the wordy mess; I tried to organize my thoughts but right now I'm pondering ending my life, so you can guess I am not able to put much effort to such a task.
Well, there goes nothing.
Why should I not end my sorry existence? I'm sure everyone would be better off without me...
