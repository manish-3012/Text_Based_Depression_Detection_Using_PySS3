I resisted temptation today!So I was put on an antidepressant for my postpartum depression (and lingering depression from before my pregnancy). I stopped taking it for awhile. I started taking it again 3 days ago (it takes 2-3 days to kick in) and I have been feeling my symptoms come back. It is harder for me to become happy. I am so irritable. I can't relax. It doesn't help that I can't see my husband the past few days. I know it isn't from that because my depression symptoms always affect my relationship with him and I saw him today for an hour and things were different. The earliest I can see my doctor is tomorrow. 

Sometimes I just want to yell at one of my kids, smack her, and throw her across a room. But I didn't. I have an immense amount of self-control. A lot of times I even surprise myself.

I have Xanax for my anxiety, although if I take it at all, it is usually before I go to bed so that I can sleep. Today my anxiety is high, but I left it at home because I thought I wouldn't need it. I just got home and I just took it. Hopefully it will kick in soon.

I picked up my stepdaughter today, on the way home I picked up my younger son from my in-laws' place. I had to get a few groceries for my stepdaughter. We went to the store, and being a supermarket, it also has alcohol. I was so tempted to just pick up a 6-pack of Smirnoff coolers (raspberry is my favorite). I could have easily drunken them all myself. It is just me and the kids at home. Nobody would know. I was afraid that if I started drinking that I wouldn't be able to stop at the appropriate time. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to take care of my baby when he woke up, and I was afraid that I would sleep so deeply that I wouldn't be able to hear him at all...

Good news! They didn't have any raspberry flavor (seriously, guys, try it if you haven't) and it is much easier to drink quickly (which is what I wanted) when I have those coolers than anything else. I wasn't in the mood for the other flavors (and the good part of me was still stopping me), so I didn't buy any of it.

Honestly, I have other alcohol in the house and I have more Xanax that I can take to calm down and relax. With it just being me and the kids, I am not going to drink and I am not going to take more Xanax than prescribed. It is still very VERY tempting to do so.

Please help.
