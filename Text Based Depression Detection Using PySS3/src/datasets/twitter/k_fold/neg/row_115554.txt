Wish one of my teacher would just shut their mouthsYes, I struggled with online learning during quarantine. Stop reminding me every 2 fucking seconds. I'm trying to overcome it, yet here you are passive-aggressively pressuring me while attempting to hide it with your blatant superficiality. Fucking whore. And do you even know how hypocritical you're being? Ruining me with your unrealistic deadlines, and now showing fake kindness.

Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I didn't miss hearing you and your childish voice during remote learning. Stop asking me. What am I supposed to say? You're just trying to make your own ego bigger by forcing a "yes" out of me with such an uncomfortable question like that. And if I said "no"? Mama mia, the good student is being oh-so rebellious. That's a phone call to the parents.

In the end, it was you who ruined me. Was it fun? Was it amusing? Did I manage to give you a chuckle? In the likely scenario that it did, it was my pleasure to entertain you, my good sir. Please humbly accept my human-sacrifice in exchange for your oh-so important reputation and ego.

Sorry for getting a little heated there. I hope it's alright to rant out on this subreddit. Goodnight to everyone except this one teacher â¤
