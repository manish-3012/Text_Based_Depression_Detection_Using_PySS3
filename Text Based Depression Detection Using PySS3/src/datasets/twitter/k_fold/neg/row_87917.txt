It's just getting worseI used to only hit my head really hard until I got headaches or blurry vision. Now I fantasize about cutting myself and today I threw a tantrum and scratched up my arms with my nails. I just really with my old best friend was dead. She told my rapist it was my fault not his. I wish my rapist was dead. I wish his new girl friend who told me my rape didn't matter was dead. Their happiness makes me more miserable and want to kill myself. If I die it's their fault. I want them to be gone so badly. I hate myself and my skin. I just want my body back. My body is so broken because of what he did to me. I can't have sex without panic attacks and I can't get aroused easily and I can't orgasm anymore since he started abusing me. I have no supportive friends. I wish I were dead so badly. I can't keep doing this anymore and I know I'm probably going to start cutting and I know that's only going to lead to worse things. I've tried to get counseling and help so many times and they don't work and they always tell me I'm too depressed and they refer me to someone else. I have no constant support. My arms are burning so much.
