15M having suicidal feelingsHi everyone.

Im 15 and I groped a 14 year old girl -my classmate. I feel like utter shit. I thought it was consensual but i realised that i was being an ass. I apologised and I still feel like shit

We were talking and stuff and it lead to it. 

I feel like im going to be jailed and im going to be cancelled.

I feel like im going to get reported and my life is over can anyone help please?
