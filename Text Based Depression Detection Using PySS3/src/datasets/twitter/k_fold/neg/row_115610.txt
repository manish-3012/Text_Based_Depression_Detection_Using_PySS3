Ending my life.I am 36 years of age and itâ€™s 4am. Iâ€™ve been hiding in hotel rooms for the last 11 weeks from a business I own and need to fix. I just donâ€™t want to because i donâ€™t care about it. I am slowly running out of money because I eat 6/7 meals a day. I am overweight since I was 4/5 years old. I know a lot about nutrition and eating healthy. Iâ€™ve been separated for nearly 16 months. Iâ€™ve tried so hard to work it out and do the right thing but sadly I donâ€™t think I can accept her toxic behavior. I am the sort of guy who has always had bad luck. Iâ€™d order a pizza it would be cold or damaged. Iâ€™d rent a hotel room and the AC wouldnâ€™t work. Iâ€™d get a bus ticket and the bus would be late. Use my credit card to pay for something Iâ€™d be double charged. I got so use to this pattern of things happening to me that i turned it into a way to evaluate problems. Turn them into challenges. Be proactive and turn challenges into projects. I donâ€™t have a voice of reason I just do things and I am very very unhappy. Iâ€™d say I am tired now but thatâ€™s not it. Itâ€™s not tired it, itâ€™s truly lack of hope that I feel I need to get through what ever this thing is that has been holding me back since I can remember visualizing when I was 8 years old. Parents were terrible. I left home early on.   Never contracted them for the last 23 years. Feel nothing for them. Nothing. Watched a video yesterday of a guy killing people in New Zealand  watched it 2 times. I didnâ€™t flinch or feel anything. Thought about my kiwi friends and messaged them. I just talked shit about how the systems in place should of caught him.  But didnâ€™t. I truly donâ€™t care. As sad as it must be for the families. I just see life as you live you die -nothing really means anything anyway and relationships are just away to have a family and not be alone while you grow old. Tonight is the first time Iâ€™ve thought about hurting other people to take what they have so I can have a quality of life. Iâ€™ve not interest in violence or brutality. Just get what I want from people. Then live longer. I donâ€™t want to work with people or for people.  Itâ€™s this terrible idea or I just kill myself. I keep looking for some sort of community I can go live in or just get help for a long time to process things but I canâ€™t find anything. At all.
