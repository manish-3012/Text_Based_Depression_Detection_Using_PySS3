Could use some help pleaseI just had dinner with my parents r my dads birthday. Last year I was depressed and had to take a year off from college. They said they would let me go back of I got good grades at the community college. I have. Great grades. My mom said shed talk to my dad and convince him to send me back. Then tonight when we brought it up she turned around. She mocked me and made me feel lower than ever. I just want to get back to school. It's my home. I feel so helpless and weak. I don't know how to tell my girlfriend who is already so tired of waiting for me. I've compRtey let her down. Failed beyond anything.  I don't know what I'm going to do. I pulled over into a church parking lot to cry and have typed this up. I really need someone. Please help me
