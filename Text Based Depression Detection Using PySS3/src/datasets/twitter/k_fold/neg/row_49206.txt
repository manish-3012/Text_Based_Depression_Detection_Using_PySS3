Does anyone know the legal procedures following my suicide?So I signed a personal guarantee for a lease I have for a business.  The business is failing really hard, and I just don't have the energy to deal with it, or life, anymore.  

So I'm wondering what would happen if I died by SIGW, and then  the Landlord sued us personally (not the business).  Would it still go through?  My mother and brother (who is not in the picture) are the other personal guarantors. 

I know the Landlord company will sue my parents until bankruptcy, because that is what they do lol... But I'm curious as to what my death might mean legally for my parents.  I'm trying to set them up for the worst case scenario because it is likely to happen.
