I'm falling appart.I'm a sober junkie living on my own 3,000 miles from feiends or family. I'm terrified of my own mental health and living by myself. I have little to no self worth and keep having sex woth random dudes who make me feel like shit, but I can't seem to stop. Today I purged for the first time in a few years and I feel like my eating disorder is coming back full force. I want to die, but I don't want to kill myself. I don't know how to let anyone in my personal life know I'm spiraling. I'm afraid of being taken back to a hospital or rehab. My eating disorder has been looking so attractive and I feel like I can't fight it. I'm terrified that I don't have family or friends around to rescue me if I take things too far. I'm so terrified of myself and I just feel miserable.
