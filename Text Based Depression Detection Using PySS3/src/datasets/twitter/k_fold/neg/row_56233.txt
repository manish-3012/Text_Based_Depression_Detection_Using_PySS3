How much do I have to fuck up my life to be legally allowed to kill myself?Like, if I drop out of law school and become homeless after my pending divorce, can I announce that I am going to die on Facebook but still be allowed to kill my self by a doctor or judge? I want an official endorsement that my life isnâ€™t fixable and that I should die.
