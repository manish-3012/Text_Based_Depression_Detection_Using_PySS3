DivorceSince my wife wanted a divorce ive had to leave our marital home and our children and go back to living with my mum. Im so lonely and have nothing to fill my empty days as i have no job. My existance is pointless and i dont see the point in being alive. Id rather just not be here. My ex is in a new relationship and it consumes my every thought of them playing happy families with my children and them being intimate with each other. Just wish i wasnt such a fucking coward and i could just jump off a bridge or in front of a car or hang myself. I did take around 60-70 of my anti depressants around 5 months ago but they didnt even make me unconcsious. I wish i could go to sleep and not wake up. I suffer from OCD and so i cant stop obsessing over my ex, my old life and her fantastic new life while i sit in a room at my mums house crying everyday wishing the pain would stop.
