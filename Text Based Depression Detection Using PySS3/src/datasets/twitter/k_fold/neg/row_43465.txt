I'm so tired this is the last strawI just got a letter in the mail yesterday that said I can't get into the therapy program I applied to over a year ago, despite psychiatrists and GPs pushing my referral multiple times in the past year. I'm done I've lost hope. I've spent the last 2 weeks trying to help others with their own issues and then got yelled at for not doing enough despite putting their safety and well-being above my own. I'm stuck at my univeristy where I'm forced to see the person who assaulted me. I tried reaching out this time. I feel I've done everything I could to try and prevent this from happening but I feel like I've been kicked down. I can't even express what's led me to this point without fearing that I'll be told I'm too sensitive. Things are just getting worse I've had 2 alcohol+paracetamol overdoses in the past 4 months. I've already taken paracetamol and alcohol together and I'm hoping it kills me this time. I don't want to die alone like this but I can't take it anymore
