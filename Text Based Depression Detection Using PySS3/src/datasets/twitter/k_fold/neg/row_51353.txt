The only thing that makes me happy is seeing others happyI was supposed to die in a house fire this time last year. Now I'm sitting here sobbing trying to figure out a reason on why I should wake up tomorrow. I feel like there has been lots of shit in my life but on the other hand there hasn't.. Lately I've been living making people angry and hating me. Because when you make people hate you nobody will miss you when you're gone, right?
