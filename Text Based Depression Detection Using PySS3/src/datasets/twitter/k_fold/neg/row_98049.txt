No motivation to live or attempt to succeedI just feel completely and utterly alone. I have a long and complicated story, as everyone does. I've tried to get better, to use my options--I do what everyone says I should. I'm on medication for my depression and I see a therapist. I've been seeing the same therapist since my Freshmen year at my school, and I found out recently that when I was hospitalized he told my mother that my "biggest problem" was "laziness." Not severe, debilitating depression, but "laziness."

I feel like he hasn't been listening to me for the past three years. Social isolation, emotional abuse, sexual abuse at the hands of my second boyfriend--I've been dealing with a lot while at school. And he dismisses me entirely as lazy. I feel betrayed. I feel extremely alienated. Any minor hopes I had that I was able to get better have been crushed, that my own fucking therapist doesn't get me. Also I was diagnosed with Lyme disease in the last couple weeks, and due to having an incompetent family doctor almost my whole life I have no idea how long I've had it. Perhaps the lack of energy could be partially explained by that, I don't know.

I just know I'm tired and hurting and lonely, and I feel like no one takes my hurt truly seriously. I don't want to survive; I want to thrive. But I feel like thriving is not in my reach--obstacles keep getting in my way, even disguised as help like my therapist. I want out before I create any more ties to this world. Only then can limit the pain I unintentionally spread by leaving.
