16 year old sister has been depressed for some time, seriously considering suicide. What can I do?Hello all. I am an 18 year old male heading into my sophomore year of college. My sister has been depressed for a long while. She started secretly cutting herself at the age of 14. My mom has many health problems (which are completely out of her control, ie- she could not have prevented them by certain behavior). So she has been in and out of the hospital since my sister was a kid. This has influenced her in many ways.

I am home for the summer, and while my sister was away, I found a video on her computer from last month called Suicide.avi. In the video she was crying and saying how tired she is of everything. Of people hurting her and her hurting other people. This makes me very nervous

I know she has attempted to OD before, but was found and taken to the hospital. She goes to regular therapy and is on prozac (I believe). She has expressed depressive and suicidal thoughts to me before (how she thinks of driving off of the bridge near our home almost daily).

I have an older brother, and we have both gone through teenage depression. My brother and I have both had suicidal thoughts. I think many (most) teenagers do. 

I have tried communicating to her that things get better, but she doesn't seem to want to help herself. She dates guys she knows sheshouldn't (leading to more emotional distress) and 'forgets' to take her medicine

Apparently, every night, our 8 year old sister asks my mother "what if ____ kills herself tonight?"

tl-dr: 16 year old sister is suicidal. It sort of runs in the family. What do I do?
