Iâ€™m depressed for the first time in years...now Iâ€™m dealing with a depressed husbandIâ€™m going to make this as short and sweet as possible: Iâ€™ve almost always been a happy positive person, but after a couple years of non-stop medical issues and surgeries, Iâ€™ve become incredibly sad and depressed. I have done my best to keep the fake happy face on for everyone except my husband...who I thought I could unload on. It seems to have backfired because now he is sad and overwhelmed. Now I give up!! I have devastated him and put a whole bunch of shit oh his shoulders, so now Iâ€™m pretending Iâ€™m all better when Iâ€™m around him because I feel even more shitty and guilty. I desperately want out. I want to be done. I can only cry quietly in the bathroom or the basement. I just want to figure out a way to leave peacefully from this world. I know this sounds rambling, but I just donâ€™t feel like explaining everything....I will never go to the hospital or therapy...I was depressed/anxious once 25 years ago after a serious car accident where I nearly died and was forced into the hospital. It was an experience I promised myself I would never allow myself to repeat. I want to be happy again...but now...fuck it.
