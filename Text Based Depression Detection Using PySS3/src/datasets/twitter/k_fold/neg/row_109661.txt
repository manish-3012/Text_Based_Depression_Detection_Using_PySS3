Collateral DamageBeen depressed since childhood. Broken home, mom murdered when I was 10, yadda yadda. 

I am a co-signer for my cousin and I's first new build home together and it requires me to keep a job and have an adequate paystub as proof. I no called no showed today at my relatively new job and I just feel this huge sense of guilt. I promised my cousin, when I was in a better state of mind, that I was going to help her pay for the house. The past three or four days I've been reading up on how to end my life or if there is any alternative than to work. There is nothing. I'm just dead weight at this point and everything else is being affected by my uselessness.

My aunt and cousin love me so so much, and I love them with every part of my heart, but I'm tired and they don't understand how much of a burden I truly will be once I tap out altogether (quit my job and sell everything I own) or kill myself. I hate being responsible for their sadness. I want to be happy. My soul died 11 years ago and school was easy to skip and bullshit but bills and paychecks are not lenient. When I was younger I would hide in my closet and stay home for several days. I wouldn't shower or clean. I've come a long way but everytime I think I'm doing good I get hit by huge bouts of depression and anxiety. Half my family died in the span of 3 years. I can count my relatives on one hand, only. No friends, lost them all before senior year of highschool. I am 21 now. 

I have no insurance, no help. Therapy costs precious money that could be used elsewhere. I really don't know why I'm posting here. I'm sitting outside of the house with my cousin home but I don't have the guts to say I didn't go to work. It will likely get worse and I will have to answer to my Aunt and cousin, since they will be facing the brunt of my actions. (no job = not being able to pay any bills, my cousin won't get the house, I'll be dead weight). The 'happy holidays' only exacerbate my sheer, gutteral sorrow. I'm tired, and have been for a long time. 

I will look into how to sell my assets (car that I took a loan out for, my phone, I really don't have much else.)

Thanks for reading I guess. I hope you are well.
