Another postSo I am deciding to make another post since I feel the need to vent again. I sorta would like to thank some of you guys who took time out of your day to respond to my dumb post yesterday. Really, I do appreciate it. I'm thinking of holding off on trying to end it for now, it sorta makes me scared of dying and leaving my loved ones behind. I don't want to be forgotten when I die, yet I don't want to be here anymore. Anyways I'm just gonna write about something else. Well, it's hard for me to make friends with other people since I am very enthusiastic when I talk about topics I am passionate about. I get the feeling the other person is weirded out or is bored of the conversation. It sucks sort of and honestly it makes me feel terrible. Really I can rarely ever connect with new people I meet since I usually end up become too enthusiaatic sometimes. Honestly I just want to know if with all my flaws and such if a girl will still ever love me or if anyone would knowing all these feelings and thoughts I have. This is probably a bit of a cringy/simp-ish question so I apologize, I don't have enough money to talk to a therapist so I can't really get help.
