No one ever gives a crap about me. There is only hate from everyoneAll everyone does is hate me. Doesnâ€™t matter who they are or what I do and donâ€™t do, I am still hated. I didnâ€™t do anything wrong. My life has always been like this. The pain everyone puts on me is too much to bear. Killing myself is my only option to get rid of the pain and my problems. Anyone who says they care or that I should live are liars. They should have done it way sooner or they do it just to make themselves look good. December 31 is my deadline. If the hate continues and my problems continue to exist, I will end my life that day.
