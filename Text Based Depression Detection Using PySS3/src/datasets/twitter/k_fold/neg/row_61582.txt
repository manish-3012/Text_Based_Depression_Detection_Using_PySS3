Breaking point has been reached..I've been depressed for over six years. And of course I've thought about suicide and even attempted it before.. but looking back, those just seem like cries for help. Tonight.. tonight I feel like I'm *actually* suicidal. I'm tired of it all. I put up with so much on a daily basis, and I just can't handle it anymore. I applaud those that can, but I just can't anymore. I don't live for myself anymore.. I get up every morning because there are people around me that would be crushed if I died. But now, as sad as it would be to hurt them.. I'm tired of feeling this way. I just.. can't.
