23/Male suicidal thoughts when it comes to my own looksHello people 

I wonder whether someone else has that problem with their own appearance the way I do.
I fucking hate how my face looks. No beard, I donâ€™t look manly. 
I am gay and I want to look like a stereotypical man for some reason I can not explain myself 100%.
Rationally I know the reason (status, it has perks, itâ€™s more attractive in my eyes )but emotionally I donâ€™t know the reason why I am so obsessed with looking like a 10/10.
People told me I look like someone who has no friends. Based on my appearance ? Yeah i kinda agree, I look awful and like a boring piece of shit.
Even tho I might not be ugly at all for lots of people I still canâ€™t accept he fact that I am not a 10/10.
It seems I draw a lot confidence / self worth from my looks.
9/10 ? Thatâ€™s not enough. I have to look like a 10/10, that means I have to look flawless when I (!!!!) look into the mirror.
Obviously everyone has flaws but there a minor flaws which would be okay because thats how the world is and there are still 10/10 men.
I wonder why I have that obsession being a 10/10. 
I never really had any approval when I was younger. Maybe thatâ€™s why ? Just being strongly wanted might be another reason...
Anyways, when I feel very down and I catch my self in the mirror there is a chance I start hitting myself in the face. It reminds me of an act of punishment. That I am not physically attractive ( = â€œsexyâ€ ) 
I am still loosing weight and when I reach 75Kg ( I am 90 Kg so far, 188cm height )
I will see how whether itâ€™s worth to continue living.
Thatâ€™s when I will be skinny enough to judge accordingly - thatâ€™s how I cope ... 

Does anyone has the same problems ? 
I am looking for a therapist so far so donâ€™t worry
