I have a plan, and could easily do it today if I decide to.I finally have a perfect plan to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been suicidal since losing my dog on April 30. She is my best friend, soul mate, the love of my life. I have other things going on in my life too, but mostly I just want to be reunited with my girl. 
And I have the perfect plan. Today would be the perfect day to do it, because my mom and I are recently sharing a car while mine is in the shop, and she is at work with no car. I had a moment after dropping her off that I was like, okay I can actually go do it now if I want to, but then I started thinking about leaving a more and I donâ€™t know what to write. I am happy to have a plan on how to do it, and I am comforted by the fact that I can do it when I want to if I decide on it.
