I don't deserve help or to be savedI beat my disabled ex-fiancee several times. She has mild cerebral palsy. I may be ill but that doesn't excuse my behaviour. I'm such a despicable bastard. I already knew what I did long ago but I just can't wrap my head around how I could do that to someone I love. I feel like such a failure. I should've protected her, not hurt her.

I truly believe that I don't deserve any help or support off anyone. As much as I want her back, as much as I love and miss her, she made the right choice dumping my pathetic arse. I deserve to be without her. There's a part of me that wants to hate her, but the good side of me just can't do it because it's not her fault. I just hope she's happy with the guy she's with now and he'll never hurt her. I just wish it was me she was with.
