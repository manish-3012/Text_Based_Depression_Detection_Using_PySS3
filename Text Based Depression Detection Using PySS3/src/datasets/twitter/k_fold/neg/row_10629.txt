Iâ€™m either happy or I want to kill myselfThe littlest thing makes me say in my head â€œIâ€™m going to kill myselfâ€ and not in a petulant juvenile way.  But in a â€œhow would I do it.. moose? Razor? Pills?â€ Kind of way.  General anxiety and depression my whole life.  Canâ€™t give my husband a child and this week I learned 2 friends are pregnant and I skipped a baby shower today.  Pills help but latest dose has me feeling so apathetic I donâ€™t want to do anything but lie in bed all day. Sucks.
