I just want to die more every day.Iâ€™ve thought about suicide every day for the past two months.

Not just a fleeting thought. Full on consideration of what I am going to do to kill myself. Itâ€™s funny, because even though Iâ€™ve been debating this on and off for five years, I still havenâ€™t decided on my method.

A month ago I lost the only person in my life who gave me reason to be a person and everything Iâ€™ve done since then makes me feel like a fucking imposter. My life is in fucking shambles now. I skip school because Iâ€™m too depressed to get out of bed, I canâ€™t even text people â€” Iâ€™ll try but I canâ€™t get more than a couple texts in without feeling like a sham and just leaving them on read, Iâ€™ve started cutting again to try and feel less, I sleep weird ass hours (10 pm-2:30 am), I cant eat, every day I feel worse and worse and I have no fucking clue what to do.

The only thing that made sense to me anymore is hurting myself because at least then I felt in control. Fuck the years of mental and physical abuse Iâ€™ve been put under, the manipulative relationships Iâ€™ve tried to be in to cope, the toxicity of nearly everyone Iâ€™ve ever fucking met, because in the moments I cut I at least feel like only I can hurt me. But now it just feels like his hand dragging the blade against my skin.

I feel gross, and wrong. And Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m so fucking tired. Physically and mentally and beyond everything Iâ€™m just so tired and itâ€™s like every minuscule part in my body is just longing to be at rest. God. Why do I have to feel like this at fucking 17. This is so fucking unfair. Everyone I know is capable of doing the shit they need to and then stuff they want to but the only thing I want anymore is to kill myself.

Try as I might, I canâ€™t get better and havenâ€™t gotten better for years. I know Iâ€™m going to die soon.
