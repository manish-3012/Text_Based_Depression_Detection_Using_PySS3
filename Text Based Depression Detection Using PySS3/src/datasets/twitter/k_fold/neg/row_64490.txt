My depression and anxiety got worseIâ€™ve had a rough month but I thought I was getting better. Yesterday, out of nowhere, my depression and anxiety hit me again very hard and I was unable to do anything for the whole day. Tonight Iâ€™ve had several nightmares.

Iâ€™m just so tired of being in pain and not seeing a way of healing I donâ€™t even know what to do. Will this be like this forever? I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to make it
