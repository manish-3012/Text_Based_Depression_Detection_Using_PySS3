Born a failure, raised a failure, no point in continuing as a failureA friend said something to me yesterday. He's a player who's stronger and more charismatic than I am, so I wither in his shadow. He told me that my anger and spite is the cause of my problems, and he isn't wrong, there's just nothing I can do to change it. I was born this way, weak both physically and emotionally, and put into an unhealthy mindset that was nurtured into blossoming by my parents and environment. I can't measure up to anyone, there's always someone smarter, who gets a better grade, who lifts more weight, who fucks more chicks. I'm a fucking virgin who's failing classes, looks like a fucking science project gone wrong,and feels nothing but spite to the world because of it, what could I possibly offer to society that's useful enough to warrant my existence? I'm stuck this way forever, and the only way to fix it is to prevent that forever. So, first chance that arises, I'm going to pick up some rope from a hardware store, or get some pills, or just grab a razor, something, because there's no point in continuing like this.
