Does anyone elses mood change like, by the minute?Like if I'm not distracted and left alone with my thoughts I will literally want to end my own life or at least cut myself ASAP. The next minute if I'm busy doing something and got my mind to doing something I'm absolutely fucking fine. Take that away and have to think about nothing and be bored and I'm back to suicidal again.
