Constantly failing and it will never get betterI can't do this. I'm studying engineering in a pretty good university, and I will fail my exam again. I failed one a year ago because I was too lazy to study, I sweared to never let it happen again, and I did it again. I have 3 days left and it's impossible to do it. I'm already behind on my course, I couldn't afford to be careless, and I was. I had so much time...

I tried so many times to study more and sometimes it worked, but a week later I was back in the same state. Nothing interests me anymore.

I'm almost constantly depressed and I feel like It will never get better. I feel like I will be stuck in mediocrity for my whole life because I'm just to dumb and lazy to improve. I'm just going adrift and I don't want to continue.
