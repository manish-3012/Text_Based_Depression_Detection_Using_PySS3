I need help.Hi, I don't use Reddit often nor have I even known about this community for very long, but I feel as if I am at my limit. Despite how good my life is I want to die. It started as I'd do it at 30 and ever since then the age has decreased and decreased. I can't go a minute without these horrible thoughts about everything in my life. I can barely focus on my school. I can barely get out of bed in the morning. I try to be happy in front of my friends but it's so fucking draining. It's so much work to do school and keep up with my social life and no matter what I do I feel bad about whatever choice I make. I can't talk to anyone because my parents refuse to believe I could even be depressed and I can't gather the strength to tell anyone I know. I don't know how or where to get help. I can barely do anything right anymore and my life is going to shit. I don't even have a reason to feel this way. I can't fucking get my thoughts even down on an anonymous post. I go to sleep every night hoping I don't wake up.
