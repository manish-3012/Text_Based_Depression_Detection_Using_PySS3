I just don't know what the point is anymoreI feel so empty and alone all the time, like I'm on a train platform watching everyone else go by.
I feel like my life is useless, a waste of space. 
I've told my partner I want to end it, but I don't think I was believed or taken seriously. 
I don't have close friends, and I've isolated myself from my family (for good reasons).
I really just want to die.
I used to self harm and I've started again. 
I don't want to be like this, like I'm constantly looking over a cliff and wondering how it feels to jump, but I don't know what to do. I can't afford therapy. 
I don't even know why I'm posting this, or if this is the right place because I'm not going to kill myself tonight, or next week probably, but I feel this terrible urge to just end it all and I'm always fighting it and I don't know why anymore.
So sorry if this isn't where this should be.
