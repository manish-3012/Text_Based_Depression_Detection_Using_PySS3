is it reasonable to kill myself cause i'm failing eighth grade?before you say it let me say it for you: "haha, you havent even experienced pain yet, kiddo. *its not a phase mum!!!!!!* hahaha fucking loser"

i have goals in life. i need to live to get there, but it's not gonna happen anyway. everyone actively avoids me. i've asked for help but no one cared. i want a job and a husband but i wont get either cause i'm failing almost all of my classes. i'm almost certain i'm retaking 8th grade and honestly, if i have to, i'm killing myself the day i get told i am. i'm too dumb to learn, everyone knows that and so do i. why should i live to watch myself fail when i can just go through a few seconds of pain to have an eternity of peace?
