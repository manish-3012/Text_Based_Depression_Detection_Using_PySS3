My psychologist told me he didnt think im suicidal and to go do something funI'm 16 m and i have had severe depression and anxiety for About 2 years. lately it has gotten worse and worse and it have gone to the point that i have been hospitalized 4 times because my suicidal thoughts etc.i have some medicine that dosnt work but let's cut to the point today i talked to my doctor, and we talked about what we should do about my mentalhealth, and then he said â€ i dont think you are suicidal i just think you are a bit sad and need to chear up(fun fact is that he is a â€ specialistâ€ and is very respected) and then he went on talking about how other people have a reason to be sad and depressed but i dont and i have to do stuff that's challenging for me a example is school i haven't been in school very much because of my health and now im starting to go so i am realy trying and doing everything he says, and i feel like he dosnt take me seriousely even tho i have talked to multiple doctors and psychologist and they have always been Really kind and helpful and i can't switch doctor cause he is the â€ bestâ€ doctor in our city (idont know what to call it) so now im sitting here crying house in dont know what to do and i have almost killed myself 3 times and i just want to end it cause everything feels hopled especely now that he will be my doctor and i dont know what to do
