I almost killed myself todayit was in the evening when it happened. I got my noose I tied early and tied to to my door handle. I placed a cushion in between my neck and the rope as I read somewhere that it would be more comfy. I sat down and since it was uncomfortable I had my hands on my eyes as they felt as if they were going to fall out. 10 seconds in and It felt as if I was going to fall asleep. I remember hearing my front door open and my mom calling out for me. She had just returned from work and thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m still here . I want to go but I donâ€™t want anyone to find me . I donâ€™t want to scar them for ever because I am selfish and all I can think about is myself . Itâ€™s 6 in the morning and I couldnâ€™t sleep as idk Iâ€™ve been thinking about this the whole night. Idk what to do but I think I might do it again tomorrow when my mind is clear.
