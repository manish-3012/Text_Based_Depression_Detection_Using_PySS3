my boyfriend needs helpmy bf is severly depressed and suicidal, ive asked him to get therapy so many times but he hadnt yet. im very scared and worried about him nd yesterday was a very scary day. i told his sister to check on him constantly nd stuff, but i rly think he needs professional help right now. i want to talk to his dad and tell his dad to maybe consider taking my bf to a mental hospital or smth but im worried abt mistreatment,  hes a black man with severe depression im very....scared of how they might treat him. but i think continuing untreated will cause more harm nd i think rn the only thing tht might help IS a mentsl hospital but idk. im also worried bx hes above 18, so if he doesnt consent i assume they wont accept him in the hospital,  but wht if ur at high suicide risk? is tht different? im so scared and worried and i dont know wht the right thing yo do is, ik its not my job but like he isnt getting himself the help he needs nd im worried what waiting will bring

i dont want him to die, or to be so depressed. he feels like nothing will get better nd everyone hates him nd i never have the right words to say. im...not equipped for this nd its causing me so much stress but i love him so much nd i wanna help in any way i can, i feel so small nd powerless i just want things to get better. he deserves the world.
