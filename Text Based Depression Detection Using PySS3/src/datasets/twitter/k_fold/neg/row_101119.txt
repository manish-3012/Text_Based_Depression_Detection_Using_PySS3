I told my mom I was feeling like dying and I wish I didnâ€™tI have struggled with passive and active suicide for a while and recently just felt like I needed to end it. But I called the hotline and talked for a bit which did make me feel better. The guy on the phone said that I should tell people closest to me and so after a week I got the courage to tell my mom. It broke her. She told me I couldnâ€™t leave her in this world alone and it makes me feel so guilty and so terrible. I still want to die but sheâ€™d probably kill herself right after I did. Itâ€™s awful, wish I hadnâ€™t said anything
