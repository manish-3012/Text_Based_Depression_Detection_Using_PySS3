What if you knew life WASNT going to get better?so the genral advice i seem to hear from people for dealing with wanting to kill myself  is that life only sucks right now, and given enough time, that it will get better. but what if you know this isnt true? for example if i was dying of some terrible illness and it was a fact that i had three days left to live, and those three days would be nothing but suffering, i think most reasonable people would say euthanasia is the best option.

now the one thing that i do have going for me is that i am not dying, or in terrible physical pain. but thats the only difference between that case and mine. i have hard evidence that my life is doomed to be nothing more than a lonely struggle to get by, until i finally decide to end it. so my question to you is, how do i still go on knowing life wont get better? is there some other way of thinking about continuing to want to live, even when you know its going to suck?



random facts if you care, but unrelated to the question:
25, yet still in college, because im lazy as fuck.

failed out of one university already, got accepted into another and im expecting a letter in about two weeks telling me that i've failed out of this new one too. 

diagnosed with (among other things) aspergers. which means it's impossible for me to form any real connection with people AT ALL. i can fake for a while, and even get myself into a circle of "friends". but they always can tell that there's something weird about me, and never really bond with me at all. hell just last week a club that i'm in had a Christmas party where they invite EVERYONE in the club. i was the only one not to get the invite, and i only know that it happend because i saw people talking about it in the clubs group chat the day after.

had sex with one girl in my entire life...in highschool.. and after about a week she kicked me aside and started dating some dude for the next 4 years. she just used me.

no one has ever loved me.

 my family is poor for me failing out of college is really going to fuck me up (70k+ in debt).

at this point even if i switched places with someone who was perfect and didnt have my issues it would take them decades to repair this shit. but with all my issues repairing is impossible. the end game for me here is ill live alone, poor and on disability,  wishing i could connect with someone until i put a shotgun in my mouth. so whats the point of the delay?
