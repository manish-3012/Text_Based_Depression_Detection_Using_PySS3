just need a friend :/hi so i'd like to preface this by saying that nothing significantly terrible has happened recently; i am not diagnosed with anything; and this feeling is an on &amp; off thing that's been going since a year ago. i don't feel like killing myself but if i wouldn't mind if i died, you know. i don't really have a lot of self esteem--my friends have slowly but surely distanced themselves from me and the ones that did stay, we're not super close to the point where i feel comfortable talking about this (then again, i don't enjoy talking about my emotions). i like gaming, learning, and writing yet i don't have raw and genuine fun with them like i used to. i also have career plans (i want to become a detective or something similar) but idk, it feels so far. idk i guess i just need a hug and something to keep me going. what im trying to say is, i wouldnt mind if i died right now

sorry for rambling and the large block of text :(
