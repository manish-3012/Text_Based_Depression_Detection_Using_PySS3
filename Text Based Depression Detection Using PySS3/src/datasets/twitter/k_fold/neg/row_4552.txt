I've been thinking about ways to kill myself since last nightMy boyfriend said some hurtful things to me and I feel so worthless. The love of my life hates me and I don't want to be alive anymore.

I used to have a gun, but I stupidly told my mom where it was. So now my best option is not an option anymore. I had a whole plan and everything. I would go to the park late at night and do it there. It's surrounded by houses far enough that they couldn't see anything (especially in the dark) but close enough to hear gun shot. Only the responding officers would see me and I'd die somewhere that I really enjoyed. I guess I fucked that up.

I have razor blades but I don't want to be in pain at all and I don't like blood. Also, if it backfires, which it probably will because I know I can't do it, I also have low blood sugar so I'd probably just lay on the ground in pain, unable to move, slowly bleeding out. So I don't think i'll do that one.

I was thinking about driving my car into a wall or flipping it on the highway. I don't want to hurt anyone. It's also a brand new Honda so i'm sure no matter what I did I would walk away. I don't have any other car available to me. I'm still thinking about it, but I'd have to really plan this one out to get it right.

I've been thinking about hanging myself all day. I read that it only takes a few seconds. It sounds so nice and comforting. I'd call the police first, then lock my door. I'm not sure where I could tie the rope though. I don't know what else to do.

I'm trying to think of reasons to live and I can't really think of any 

I also told him earlier that I was feeling suicidal and he didn't really say anything. I feel like useless garbage
