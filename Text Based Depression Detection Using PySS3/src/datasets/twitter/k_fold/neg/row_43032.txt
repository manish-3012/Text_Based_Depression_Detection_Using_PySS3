Iâ€™m kind of at a loss for words now.. i donâ€™t know how to explain what Iâ€™m feelingAnyone live in Houston? I moved back and donâ€™t have any friends here.. my fiancÃ©e left me, took my dog, and now i live back with my parents.. needless to say i could use some positive people in my life right now..
