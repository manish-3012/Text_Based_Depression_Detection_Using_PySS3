- first timehello,

so  I thought  about writing on here since I have no other place nor do I have people to express it to.

these thoughts began about 6-7 years ago and they have been getting louder. I never attempted, although did in my own mind. 

I just feel like I've been and will be running on the spot my whole life bearing all this heavy pain on me. 

I feel like one day, I might let go of it all.

 thanks for taking the time to reply, even to read and sorry if this seems a bit too vague or cryptic, have a hard time expressing myself since I rarely do.
