Staying off antidepressants helped me see the situation how it really is (17)A few months ago, my therapist referred me to a psychiatrist who later diagnosed me with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) after fessing up about my suicidal ideation as a means of coping with my worries. The thought that I always had an escape button in case things got too bad calmed me down in a weird way.  


Anyway, my psychiatrist prescribed Sertraline to helped me deal with my symptoms...and my mood really went uphill from there. However, I still had moments where I fantasized about suicide. My girlfriend, who had supported me all this time, decided to break up (rightly so) because my emotions had become so volatile. My mood for school and academics in general also plummeted. I felt as bad as I did before I started taking my antidepressants.   


A few days ago, I ran out of pills and decided not to buy more to see how I'd cope. Even though I feel absolutely horrible, I can see my life without a rose-tinted lens. My grades are horrible and I might have to repeat my year; I keep telling myself I'll study but never do because I am lazy and worthless. My repeated panic attacks will never cease and I will never help me secure a stable relationship. I am a disappointment to those around me and killing myself would only exacerbate my burdensomeness. But I feel like I'm out of options. If I don't kill myself asap i'll just be setting myself up for more failure. I'll never amount to anything and I never felt like pressing the escape button so much in my entire life.  


This catch-22 situation has left me crying myself to sleep on a daily basis ever since I stopped taking my pills. I can take them again, but should I really be masking my situation? I feel lost.
