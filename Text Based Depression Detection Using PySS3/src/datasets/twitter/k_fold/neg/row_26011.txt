I'm turning 30 tomorrow.I always get the birthday blues. I usually just cry. People make me feel like shit for not wanting to celebrate. I was able to handle last year okay when I was medicated. I'm off my medication right now because I'm pregnant with twins... I just found out yesterday that they're boys. I have an 8 year old. My thoughts make me want to sometimes just disappear forever but sometimes flat out blow my brains out. 

I have PTSD from a lifetime of abuse... I posted some memories that popped up earlier. I was hoping that just getting those memories out in written form would help me but it hasn't. :(
