camhs experience?today i had my first assessment with camhs (child and adolescent mental health services) and was officially diagnosed with severe depression but they really want to break my confidentiality and tell my parents about my suicide attempt and thoughts, I really do not want them to because I do not trust that my parents would be understanding and so i'm absolutely terrified that they'll call my parents and not let me know before. what can i do? I'm 17 so legally they can't tell them without breaking my consent right?? I dont quite understand how it works
