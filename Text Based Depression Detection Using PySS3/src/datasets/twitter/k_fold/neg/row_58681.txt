If I donâ€™t have a purpose I might as have no point in going onWhen I was 16, a junior in high school, I barely figured out what I want to do with my life. I wanted to help out my people out on the Navajo reservation, support the other parts of my family that isnâ€™t doing to good, and have a stable life with a good circle of friends. 

I went to school after graduating because I couldnâ€™t get into any good schools because of my gpa was horrible, and didnâ€™t know how to get to my life goals. 

Iâ€™m now 18 with only one class in my second semester at a community college, because I failed all five of classes the previous semester, I was not able to take a class and was dropped from it, put on academic probation, dropped from another class, and now failing my only class. 

After all that I decided to think about alternatives because college is not for me. I thought about a trade school. Nope. Too expensive, strict, and just expect to much from me. 

Iâ€™m not from a great background. I grew up in south Los Angeles during the early 2000â€™s. Which was just starting to calm down from the 90â€™s. So I seen and heard a lot of stuff, met a lot of people, did a lot of things. Most Iâ€™m will never talk about. Not to my best friends, family, or even therapists. 

I know how easy it is to get money and I start to think about. Almost tempted to. Then willing to. And just when I was about to act on it. I see them. My nieces and nephews that ask me to play with them, my friends and family that ask me to hang out with them, and I think about them and I remember my goals. 

After all that I begin to wonder if Iâ€™ll ever amount to anything. I wonder if Iâ€™m even supposed to be here. I think about how everything wouldâ€™ve been if I was just like my brothers and sisters that didnâ€™t make it out because of my father. I used to think I was lucky for that. But nope. Iâ€™m just a burden. My mom was successful. Not anymore now. 

Now Iâ€™m thinking I should just end it. Because itâ€™s hard. Finding a job is hard. School is hard. Life is hard. 

The problem right now though is the hardest. How? How should I do it? Should I grab my gun? My knife? Take every single pill in the house? Drink myself there? Drive up the mountains? Start a fight with the wrong person? Take something some dude just gives me? I donâ€™t know what to do. Which should I do? 

Because everything is so hard right now. And everything isnâ€™t for me. Is living for me. I donâ€™t think so. 

I think Iâ€™m going to try the drinking one though. So if anyone is taking theirs. I see you there. If not then I guess Iâ€™ll see you all here tomorrow.
