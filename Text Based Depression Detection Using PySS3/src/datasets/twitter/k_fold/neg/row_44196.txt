I really want to kill myselfI want to die so badly. It's so simple but I can't bring myself to do it. 

I hate myself so much. I'm an awful person with nothing left to live for. I don't know why I keep going. I'm just terrified of death. I'm scared that there is a God out there and that I'll be sent to the worst there is. 

My parents know nothing about how I feel. I can't bring myself to tell them. It's terrifying. I don't want to see them sad. 

I haven't cut myself in a while but the urge to do it is getting so much stronger. I just want to die without me killing myself.
