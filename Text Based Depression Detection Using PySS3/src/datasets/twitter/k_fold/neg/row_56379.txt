I'm broken. Nothing is ever enough, but I keep smiling.I feel so alone even when surrounded by people. I put too much weight into a seemingly unattainable romantic relationship and I'm miserable.

I have people who love me. I have family, I have friends, I have a good career, but nothing is ever enough. I'm broken.

In the last week, I've had my heart broken, I've been stood up, and I've been humiliated at a bar by some random girl who was feigning interest. I don't know what's inherently wrong with me other than I'm depressed, anxious, and awkward... I guess that's enough to do it. I'm 22 and have never been a relationship. Outside of that, I've never even had sex.

The shitty part is I don't even know how to get experience. Every girl I talk to runs away when they realize I have no idea what I'm doing. I just want to feel the love that comes from being in a romantic relationship. My friends have suggested that I get an escort to help. They personally know one that is apparently sweet, affectionate, and gorgeous, but I just can't do it. It's not real. I actually want someone to WANT to have sex with me, not because I paid them. I'm so far behind I'll never catch up.

I wake up everyday and think about killing myself. I get this pain and anger inside of me that I don't know how to alleviate other than harming myself or destroying things around me. Though every time I do the latter, it doesn't work and I feel more empty than before. Recently it's gotten so bad I can't think of anyway to feel better other than killing myself.

It all just hurts too much. I keep going because I'm afraid of what my death would do to other people. Like I said I should be happy with what I have, I should be grateful. I've tried so hard to be focused on the good and be happy, but no matter what I can't. So here I am, I try to smile and not bring others down, but it's killing me. I'll never get better. I'm broken.
