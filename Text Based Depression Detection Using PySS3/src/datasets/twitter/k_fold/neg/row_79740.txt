Would like to talk to someone...I'm just going to ramble and hope it takes me somewhere... I've never really had many friends, and no girls (not a virgin though :D) but as of late (last 2-3 years) I have really been trying to improve myself. I lost weight (my freshman year of college I lost 60 pounds, though I weighed like 230 to begin with), cleaned up, dressed nice, the whole nine yards. I have had quite bad luck in the past (I once asked a coworker for her number and, no joke, she never came back to work) and I have only once managed to get to a first date, out of about 20 people, and that was the last last date. This year has been especially difficult, as I have been rejected about 8 times in the last month. Now, this typically isn't that much of a problem, because I just push the thought out of my mind, but this year I am living in a 2 bedroom apartment with my roommate who has loud, rambunctious sex 3-5 times a day. He is my best friend, and I have asked him several times if he could perhaps wait until I was out (I am frequently), or just do it slightly less. I can't escape the sound! I also miss hanging out with him, because now all of his time is spent with her. As stated before, I don't really have many friends, and I just want to be a part of some group.
Well, now I am crying, so this will be extra embarrassing when he comes out :/ 

TL;DR -- I whine a lot.
