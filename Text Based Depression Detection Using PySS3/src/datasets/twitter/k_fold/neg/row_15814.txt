Iâ€™m doneI think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself soon. These past few weeks and months have just been horrible. And I donâ€™t feel as though Iâ€™m not gonna get any better any time soon. I have no confidence in myself at all. My self esteem levels are just so so low. And at this point idek what to do. Iâ€™ve tried to tell myself that everything is helping me when it really isnâ€™t. I havenâ€™t been myself in years. Iâ€™m 14 and itâ€™s this hard to live especially with myself. Iâ€™m a teen girl who has nothing and feels as though damn near the entire world hater her. Nobody knows the date or time I think Iâ€™ve come up with to go through with this. Idk what I wanna do yet but I have an idea. Cause Iâ€™m just so done with this life stuff. I donâ€™t even feel loved. Iâ€™m just so worthless and ugly. More words to be said I just hate myself so fucking much.
