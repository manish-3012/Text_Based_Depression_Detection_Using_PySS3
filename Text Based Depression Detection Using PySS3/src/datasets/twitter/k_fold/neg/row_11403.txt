Why, Just a question I can't answer myself.I don't talk to those around me about Why, I want to be in an accident, be in a place where where there is a murderer, feel useless and unwanted.

I have thought about this for years and it has only gotten worse lately. What is making it get worse now? Being paid the amount for one job but doing one that is two steps above the job I am paid for. Being passed over for jobs I applied for within the company I work for. Either do not receive callbacks or even acknowledged for jobs I have applied for.

I fell like no one really needs or wants me. I have no friends and I do not care for my coworkers even though I act like I do. I continue to mess up as my self worth drops lower and lower as things keep being held over my head and then moved and I follow them like a horse with a carrot. 

When I am driving or alone all I think about is what if this or that happened. Would my family be able to be debt free and happy if it was accidental death or dismemberment? Since when did this become my norm, and why?

I do not know if I am writing this as a question or just getting it off my chest.
