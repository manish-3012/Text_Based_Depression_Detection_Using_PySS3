AngryI'm just very angry. I've never been an angry person. I've always been sad and depressed. But I realize now how angry I've been and how I've been turning my anger in on myself. I am angry at my doctors. I am angry at the way I was treated like an animal in the hospital. I am angry at people who have hurt me. 

But I have to acknowledge that they might not have meant to hurt me but it somehow makes it worse. If someone punched me I would feel justified in feeling hurt and angry. But when someone hurts you through ignorance then how are you supposed to feel?

I've just been numbing myself. I keep myself numb all day so I can't feel the hurt or the pain. I'm afraid to go out anymore for fear something will trigger a panic attack. When my emotions get out of control I'm afraid of what I might say. I get so angry I want to scream. I'm afraid of saying something that might hurt my family. I'm afraid of going on Facebook and telling off all my friends. I'm afraid if I see my doctor again I'm going to scream at him for driving me insane. I'm just on the verge of losing it and if I don't kill myself I'm going to ruin what's left of my life.
