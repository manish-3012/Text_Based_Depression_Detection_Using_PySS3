I don't know how much longer I can goFor 18 years I've fought mis/underdiagnosed mental illnesses. For 18 years I've tried and failed to do what everyone else does so easily. Turns out I have borderline personality disorder (and depression and anxiety). It's ruined my life. The things that I've done because of it have hurt everyone I love. My wife is holding on, but it's so strained and uneasy that it makes my skin crawl. She says she loves me but never hugs or kisses me. Never snuggles up to me. My kids hate me. I can give 100% effort and, because of my depression, it looks like I haven't tried or tat I don't care. So here I am, 36, unable to do the things I need to do to show my wife I love her, unable to be loved because I have failed at everything, and have no one to talk to about it all. So I sit and fantasize about the feeling I had the last time I tried to kill myself, when the pills all kicked in and I was warm and calm and serene. So I sit and look at photos of people who have committed suicide. And I wonder how much longer I can go. 

There is, obviously, some part of me that doesn't want to die. Or I wouldn't talk about it. I'm scared. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm not going to do anything soon. Even if I do it, I have a lot to do before. But, my God, I'm exhausted and so unbearably sad, and I just want to be loved and to be accepted even though I have nothing to offer anyone. Or I want it to be over.
