22M Gonna go Robin Williams myselfI just cant see a reason to live anymore, My AME wont let me be a pilot, and the FAA have pretty much grounded me, I just really dont see a reason to live.

Why is it so easy to buy a gun in this country, yet If I want to soar among the clouds saying fuck you to gravity I'm looked down upon.

All I wanted is freedom, I guess I can gain the ultimate freedom in death though Freedom from existing.
