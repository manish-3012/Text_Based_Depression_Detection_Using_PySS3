I'm tiredI'm 21.

Would have been considered smart a few years ago, but living has eaten my mind away. Got into a good university. Failed 1st year, retook it after getting mitigating circumstances for depression. Got ill (physically) at the beginning of my 2nd year, doctors couldn't figure out what it was, no mitigating circumstances. I failed again. Spent most of this year recovering, getting myself okay. Exams in 3 days, which I'm gonna fail, and I'll be kicked out.

I've spent 4 years in university, only passed one. Made my parents spend thousands on me, giving them hopes that I couldn't follow through on.

I'm just tired. I'm just really tired. I just want to lie down, go to sleep, and not wake up. The only thing I can think about is the sharp knife 7 steps away from me.
