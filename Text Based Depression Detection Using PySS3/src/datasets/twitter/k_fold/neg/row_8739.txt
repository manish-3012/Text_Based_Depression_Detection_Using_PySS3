silenti'm freaking out in a very large way and if you saw me, you'd never know it because i'm so good at masking my body is cracking. 

i feel ashamed for all the things done to me. i feel ashamed for being alive.

i feel ashamed for being angry. i feel ashamed for caring. i feel ashamed for love.

i feel ashamed to breathe. how can i feel these things and still want to live?

i am living, but it doesn't feel good. it feels like drowning every second of every day.

telling me i'm wrong for these feelings only adds to the shame, so pile more on.

it just makes me feel more ashamed for feeling and even more for sharing.

it gets to the point where my logic overrides my reason and asks what the fuck are you doing?

why are you even here? what's the point of this? you're a fucking idiot for even trying.

i feel shame for feeling shame. i feel shame for hurting. my head starts to chant

i'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorryi'msorry

the words don't even make sense. they're just a raging storm trying to overwhelm me with horror and guilt and shame and rage and hurt and confusion and why?

i don't know. i don't know why. i didn't ask for any of this, so why do i have to be here? 

i don't want to talk. i can't talk. there's no point. i tried, but the words are never right. they never say what i mean because i don't talk like them. i'm in the wrong fucking world and it hurts and i want to go home please fuck let me come home i'm sorry
