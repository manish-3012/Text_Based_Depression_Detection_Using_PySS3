Feeling hopeless and lost...I stood in my garage two days ago, on a chair with a rope around my neck. My life is literally flashing before my eyes. I'm crying so hard.... I let my weight fall so that I could feel the rope tighten around my neck. I don't know why I did that, maybe just to feel that one last bit of pain.... It feels like all I feel is pain these days.... My reasons for contemplating suicide seem so trivial when I stop and think about them but they are do very painful to me. I just couldn't kick the chair out from under me. This also made me feel like a coward and another thing I failed at. I took the rope off my neck and walked into my house trying to just make sense of what just happened.  I am afraid that I will continue to have these recurring feelings and I will carry through at some point. I am so sad.... Life has lost meaning..... Nothing is fun and nothing to look forward too. I don't even know why I'm writing this.... I can almost anticipate the posts to follow. Maybe just a weird way of getting it off my chest and reaching out.....
