Actually, feel betterAfter reading this forum (or how do you call this Reddit thingy?) for one week i started to feel way better about my life situation... It's like... All those people and their REAL problems, like losing someone or having a debt or unsuccessful attempt of killing themselves, my problems does not stand any near to these. I started to realise that my life isn't that bad after all... Even though im still in pain and depression, for now i feel a lot better, like in general. Too bad it doesn't change all the bad things around and hopefully i will finish myself this weekend but... Yeah, untill then im totally fine. Gotta listen to Muse and read some more now.
