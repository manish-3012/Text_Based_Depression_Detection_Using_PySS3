I'm so ashamedI've been accused of plagiarism for a second time during the course of one year due to sloppy citations, despite me working really hard to improve, and I just feel so ashamed that I want to die. I normally work 2 or 3 jobs at a time but this year I made it possible to only focus on university and for what? Poor marks and plagiarism. I don't sleep and haven't slept in days. Sometimes I stay up close to 72 hours in a row because I'm so anxious I just weep for hours. If my parents knew the full story they'd be so ashamed of me. My fiance probably hates me for all I've put him through this year with university and planning our wedding. I just can't cope with it all. I've officially broken and I'm done. I almost threw myself in front of a train yesterday because I hate everything inside my brain and it won't go away... I'm such a massive loser. I knew I couldn't cut it at the postgraduate level :(
