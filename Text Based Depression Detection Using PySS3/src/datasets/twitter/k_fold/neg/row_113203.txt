worthless.No drama. I've just come to the conclusion that i'd be better off out of it. Apart from my mum, literally nobody would give a toss if I was gone tomorrow. And i cant disagree. I must be a horrible person, all my life I've been nice to folk, just been a normal person and have got virtually nothing in return, except for contempt. Most days i go to bed and wake up thinking it would be best if I wasn't subjecting the wider world to my existence. I'm pretty much set on how it's going to happen, it really is just a question of when. Like a train thundering through the night, you don't know when it will reach you, but you know it's coming, and eventually it will hit you. Sometimes its hours away, sometime it's minutes.
