"So, how has 2020 been for you?"~~Oh, you know. Aside from my mental health constantly deteriorating and my parents not giving two shits about it all while trying to force me to hurry up and work. The constant stress, dysphoria, and depression making me want to go back to harmful days or even increasing my suicidal thoughts. Or how i wake up every morning wishing i didn't. Or how i'm always on the verge or breaking down only to stop myself so i don't get yelled at by my family. Or having to constantly listening to my family argue about whatever the hell is on the news all while yelling at me if i even try to say anything. Or how every time i look in the mirror, i feel like crying. The thoughts of 'god, i wish i was dead' and 'if only i could just stop existing' constantly flood my head.~~
