First year of high school, and I'm on the verge of suicide.Sorry if I get ranty, but this is the only way I can expel emotions without cracking someone's head open.

I've always been an independent person, because my classmates treated me that way. I have schizoid personality disorder, as a result of being an outcast and having to adapt to being one.

I've never been social either. Middle school was the time I dropped off into antisocial behavior.

My only true friend has left the school and now I'm left with borderline autistic 14 year olds.

The big dick mcgees always make fun of me for their extra brownie points, and very few kids think I'm alright because I'm not doing anything.

Half the school day is thinking about suicide from the amount of work that has been put on me. The work usually consists of 3 hours+ homework a night, but I've been a procrastinator all my life and the think of the work gives me a migrane. It's bleeding into my private life, and the last thing I want is for it to bleed into my private life.

It doesn't help either that my grandmother makes me and my mother mow the lawn every month just about, and do dinner every night.

Life doesn't even feel real. I'm not exaggerating when everything feels bland and color looks gray.
