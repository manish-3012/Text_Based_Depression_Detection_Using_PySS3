Never thought I'd come this close to ending it. I think this is it.I put together a suicide method a few days ago I think should work. I can't believe I'm typing that. I really think this is it. I'm going to be 34 soon. I live in a two bedroom apartment with my Mom: she had to move in with me when she lost her house and couldn't keep up with her mortgage payments. Needed somewhere to live. It's not her fault, but it's also such a brutal situation. It's like moving back home but in reverse. My Dad was a paranoid schizophrenic and alcoholic, and died of cancer when I was young. I have memories of my brother and I tying his shoes together under our giant oak dining room table while he was wasted, so he couldn't get us during his psychotic moments. It was like a traumatic childhood slapstick routine.

I know at one point he was holding a knife in one hand and me in the other when I was a baby and I wish he'd have done me in then, so I didn't have to deal with the mind and life that came afterward. I've always been so poor and to have my own Mom have to move in with me just really emphasized that for me. How unusual and difficult my life has been compared to my peers. She doesn't treat me badly at all, but it's not exactly ideal at nearly 34 years old. I feel so trapped. I feel like this should be more eloquent, in case there's some advice, or something I'm not seeing to allow me hope, but I can barely string thoughts together, and follow the strands that led me here.

I still technically have friends but I had what I can only describe as a massive breakdown and stopped talking to them almost three months ago, and basically everyone except my Mom, and that's because I have to talk to her. I felt like there was so much pressure on me: my life is pretty sad - it's not where I want it to be - and updating them on it felt grueling because I was so lost. I was working remotely for a startup company in SF. It paid better than any entry level job I could get in real life, but the isolation was absolutely killing me. Ironically I've just isolated myself even more. It was completely counter-intuitive to just stop working and not even have money, but I also assumed the weekend I'd stopped that I'd end it. Instead, I've been frozen for almost three months. 

I have one very good friend I was about to go in on an art space with at that time - we'd been working on a music project and doing art, but I just couldn't take my situation anymore. The music project wasn't really going anywhere, which in a way was fine (I never was banking on fame or fortune from it) since it was something to do, but at the same time felt increasingly crazy to be investing my time into. I honestly don't know what I'm investing my time into at all. I did talk to him a few weeks ago like I was going to get back into things, but then dropped right back off again. Friends have texted and I just haven't answered - I felt unable to say anything: to say, basically, I'd stopped working or trying and was considering ending it. I'm hurting or frightening them I'm sure. It's gotten to the point now that it's clearly going to feel strange to talk and the air would have to be cleared just to hang out. I've ended up doing nothing all day, except feel completely lost and frozen. 

I see no way back to a life. I can't imagine working online again, alone, but I also can't see just getting a low-wage job here in the city (it's a big one - want to remain anonymous though) just to be social, but not saving money at all, or being able to just keep up with car repairs and whatever else. I also feel like there's no way to meet somebody living with my Mom. She's making enough to move out, so I could get a roommate, but I'd just be working online all day and they'd have to witness my shattered life. Or I could move into my own place maybe, and I'd be living alone, working remotely. I know I can work in coffee shops and so on, but I'd still feel alone. I'm also $50k in debt with terrible credit, so I'd look sketchy to renters. 

I'd like to get back into learning programming, but then I'm working remotely all day and learning programming, alone, at night. I've made websites for people in the past for money, I've done it a bit for fun, and so it legitimately could be a career, where I could work on art and writing and whatever outside of it. I could do a bootcamp but I need to save money to do that over several months and then that would take like six months, but at least would be social. The best way to save money? Working remotely. 

I don't know if I can suck it up and do that. As it was, it became increasingly difficult to go out and be social, when my home and work life was so fucking strange. Or maybe it's not in this day and age? I don't know. I can't tell if I'm just not seeing straight. I feel like I'm 30 feet underwater. Getting back into life, and stepping away from this precipice, I'd still have to live with "that one time I cut everyone off for three months." 

I'm so far away from the life I was struggling to have, however difficult, growing up extremely poor. I just don't see how I can get out of this. I don't know how to fight my way out.
