Why shouldn't I kill myself, why should Ifuck this "you matter" bullshit. what are the pros and cons of jumping off my 9 story roof and landing head first on the pavement. and just listing negatives might be the fastest way to discredit yourselves. the whole "life is strictly worth it" attitude is fucking disgusting, i need an objective comparison, pros and cons. fuck the strict positivity and optimism, it's sickening. i'm not finding any weighted arguments not to, and i'm planning on doing it within an hour or so
