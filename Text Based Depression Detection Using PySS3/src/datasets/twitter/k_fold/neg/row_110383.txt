Being pathetic is surprisingly comfortableI mean, people don't expect much of you, neither do you, so one is able to passively exist and... that's all. Not even a need to worry about anything. Sometimes I feel like pathetic people aren't exactly expected to live, so if such a person ceases to exist, it's, uh, it shouldn't be anything more than a slight problem for others?..
Such thoughts do in fact bring me comfort. And tears, but mainly comfort. I feel like I can freely go.
