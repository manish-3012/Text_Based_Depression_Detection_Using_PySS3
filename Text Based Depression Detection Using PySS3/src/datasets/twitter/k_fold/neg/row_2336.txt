I'm worried I'm going to hurt myselfHope it's okay to post this here. I don't normally hang around this part of reddit, and I just googled for this kind of sub.

Things are not going so well for me here. In my usual way I made things much worse with things I said to my wife and someone else this evening.

I feel a gut-wrenching loneliness, hopelessness, and despair. I want my life to be over.

Thanks for reading.
