Do my family deserve to feel the pain of my death?I've been depressed probably my entire life. Of course I wasn't diagnosed till I was 16. No one has cared for me my entire life. Even though I lived with my Mom, she just ignored me most of the time. When I was having really bad problems in school with bullying, depression, and anger, she didn't do anything or even talk with me about any of it. It got so bad that I made my self throw up almost twice a week in 2nd grade so I could go home sick. My father also ignored it with drinking and really was a glorified baby sitter that didn't care about my needs at all, or just yelled at me for not doing "good enough". My brothers also don't seem to care about me trying to kill myself before or anything. So since no one cares, I think sometimes they deserve to be in pain for messing me up my entire life. Even now they constantly ignores me even though I am in so much pain and do ask for help. It's either "I don't know what to do." or "We'll figure it out." and but really, they just want me to go away. 
The only reason I stay alive is because I don't want people to be sad. But I have nothing going for me AT ALL. I feel like nothing good has ever happened to me. My whole life is just piling on more shame and sadness and failure and insecurity and anger year after year. I'm a complete loser and failure, I can barely function at all, I'm definitely not living a life. There really is nowhere else to go but to die. Except people trap me in because they'd be sad, but then they don't ever try to help ease my pain. That's why I think they deserve it.
