Iâ€™m alone, hated, and forgotten about.Iâ€™ve lived a short 21 years on Earth. Each year wasnâ€™t ever comparable to many random people I see every day. I was born with several medical conditions, I inherited the severe depression and mental disorders, and I inherited every gene that turned out to only make things worse. Iâ€™m sure with a lot of effort and push from myself that I could be where I want to be. The fact is no matter how hard I try I never can complete a task or goal.

Thereâ€™s one after another mistake I made every day of my life. No matter what my options are I can only make a decision that becomes a mistake. 

Iâ€™ve had enough. Iâ€™m tired of being my own victim and other peopleâ€™s target. Life is 1/4-1/3 over and all I have to show is disappointment and mistakes I shouldnâ€™t have made. 

I wish I knew what to do years ago but honestly I was never gonna love long. Iâ€™m refusing any type of support or hotline. That is not necessary at this point as the process to peace already is moving.
