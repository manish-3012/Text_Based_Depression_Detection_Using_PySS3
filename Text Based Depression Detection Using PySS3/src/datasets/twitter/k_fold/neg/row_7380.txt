I just cant anymoreI am 24 years old and have been suicidal since i was 15 or so. Everytime i was faced with a overwhelming challange my mind goes straight through â€œhow about we just die?â€. Never acted on it obviously but i can say without a doubt that i think about killing myself at least 5 times a day on avarage. And things are worse than ever. I work 66 hours a week for 6 days. Customer representitive. Jesus fuck. You would say im lying if i told you what kind of morons i deal with on a daily basis. Trying to stay calm to a person who is literally screaming and swearing to you is exhausting. Im never offended but i wanna fight, scream back and humiliate the shit out them but all im supposed to say is â€œYes sir you are right to be mad.â€. Every night i genuienly hope i dont wake up. I literally fucking beg not wake up to a god that i dont believe in every single day. 
How can i be expected to enjoy life find the happiness in small things or whatever. 
I dont have the guts now but i cant do this anymore. 

yes everyone is right. Im weak. i cant handle stressful situations. i cant provide. I keep losing the battle to my depression. 

everyone around me is used to their life cycle and they always handle their problems but all i can do is fucking not talk and not smile for weeks. And my negative behaviour hurts my family and close friends. And then i feel guilty for feeling this way. whenever i try to open up people tell me to man up. God. Really? what a solution you got there. I cant man up. im weak, im tired, im numb. But when â€œthatâ€ day comes, i will be the selfish one, while all i wanted was to be calm and peaceful. I will be the one responsible to not reach up to them. I will be the one to scar them for their entire lives. 
to sum up im in extreme mental pain and no psyhciartist could help one bit.
