Feels like I have a crisis every day! But I could swear I'm not depressedWell I feel like I am but not that much. I never really cry or feel THAT sad but I just know I want to die so so much. But my parents and sisters will have to suffer for a while if I go. 

I have like an existential crisis everyday and I really can't be bothered to get help. I'm waiting to feel shitty enough to end myself. I don't think any of this *really* matters. 

I'm in bed right now, just watching YouTube and typing this. I feel as average as can be but this **feeling** I just want to fucking DIE. I really don't appreciate the way I turned out :( If I could be bothered I'd get help, but it's just so much effort. I started on sertraline for a month and just went cold turkey because I couldn't be bothered to get prescription. Never felt any side effects from stopping. Legitimately I'm not even sad. I'm not sure what's wrong with me. 

I have made a lot of positive changes, flipped my way of thinking of many things. I no longer fear being lonely and I feel content with many things. But I know for sure I want to die! I'm so confused. Someone PM and ask me some shit just to give me some attention until I no longer feel this way. 

There's so much I want to get off my chest, I even forget what I wanted to say. There's definitely a reason for this post but for the life of me I can't remember. Or something I definitely wanted to say. Brain machine broke.
