My suicide attemptI tried hanging myself again.
The first time I did it, was probably my closest to success. I wrapped a scarf around my neck in my closet and kicked the stool from under my feet. I remember the immediate extreme pressure in my head, and the scratches on my neck that  I felt from the scarf. I remember being surprised by how much uncomfortable pressure I felt. 

At this point  I am now fully hanging from my neck. My immediate reaction was to use my hands to pull at the scarf to relieve the pressure but that scarf wasnâ€™t going anywhere. I then tried to use my dangling feet to reach the stool that I had previously kicked away. I could just reach it as it fell on an angle next to my garbage can. I stepped back onto the stool, caught my breath, then looked in the mirror. 

My face was purple,with cuts/redness on my neck with tears in my eyes. I was only hanging for  probably 5 seconds but it felt like an eternity. 

I only wish I couldâ€™ve completed my mission
