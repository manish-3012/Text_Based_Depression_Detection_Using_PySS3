I don't want to be here anymoreI'm just tired of everything. It's a never ending cycle of depression. I feel good for a couple of days and then I end up here again. I'm just tired of this cycle and having to be strong. How many times am I gonna have go through this. It's so exhausting. I know a lot of people have told me it gets better but I've been here so long that I don't believe that anymore. I'm not gonna do anything but each day it gets harder not to want to.
