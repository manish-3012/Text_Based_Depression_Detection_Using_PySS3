I'm worth more dead than aliveMy SGLI (Servicemember's Group Life Insurance: basically life insurance for US military members) has come through.

I am now officially worth more dead than alive.

My wife is my benificiary. She'd get a cool $300,000 lump sum, if I iced myself today.

I have a very tough decision to make.
