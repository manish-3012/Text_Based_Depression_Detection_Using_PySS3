Betterhelp cost too much for something I'm not sure will work. So I'll try you guysHey. I'll be honest with you. I don't know if this will work or if you can help me. But I'm quite desperate for something to feel better. So here goes. A little piece of my story.

So to begin with. My story has two sides to it. My family, and my friends. I was quite happy a few years back. Maybe around 2014ish that began to change. I essentially continued a rejection street from some girls. Not the kind of rejection at the bar where you just try to get lucky. The kind where I was friends with them and build a long relationship with. To say the least, I no longer have any idea how boyfriend/girlfriend relationship work. I no longer see my self capable of that. And still, I think I have feelings for my workpartner. And I just don't know how all that will go down. I already have a good sense she does not see me that way. But I just can't bring myself to accept that. I'm also a virgin, however I personally don't mind. I feel like I long for physical connection and compassion more than sex. I feel like saying you're a virgin is more a call for physical affection then sex. I, of course, have more to say about friends and girls. But I think that is more than enough to get started.

Now over to the family part. 2 years ago my parents got divorced. Common story. I personally did not take it too bad. I saw it coming some time before it happend, so I got prepared for it. However every one else took it way worse than me. Might be because I felt quite bad before, so it did not tip the scales as much as it did for everyone else. What did do me in though was trying to help everyone else while I felt like shit myself. I have become quite apathetic to my family because of it. But resently my father tried to commit suicide. I often thought about taking my own life. It comes and goes. Some times it gets at bad as thinking about it everyday and other times I don't think about it for months. And one of the things that always me sure I never did. Aside from being to cowardly to kill myself. Was the thought of how my family and friends would react. I often told myself that no one would care. But I know deep down that it might tip my father past the egde. And now that he already has tried once. I'm even more sure that I might've been right. I still hate having to try and keep my family together, but I don't have it in me to cut contact. And that's a good start on the family side.

I'm sure that's more than enough to dig in to. So please ask away. I'm an open book if it helps me
