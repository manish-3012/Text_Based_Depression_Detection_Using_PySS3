I canâ€™t do anything rightI kept telling myself that I was gonna wait till at least December to kill myself but I just want to right now. I canâ€™t do anything right in anybodyâ€™s eyes. I just disappoint everyone and I constantly want to die. 

Iâ€™m so frustrated because I donâ€™t have access to anything that could (with a high chance of success) kill me though. I feel helpless. I donâ€™t even have the power to take my own life and itâ€™s so frustrating.
