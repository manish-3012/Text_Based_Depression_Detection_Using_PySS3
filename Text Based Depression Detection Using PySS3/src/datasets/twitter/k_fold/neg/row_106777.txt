all of my dreams are dead, why am i still herelike when things are bad and i have real feelings it's agonizing. it's painful

but then i get used to it for a while and numb to the shock and even in those moments of like reprieve from the worst of it it's like, 

the best it gets is still like a daunting, unsettling awkwardness. like i'm just not supposed to be here, the store is closed and they locked the doors and i'm still in here what the fuck am i doing in here? what's wrong with me?

it's like a nightmare and that horrible feeling of like, "what can even happen now? where do i go what do i do how did i end up here how'd this happen? it's all over do i even have anywhere to go after this?" but like, without the part where you wake up and feel relieved that it wasn't real life and there's still hope, still options. bleh
