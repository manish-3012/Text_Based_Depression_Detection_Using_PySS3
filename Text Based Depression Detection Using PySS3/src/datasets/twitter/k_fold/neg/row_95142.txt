I don't know what to do anymore. Need help.I've been going through a really rough time recently and I don't know how much longer I can do it. I've been thinking a lot about suicide. Even though I have a lot of friends, and I'm doing okay in school, at 23 I feel like my life has no direction anymore. I don't have a degree or anything and I'm really struggling financially. I over drafted my account today to put gas in my car. My friends and family only want to hear so much before they interject and give me their side of what they think would make it better. The truth is I'm just really unhappy with myself. I don't know what to do. sigh.
