Suicide Note. What do you think?My name is Austin. Iâ€™m 20 years old and aboriginal. My final few days were spent drinking. A Mickey a night. And then a big bottle the final night. 5 nights in a row. Iâ€™m doing this because the stress of sustaining or even beginning a career has become to much. 

I donâ€™t even know what Iâ€™m doing with my life anymore. I canâ€™t even say much about how I feel anymore. Itâ€™s just pain. Numbness, regret, sorrow, guilt. 

Itâ€™s always â€œIâ€™ll stop drinking tomorrowâ€. Tomorrow is the day that never comes for me. 

*Figure Iâ€™d make some separate notes here for some of my friends*
