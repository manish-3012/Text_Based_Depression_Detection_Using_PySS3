Should I tell?I went the furthest I'd ever gone. I started climbing out the window of my 11th story apartment. I backed out because I was scared and then my bf found me. This is definitely the worst it's ever been, and I don't know if I should tell the other people in my life. I dont want to be that person whose just "crying for help." I really only have 1 good friend and my mom, but I dont want to worry them or have them look at me differently. Is my bf know enough? Or should i tell my mom/best friend?
