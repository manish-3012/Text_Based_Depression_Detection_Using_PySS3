I've fucked upHello guys. I'm writing to tying y'all once again.

This time I fucked up very hard.

So... In November I started dating a girl from my work, I know I shouldn't do it but I really liked her. I've dated another girl from that same job and it didn't end up well. But I started dating this new girl anyway. We were liking each other. I think she even was in love with me. But I hidded a STD from her, and last week I told her. We had sex multiple times without protection and she couldn't handle what I've done. She wasn't mad only because I might haveade her sick. But because I hidded it.

I know it's all my fault, and I blame myself for it really bad. I'm done of being this selfish asshole that can't think about other and how my actions can hurt people. I've hurt some many people in my life, my parents, my friends... I'm done with that. I thought I was changing but I'm not. I don't think I ever will.

My close friends told me how everyone makes mistakes and it will get better. I should use this to learn and never do that again. But I can't. I can't live knowing what I've done.

I really hope she is not sick, and I don't think she is. But the fact that I hidded it, and the fact that I hurt the most amazing girl I've ever met suffocates me. I just can't handle the fact that I fucked up not only my life, but also the life of the one loved
