VentI feel silly for needing to post on reddit.
And for the most part my problems feel superficial but it didn't stop me from trying to cut yesterday.
I am in a relationship that is shit. Constantly getting yelled at for everything.
I can't talk to her without getting blamed for something. We have kid together and I don't want to leave my kid. So I feel stuck.
Some days are good but most of the time I feel hated. I've never really had crazy mood swings until now.
I also feel stupid for trying to blame all of My problems on someone else. Its not like I'm perfect.
Either way I feel helpless, and don't want to shit talk my partner to friends.
