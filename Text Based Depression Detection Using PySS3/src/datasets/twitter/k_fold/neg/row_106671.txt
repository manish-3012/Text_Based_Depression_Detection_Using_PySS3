Iâ€™m so close to giving upI genuinely didnâ€™t plan on being alive past this year, I donâ€™t see any potential for my life in any way. I feel so trapped because thereâ€™s people who love me, and I know Iâ€™m inevitably going to hurt them when I canâ€™t take being alive anymore. My only hope is that I get a terminal disease so that I can die without causing people excess pain
