My mom ignored my painI have been feeling suicidal for the past few years. Even though I've gotten better, a conversation my mom that I had last year still hurts me. I was repeatedly trying to reach out to her out of desperation and pain because I was feeling suicidal. She typically ignored my cries (she's an asian parent who doesnt believe in mental health) or gives some motivational speech. 

However, once she simply said "The dog that barks never bites" and until this day, I think about it. I have thought about it for some time and it still hurts. What do y'all think? I haven't spoken about this to anyone and it would be great to have other people's perspectives.
