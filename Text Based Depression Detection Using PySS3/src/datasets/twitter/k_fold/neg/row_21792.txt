Feels so trivial, but I can be a very volatile person, and this shit is really getting to me.I'm a 25 male, I once was very depressed for about 7 years (age 14-21) and took part in some very risky behavior (slamming a 3 day OD worth of pills to see what it would do to me etc. mixed with alcohol and such things).

Since this part of my life has passed, a lot has changed. I made some moves and got my dream job, I bought my dream house, I'm quite accomplished in my career and such. But this is where the disconnect seems to have happened. I feel like my friends, or those who were my friends, instead of being happy for my success as I would be for them, are instead jealous. My interpersonal relationships which I have very few of but keep very close and dear have distanced and diminished.

I still stuck on an old girlfriend from like 2 years ago and all other girls seem to feel like a waste of time to me.

Anyways, I'm thinking of making a noose with a rope after work tomorrow. Right now it's taking a lot of work to keep things status quo - I know I have a limitless ceiling for what I can do with myself. The problem is I have nobody to share my life with... I can do better, I can achieve more, but I have nobody to share with, and my entire social life is feeling more and more disconnected with every passing day :'(
