There are no good daysEvery day is a futile struggle to avoid pain and suffering in the future, and I know deep in my heart that I cannot save myself from the kind of suffering that I fear; the kind of suffering that leads people naturally to their deaths. And then I'll just be another wasted, useless life that nobody will give a shit about. Dead in the cold, or the heat, probably because I was too unintelligent and unmotivated to figure out how to make sure I'd survive the extreme temperatures. 

I know deep in my heart that I am not smart or resourceful enough to get through life on my own. I am a complete failure of a person because I cannot rely on myself, on account of being too incompetent. I think a lot of people in my situation don't even think about how maybe it's just because of their own natural stupidity that they remain in poverty. They just turn a blind eye, maybe because it's too painful to accept the reality that you were always going to fail if left completely to your own devices. I just need more courage to be okay with death.
