Tonights the night I guess.I guess this will be my goodbye, I can't take it anymore. I have 2 friends and I'm on the verge of losing one of them. Every day sucks and I just work until I go to sleep. Too depressed to chase goals and suck at everything. ill just tell my parents I'm going on a bike ride and go get some rope from the hardware store down the street.
Goodbye.

Edit: bury me in Telluride and play rocky mountain high or take me home country roads by John Denver at my funeral cause those are peaceful songs.
