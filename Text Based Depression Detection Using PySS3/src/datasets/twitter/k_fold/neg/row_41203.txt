4 hour standoff with myself on whether to die or noI am so fucking close of doing it and it is a perfect opportunity (roommate is not here). I only have to clean my room (because its so fucking gross and im sub renting from my friend and dont want to leave anther bad goodbye gift) , start drinking and stab my hand to know if I can deal with the pain before starting to cut, in any order. But here I am after 4 hours with my emotion changing very fucking 5 second - from determined to sitting in a corner feeling like crying to contemplating whether im doing it for attention to saying fuck it I dont need to do these things first. I know if I start doing any of these, I will not turn back. I dont know what to do. I cant speak to my most trusted friend (they know I'm suicidal) because this is like putting such a burden on them and I cant do that to them. I dont know why I am writing this, im just tired and done. Maybe this just acting as a child and ranting or seeking attention, i dont know
