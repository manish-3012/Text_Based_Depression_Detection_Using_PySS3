Because society refuses to offer euthanasia, I'm forced to consider a lonely, painful end to my life--maybe even permanent paralysis if my suicide attempts go wrong.So frustrating. I just don't want to be here and it's been a pretty consistent feeling for over two decades now. 

I wish I could say goodbye to my friends and family and do the things I wanted to do before I died. Instead, I have to hide my plans and ultimately, risk a painful and cruel death. And if it doesn't succeed, I risk painful mangling or paralysis. The hospital will invariably try to keep me alive even though I'm looking to die. So infuriating.
