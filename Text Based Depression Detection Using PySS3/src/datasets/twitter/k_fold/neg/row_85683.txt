I want to do it, why canâ€™t i?!?I want to kill myself. I have no reason to live. I am so fucking tired. I am just scared. Not of dying, thatâ€™s what I want. Of fucking it up, like iâ€™ve fucked everything up in my life. I just want to go, Iâ€™m ready, Iâ€™m so tired. I wonder if enough alcohol would make me brave enough??
