I sometimes think about it and can't fucking believe that I'm only 18, there's still so many long years of this fucking joke called life ahead of meI'm trying to cope with different mindsets or philosophies but it doesn't really change the fact that I was fucked from the start, some people just aren't designed to be happy and if they're cowards like me they need to resort to waiting for natural death I guess. Not like I have any tools to off myself, If I could get a shotgun where I live I would be most likely already dead 2-3 years ago.
