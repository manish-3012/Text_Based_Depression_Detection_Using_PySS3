15 years I have been alive and 4 of those I want to dieSchool I my problem, I can't seem to please my dad with report cards. I'm not that bad I get A's and B's but I sometimes get one or two C's for the stupidest reasons. I don't feel welcome there, heck I don't feel welcome anywhere, the school seems to favourite the high end, I'm left struggling in some places, everytime I tell someone about my suicidal tendency. People laugh. They think I'm 'memeing' I have told so many people but to them I'm just a joke. I don't know what would be funnier for them, me talking about suicide or commuting the deed.
