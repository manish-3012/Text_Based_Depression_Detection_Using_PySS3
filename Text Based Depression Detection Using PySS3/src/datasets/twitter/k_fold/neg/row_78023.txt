Holy shit I knew I shouldâ€™ve killed myself when I had the chanceI just looked up jobs I could try out and Iâ€™m qualified for none of them. I have literally no experience, talents, and only rudimentary knowledge on a trade. Why didnâ€™t I kill myself? I shouldâ€™ve killed myself. I shouldâ€™ve killed myself. I shouldâ€™ve killed myself.
