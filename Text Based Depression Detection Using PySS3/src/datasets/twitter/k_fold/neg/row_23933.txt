Googled "reasons not to kill yourself" and nothing sounded goodI tried variations to get a few different sets of results (although there was obviously overlap) and clicked all the first page links. I was hoping to bolster my own personal 'reasons for/against' list which currently consists simply of "it's a bit of a faff" in the 'against' column but if anything it's just strengthened my position as nothing on any of them were any good. None appealed to me.

For some context, I'm sure I've done that before. I've been thinking about it for a while after all. I completely stopped hanging out with the three friends I had 10 years ago deliberately so as to minimise the impact on other people as best I could. In the intervening years I've come up with several plans and always figured that I'd go through with it when things got too much or I die of some other cause. Other than that I've done the bare minimum with life. I've worked in a supermarket two days a week for around fifteen years and that has been my only job. I still live at home. I've avoided getting close to people (which it turns out is easy). I just spend my time on the internet and using TV games as distractions but I'm increasingly growing disinterested in those (or starting new ones at least).

So I'm basically just waiting to die anyway. I figure I may as well get it over with rather than spend fifty years or whatever being unhappy. I can't be bothered waiting any more and in all this time I haven't thought of a single other reason not to do it, although I'm open to suggestions.
