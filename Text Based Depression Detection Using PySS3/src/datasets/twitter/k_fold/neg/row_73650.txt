I'm locked in my room.I'm 17 I'm not going to go into the details and the abuse/mental illness I just want a solution for this moment if you can't give me any solutions in a few days I'm going to suicide I was going to do it today but I had a paranormal dream and found out it was a real person who was talking to me I'm not sure if this is a sign that I will die soon, so I decided to wait for another day, I'm locked in my room I have bipolar anxiety depression PTSD ? a mix of these I skipped my semi final exams because I have school anxiety and my father forces me to go to school so I go to abandoned houses untill school ends pretty wierd I know but now I'm locked in my room my father found out about the semi final exams and I didn't leave my room for the last 2 days except for bathroom and water (in the holidays I had hypomania for like a couple of days so I was socialising normally with my family but the rest of the 30 days I spent locked in my room) I don't want to spend the rest of my life like this I don't want to face him (unless he breaks in) or face my school teachers since they called and said that I would be expelled if I didn't come to school I'm not planning on going back they gave my seat to another student and I'm not happy with my friends asking questions I don't feel comfortable answering, he shuts the internet most of the day only turns it on for my sister for a little bit I can only leave the room at 3am to get water because they are all sleeping I'm trying to eat less so after I die you know, I have no clue how he found out about my suicide I heard him saying Kill yourself I'm gonna make your life miserable that moment I changed my mind from suicide to murderer I wanted to go out and kill him because I'm not that weak but I'm not a killer he is a loud/mentally ill guy he keeps screaming Fuck that guy I'm gonna kill this guy these people need to die and sometimes at my mom he just goes on like this everyday since I remember him he doesn't work he stays at the house sometimes he has outbursts for no reason and gets a knife from the kitchen and starts threatning to kill everyone he went to jail once but his family pressured my mom to drop the case he stayed there for 30 days so he might be scared to attack again he just keeps screaming the entire day I don't want to hear him so I sleep in the day and wake up at night the computer is the only thing that I can listen to music or play some online games I know that I'm using the house food and Internet this is why I want to suicide because I'm wasting their resources for no reason and I don't want to feel dependant on others I tried to get an online job so I can live alone but It didn't work out, he once tried to kill me but I locked myself in my room the door handle is broken but I have a separate lock, my family are okay with him and they say I'm the problem because I don't open my room (not my choice) but I have a pretty scary PTSD everytime I hear someone screaming I just think that he is trying to kill my mom or is about to break in my room and attack me, I don't know what else to say I think my only choice is suicide otherwise I might run from the house and maybe find a work that offers me a place to sleep which is unlikely in my country so I will end up homeless and everyone will think I'm insane I just wanted to post this to prove that I have no solution left I'm not sure what I'm going to end up doing being a murderer If he ends up breaking into my room maybe not get jailed because he is a psychopath or just suiciding but I only have a couple of days to decide what to do.
