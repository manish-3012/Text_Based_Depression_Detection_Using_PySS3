I just mentioned by the way to my mother that maybe I'd like to go into suicide therapy - She answered "Finally"Where the fuck did I go wrong?

I don't know what I feel but I don't want to do a therapy again. It's just, I know what they're gonna say. I sit there and wait until I can continue failing at studiyng.  

  

Why the fuck do I have to go through all this?
