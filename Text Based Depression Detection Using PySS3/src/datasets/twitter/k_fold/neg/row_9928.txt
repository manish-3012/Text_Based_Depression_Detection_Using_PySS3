AloneI've struggled with depression for quite a while, but it's really gotten bad in the last year and a half. I have lost almost all motivation to do anything, even the activities that I used to love and would spend hours and hours doing. I failed 2 years of high school due to it. My parents believe that depression is something the person decided to have and they control it, just any time they want they can become or get rid of it. I have ended almost all of my relationships because nobody cares anymore, my last girlfriend broke up with me because she said dating me made her realize that she's gay, and 8 months later she's engaged to one of my old male friends. I don't have anyone who cares and understands anymore. 

I've lived my whole life in solitude pretty much. I grew up in a house in the middle of nowhere U.S.A and was homeschooled so I didn't make too many friends. And now even when I see hundreds of people a day in the city it's no different. I never had the neighborhood friends that stay with you your whole life or the girl next door who you're best friends with forever and end up marrying. I've always lived a lonely life and I don't feel like that is ever going to change. I would rather take my own life at the expense of a few people grieving for a few years at most and eventually moving on than living the next 50 or so years alone.
