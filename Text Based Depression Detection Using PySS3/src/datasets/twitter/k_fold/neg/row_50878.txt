I think I know what song I want played at my funeralI Surrender by Aron Wright. I just feel like it sums up my current state perfectly. I know that that wish probably wonâ€™t be honoured but it would give me some comfort to know that that song would be played. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be kicking for much longer.
