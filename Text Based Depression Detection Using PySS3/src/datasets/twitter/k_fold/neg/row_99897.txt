When does therapy cure anhedonia and if it doesnt why shouldn't I suicide?I have drug induced anhedonia. 

I use therapy constantly and look for an effect. It has had 0 effects and then makes me suicidal. Im not going to live with this condition and I want to kill myself. My life is over.

Therapy: "No your life is not over"

Check feelings: symptoms are the same even if I replace that thought.

Same thought occurs again due to the symptoms

Therapy: Exercise

-exercises-

Check symptoms: symptoms are identical to before

No matter what I do the symptoms are the same. Therefore I just want to commit suicide.

Im not able to enjoy or feel things anymore. I cannot talk to people anymore at all.

Why shouldnt I suicide? Its not going to get better tomorrow or the day after....

And I do not have the patience to wait.

I am making plans for getting ECT perhaps and if that doesnt work then ill suicide.
