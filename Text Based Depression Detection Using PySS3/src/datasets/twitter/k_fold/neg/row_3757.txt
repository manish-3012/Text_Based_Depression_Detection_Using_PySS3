I've given upI've tried my entire life to be someone, but it all seems to work against me.

I just went to the last bank in town (shit, maybe in Canada) to ask for a student loan. We went through the 2 hour vetting process and I thought I finally, finally had a chance...and then  one of the 100 questions asked if I received any physician support. The list included depression and anxiety. I answered yes. She told me I didn't qualify.

OSAP doesn't cover enough due to my...unique home situation.

I have to choose between having a home and being able to get an education. Call me stupid, but I can't imagine a future where I can't succeed educationally...I've spent the last 10 years preparing for engineering and now I've barely been in two years and I'm already out of options.

I've been putting in job applications every day and nowhere will take me. 

I was the valedictorian in high school. I have one of the best averages in the entire school. I volunteer, but I can't afford the extra thousand dollar per semester so I can apply for co-op, so nowhere will consider me for employment. The time I don't spend studying for something I can never achieve anyway, I'm putting in scholarships. Out of the hundreds I've put in (72 through my school's website alone), I have gotten 0. 

My last hope was my grandmother, who could absolutely cosign for me, but said "oh no, I don't want to live with loans for the rest of my life". So there goes mine.

I just wanted to get this out, thanks for being here. I've scoped out getting help in real life, but it seems I'll be placed on an involuntary hold, which...isn't going to help me get a job, so I can't do that.
