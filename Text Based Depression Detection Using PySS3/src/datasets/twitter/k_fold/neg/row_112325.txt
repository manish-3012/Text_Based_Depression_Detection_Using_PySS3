Itâ€™s really hard to hold onItâ€™s really hard to put into words everything. I always had this issue. This depression has just been kicking me to the ground for the majority of my life. Nothing helps. I want to end my life but I know I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t because that would ruin some people family and friends. Iâ€™m holding on for them. But I find it more and more hard to everyday. I think about that I could do it right now if I wanted to. I could end it all. All my problems would go away. I would be with God in paradise, nothing will ever hurt or harm me ever again. Nothing. But doing that would come with such horrible consequences. I find it so hard to put on my fake smiles. I find it so hard to express myself. Itâ€™s all fake. I always act goofy around my friends and idk if thatâ€™s real or just to hide whatâ€™s inside me. It hurts to be here but I have to be for those who care for me. Meds donâ€™t work and I donâ€™t want anymore because that will infringe on some careers I want. Iâ€™m afraid of living. Iâ€™m afraid of interacting with new people. Iâ€™m afraid of beginning relationships because I have this feeling in my head that itâ€™s fake and theyâ€™re out to hurt me like the others. I just donâ€™t see any good point to living. Itâ€™s all shit. And I want to believe so badly that there are good points but I just canâ€™t see it no matter how many signs from God show me that there are reasons. I struggle to hold on. Iâ€™m treading deep water and my lungs are giving out. 

I hold on for them. It feels like a blessing and a purgatory at the same time.
