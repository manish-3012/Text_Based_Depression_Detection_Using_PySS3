I am not sure if this belongs here. A redditor I interacted with may have gone through with it and I am wondering if anyone knows anything.A month or so ago I was posting somewhere in /r/japan, and a user named /u/[**ryneku**](https://old.reddit.com/user/ryneku) started making dismissive hostile posts and was beaten down by the crowd. I got a sense the guy was acting out and wanted that abuse, and I as much as said so, trying to acknowledge the human aspect, but I said something like this: 

\&gt;Maybe everything is fucked up for you but it's never too late to turn things around.

He responded by saying "You're right, I am better off dead!"

I tried to explain what I meant and pm'd him several times. But when I checked his user page his last posts, just shortly after our interaction, were about suicide. And that was the last he posted.

It's a long shot but did anyone ever have any interaction with the guy? Or know where he might be? I just have a really bad feeling.

As I say I don't know if this belongs here; if not please let me know.
