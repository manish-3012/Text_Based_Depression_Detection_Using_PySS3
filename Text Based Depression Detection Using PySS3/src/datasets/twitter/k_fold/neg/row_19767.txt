I have been thinking.I think of killing myself every day. I imagine different ways to do it. Recently I have been thinking of stabbing myself in the heart. I think I know where the mark is supposed to be.

I used to stop an look at different knifes for sale in the nearby hardware shops. But the knives there won't seem to be strong or sharp enough to do the job. As I am writing this I am thinking of how I would do it. Between 3rd and 4th rib. I think the location is good enough, should miss the bone and go straight through the flesh.
I have been thinking about the moment when the metal slices through. Would I hit my mark. Would I miss and drown in my own blood. Would I stop at the first sign of pain. If someday I do get a knife I just wish I have enough strength to guide it clean through completely and then pull it out. I imagine such a step would incur a huge amount of physics pain. I probably shouldn't get drunk or high for the act. It might numb everything but I might miss. I should probably get a stethoscope as well. That would come in handy, should take out all the guess work out of the setup.
Listen. Mark. Stab. Might have to run into a wall while holding the knife. Will try not to cry during the procedure as I am a man and Men Don't Cry.
