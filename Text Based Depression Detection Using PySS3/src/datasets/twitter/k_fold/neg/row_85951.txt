I feel needyI just posted on here an hour ago, but I didn't notice people were messaging me back, I feel awful. I feel like I have no one. I read the message that suicide watch gives out to those who post or reply, and it says don't use PMs as a first resort. In my case, please do. I can't be left alone or I hurt myself. Please talk to me.
