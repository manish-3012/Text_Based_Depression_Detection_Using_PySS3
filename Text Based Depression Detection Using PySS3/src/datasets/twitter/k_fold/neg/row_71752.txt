What happens if I tell a therapist that Iâ€™m having suicidal thoughts?Hi 
Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for 5 or 6  years and this year has been the hardest by far. I havenâ€™t been able to get suicide off my mind for months. Iâ€™m scared to die but whenever Iâ€™m alone I canâ€™t help but think about killing myself. I realize I need professional help but Iâ€™ve never been to a therapist and I am scared to tell them because I donâ€™t want to be sent to a mental hospital. But I want to be honest with the therapist if I go. I donâ€™t see the point of going and not disclosing all of my feelings. But if theyâ€™re gunna send me to a hospital I wonâ€™t go at all
