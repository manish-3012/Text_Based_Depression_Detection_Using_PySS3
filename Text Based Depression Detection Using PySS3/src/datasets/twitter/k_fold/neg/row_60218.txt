I just want the everything to stopI canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m a complete failure of a person. Almost 30 with no job on ssi, pretty sure my payee is stealing from me. In constant tooth pain because I donâ€™t have any dental plan. Itâ€™s been almost a month of nonstop pain, sleepless nights and looking up ways to kill myself. New state with an expired id and payee wonâ€™t send my SS card so I canâ€™t even get an ID to get a dental plan. I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore. I just feel myself getting closer and closer to the end of my rope. Iâ€™m fucking losing it. Why canâ€™t it just fucking end it already. Iâ€™d be be better off dead
