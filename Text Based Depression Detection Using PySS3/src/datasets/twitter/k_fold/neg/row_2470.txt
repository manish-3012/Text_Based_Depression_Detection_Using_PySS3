Been hangin out alone at rock bottom for years and not sure how I still existJust pulled the trigger on my skull the first time. Safety was on so I figured I'd survive, but I really hoped a miracle would happen where the safety failed and I died. The only 2 real friends I thought I had now have finally just abandoned me. 

For some reason I've also been fantasizing about playing Russian roulette every day until I die, which even I see is insane. I've also had several lucid dreams about public suicide, and voices in my head trying to convince me to kill myslef daily for years now. I am so fucking lonely and exhausted of going nowhere. 

Someone talk to me? Incredibly sick of myself, all these people who desert me, and just this world in general. I just wanna talk to someone else in a shitty postion, I guess. Not gonna lie, I feel supremely lonely and hopeless right about now. Thanks.
