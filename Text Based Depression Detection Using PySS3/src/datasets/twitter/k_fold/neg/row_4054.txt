I wish I would just die!!I really wish I would die, I have quite a lot of pills I have been stock pilling and will get more.. I haven't set a date or anything but I hope I do it soon. Friends &amp; Family do know how I feel and I have been advised against an overdose as it is supposed to hurt a lot. I think anything that kills you is going to hurt! My head and my life is such a crazy place + I am deeply upset with how my life has turned out. I am 40 now and just want to give up! I always thought i'd have life in order by this point in my life but I am far from it. I hate my job and getting out of bed everyday is killing me, I am applying for others and have had lots of interviews in the past but nothing successful, I will never have some high paid job! guess that's my own fault for not applying myself when I was younger. I so wish I was rich so I could just go travelling for the rest of my life and not have to worry about money...

Maybe I'll win the Â£122 Million Euromillions jackpot tonight! fingers crossed
