I'm not suicidalSo I was looking up ways to off oneself and eventually came across Terminal Dehydration.

Apparently you go into a state of euphoria after the initial thirst period passes and it is more peaceful than assisted suicide by a doctor. It takes at least 3 days but whatever.

I'm not really suicidal... but going out and hiding in the forest somewhere and dying peacefully from dehydration sounds kind of relieving even if it is just the fact that I could do it if I wanted.
