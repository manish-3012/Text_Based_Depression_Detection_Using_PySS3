I want to end my life just because I can't get a girlfriend.I'm so sick of chasing women, only to be rejected constantly. Each rejection makes me feel worse and worse. But I can't help waking up at the beach and trying again. If only I wasn't sexually attracted to women. If only I didn't care, then I would have been happy.
