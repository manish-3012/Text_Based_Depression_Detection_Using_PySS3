Life is worthless.I've 4 years depression and I've anxiety. I like 1 girl but she already have a bf and they're always kissing and she hates me. I suck at school and I'm fat. I've been neglected by my father and my father is a wanderder and a junk and I've don't saw him 3 years. I've got 5 step-fathers and I suck at playing guitar. I don't have friends and I cried 4 times on school and when I was 10 I've cried everyday at school and they say that I'm a softy. I'm just broken of the things in life. You've go to school till you're 18. Then you work until you're worn out and die. I never will get a gf and never will get good friends and I've got 1 good friend and he have depression too and everyday he says that he wants to die and he have got epileptic attacks. Teachers always complain at my for not doing my homework. That's why I'm going to try suicide.
