It's been a wild ride my comradesI've been subscribed to this sub reddit pretty much since I first created this account. I was going to end my life but ended up staying a bit longer.

After all this time, I think it's time for me to leave this place. I would like to stay a bit longer to maybe comment on the posts but I think that wouldn't do me any good, and for the first time I'm doing something that's for my own benefit rather than someone else's.

I've gone through quite a bit this year and a few month while on here, and I don't regret being here but it's about time I leave. I still have depression but I'm not suicidal anymore and after such a long time it feels... different and new.

I hope that many of the people on here find their own way through life no matter what hardships they face, but I have learned a lot while spending my time here which is something I will take with me as I try my best to move forward.

Goodbye everyone and good luck, hope to see this sub being almost empty someday and maybe never find myself coming back here again, or at least not for the same reason as I have in the first place.
