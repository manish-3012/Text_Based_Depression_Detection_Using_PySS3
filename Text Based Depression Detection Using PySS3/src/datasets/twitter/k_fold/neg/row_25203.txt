I don't want to do this anymoreEver since I was as young as I can remember I've never wanted to live. And everyday since I have found a reason to keep thinking that. 

At this point I kind of feel that life is pointless. And honestly it's a lot more painful than I think it's worth. Never a day in my life have I not wanted everyone to be happy. But I kept messing up. I ruin everything. 

I've been in hospitals before. I'm on a boatload of meds. And I go to therapy 2x a week. Not once in any of my treatment have I ever felt as though I was getting better. But fake it till you make it I guess. 

I don't want to hurt people anymore. And I don't want people to hurt me. I feel like a piece of my soul has died that I will never get back. Not everybody gets their happy ending. I'm ok with not getting mine. I just want everything to be over. I just want to be in peace.
