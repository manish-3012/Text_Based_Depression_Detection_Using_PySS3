My thoughts keep coming back to thisI attempted to complete suicide before. Bag on head, hung myself....  friend kicked in door and I was hospitalised for a week but no after-care.
I guess I've had a few other attempts.... drinking and taking pills till I passed out. 

Just now I feel as though I'm slowly commiting suicide by leading a dangerous life...  drinking and taking prescription drugs by the handful and not caring if I wake up.

I've already thought out a plan for soon....  I'm going to take several disposable bbq into a little hobbit hut I rent while walking.  I'll drink and take sleeping tablets till I pass out.
I'll pay for several days in the hut so no one will find me too early. 
I'll tape up half the room and put up a sign so that any one who enters the hut will see right away that they need to move away.

Anything else I need to think about?
