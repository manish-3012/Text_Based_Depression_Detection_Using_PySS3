My will to live changes by the minute and its exhaustingI'm 19 and I feel like I have a lot to look forward to, Getting out of my shitty community college,going to school away from my small shithole town and away from my toxic parents..being closer to my LDR gf, even the possibility of getting a new job excites me..these thoughts are the only think keeping me hopeful but they also seem so out of reach like a pipe dream. I guess you can say I've been depressed all my life..I grew up in an abusive home..which I'm still in...My brother is moving back to my hometown in June and he wants to get me out of this environment. I'm looking forward to moving in with him..He also has depression we talk a lot about it..and sometimes when I'm feeling suicidal (which is everyday) I think about what him and my gf will have to go through and "Shake it off"..I have a letter ready to send to my gf if i go through with it..and a plan on how to end my life.. I feel like its getting closer and closer and i cant do anything to stop it. I want to get better I do..I hate feeling like this..I've considered talking to my schools therapist.. if anyone could tell me what thats like I'd appreciate it..also if anyone has taken any anti-depressants can you let me know if they make a difference..thanks
