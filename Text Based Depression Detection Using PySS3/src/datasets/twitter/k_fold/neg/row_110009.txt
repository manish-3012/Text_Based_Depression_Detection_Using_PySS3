You canâ€™t outrun your destinyIâ€™m at the liquor store. Then Iâ€™m going to get 90 days worth of antidepressants. Itâ€™s going to be alright I tell myself. Some people will be sad but I wonâ€™t have to clean it up. And they ghosted me while I was alive so they can ghost me while Iâ€™m dead those selfish fucks. I should probably finish writing my note but thereâ€™s no reason why I should wake up tomorrow. Weirdly enough I feel at peace. I think Iâ€™m actually going to do it this time. Iâ€™m only worried that it wonâ€™t be enough to kill myself and Iâ€™ll just end up some brain dead monkey. But itâ€™s fine. It will all be fine. If I take them fast enough and jam myself under my bed I wonâ€™t be able to seize and shake free and Iâ€™ll choke on my own vomit. Itâ€™ll be ugly but itâ€™ll be over and thatâ€™s what matters the most.
