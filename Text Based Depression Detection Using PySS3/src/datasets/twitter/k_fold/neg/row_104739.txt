I want to be erasedIf there's an afterlife I'm gonna demand that god completely erase everything about me from the universe. I want to the light switch to turn off, to go from being conscious to having never been conscious or known existence. I'm gonna be so pissed if I have to continue being whatever I am in some other life. My personality, my body, my legacy are pathetic and meaningless
