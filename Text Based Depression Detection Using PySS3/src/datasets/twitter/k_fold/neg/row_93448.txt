Seriously considering giving up.I want to just end this. I believe that when I die, it will just be like before I was born; nothingness. And that is vastly preferable to my existence lately.

My future, if I decide to pursue it, looks like this: file for bankruptcy, quit drinking, attempt to be competent in this new career (went from being a server in this company to doing tech support, for which I seem to be very unqualified), going through therapy (again), trying medications (again), all for what? A shot at a mediocre life?

Also, I'm 34 and my teeth are rotting out of my skull. It causes me great pain and is one of the factors in my love for alcohol. Then there's the chronic back pain, but the teeth have somehow dulled that for a while now.

And I'm practically addicted to eating like shit. That's another obstacle I'd need to overcome.

It just all seems hopeless, at the worst of times. At the best of times, it seems doable, but not worth the effort. I've had my shot at life. And I've failed in every way. I just want to quit.

Thank you for any advice you can provide. I'm sorry to just jump in here. I don't want to tie up the crisis line again. It's not like I have a solid plan. Story of my life, and death.
