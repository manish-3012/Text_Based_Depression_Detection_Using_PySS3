My girlfriend doesn't want anythingShe told me she doesn't want any letters or voicemails. She doesn't want to have to say good bye to me. 

I feel like I should leave something behind for the people in my life. Letters of hatred to my parents. Letters of forgiveness to my sister and to the friends who abandoned me when I needed them. 

My girl is special though. She's the sweetest, most caring soul ever. I hope she meets someone just like her. I want to emphasize that to her but I don't know if a letter would do just that. I don't know if my thoughts formed one cohesive sentence but idk I'm tired. My head hurts.
