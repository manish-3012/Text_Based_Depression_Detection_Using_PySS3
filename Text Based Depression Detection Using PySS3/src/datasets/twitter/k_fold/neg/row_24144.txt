I don't want to live without herSo it's not even 8 hours into the new year, and already I've kept getting memories of her I don't want anymore, I've looked at her public social profile that I know (as much as I can without having an account) and I just want to die right now. I still love her. I still miss her. I still want her. And she wants nothing to do with me... I am so broken and hurt after all this time. I know I will never find another love like her. We were perfect for each other when we were together. Why doesn't she love me like she said she did then? I should honestly just end it and I don't know why I keep going. Why should I keep fighting when I will never have the future I've wanted my whole life?

I should be sleeping right now... Instead I'm bringing in the New year with tears and pain... Idk what to even do anymore
