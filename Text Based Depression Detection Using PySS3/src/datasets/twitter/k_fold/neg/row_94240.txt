32, no job, no girlfriend, no friends and live at home. Also , citalopram is crap.I don't feel any emotions, I just exist. I last felt normal when I was 15. I'm giving citalopram another try right now and it's rubbish. It wakes me up every night and I'm so chronically tired that I'm stopping it.

I got an interview for medical school and I feel nothing. I actually view it all as a chore. I can't be bothered with the interview and I can't be bothered with more schooling.

I'm just existing here, in this world like an alien.
