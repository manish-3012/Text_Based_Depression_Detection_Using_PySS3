A fucking GRANDMA has a sexier body than me and I feel trapped inside a failed genetic experimentI saw a 55 year old grandma on Instagram with a very tomboyish "I don't care about my body or fashion I just care about my children and grandchildren and work".  She had a very laid back, working class, non-feminine vibe to her.

That is, until she had to go to a formal event that focused on her activism (her youngest son is disabled).  She looked like a tiny, cute, sexy fairy princess.  She was wearing a UK size 6-8 (us 2-4) see through dress with only glitter covering the nipples (which were poking out of the dress) and a slit showcasing her cellulite-less legs.  She looked like a 55 year old's head photoshopped onto an 18 year old's body.

Her breasts were perky as fuck and located slightly below her neck

Meanwhile I am someone who cares about myself and I have starved myself to the point of considering suicide.  My breasts fall to my legs and are so heavy and saggy that the bra HAS to have straps to keep them up.  My breasts are located in the middle of my torso, just above my giant belly.  I am forced to wear a UK size 16-18 due to birth control and a very high dose of antipsychotics AND a slow metabolism.  Meanwhile celebrities can brag about binging and still be thinner than me.
