I need helpHi. I really don't know what to do and I'm shaking so bad right now. It's a long story but my girlfriend of 6 years broke up with me tonight and all hope is lost in my life. She brought me back from the brink once before and I've done everything since then to adjust for her. I quit playing video games semi professionally, got a different car, and even have my house on the market for sale currently to move closer to her. She says the distance tainted the rest of the relationship even though we were happy all the times we spent together but she felt pulled apart from everything else in her life because of me. I never meant to do that and now feel like I have been emotionally manipulative to her. I spent the last 4 hours convincing her once I move it'll get better but clearly that was just more manipulation from me. I have no friends or close family to talk to. She was the only person I had. I literally put all my eggs in one basket and fucked myself for it. I just want to restart.

Please help. I really want to kill myself and am just hoping this venting will prevent that.
