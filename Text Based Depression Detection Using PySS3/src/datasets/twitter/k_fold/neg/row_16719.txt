I have no will to live in this world and I only live for others sakeIt's not that I have a shitty life. But so many people has proven to me that I don't matter. They wouldn't care if I died. I have friends and they are there for me, but I can't tell them how I feel. My thoughts aren't reasonable. I have a great family great friends but I am a terrible person. I had way to many people who earlier in my life trashed me completely. Made me know that I don't matter. Then corona saved my life cause I found out some people actually cared. But I still live daily with the thoughts of me not being good enough. I hate myself. And I can't tell anybody how much of a shit hole I am in because they shouldn't worry. I'm not that important. I have promised them all that I wouldn't self harm any more. But it is so hard. Can't I just be happy, and why is everything wrong with me? I really just wanna kill myself, the only thing holding me alive is that other people need me.
