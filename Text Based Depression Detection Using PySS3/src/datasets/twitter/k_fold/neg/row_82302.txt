Help.I have no friends who I can confide in, and I've kept this balled up for over a year, Im a constant black cloud over my friends, my girl, and family, I put on a mask and try to act happy around people but inside I feel dead already. Ive got shit social skills, I'm ugly, and stupid. Ive got nothing going for me but a vinyl collection and degree In a feild that makes me feel incompetent and like I've wasted my youth. I'm only 24 but I feel like I've lived 3 lives already, I've put a blade to my wrist everyday for the last 3 days almost as a ritual and I'm starting to think I'm to much a fucking pussy to even off myself. My girl is the only one who cares about me and I don't want her to have to waste her life trying to help someone who can't even help themselves. I can't afford therapy, and the betterhelp basically told me I was to much to deal with. I really don't know what to do. If I call a crisis line I'm gonna just hang up because I can't talk about it, it's actually really hard even typing this out. If anyone has any type of advice Id really appreciate it. Much love.
