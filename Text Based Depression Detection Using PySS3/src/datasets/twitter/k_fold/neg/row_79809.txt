Iâ€™m completely numb. I think Iâ€™m readyI have done everything to solve this. Iâ€™ve been to therapy, I have talked about this to fucking oblivion. I have read all the books, I have taken peopleâ€™s advice, and I still canâ€™t bare the idea of being here any longer. When I think about it, Iâ€™m just numb. Completely numb. Nothing anyone says makes me feel any better or worse. Iâ€™m just in between constantly, and I think that itâ€™s a sign, itâ€™s time to go.
