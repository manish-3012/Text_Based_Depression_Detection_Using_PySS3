Dear subredditI ll end my life later tonight when my parents and my little brother will fall asleep. I ve been cutting meals for quite some time now, as a way of punishment you know, sometimes when I cant solve an equation or some complex quantum physics problem I just slap myself. But you know it's okay..  I thought I had so much left yet to do, so much to live for you know. But yea i guess it is better to die rather than to be stupid my whole life, I am an honored student but yet I feel like I am so dumb. I am you know. I loved poetry too. It is nice, read some, reminds me of the human race. Anyways bye!
