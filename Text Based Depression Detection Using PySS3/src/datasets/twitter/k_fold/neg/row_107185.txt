0 will to go on.I've been reading this sub for a while now and i think i'm the weakest person around here, all i see are people with great problems that still go on with life, even if struggling, my problems are kinda stupid compared to theirs. Anyway for how my life is going i just can't seem to be happy whatever i try to do, i've been bullied from early age, up to when i started retiring from school year after year.. till around 2 years ago I had no job, nothing to do except playing videogames all day long being a burden.. 18 months ago I moved in with my girlfriend in a new city (moved just for her, leaving behind the few "friends" I had and my parents) but things didn't go too well, let's say I need a lot of attentions to feel happy and we couldn't bear it any longer, got kicked out from here and found a new house 1 month ago, being now completely alone again, the only moments I have social interaction are when I go play TCGs at the local store, otherwise I'm like a plant and can't seem to find the will to live. I'm just 22 and everyone I come in contact seems to just don't like me, my brain kinda see only the negative parts of every thing that happens around me, making my whole life and love relationship an hell for both me and who is around me. I checked out on pretty much the people I knew and from whom I went away and they all seem happier without a burden like me. I know my problems are stupid compared to what people posting here have to take everyday, I tried to fake being strong " who cares if I'm alone I can do it on my own" but I just can't. I can't bring myself to go back to my parents cause I would just return my old self, doing nothing all day long but I can't even keep on living like this.. I've already tried to see someone for my problems and it didn't work, literally just the same as before.. the first thing you would say will be "just go out and make some friend" I have to say I'm the most socially awkward penguin in the world and I even if I open up to someone they just run away and leave me behind...I'm starting to sleep more and more and wasting my days again like when I was living with my parents and every day seems worse than the one before.. I miss her, the so called love of my life, I miss my family, i miss my friends and I just have this giant void that can't be filled and doesn't make me think straight for a single moment..sorry for my rant but I see the suicide as a bigger possibility every day that comes by.. don't know how long I will last.
