Literally nothing matters anymore.I've been nothing but a fucking potato for 4 years now. There is no joy, humor, nor excitement. Only disappointment, shallow fake thrills, and anger. Life has no value anymore. I just want to fucking live again. I have it better than so many people in the world and here I am bitching about this stupid shit. Everyone hates me now so I guess it would be better if I just jumped off my fucking balcony. I want to do it so bad but what is left of my common sense told me to write this and seek help. I'm on the fucking brink.
