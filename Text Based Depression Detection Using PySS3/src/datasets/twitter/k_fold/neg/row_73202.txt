Plan to KmsIve talked to the therapist and a friend about my problems and how I feel and in the moment it feels good cause its a distraction but as soon as its over the thoughts haunt me again, nothing is fixing it I feel like too much of a burden if I keep on persisting them, cause I keep bringing up the same feelings and questions and they give me the answers which is fine and I thank them but it doesn't help me and I just want to die now but haven't told them cause if I do they'll try and stop me. I wish I could get an approval so it doesn't feel that bad
