I want to reach out to someone, anyone but I feel so detached.Iâ€™m hurting so much and I canâ€™t do it anymore. I know Iâ€™ve posted before and Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m vague. I donâ€™t even have words to get the emotions out. I am only 21 but itâ€™s so clear to me now that I ruin everything in my life. I know people love me, but I know Iâ€™m not a good person. I know I feel this way because of my own actions and I know I canâ€™t ever fix or make up for things I have done. I donâ€™t see the point in my life anymore. I donâ€™t want to do anything. Nothing makes me feel better. I just want it to stop and I always end up hurting myself again. I know I need to seek help, but I just donâ€™t see a point anymore. I havenâ€™t slept in 2 days and I think Iâ€™m done being scared. Iâ€™m just done, I hope God is real. I hope He forgives me. I just want everything to stop. I want to say please help me but it doesnâ€™t matter anyways. Iâ€™m sorry.
