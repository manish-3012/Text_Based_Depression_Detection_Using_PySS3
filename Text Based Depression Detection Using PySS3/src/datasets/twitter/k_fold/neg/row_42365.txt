Is it me?I've been feeling like my life is going downhill for awhile now. Everyday I wake up and lie in bed trying to stop time, hoping that I don't have to go through with the pointless drudgery of life again. After the urge to piss overcomes my depressing thoughts, I start my day loathing everything. I see society around me, broken and hateful. I'm so spiteful towards this life that I can't find joy in anything; I can't even begin to care. I sit around drugging myself into a stupor. Is this what life is? How can I keep fucking going when I'm heading straight to nowhere? I can't keep up this bullshit act forever; I'll have to pull the trigger sooner or later.
