I have nothing left. Everything is gone.I have lost everything. My job. My partner. My mind. 

My parents would be devastated if I killed myself but I just canâ€™t do this anymore. 

I had a breakdown and had to go stay with my mom. I wanted to kill myself every day. I had vivid scenarios play out in my mind of how Iâ€™d do it. I attempted several times. The only thing that kept me going was the possibility of coming home to my partner. She didnâ€™t come visit me once. She wanted me to come home and wouldnâ€™t see me unless I did.

I finally made it home and she said sheâ€™s not in love with me anymore. She keeps waffling between going to counseling to work it out with me and going to convince me to be her friend. After she asked me to marry her one year ago tomorrow. So thatâ€™s it. Everything is lost. I have nothing. Everyone can only give me useless platitudes about how everything will work out. No one knows that. Itâ€™s been going more and more to shit with every passing day. I want to kill myself. The most painless way possible. But I canâ€™t. I couldnâ€™t do that to my parents. But I have nothing left to live for. I pray every day to get killed while Iâ€™m driving. The least God could do, if he exists, after all Iâ€™ve been through, is to just kill me.
