I wish I'd never gone to college. Then I wouldn't have turned into a disaster.I used to be good. I was in the gifted and talented program. Won awards. I still didn't have any friends, but I was convinced I would be successful when I was older because I was smart.

I should've seen it coming, when all my teachers said I wasn't giving it my all, even when I was.

Now here I am, five years into college, waaaaaay behind on my three finals, horrible grades, and just wanting to die. I don't know what happened to me, or why, but I can't get better and I want it to stop.

My bullies were right. I am worthless. The only thing I had to be proud of is worthless. It was always worthless.
