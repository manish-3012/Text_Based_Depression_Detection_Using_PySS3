Should I clean my house before I kill myself?Girlfriend has been cheating on me. Lost my job. Nothing to live for. 

Been battling serious depression for 26 years. 

Had many doctors tell me that because I'm a male, I can't possibly be depressed. 

So I'm done. I have the chemicals I'll use to kill myself. 

Should I at least tidy this fucking pigsty to make going through all my shit easier?
