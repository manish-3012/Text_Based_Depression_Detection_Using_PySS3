I have to push back my suicide day again...In a terrible mood right now.

Just learned some news that I have to go help someone for a few weeks in November. Frustrated because I was going to end my life right after the election but now I have to wait longer. My new date will be sometime a little before Thanksgiving.

This sucks, I hate myself so much. I just want to die and disappear. Wish I was never born.
