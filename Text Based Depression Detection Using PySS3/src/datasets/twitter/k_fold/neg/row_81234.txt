As I become happier, the urge to kill myself becomes strongerMy life has gotten so much better in these past few weeks. I found a stable home, I bought nice things, I met old friends, and I finally met some of my goals. You would think suicide would be the last thing on my mind, but it isn't. I'm tormented by nightmares every night of losing everything and it's making me wonder if I should quit life now while I'm still happy.

My whole life has been a roller coaster of feelings, and it's driven me insane. I want true happiness with myself but I know there's a chance I might never find it. Not with purpose, not with love, and definitely not with money. The only way for me to find true happiness is for me to be with peace with myself, and that's a journey I'm not sure I can embark on. Suicide is the much easier route.

With this newfound happiness, I no longer fear death. I'd argue I'm more suicidal than ever, but for good reason.
