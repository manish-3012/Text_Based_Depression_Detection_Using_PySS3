I think Iâ€™ve just tried to drown myselfI think Iâ€™m getting bad again. Earlier when I was in the bathroom after crying, I noticed a pail of water that was full. We donâ€™t have a bath tub, you see, and I suddenly wondered, what would it be like if I put my head in the pail full of water? Would I drown? So I put my head in it and held my breath. At first, I laughed after doing it but then I realized, maybe I could drown in it? So I kept on doing it. I didnâ€™t drown obviously, but it got me thinking, if we had a bath tub, Iâ€™d probably try it, drowning myself, and it scared me because I was really willing to try it out and do it. Iâ€™ve always had thoughts about wanting to die, even thinking of how Iâ€™d do it but usually something stops me. I canâ€™t cut really deep, I donâ€™t know where our gun is. I donâ€™t wanna jump from a building. Iâ€™ve decided that if I were to do it, Iâ€™d overdose but I donâ€™t know where to get the pills to overdose on. Iâ€™m pretty sure I wonâ€™t die from over the counter meds. I donâ€™t wanna poison myself because Iâ€™d probably still live but thereâ€™d be harmful consequence to my body. Anyway, the point is Iâ€™ve thought about it but Iâ€™ve never really put in the effort to go through with it or even to just buy the things Iâ€™d need. What happened tonight was the first time I was willing to do it. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s enough to call it a suicide attempt, I didnâ€™t get through with it and I donâ€™t think I can drown in a pail of water.
