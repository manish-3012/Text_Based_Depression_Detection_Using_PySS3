Iâ€™m worried I will try again.Iâ€™ve been honestly okay for a while. However, everything is becoming so much worse right now. Panic attacks are back (all the time), lost interest in everything, pushing myself away from family and friends, and plans to die are constantly going through my head. I just canâ€™t be in that fucking hospital again. I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m lost and feel like Iâ€™m only staying alive for others.
I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m asking for advice or what Iâ€™m doing, Iâ€™ve never really posted here. I just donâ€™t know who else to talk to at the point Iâ€™m at right now.
