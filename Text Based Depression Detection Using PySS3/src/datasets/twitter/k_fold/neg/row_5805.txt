Done being walked onI just got an apartment and a new job, but my past comes back to haunt me all the time. I'm still dealing with my abusive ex boyfriend and his adult kids giving me drama and making me feel worthless. I'm just so done...I'm tired of being used and walked on and giving my all when I get abused in return. I'm trying to move on, be better, get better, but my depression and PTSD gets ahold of me sometimes and makes me think that no life is better than this fucked up one. I'm at my wits end. And I don't know if anyone will read this or even comment, but it's a last ditch effort. Thanks for reading.
