i don't feel anything anymorei don't feel sadness, fear, anger, joy, or anything. My head just hurts and feels foggy. My birthday is in a few days but no one will probably remember. Planning on killing myself then. i have it planned out and I no longer feel fear. I am just going to return to the dirt and sleep blissfully. Really excited
