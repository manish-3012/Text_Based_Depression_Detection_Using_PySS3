My own mother makes me want to kill myselfAnd I'm going to do it soon. I can't even begin to explain how fucked up my life and living situation is. It's sad because I really don't want to die, but this is the only way the pain will end. I've tried again and again to escape from her controlling grip but it doesn't work. I'm broke, without a working car, I've been trapped in this hell for too long. I'm hurting mentally and physically but I can't do shit about it. I'm scared to die to be honest but the peace that will come after will be totally worth it. Anyways, this is just a goodbye post. 

I tried.
