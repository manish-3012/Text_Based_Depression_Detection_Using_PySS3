Life stress is driving me insaneI can't take it anymore. I have no friends, no social life, my parents are constantly hanging over me about school that I do NOT want to go to despite it being free for me. I barely make any money and applying for new jobs is hell. I can't afford therapy nor do I ever want to go again due to past experiences. I really don't think my life is worth anything anymore and really just want to end it all.
