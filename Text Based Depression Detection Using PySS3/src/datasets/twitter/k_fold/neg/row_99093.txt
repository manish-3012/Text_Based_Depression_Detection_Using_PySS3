Drug addictIdk what to do anymore. I am depressed, I don't have any friends. All I do is take drugs. I don't know what I am doing with my life anymore. I have struggled with drug abuse since I was 14. It started with oxycodone / oxycontin. Then I started smoking alot of weed, then I started taking lsd, xanax, mushrooms, dxm, drinking alcohol alot etc. I need some help but I don't know where to start. I don't have very good social skills, I just  take drugs and sit in my room  by myself listening to music. My mental health is declining and all I think about day and night is killing myself but I am too much of a coward to do it. I feel like I am a burden to everyone. Im just a depressed junkie with nothing to offer to anyone. I have been losing alot of weight and cutting lately, I don't have much of an appetite and only eat if I have to or force myself. I don't know why I am typing this, I can't think straight anymore. Hope everyone out there is having a good day or night.
