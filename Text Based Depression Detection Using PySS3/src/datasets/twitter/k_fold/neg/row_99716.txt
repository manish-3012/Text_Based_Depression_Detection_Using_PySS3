ANONYMOUS POST:  Guilt is the only thing keeping me here.  (Please reply as usual.  Mods will post any comments from the OP.)
This is a long post, so thanks in advance if you take the time to read it. I'm having a really hard time...I've been on a steadily increasing dose of antidepressants, but they aren't working right now. All the psychiatrist tells me to do is wait...he says it might start working, I need to give it more time. Even if it does start working in a few weeks, I don't know if I can make it until then. Everything is difficult. I can't do anything anymore, I dread seeing people because I'll have to expend energy to seem normal. I can't even do that anymore though...people are starting to notice how bad I am. I've recently taken a turn for the worse, as I have never been a particularly open person, but the past two times that I've tried opening up to someone, it's ended awfully. About a week ago, a girl initiated a relationship with me...I thought maybe this would help me get better, but after two days, she told me she decided that she"wasn't ready for a relationship yet." Now I feel worse...in those few days I grew way too attached to her, since it was the first great interaction with a person that I've had in awhile. I know this is irrational but I can't deal with it...I'm constantly thinking about her now, and I want it all to end. I can't "wait" to see if the medicine works...what if it doesn't? What if I have to wait many more months with a different medicine, and that doesn't even work. I've come very close to killing myself multiple times now, I have a plan. Literally the only reason I haven't is that I'm guilty about what it would do to my family...I know it would ruin their lives. The scary thing is though, I'm starting to lose that feeling too. I'm starting think that that doesn't really matter, because I'll be gone, so I won't have to worry about it. If I lose my fear and guilt, I don't think I'll be able to stop myself.
