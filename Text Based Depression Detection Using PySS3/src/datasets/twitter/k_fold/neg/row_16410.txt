I canâ€™t handle the pain anymoreIâ€™ve gone through a lot of trauma in my life and Iâ€™m tired of being in pain.  Iâ€™m going to put my dog down today.  I know itâ€™s the right choice, his pain will end and heâ€™ll be at peace.  But I just keep thinking, why canâ€™t that be me too?  If itâ€™s a mercy to end his pain why canâ€™t I be at peace?  Why is it so horrible to want to end my suffering?

I know I canâ€™t do that to my family.  I just want the pain to end.  I want to be at peace.  I wish they could just let me go.
