I hate everything.I don't think I'm exactly suicidal, but yhe thoughts are creeping in mire and more every day. I'm not depressed in the classical sense, I'm angry, unbelievably angry, at every one, and every thing. 

The world seems to be going in a direction I can't handle, some things are better but it really feels like its only an illusion, only better on the surface. Politics, both global and domestic, religion, economy, it all seems to be going down hill for the average person. I spend all day working and trying to find the motivation to do anything to improve my situation, but I'm so tired, every escape frels cut off by greedy elite. I just find the idea of giving up more and more enticing. 

I'm a 27 transwomen and the hopelessness of paying for things like surgery or medicine is overwhelming. I'm so angry that despite everything looking like its moving forward, my situation seems as bad as its aleays been. I have no hope of paying for anything, no jope of paying or having the time to return to school to better my situation.  I'm just so tired. 

I have no friends, and I don't really want any, some family that might care, but I don't actually care if they do. My only anchor is my boyfriend. He is the only one I'm yoo scaref to hurt. 

Every so often I try to look up something, look up advice or other people with suicidal thoughts, but, it seems everyone is giving such generic advice, "wait it out  think it thru, it gets better." I'm so tired of seeing that. I neef real advice, real plans, real strategies to improve my position, and real belief that this world isn't fuck beyond repair.

I'm just so tired, and angry.
