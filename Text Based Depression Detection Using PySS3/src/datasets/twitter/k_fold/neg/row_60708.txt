Bullying traumaHow does one heal from severe bullying trauma? I was bullied for years from middle school to high school and i feel overwhelming anger. I keep ruminating over it and have a lot suicidal thoughts because of it. I believe i have aspergers and im going to see a psychiatrist soon. I regret not doing anything about it or telling my parents. I dont know what to do anymore.
