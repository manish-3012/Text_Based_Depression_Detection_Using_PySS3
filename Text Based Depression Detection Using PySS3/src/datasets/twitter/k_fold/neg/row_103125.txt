When does it get better?Since my early teens they've told me it gets better. Well now I'm 23, got an nice apartment, well payed job and the most wonderful fiance in the world, but I'm still suicidal. Even more then I was then. So exactly when is it going to get better? Because I don't know how much time I have left.
