A promise to myselfI've given myself an ultimatum - if things aren't any better by my next birthday, I'm going to end it. Not sure how yet, but as painlessly as I can, I guess.

 I want to give life my best shot but I'm so so tired of feeling this way ALL THE TIME. I've tried to make myself happier in so many ways, but it never works and I'm just in tears every single day. Nobody really gets it (and to be honest, I'm glad - I wouldn't wish feeling this way on anybody) and I'm not going to be a burden to them anymore. They'd never say it, but I can tell I'm draining them all and I hate myself for that. Plus, I don't want to get older and watch as everything slips away. 

So either I'll improve the situation or end things before they can go downhill any more than they have.
