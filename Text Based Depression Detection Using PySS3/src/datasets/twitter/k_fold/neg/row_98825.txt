9 Years of hell, not for much longer though. I want to put myself out of my misery.It's been 9 years of hell. Not one person has sent me to any kind of therapy, no one person gives a damn apart from my wife. 

Seriously, there is no point in going through this anymore. I even went to the psych ward and told them I've had enough and want to kill myself. They said there was nothing psychologically wrong with me and sent me on my merry way home. 

Fuck this. 9 years of lying in bed and literally no one apart from my wife gives enough of a fuck to even spend more than the absolutely minimum time required before they can shoo me off

. Honestly, what would you do in my situation? The medical industry in my country is well known for being full of self-important shits who don't care less about the patients. Unless your have a textbook ailment, they get their money and they send you out the door. The suicide rate here is very high. Now I think I understand why. I never thought I'd become another statistic but I simply have no other way out. 9 years of pain every single day. 9 years too long. 

The biggest irony is that I'm not even depressed, I loved life and I still find the smallest things interesting and I WANT TO LIVE, even if I didn't have a dollar to my name. But not being able to walk and stand like a normal person without my feet burning like mad is impossible. I wish I could give my brain to a pysically healthy person who is depressed. They would be happy and I would be happy knowing at least one of us got a life worth living.

I'm just afraid of failing and ending up as a vegetable, so I keep putting off my suicide. But it's inevitable.

In (perhaps too much) detail, this is my intolerable situation:
