I don't know who I am anymore.I was going to write all about my life and my problems, but what's the point? It will change absolutely nothing. Talking about my problems won't change them. I can't even actively change them. Things don't always get better.

 That is a nice, sugary thing to tell people but it isn't always true. Part of me tries to think things will get better, but the rational part of my brain knows that is impossible. 

Guess I'm just waiting until I am brave enough to finally take my own life. Life has screwed me enough. I should at least get to decide when and how I die. I just wish I was brave enough to have done it already. 

I am 28 years old and I am on my way out. I can't do it anymore. I can't.
