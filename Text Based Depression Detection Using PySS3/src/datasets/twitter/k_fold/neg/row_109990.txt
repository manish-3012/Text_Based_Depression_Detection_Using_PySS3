ExHello, I chose a random community or at least one I know might be brutally honest considering I can admit my own wrong-doings. I've been dating a girl named Sydney for 3 years and we were best friends for 5 years. Funnily enough we were long distance but met up quite a lot and had plans to move into an apartment in august + in june i was gonna live where she lives. She broke it off with me June 19th and said she needed space to find her own happiness without me - honestly i freaked out because I have awful separation anxiety with her + depression + whatever else that isn't justifiable anyways. I harassed her, i spammed her with texts everyday asking for a chance to meet up and discuss things. She came around to it but by that point I was so mentally distraught that I rejected her and said I'd prefer killing myself cuz my plans crumbled beneath me when I thought things were finally looking better. I found out when she dumped me she reconnected with someone she cheated on me with a year and a half ago, I went crazy on her with texts and calls ( her and i were still on good terms at this point). She blocked me and told me she hated me and never wanted to speak again. Of course we reconnected and remained friends afterwards but she was distant and I couldn't fully accept that it was over over. She ended up cutting all contact with me until I got to michigan in which she then tried to be friends but I was pushy and trying to meet up but she didn't want to she just wanted to text every once in awhile. Okay, she drops me entirely. I eventually leave her alone and stop trying to find new ways / reasons to reach out to her and accept that she's gone and what i'm doing is totally creepy and absurd. My friend showed me that the boy she cheated on me with was spending the night at her house and she even did his streaks. Keep in mind when we broke up, she assured me she could never be close to him because she felt truly awful for what happened. I've been in a place of wanting to die and i'm not sure if I'm gonna live past this week but I walked 3 miles in 90 degree heat and showed up at her house to see if she'd just talk to me about this. Stupid, I know. When I got there the boy approached me and told me he'd kick my ass and etc. He put his hands on me and shoved me meanwhile I told him I didn't want confrontation nor was i even on her property. I was leaving because I saw no cars and assumed she wasn't home. I'm not sure what to do but I do know things are done with her and that's the closure I needed. I never expected any of this in all honesty we were beyond healthy in person and I guess that's why she won't see me not only that but she clearly made it obvious. Am I completely batshit boutta go to jail type insane?? I kinda expected she'd maybe at least explain things face to face instead of dumping me over an email and blocking me. She told me she still had feelings and cared for me but she needed to be done but she's already sleeping with someone new? Anyways, I know I did a lot wrong but it's been very mentally tiring knowing the only person who's ever made me feel any happiness whatsoever truly screwed me over the worst in the end.
