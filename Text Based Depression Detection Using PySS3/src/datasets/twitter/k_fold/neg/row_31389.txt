Iâ€™m not going to do it butI want to blow my fucking head off. I donâ€™t come to this sub ever so I hope Iâ€™m not breaking the rules but I just have to vent somewhere. I canâ€™t take the flooding and memories anymore. CSA by my father. Going through major life transitions. Itâ€™s triggered a lot. Diagnosed PTSD. Self-diagnosed functioning alcoholic. I have a good job. Husband. Just bought a new house. I have a son that I would never leave alone on this earth to figure out this dark world alone. I have faith in Jesus. For these reasons I hang on, but I want to die. I have these intrusive thoughts that wonâ€™t stop. I canâ€™t sleep. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Iâ€™m worn down to nothing. It gets to a point that I feel like I have lice and bugs crawling on my skin. Like the whole world is ending. I hate so much self hate and anger. I hate my father. He ruined my childhood and itâ€™s ruining my adulthood. 

No one wants to hear the details. No one wants to hear the stories. Iâ€™m alone with this. My family flinches bc they hate they didnâ€™t see it sooner and that they were close to my father. My husband doesnâ€™t know how to deal with hearing the details so he literally leaves the room to â€œuse the bathroomâ€ if I open up. All of my friends would look like deer in headlights if I told them. Obviously at work I canâ€™t talk about my childhood trauma. I need more therapy AGAIN but itâ€™s so much money. 

Death seems easier. I want to just die. I want to stop struggling and fighting. I hate my father. The grooming and the acts and the after effects. I hate him. The only person I hate more than him is myself and thatâ€™s so fucked up.
