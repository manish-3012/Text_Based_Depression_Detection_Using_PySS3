Why am I a terrible person?Hi, long time contemplator, first time talker. Donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m gonna be doing this right, wouldnâ€™t surprise me if I did it wrong. Like everything else. 

Iâ€™ve never liked myself, always had self esteem issues. A few years ago, I thought about killing myself, but I never got close or anything. 
A couple days ago I got into an argument with my girlfriend, said some pretty horrible shit. We talked it over afterwards, and we forgave each other for all the stuff we said. But I feel terrible about myself, worse than I did last time I wanted to kill myself. My gf is watching me now, making sure I donâ€™t do anything dumb, but weâ€™re not around each other all the time. 
Iâ€™m scared.
