The hotline is burned out and meanI called twice yesterday. They made me feel worse. 1st I got a guy whose English was bad and kept guilt tripping me he wasn't getting paid but he was nothing. I called again I read that's what you're meant to do but the lady I got was even worse. She was irritated and when I said I was depressed cause my house was taken she started lecturing me about foreclosure which was super patronizing. Then she kept inferring I was being difficult finally I said you arent being nice to me LifeLine hasn't helped and I feel worse now and hung up. Up until now my experience with them was ok. I complained but idk if it matters. Fuck me man.
