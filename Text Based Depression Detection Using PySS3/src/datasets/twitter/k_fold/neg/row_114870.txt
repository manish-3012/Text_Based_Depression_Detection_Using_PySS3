I might end it tonight, here is the story if you want to help me...So this might not belong here but I just wanted to share my story. My name is Ralph. So I had a friend since second grade. Her name was Isebella, everybody said that she was identical to someone on the internet called "coco queen" I personally never saw her face but if it helps you piciture it than good for you. Isebella and I hanged out like alot, even when we were 12 to 13 we almost lived together. We always played vieogames, watced netfilx and had the time of our lives. Our families were business friends so they aproved our friendship. The things were kind of awkward around us when we were 14 because our parents always made sex jokes about us when we could hear them. In one night my family and I were having dinner with her family and her father shamed her. She went outside for some air and I followed her. It was cold outside and It was playing Still loving you by scorpians. She fell to me and we accidentely kissed. I said that I was sorry but she said it was ok and she felt the same. We started daiting and hot digidi dog daiting we did, we started drinking together, we spent all of our time together and started even watching horror movies together. It was the best moments of my life. After like 5 months the magic was still there. However everything most come to an end and when I was hedding to her house for Netflix I found her dead with a card  on her hand. I freaked out! I called the police and her family. When everything was investigaded by the security cameras, It was fount out that she commited suicide. I was having a fucking panic attack when I saw her killing herself. I read the note she left me it was fucking insane. She made me a braclet that I still wear. It has been a month since the event and I still can't believe my fucking self that it happened I started seeing a therapist but I dont think it works. I was the only person who really understanded her complesity. And yea it truly sucks.
