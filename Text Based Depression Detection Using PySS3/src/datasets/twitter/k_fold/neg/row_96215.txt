How do I become comfortable with the idea of living?I just don't know what to say or do from here. 

After several failed suicide attempts, six rounds of therapy/counselling, multiple medications and doses and all the support available to me, I still only find myself wanting to die. As long as I can remember really, there has been these constant impulses, urges and thoughts, that I should end my life. 

I don't feel comfortable with the idea of living. Nothing about it appeals to me, but people need me to be alive. Mainly my mother, she needs me. It would kill her to find me dead, and I can't do that to her. But once she's gone, I'll have no further reason to hang around. 

I know I should be afraid of these thoughts, that the concept of dying should terrify me, but I only feel okay and calm when I contemplate it. 15+ years of suicidality and it shows no sign of slowing down; in a weird way it has become my solution to everything. "It's okay for this to go wrong, you're going to kill yourself anyway". I'm tired of the hospitals, of not being enough, of being disabled, of being in physical pain. I just want to feel okay.

I don't want to be happy, I just want to feel okay for a few days here and there. I need some kind of relief from this. The self-harm and suicide attempts can't go on forever, I just need help.
