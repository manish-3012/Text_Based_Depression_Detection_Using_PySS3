Thinking about suicide... recalling sexual abuse... I think...A few days ago, I was working on a timeline of nodal events in my life with a psychologist. Some of the events were tough but I could vocally talk about them as I wrote them down. Then I recalled an event. I'm currently 27 (male), and this happened when I was around 20 or so. 

I met this guy online. We chatted a bit and finally met. He picked me up, and we went for coffee. Then I decided that we should hang out at my place. He seemed alright and normal. We were just talking, and he kept trying to move the conversation to sex. I told him that I didn't want to do that. He started to put me down and tried to talk me into it (I can't remember what he said but I felt guilty and like I owed him something). This went on for what seemed like hours. He wouldn't leave my apartment. He was blocking the entrance. I felt trapped, all while he continued his verbal manipulation. I don't know remember how we ended-up in bed or how my clothes were off. I remember him touching my genital area and him making me touch his. It felt so wrong. I remember panicking. I remember more verbal abuse. I remember feeling terrible...like it was my fault... and I remember the relief when he finally left and I locked the door. 

I've blocked this event out, not thinking about it much until I thought about it in my therapy session. I told the psychologist that I couldn't tell her but I would write it down for next time. When I drove home after the session, I broke down, cried, felt a lot of anxiety. Just parked on the side of a country road, all in the dark.  Was this sexual abuse? Was it my fault? I'm not sure what it was. I'm thinking about suicide. I have a plan, bought the means to go through with it, and visited the place where I want to do it. What is wrong with me?
