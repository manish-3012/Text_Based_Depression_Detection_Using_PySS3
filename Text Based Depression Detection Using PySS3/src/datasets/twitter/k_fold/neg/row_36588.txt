Everything's terrible, Utterly alone, Nothing to really live for, Anyone care to talk for a few?I don't really know what to put, I've never reached out to anyone before, but I have no other options, and I've actually talked to people on reddit that were a lot... better? then people I personally know, so I'm hoping someone is reading this.

I'm at the point of totally giving up, I just really need someone to talk to, even my local crisis center hung up on me...

I don't feel like explaining my whole life story, but pretty much:

in 2010...
-Over weight all my life, heaviest weight was 490lbs when I graduated from high school.
-Never tried to develop social skills as a child, took whatever friends I could get, no relationships, all due to self esteem issues and a sheltered upraising from my parents.
-After leaving highschool, fell into a world of drugs which led to an overdose, which left severe liver and kidney damage.
-Lost my Job, have been unable to find employment since then.
End of 2012.
-Now weigh 178lbs, Look totally different and know one remembers me. When they ask how I lose it, I have to give them some lame excuse instead of saying hard drugs and an overdose will do that.
-Anything I found joyous and fun is now bland and boring.
-On multiple medications for pain and mood issues.

I've actually overdosed again on Gabapentin four nights ago when the girl that I ever came closest to loving told me to "Fuck off and never talk to her again" and then proceeds to hook up with some other guy who was using me this whole time... Anyways, I woke up a couple hours covered in puke and blood and extremely confused. I cleaned myself up and acted like nothing happened...

If anyone cares, I'll tell them more. I really need someone to talk to, my grip on life is slowly loosening and I'm really not attempting to hold on..
