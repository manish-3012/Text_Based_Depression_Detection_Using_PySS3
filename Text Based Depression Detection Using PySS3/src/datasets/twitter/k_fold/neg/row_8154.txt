Just need to ventI wouldn't say I'm suicidal exactly, I just don't want to live anymore. If there was a button that could take me out this world without hurting anyone I'd press it in an instant. I'm fed up of living. I'm constantly stressed, sad and feeling lonely. I don't know who I can talk to, and I feel like no-one really cares since my problems aren't as big as others. I feel guilty for feeling like this, I have no reason. Sometimes I think that maybe everyone deals with this and it's all in my head. Maybe I'm just overreacting. Maybe it's normal to think about buying a load of over-the-counter medication in case the situation gets worse. Maybe it's normal to not want to leave my room ever and stay there until everything's over. If it is I'm sorry for bothering you. I don't even know if this is the right subreddit to post this in. I don't know much anymore. I don't where I'm going in life, who I am, who does and doesn't like me. I don't know what happened to the happy, carefree child I used to be. When did that change?

P.S. if anyone gets offended that I posted this in this subreddit I'm really sorry, I didn't know where to post it and I will delete it if it annoys anyone
