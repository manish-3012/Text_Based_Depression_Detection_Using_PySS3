Considering ending my life.Hello. I'm a Venezuelan 20 years old man with schizoid personality disorder, and I'm thinking about killing myself. 

The reason why is that... I feel like I'm a waste of space; my whole life feels bland and unexciting. I've been a loner since I was a teen, never fell in love, never kissed, never made any friends. I lack empathy and desire to connect with others, it just doesn't feel rewarding or natural.

Three years ago, I moved away from my parents to start my college education. I recently dropped those studies, I realized I don't have the profile for a psychologist nor the interest to really become one; but... there's nothing else that motivates me, no vocation for anything I've seen, nothing feels appropriate, meaningful or satisfying to me. 

I cannot see a future for myself and I'm devoided of the drive to go out there and find or create one. On top of that, I live in a country with a massive political and economic crisis, where protest and repression have been regular since the last two months; where the is high criminality and little food, goods or opportunities for a decent life. 

What's the point of me living then? If I cannot have a place in society; if there is no meaning in my actions; if there are no emotions in my life nor people to share them with. What am I to expect? I'm tired of wandering between emptiness and despair; afraid of becoming a burden for others.
