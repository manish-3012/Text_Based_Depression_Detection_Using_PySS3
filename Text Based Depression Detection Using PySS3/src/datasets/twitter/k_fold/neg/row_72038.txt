One last goodbyeHi, so this is kind of a goodbye statement or something along those lines. I have decided to end my life as of June 1st. I just wanted to thank you all for your nice words &amp; messages! I really did appreciate you guys trying to help, I wish you all the best my friends. I also wanted to say that nothing anyone will say or do will convince me otherwise Iâ€™ve literally tried for years now. Iâ€™ve packed my things, wrote a couple of letters to a few people who might be want to know why I did what I did etc. Iâ€™ve neatness up my room too and Iâ€™m prepared. I tried ending my life a couple of times but none of them worked, I either bailed out or on one occasion the rope snapped and I could bring myself to do it again, so this time Iâ€™ve decided that Iâ€™m just gunna jump into the canal so I will know thereâ€™s no going back. I am much calmer now that Iâ€™ve accepted what Iâ€™m going to do to myself. I havenâ€™t been this calm in years in fact. Anyways I genuinely appreciate you guys for trying to understand me. This is me over and out. goodbye ðŸ‘‹
