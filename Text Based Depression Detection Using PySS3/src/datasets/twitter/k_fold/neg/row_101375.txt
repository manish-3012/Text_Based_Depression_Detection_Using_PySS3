Lost all energy and can't be bothered to go on.After dealing with this spiral of depression I've been for a long time. I've lost all energy, I feel like shit and then lay in bed all day and feel more shit for doing that but have no energy or will to change, so the cycle continues. I have so many anxieties and insecurities too and I just feel like... Like I only consume everything around me and I feel like a parasyte. No one ever really tried to help me out in the real world, got no friends either in the real world. I'm just sorta laying here all day all night. The only thing that kept me going longer was my friends online but... now I just feel like o annoy and stress them out too, everyone is so close and has at least one close friend. I have an SO and he treats me good but there's no one else in my life who cares for me at all except him. I know I should just make friends and but... What's the point anymore. I'm too useless and unlikeable anywhoo.
I just want my life that was doomed from the start to just end.
I know I shouldn't die cause my family and shit will feel bad, even though they don't like me at all and I don't like me either. 
I'm thinking of ways to end my life. I don't want to be taken away for posting this and like sectioned or something.
