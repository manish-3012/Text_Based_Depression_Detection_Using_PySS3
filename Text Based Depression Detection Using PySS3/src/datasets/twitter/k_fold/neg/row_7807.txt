I can't take it anymoreI'm 15 years old and have hirsutism. I have crazy leg hair,stomach hair,arm hair and chest hair. I can't take it anymore. I wake up feeling disgusting and I go to bed wishing I was never fucking born. I hate myself and no one will ever love me. I wrote a suicide note in case I were to ever do it. I want to. I can't stand myself anymore. Everyone else I  my family is normal, why am I such a monster. My life is just gonna get worse so I might as well leave, but I can't hurt my family. I can't hurt my friends. I cry myself to sleep every night and wish all day that I was normal and not hairy and disgusting. I just want the pain to end. I just want to stop waking up feeling hopeless. I'm starting to think the only way to wake up not feeling hopeless is if I didn't wake up at all, which is why I wrote the suicide note in case I just don't wanna wake up anymore. I'm gonna lose everyone so what's the point? The only reason I'm here is because of my family and friends but I'll lose them too.

Why did this have to happen to me? What did I do to deserve this? Why didbi have to be so disgusting and fucking gross. Why God?


I've lost my motivation for everything. I just want to be okay and ill never be able to feel happy with myself again. I'm so tired. Im so sick of myself and I want to kill myself so badly. 

The worst part is that the hair growth is just gonna get worse. I'm fucking done. Nothing fucking matters and I should just end it before it gets worse. I'm a waste of space.




I want the pain to fucking stop.
