I had this dream last night.It was horrible, i was at a party with pretty much everyone i used to be with and their friends and so on. They all hated me as much as i hate myself. I woke up feeling horrible, ive been telling myself a lie to trick my brain, but I canâ€™t trick it, it knows everything.
Iâ€™m 23 soon 24 male, i had to move in with my parents 2 1/2 years ago due to a downward spiral. Ive gained 35 kgs, and ive not been social at all the last two years. Except 2 times about 1 month ago, but it felt horrible, as im now a diffrent person, even though i managed to act somewhat normal. Idk what to do, i feel stuck, im struggeling to forgive myself for my mistakes and flaws and try to move forward. Fuck man this wasent going to be me how tf do i get out of this
