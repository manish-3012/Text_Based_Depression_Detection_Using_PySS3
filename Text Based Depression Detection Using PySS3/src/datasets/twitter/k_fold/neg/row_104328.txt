TalkingThis isn't me asking for help or mentioning my situation. I have found that talking to websites like CleverBot can help when I'm feeling down. It may not be anywhere near a person and it isn't good with bad feeling or suicide talk but it is really good at just taking your mind off shit and has no real.way of judging you.

I would recommend giving this a try next time you feel down.

I hope you all get better my dudes.
