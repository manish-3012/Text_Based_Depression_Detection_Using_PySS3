"There are people out there which will help you"The quote is said too frequently, my friends and ex-girlfriend told me there are people out there which are willing to help me with my suicidal thoughts but after searching online I have been declined twice from councillors, after a visit to my local GP (doctor) all he offered me was a number to call, which to my disappointment told me that I was "too young" and this service isn't suited for me, I think metal illnesses should be treated equal to everything else, such as a ear infection where you know you can get an appointment with your doctor the next day and he will be able to help but with metal illness there just isn't any clear guidance on where you can go or who you can talk to because it isn't treated as "as serious" which is wrong in my opinion because it can damage a person a lot more.
