I really want to throw in the towel.I don't even get what's going on anymore. People tell me I'm attractive, that I have a good personality and an awesome life, but I have never been on a date. Girls seem to laugh at my jokes and blush at my compliments, but I can never get a date with them. I know dating isn't everything, but, holy fuck, I've never even had it. It just seems like each day that passes makes my life less awesome and more depressing. I just want someone else to admit that there's a point when a guy just needs to stop trying to look for girls and that it's okay to die rather than die from loneliness.
