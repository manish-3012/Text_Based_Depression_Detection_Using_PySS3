I think...I think that maybe I'm not cut out for life. Maybe I don't deserve it; maybe I'm just not good enough or smart enough to make it. 

I do try to think differently, of course; but no matter what I do, I can't shake the lines "You make the same mistake over and over, you stop calling it a mistake; if you just wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up, soon enough you forget why." 

I've gotten to the point where I've long since forgotten why I wake up in the morning, and I think maybe that's my mistake, and the solution is to, well, end it.
