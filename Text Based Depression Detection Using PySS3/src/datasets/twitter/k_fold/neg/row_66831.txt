I hate living, whats newIve been depressed for a long time, 4 - 5 years. Mainly stemming from a couple points.

\-Im not smart at all and have struggled .... here's the thing I cant even type out this damn post. I cant even find the energy to do that. I should be studying my lectures that are recorded but I'm not. I just keep letting myself fall farther and farther behind like a complete moron piece of shit. Right now I just want to die. Its all i think about and all I want. I even went out and bought a tank of helium so I could gas myself. but now i sit here as a huge pussy.

I don't even want to type this anymore. I just want to end my life.

I typed all of that up a couple days ago and now I am a bit more settled. I still think im going to end my life. Probably at the end of the month. I will do it on campus at night that way it makes a ruckus the next day. I don't want to keep living this life anymore. No matter what I do in life I will always struggle so I might as well get it over and done with then waiting around to suffer more. 

But until the end of the month I will keep trying the therapy and keep trying to catch up with the school work. But I already know that at the end of the month I will take my life.

I think its the best option. I'll make one more post around the 20th of oct and that will be it
