GoodbyeThere is nothing left. This world is empty. I am empty. It holds no more for me and I am saying my goodbye. I never found myself. I was lost all my life and still am. If I just died now I would end my suffering. I'm sorry for everyone who might get hurt but I never was meant to be here. I am just an empty shell of a human. 

I don't know what else is there. I just want to be gone forever. I'm not good at anything. I always talk about myself. Look at this post. 

Fuck me. Fuck life. Fuck everything. 

Goodbye.
