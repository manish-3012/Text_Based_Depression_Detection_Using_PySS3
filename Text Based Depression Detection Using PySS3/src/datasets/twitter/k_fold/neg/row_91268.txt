My chronic pain has triggered my depression again.Iâ€™ve struggled with mental illness for a while, but Iâ€™ve been in remission for the longest time since the last time itâ€™s gotten bad. 

Iâ€™ve also struggled with chronic pain for the past 3 years, but recently itâ€™s gotten so bad I actually want to kill myself. 

The issue is that Iâ€™ve already tried antidepressants for pain and prescription NSAIDs. I went to a rheumatologist for joint pain and all he said was that Iâ€™ve got bad hypermobility. Ive got stomach problems, headaches, neck pain, etc. you get the idea. Everything literally hurts and itâ€™s completely exhausting. Itâ€™s driving me crazy. 

Iâ€™ve been to doctors and stuff but thereâ€™s nothing wrong and Iâ€™m still in pain. I want to mention it to my psychiatrist the next time I see her, but Iâ€™m not really sure. I have to get a new Primary Physician because of insurance stuff. If I go to one, I donâ€™t want them to think Iâ€™m just trying to score prescription opioids, because I donâ€™t want them at all. I just want the pain to stop. I canâ€™t focus and itâ€™s begun to have a really bad impact on my life. 

I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
