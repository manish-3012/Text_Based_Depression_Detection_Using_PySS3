Over it all.I hate having anxiety. Fucking over it all. Iâ€™m done, and at this point I wouldnâ€™t mind being in a box. I just want to kill myself. 
Iâ€™m having crazy separation anxiety because my SO is leaving town for a couple days. No big deal, right? Wrong. This is all bad for me. For obvious reasons I just donâ€™t want him to leave me. 
So Iâ€™m crying and telling him I just donâ€™t want him to go and all he tells me is â€œIâ€™m goingâ€. â€œIâ€™m still goingâ€..
Gee, thanks for helping me out here, babe. Obviously his anxiety is a lot different than mine but itâ€™s like he doesnâ€™t care at all about helping with mine. I cried and when he wasnâ€™t helping at all, I left the room and he fell asleep!! Wtf. 
Iâ€™m just ready to fucking die.
