Iâ€™m confusedWhenever I feel bad at the slightest my mind just spirals and I become empty and miserable for a week and then I get better but it happens all the time, whenever Iâ€™m in this cycle I always think like what if I just killed myself, Iâ€™ve googled methods etc but I want to die / cease to exist but not die at the same time if anyone gets me. I donâ€™t want to do it to my mum now that I live with my dad as itâ€™ll crush her but I just want life to stop so I donâ€™t have to worry about anything as Iâ€™m 17 rn and Iâ€™ve got too much stuff to think about and just want to turn my brain off
