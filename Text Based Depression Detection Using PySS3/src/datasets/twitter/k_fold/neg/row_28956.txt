Why can't I Be a decent personI have no idea why I'm such a shitty person, I just am. I can barely function because I'm constantly wanting to end my life. I want so badly to be a functioning member of society but I know I'll never achieve that status. I won't be able to stand another 70+ years of this. I need to end my life so badly and yet I can't. Everything points to me needing to kill myself. I've prayed to God and asked for help and advice and that feeling of hope he gives people, but he doesn't care about me. I know he has no plan for me. I'm scared to kill myself but I'm fucking terrified to stay.
