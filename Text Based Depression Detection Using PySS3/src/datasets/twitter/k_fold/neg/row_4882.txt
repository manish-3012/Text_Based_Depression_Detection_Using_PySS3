I will be strong. I won't listen to any of you negative cruel evil people. I will reach to my dreams. I won't listen to your demotivation and negativity. I won't kill myselfI won't kill myself. I am very very very fragile, but I have a monster inside of me made of steel.

Everytime I break down crying and threaten suicide, that monster made of steel comes out and screams "DONT LISTEN TO THEM". "DONT LISTEN TO THEM". "DONT LISTEN TO THEM".

As long as I just consider myself part of a majority or a group. I become a robot.

I am not like the majority or the minority. I am like me. And I believe in me.

You don't believe in me, but I do believe in me.

#I AM SORRY SUICIDE, YOU WON'T GET TO ME NO MATTER HOW HARD YOU TRY.
