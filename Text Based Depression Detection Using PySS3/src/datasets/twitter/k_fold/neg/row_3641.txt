thereâ€™s no way out of this for me.if someone can name ONE thing besides â€œwait it outâ€, then maybe iâ€™ll be more hopeful. itâ€™s not anyoneâ€™s fault, tho. itâ€™s j the way it is.

my parents r emotionally and verbally abusive and i rly j canâ€™t take it anymore. iâ€™m in ninth grade so iâ€™d have to wait 3 more years. even w college my parents COULD fully pay for it, but they refuse to unless i go to a christian one. manipulation is their best friend

what the hell am i supposed to do? yes, iâ€™ve tried talking to them and setting boundaries and all that, but it doesnâ€™t work. iâ€™ve tried countless times. whatâ€™s my next step besides death?
