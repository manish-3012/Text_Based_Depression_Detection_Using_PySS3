A light that I can't findYes, I am a suicidal one. I am physically, emotionally, and mentally tired. I feel like I am just existing not living. My Own reflection is trying to pull me down, I know there's a light that I can't find, maybe its too far away or maybe Im just blind. Just stop for a moment and looked into my despair eyes and stepped to the farther side of my dream be careful of what you might see so carelessly I am dying hopelessly. I am 21 years old suffering depression probably 4 months from now I'll gonna commit suicide.
