Abuse hurts. My .02.Hello everyone.

Abuse hurts. What I find interesting is a personal philosophy that might help you suicidal people out there who find it hard to deal with the life choices and situations that have been plopped in front of you. Let me preface... im still in a bad place. My personal situation has not changed..I'm dealing a lot better...that is the only deal here. No bullshit my life is still shit... however I've become a bit wise through my own experience and I'd like to share some insight...  These forces that you are interacting with that are making you feel like utter shit... remember the time when you were a child? Can you remember how nothing affected you as much? We let them take this..take this wonderful thing that we have recieved...this life is so much in our head ..I'm not going to tell you how you can get there but let me tell you... please find a way...I really would like to show you but there is no time for guru's...just maybe spend some time to reflect on this. Good luck. With love, me.
