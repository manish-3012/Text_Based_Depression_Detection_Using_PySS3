The Ole Run of the Mill Suicide CrapHello, I hope this post fits here.  Truth be told, I haven't used Reddit in some time and I haven't actually written a post in much longer, so I hope this is formatted correctly.

This is probably the first time I admitted that I have a significant problem with suicide ideation.  Even on the best days I find myself waking up thinking the cliche "I guess I didn't die last night either,"  and on the worst I like to busy myself with concocting elaborate ways to kill myself without causing much damage to my body so as to not traumatize those close to me and especially the poor souls who would have to deal with my direct aftermath.  Personally, I don't think I could ever go through with it, but I can't get the idea out of my head.  Kinda like a fogginess or really thick haze that clears up when you get close to it but comes back when you back away.  

I was wondering if any of you live with something similar?  Regardless, thanks for taking the time to read.
