I just can't explain how I feel, I just don't want to be herewaking up just is a chore, my friends don't seem to care for me, I'm not funny, smart, creative or anything. I'm mtf so I'm just trapped in a body I hate. I know I am a woman but I can't see myself happily becoming one. I have no ambitions, no goals nothing I can't do anything right and I'm just so close to ending it but ofc I'm too much off a pussy to do it
