Selfish thinking on my endIt's my birthday.  My day to request whatever or do whatever according to my wife and her family.  What I want is not another birthday.  Not another day to celebrate whether that's tomorrow or next year.  The more people say "happy birthday" "hope your day was great" wtc. I just want to dive out of the hotel window I'm staying in.  I can just walk out now...and just go somewhere and die.  It would be so easy, but my stupid ass won't do it.  I want to...I don't want to live and hate the day I was born let alone most others.
