Any advice?I am 25 years old. I donâ€™t have any family or friends. There isnâ€™t anyone on this planet who cares about me. I donâ€™t have any potential nor any future. As such, I would like to end my life. Does anyone have any tips to ensure that I can permanently leave this planet? I genuinely donâ€™t care if I go out in a quick painless death or a slow and grueling one. Any tips are welcomed.
