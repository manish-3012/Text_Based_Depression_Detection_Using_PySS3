If I could leave this world for a better one, I would in a heartbeat.I sometimes hope that there's a Heaven, even though I'm not religious. I just hope that there's something better. I know there's not, though.

I just fucking hate so many things. I'm so sick and tired of the cruelty and neglect and all the suffering. I'm tired of people, I'm tired of the world. I'm tired of my brain.

I'm honestly really overwhelmed right now and I just really need to talk with someone.
