Thinking about possibly exposing myself to COVID-19.Iâ€™m sorry. I have to do this, my parents genuinely care more about my neo-nazi, Holocaust denying brother than me, my life has gone to shit since my senior year of high school, and because of my disability I canâ€™t thrive like everyone else can because this world wasnâ€™t made for people like me, and since Iâ€™m too chickenshit to end my own life myself via guns or pills Iâ€™ll have Miss Rona do it for me. My plan is that I go to a hospital or crowded space with more than 10 people in it so that I can contract it and hope it will kill me as slowly and peacefully as possible. Why shouldnâ€™t I?
