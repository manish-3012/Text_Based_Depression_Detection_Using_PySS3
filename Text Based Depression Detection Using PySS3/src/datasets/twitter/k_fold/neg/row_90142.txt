Pregnant and so alone.I found out last night that my boyfriend of 5 years has been cheating on me. This isn't the first time. This actually has put it at a point where I honestly can't remember how many emails I've found, how many texts... we have a 1.5 year old son together. And I'm pregnant with the second. I'm losing all faith and I feel like I'm going to be that mom I didn't want to be. I feel like I'm just going to live this empty life that I'm only living for my babies, whether its with this guy or not. I'm so stuck and just feel alone. I wish I wasn't here. I wish this never happened. How repulsive must I be?
