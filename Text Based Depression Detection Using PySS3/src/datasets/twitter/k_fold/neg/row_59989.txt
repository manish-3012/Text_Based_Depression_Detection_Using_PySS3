Battling.Man, i've never been the kind of person to sit here and genuinely consider "maybe I'm just not worth the air I breathe" but recently my mind has been ticking over.
Like, why the fuck am i here.... it seems like my life consists of one battle after another and the sole reason i exist is to fight.

I just want to be happy.
I just want my family to be happy.
But no matter how hard i Fuckin fight, no matter what i do, I'm always falling short of that goal.
I'm never good enough.

I have a missus i love.
I have a son i would move mountains for.
So why am I just not enough?

As a man who was taught "don't fucking cry! Don't be a girl, Don't be weak" it's so fucking hard to be vulnerable.
But the times i can't hold it in, the times my facade waivers, I feel like im letting everyone down.
I need to remind myself,
I'm supposed to be tough.
I'm supposed to be strong.
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A MAN.
Don't show weakness.
Don't be vulnerable.

If a tear escapes you are a fuckin sook.
Stop that pathetic shit and be a man.

Im saying it right now.
Being a "MAN" is bloody hard.
We too are impacted by the image the media portrays as ideal. 
We too are impacted by pornography not depicting a "normal" and healthy sexual relationship.
We are not immune to the media we consime.

It is hard for us.
Making it from Today to tomorrow is hard for me.

Some days just stopping my car on the tracks is so damn tempting...m
