Getting tired.I don't know where to start. So I will make this sweet &amp; simple.
I'm tired of being the strong one when all i really want to do is to crash &amp; burn and cry.
Im tired of being walked over like a fucking doormat. (I'm learning how to stand up for myself)
I'm tired of being hurt. taken for granted. 
I'm tired of losing EVERYTHING that makes me happy within a year.
I have no one. Im tired of being lonely. 
Im tired of life.
i just want to die than to go on feeling like this for another year.
