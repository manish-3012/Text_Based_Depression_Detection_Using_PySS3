Can'tI can't do it. I hate my job. I hate my coworkers. I hate that all my job searching has been fruitless so far. I hate this car payment that is tying me down. I hate how lonely I feel constantly. I hate that the person I'm so madly in love with doesn't care about me in return. I hate how I look. I hate coming home and seeing the same 4 walls every single day. Every new place I go to is really just the same thing over and over in a different setting. I hate that everyone thinks I'm happy. Even when I tell them I'm not. 

I'm 23 years old and I'm already exhausted. 
Are these really the best years of my life? If so, count me out for the rest of it. This is a shitty ride and I want off.
