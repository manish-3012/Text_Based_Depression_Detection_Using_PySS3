Iâ€™ve probably posted something about this before but I (m18) know for sure now that my best friend (m19) is suicidal what do I do?Heâ€™s been depressed for a long while now but itâ€™s gotten to the point where heâ€™s threatening to give away the life insurance money he got from his father and is driving really recklessly when heâ€™s alone. Heâ€™s also out right said that he want to kill him self but us just afraid to hurt his mom and is waiting for an accident. What do can I do for him what do I say? Especially when he understandably so doesnâ€™t wanna go to a hospital so he isnâ€™t entirely open with his mom or therapist I really donâ€™t know what to do. Also sorry if this is vague Iâ€™m just not entirely sure what to say I can elaborate more if need be just ask.
