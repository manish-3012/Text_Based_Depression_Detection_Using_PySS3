Please give me one reason I shouldn't kill myself?I can't think of one. I have no friends. My girlfriend broke up with me because I wanted something she didn't. The only thing I am good at is theater and it's not like that leads to a future. I am an atheist at a Christian School and everyone is afraid of me. I have no one too turn to, so I have to use Reddit.  I want to die, but I am scared. So please I would love a reason.


Edit: I am fine. I will just watch tv and play Pokemon till I get tired. Thanks.
