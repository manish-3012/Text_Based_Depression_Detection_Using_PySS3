constant pressure to keep going, even though I donâ€™t want toSome days are better than others, but days like today feel like the worst. I didnâ€™t go to school today, I didnâ€™t want to go yesterday but I had practice. The only reason I go to school is so that I donâ€™t have to worry about grades, or people getting mad at me for not being there. I donâ€™t really have that many friends, only two that Iâ€™m really close to, but even then I havenâ€™t been able to see them recently because of a lot of different reasons. 
I feel like Iâ€™m supposed to work hard, Iâ€™m supposed to feel happy so other people donâ€™t worry about me. Today, Iâ€™d really like to die, but I know I canâ€™t because other people would feel sad. Itâ€™s horrible to say, but I wish I could die from some illness so people wouldnâ€™t blame themselves if I died. 
I feel like a disappointment to my teachers and to myself; ever since I was younger I was always told to make good grades, and my teachers always expected a lot from me. Iâ€™m not doing as well in school as I feel is expected, and Iâ€™m starting to question why it even matters if I do well in the first place. Whatâ€™s the point if Iâ€™m not going to do anything with my life anyways? I wanted to be a zoologist or an artist, but Iâ€™m not even good with either subject. Iâ€™m just mediocre and now dread thinking about the future. I wanted to go to college, but now I donâ€™t even know what the point is. Whatâ€™s the point of living, when there are horrible things in life that will likely always weigh me down?
I know that life can be beautiful, but even when I notice its beauty there is always something that comes and ruins it. The state of the world makes me feel hopeless, my lack of skill to do what I love makes me feel worthless, and it seems that the only reason Iâ€™m here is because I donâ€™t want other people to feel like itâ€™s their faults for me feeling sad. 
Iâ€™m tired of having the same routine: I wake up to go to school, then to practice, go home and nap, wake up to shower, eat, and do homework, and then finally go back to bed. I used to really enjoy art, playing video games, being with friends, etc.,  but now I just donâ€™t know what the point of it all is. Iâ€™ve been told things will get better, but Iâ€™ve been told that a lotâ€”things get better for a little, sure, but then it just goes back to how it is. I constantly feel anxious to live up to expectations from others and myself, and even though Iâ€™ve been going to therapy and have been medicated for anxiety and depression, things havenâ€™t really improved long-term. Iâ€™ve been through some trauma and it makes me feel even worse about myself and living, but I feel pressured to keep going because of others. I donâ€™t want to affect others negatively, but I often feel like I just donâ€™t want to keep going.
This isnâ€™t my main account, and Iâ€™m not planning on returning to this one. This isnâ€™t necessarily a goodbye, but simply some â€œI-donâ€™t-know-if-I can-keep-going-on-like-thisâ€ rant. I want to feel better, I really want to feel like life is worth living, but itâ€™s become increasingly difficult for me to try to have hope for something better.
