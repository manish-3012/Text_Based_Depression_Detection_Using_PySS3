A realizationIâ€™ve had the biggest realization: Iâ€™m truly alone. I scrolled through my contacts of people I could call and talk to, and thereâ€™s no one. Either itâ€™s someone I donâ€™t have a personal relationship with, my parents whom I donâ€™t talk to and ignore my calls, or itâ€™s former friends whom Iâ€™ve fallen out with months and even years ago. Iâ€™m the problem. I really donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m still here. I feel as though Iâ€™m wasting time, stalling for something good to happen, when I already know that this is essentially it. I am so tired, but at the same time, I fear the reality that if or when I decide to take my life, Iâ€™ll literally be an empty body, as opposed to me already feeling empty. Iâ€™m thinking this through, and actually trying to weigh pros and cons, but I honestly think this is it. And, like most guests at a party, I donâ€™t like to overstay my welcome
