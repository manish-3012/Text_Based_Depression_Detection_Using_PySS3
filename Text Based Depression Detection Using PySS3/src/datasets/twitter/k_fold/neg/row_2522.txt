I might do it. I cant go back to that houseGetting kicked out of my house, and my only options are go back to my abusive fathers house, or go to my moms who lives off the grid (no wifi, no cell service). I have OCD and i dont think i could spend everyday of quarantine thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking and thinking. Itd be easier to just kms. Fuck this. My lifes a living hell anyway
