I have nothingI have nothing, like there's nothing I want or deserve. All I want is someone to be happy to spend time with me or to smile at me. Ofc I would prefer to have a partner but I would die to just have a good friend. I've never had either and I never will. People around me win life by simply existing and whenever I complain I get laughed at. I've felt like killing myself multiple times but I just feel like if I do no one will bother to remember me and I think that will just show how pathetic I am
 Idk why I'm posting here lol I just have no one
