My depression (just texting trying to feel better)*SORRY FOR BAD ENGLISH*

After my grandma passed (2011) i started to feel sad, and i though that was normal. Weeks, months and years later i was not feeling better, my favorite things became boring, everything became boring, nothing made sense (in a existential way), i became fat (was a soccer player in college), i started to think that i was a person that my friends didn't like, just live with, that the girls who i dated were with me fot pity, and one of those were maybe my first love but i fucked up everything (like aways). More time passed and this awful feeling became bigger and bigger and i decided to kill my self, i planned every thing but in THE day i was too drunk and afraid that i couldnt do it, because i was weak and i knew that i would hurt my family so bad.

After that i went for help (2015) and till today im using medications and im feeling better, really, i do things like a normal person, work, study etc. but i still cant see color in life. Im not like before when i had actually desired my family to die so i could kill my self without guilt, but im not feeling good. When i have bad days like today, i cant sleep thinkig about so many bad stuff, some of then i know domt make sense and sometimes i just feel very bad without reason. Mental ilness is like that, we feel bad for things that exist, things that we made up and sometimes for no reason.

Im writing this to remember that i have a diasease but no matters what i say to myself there is people who cares for me, love me, an I love them too.

When my family goes, i will finish with my life, im tired of living for others and only feel "happy" when im high. Im still fat, with problems in love relations and without willpower to do lot of stuffs and i dont belive that i will ever get rid of this feeling, it sucks? Yeah, and nothing will solve that, so lets try make a little less painful to not hurt those who loves us (THEY EXIST)
