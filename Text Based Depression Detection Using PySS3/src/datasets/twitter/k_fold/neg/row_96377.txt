Please help me.I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. 

Iâ€™m a 15 year old kid from the city, get decent grades, have a fair amount of friends and maintain a good relationship with everyone around me...but I want to kill myself. 

I donâ€™t even know whatâ€™s wrong with me but I think Iâ€™m going insane; Iâ€™ve lost interest in most things around me and only participate in them to burn away time. My parents divorced when I was 7 and all the drama that came later in my early teens that almost killed me inside. Recently I visited a psychologist and was diagnosed with severe depression, he didnâ€™t want to put me on any medication yet as he is still trying to learn where Iâ€™m at. Even when he asks about my problems and what leads to the mental state that Iâ€™m at today, I canâ€™t seem to get my head around it and telling him just seems like a waste of time because he doesnâ€™t understand me. I feel like Iâ€™m judged even though I understand that it is his job to know, I also feel like nobody will ever understand me. Iâ€™m going to give it another try but so far Iâ€™m helpless and I just donâ€™t understand whatâ€™s going on. 

If I can kill myself right now, without pain, without hurting my parents, I would 100% do it. I feel like a pre-programmed robot, just trying to live an extra day everyday. Please, I really want to make my parents proud one day but I just canâ€™t see myself anymore. 

Please help me.
