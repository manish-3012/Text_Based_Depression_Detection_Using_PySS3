Even tho I'm happyahhh you beautiful souls.. life sucks. 

How did I escape years of abuse find love and happiness with family and friends and yet If a car came barreling my way I wouldn't move?

I'm *happy* but I still don't want to be alive. I was told "it gets better" and then I grew up and the same people were like "well...it doesn't get better, but at least you're older" 

Wtf? What? The? Fuck? So I'm just supposed to accept all those years of molestation, accept that because of my abuse I'll never be normal? I'll always have depression, bipolar, anxiety, PTSD, fucking *schizophrenia* because of what happened that was out of my control. I'm gonna be miserable all my life even when I'm happy as can be and I'm supposed to be *grateful?* 

I go to therapy, I worked on myself, I made all the right possible decisions I could and still do. *Fuck* even my psychiatrist told me "you should recognize how resilient you are. Most people who went through what you went through would come out in a lot darker place, if not dead. Youve done everything *right*" Everyone says this to me who finds out my story, despite my loving personality. WHAT??????? I DONT WANT TO BE RESILIENT I WANT A CHILDHOOD BACK WHERE I WAS LOVED AND NEVER HURT.

I've already decided. If I don't have everything I want and everything figured out to a T by the time I'm 25 (I'm 20m), I'm flying to San Francisco and throwing myself off the bridge. Don't try to convince me otherwise.
