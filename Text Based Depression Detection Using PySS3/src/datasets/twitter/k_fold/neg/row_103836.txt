Benzo addictionNot sure how to preface this but Iâ€™ve had a very serious benzo addiction since I was 17. Itâ€™s not how they make me feel. Itâ€™s the blackouts. The passing out for days. Feeling disconnected from reality. Too dazed to care about things that seemed like the end of the world. I buy off some shady â€œfriendsâ€ in hopes a laced Xanax would kill me.
