I am in the brink of giving up. I just wanna end the suffering. (Vent)I am 17, I've been diagnosed with OCD, MDD, and SAD.

I am fucking tired, no one gives a fuck about what I am going thru, especially my dad, I've seen 2 psychiatrist, one I stopped seeing for some reasons, and the 2nd one just misdiagnosed me at first then give me antipsychotics that made my symptoms and gave me bad side effects like hallucinating, luckily I stopped immediately cold turkey, but it was followed by a week of hell.

After that my dad have came to a conclusion that no one will gonna treat me and that every doctors out there is the same and it's up to me to help myself, I've tried, I did fucking tried, I meditate 2x a day, exposed myself, exercise all this kind of shit but my mind is keep fucking with me, maybe my chemicals and neurons are not normal out there, and need some serious rewiring. My mom understands my pain but she can't fucking do anything because she has no money and my dad has our family's possession.

My anxiety and depression took away everything from me, my passion, my friends, my social life, my love at learning things, and my happiness overall, and my personality and sense of self. I am tired, I feel hopeless, I am trying everything I can do but it's not enough, been bullied by people whole my childhood, been abused mentally and emotionally for 2 years by my own relatives, living in a third world country where I am an outcast, and my dad is neglecting us, man fuck you life give me a fucking break, I think life is not meant for me, I used to love learning and love life itself, but now, I became a depressed, boring, loner, and maybe a loser that no one gives a shit about. I think suicide is the only option, I don't know man. The fuck is the purpose of life if you can't feel pleasure or rarely feel emotion besides sadness, emptiness, and anxiety. Fuck this shit man.
