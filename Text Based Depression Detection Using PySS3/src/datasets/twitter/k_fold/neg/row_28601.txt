Need a better way outOK so I've been trying to kill myself for 8 years now, in my defence I was 12 the first time and had no clue what I was doing
Just recently I've tried setting myself on fire, I panicked and put it out being only mildly burned.
Ive overdosed more times than I can remember, usually take a few grams over the lethal dose and spend a few days feeling like death but I'm always still alive.
I tried falling asleep in a road and just got detained by the police and I've tried cutting my throat but I was to weak to do it properly.
Even tried hitting my head with a hammer a few times, hurt like an asshole full of angry wasps but apart from what seems to be a permanent headache it was fine.
I can't seem to tie a good enough knot to hang myself and I don't have a car.
The only ideas I have left is to jump in front of a train, though I wouldn't want to do that to the driver, or maybe stab through my eye?
I need something that's physically easy, though it can be as painful and long as needs be. Haven't really tried drowning yet, but that's the plan in the next day or so. I'm pretty sure I'm immortal though and that does not seem to be helping the situation.
I want to make it look like an accident so my family aren't as upset but at this point I'll do anything
