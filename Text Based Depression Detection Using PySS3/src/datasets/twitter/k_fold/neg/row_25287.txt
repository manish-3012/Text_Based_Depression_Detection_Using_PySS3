Itâ€™s settling in...Ive attempted several times before, hanging mostly though I tried to crash my car one time... I wasnâ€™t really ready to die. It was all pretty half-assed. But I finally realized it doesnâ€™t actually get better. It gets worse. Obviously this was tough to swallow at first but now Iâ€™m ready to end it for real this time. I have a fool proof method. Just costs $$ I donâ€™t have at the moment. But I will soon. Iâ€™m planning on New Years, but Iâ€™m pretty excited tbh.. I might cave and go for it the day after Xmas. Anyone else made peace with it and actually pretty stoked? I havenâ€™t looked forward to something like this in years lmao
