Am i depressed or just a coward?22/m. I have been living with suicidal thoughts for over 3 years now. And have tried several times. Get this, the reason for my suicide attempts is because I am a failure. It's pretty funny. Anyway, I still have suicidal thoughts. Haven't acted on them for a while, a year maybe. But lately for the first time I've been seeing a therapist and so far it's not helping at all. It's been 3 months. Granted that's a short period of time. But to not work at all? I'm not made of money. Neither are my parents(i live at home).

Ok, maybe i should elaborate about what depresses the hell out of me. I have social anxiety and a learning disability. I knew i had one but about a month ago I started to look up what "Title 1" is. Now i was in title 1 for a long time, through middle school. So thats a big chunk of my depression.. I mean what is there to do with my life? I try my ABSOLUTE hardest in school and i manage to get 60-70%?! I don't want to be working at some call center or mcdonalds for the rest of my life. Which at this point would be good just to get some money but I'm too scared to go to the interview!

I was bullied in high school because i was.. well.. i guess annoying. My friends stopped talking to me because this bully told them i was annoying and how stupid/gay I was. So then all this lead to everyone calling me gay and occasionally hitting me. It didn't hurt me a lot being called gay but after a while it just got to me. And i was a freshmen at this point, so of course it would get to me.
TL;DR Anxiety, Learning Disability, What can i do?
