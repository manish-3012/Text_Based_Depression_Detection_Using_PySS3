Just needing a harsh pep talk. It's a overwhelming anxiety that looms over me. Its best friend is this bright and beautiful suicidal thought. Today I was all too tempted to jump off that red bridge. 
Then I seen a cat. It was laying in the grass searching me with its big yellow eyes. And so I took a walk. 


I'll be back to that bridge though. 


The "Your life is precious" stuff doesn't work for me. I need someone to tell me to get my shit together. I need someone to tell me how I can contribute to this world. I need someone to remind me what my moral obligation is.  
I'm healthy, and I have a dog. I recently moved and have left a friend whom I've known since the third grade. I have absolutely no one but myself. Remind me how to cope with that again.
