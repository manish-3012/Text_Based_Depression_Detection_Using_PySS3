I'm done. I give up.I hate myself. I tried to post on /r/rateme to feel a little better. All they gave me was horrible criticism. I'm dealing with horrible stress and anxiety. My normally caring boyfriend tells me to knock it off and that I don't know "real stress". I'm fucking fat and ugly and over stressed and I can't take this shit anymore. I used to brutally cut myself and I'm at least about to go back to that.
