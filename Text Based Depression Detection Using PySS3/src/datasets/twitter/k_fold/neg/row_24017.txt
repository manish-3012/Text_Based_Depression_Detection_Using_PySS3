I can never rest. Suicide is the ultimate rest. No one can bother me after that.I keep getting pulled every which way, and I'm tired of it. I keep thinking bad things are going to happen to me, and I don't trust anyone anymore. I can't take it. Sleep is wonderful and death is the ultimate sleep. I know I can't ask, but just know that I'm open to getting PMs from anyone who wouldn't mind helping. We can talk about how odorless water is. How flavorless crackers are. And how painless a butterfly landing on your hand is.
