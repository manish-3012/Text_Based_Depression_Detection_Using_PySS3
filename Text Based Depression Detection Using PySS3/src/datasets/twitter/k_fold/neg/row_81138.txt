Iâ€™m trapped in a cycle of self hatred and I think at some point in the next year Iâ€™ll end up killing myselfIâ€™m a disappointment to everyone I know Iâ€™m a piece of garbage and nobody likes me it only causes me to hate myself more and I drink more and more every month Iâ€™m hoping at some point itâ€™ll just kill me because every day is misery
