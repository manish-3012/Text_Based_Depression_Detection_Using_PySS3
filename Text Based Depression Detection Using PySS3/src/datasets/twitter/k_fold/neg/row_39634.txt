Help me, please.I am a female and Iâ€™m only 15 years old, yet the thought of dying is overwhelming me. 

Here is a quick backstory v

Before my dad divorced my step-mom, I lived with her an her three kids. Let me just say, those 12 years I lived with them were the worst years of my life. I was constantly verbally abused by her three kids, and even by her sometimes. They didnâ€™t like me simply because I wasnâ€™t their real sibling, and they even told me that. I hated myself and even more, I hated my life. I am a mixed girl, my biological mother is African American, and my father is Caucasian. I grew up in a mostly white neighborhood, and I was always picked on because of the way my hair and skin looked. I was so mad at the world, I always wondered why I was even born. My dad traveled all the time due to his job, which meant I only saw him for 4 days every 6 weeks. 

I felt as if I was alone in the world, and that nobody cared about me. Eventually, my dad finally realized that I couldnâ€™t live there anymore after I attempted to run away from home. He divorced my step-mom in the Spring of 2018. The day I found out was probably the most exciting day of my life. Him and I moved in with my grandparents and are currently still living here almost three years later. My life has been so much better now, and Iâ€™m thankful for all of the love my family has given me. However, my anxiety and depression has recently gotten worse and I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I have no friends at school, I sit at lunch alone most days. Iâ€™m not in school right now due to Covid-19, which I am kind of enjoying because I hate being social. I see people I thought were friends hanging out with people and never thinking to invite me anywhere. Itâ€™s always been me who reaches out, and Iâ€™m sick of it because nobody will ever do the same. Iâ€™ve been feeling very lonely nowadays and itâ€™s really taking a toll on my mental and physical health. Iâ€™m barely eating and I feel like dying every single day. The only thing keeping me alive is the thought of leaving my dad all alone in this world. I want die, but I donâ€™t want my loved ones to be devastated. Iâ€™m ashamed of this, but sometimes I hope to get into a car crash with my family so we can all die together. 

I have a therapist, but Iâ€™ve never told her about those thoughts yet. Iâ€™m not sure if I should because she thinks that Iâ€™m getting better. In fact, my whole family thinks Iâ€™m fine now, and that having a therapist is, â€œunnecessaryâ€. Truth is, Iâ€™m not fine, Iâ€™m just really good at hiding it. I really need help, Iâ€™m afraid one day Iâ€™m just going to snap and end my life. But, I donâ€™t really want to die, I just want to feel alright.
