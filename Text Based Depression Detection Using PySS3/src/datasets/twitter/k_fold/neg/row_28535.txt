It's all uphill from here..Out of coma.. no memory anymore.. Anhedonia, Trauma, no friends/gf, and constant anxiety... I gave my best to improve, but i am stuck.. I feel hopeless and I am thinking about death 24/7. I honestly dont know how i am still alive, i've had in total over 6 near death experiences with drugs and accidents. perhaps god just simply want me to suffer a deliberate painful death.
