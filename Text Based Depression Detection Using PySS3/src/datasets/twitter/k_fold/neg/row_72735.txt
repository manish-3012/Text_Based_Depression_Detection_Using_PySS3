Firearms are really the best option?80% chance of success. 20% chance of making my life more miserable at an epic level.

Why donâ€™t we have a built in â€œcheck outâ€ option? Why doesnâ€™t our society provide one? Iâ€™m being rhetorical here, sorry.

But seriously. Firearms? Buy a gun and pray to god that you aim it properly and that itâ€™s sufficiently powerful?
