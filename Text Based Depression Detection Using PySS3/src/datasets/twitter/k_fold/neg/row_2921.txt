Suicidal for years and years, still trying to feel better...I don't know what else to do to help myself. I keep trying to do  something to feel better because I need to stay alive for at least 4 more years so my son can graduate college. I am starting to act recklessly like, I am looking for something bad to just happen and that's not good. I think I need to go to a residential mental health hospital that can treat meet with ECT or TMS where I can stay for months. But here in Portland, OR there's nothing like that and I have no idea how to get a referral on a place to go. I could fly and stay somewhere. Where do the celebs and people with money go? Not that I have any lol
