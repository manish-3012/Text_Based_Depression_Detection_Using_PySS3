I got busted by cops for weed and found out my girlfriend has been cheating on me the same day.Hey guys. This happened with the cops, found my weed. Itâ€™s so shitty, then my gf has been cheating, gf of 1 year and a half. saying terrible things about me and I had to be up at 10 for work, I went to bed at 8am terrified cause my girlfriend said she was gonna kill herself and kept trying to leave the room everytime I dozed so I had to watch her All night. Went to work and managers criticizing me because Iâ€™m so off. Am I an idiot for being so dramatic? Am I overreacting to all this news? Now I feel trapped cause my girlfriend is saying she will kill herself if we arenâ€™t.
