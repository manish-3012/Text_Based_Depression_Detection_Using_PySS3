I'm terrible and not worthy and wish I was dead at 35yoI have such anger and anxiety that I am a terrible person. I snap at people, can't accept compliments or concern. I can't be happy and make everyone around me miserable. Kaiser docs just keep feeding me pills, going over the same breathing exercises and making sure I don't kill myself. Seems happiness is not possible,  only stayin alive. Which, being the way I am, and how bad I am, and how there is no hope I'll ever be better, why am I still here punishing my fiance and friends with my shitty existence? I dont have a note or a plan, I just wish I could lay down and disappear into the ground, or go back in time and stop my parents from meeting, nullifying my birth. How do people find happiness and a will to live, when the problem is literally in your head? Why continue to exist for the gamble of happiness and not hurting the ones you love? What can I hope for from tomorrow or continuing to live, if I cant fix myself, and my doctors cant either?
