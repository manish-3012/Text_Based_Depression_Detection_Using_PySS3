Posting this to get it off my chest, written in a bad state of mind, sorry for any grammatical mistakes.I feel like i am living someone else's life, i do not find joy in things i used to, i do not find joy in anything anymore, i have changed completely and feel like a shadow of my former self, the people i would give my life for 5 years ago barely feel like acquaintances at this point, i live just so i can be too miserable to ACTUALLY live.

I feel very little, and the feelings i feel are never positive, nothing excites me anymore, nothing affects me in a positive way, i somewhat recently moved to a new town, and i didn't feel a thing during it, i wasn't happy to "restart" my life, i wasn't scared of change, i wasn't excited for it, nor was i sad to leave behind the places and people i grew up with, i just felt like a completely numb waste of a life.

I feel like I'm supposed to kill myself but i am too much of a coward to actually do that, in fact, i am too much of a coward to live too, so i just float through this vicious, meaningless cycle of waking up just to go back to sleep, tired and beaten down, waiting for the grip of death to relieve me, which is taking way too long.

The worst thing is, i didn't go through anything that would warrant these feelings, in fact i had a fairly good childhood, with loving parents who hate me now, which makes me feel like an over entitled, selfish asshole. 

A family that probably hates me, and is sometimes vocal about it, and no actual friends to speak of, make me not feel wanted, i have lost that feeling years ago, i would love for this to end, but i'm too scared, i hate this, yet i can't change it, i am helpless, and an embarrassment to everyone.
