I canâ€™t believe it but I think Iâ€™m suicidalIâ€™m someone who seems to have it all together - to some extent.
But the more I see my children grow and be fine the more I realize how mentally ill I was growing up. 
I wouldnâ€™t ever want to leave my children. 
But we all die one day anyway, so who cares when it is?
I canâ€™t find happiness in anything I do. 
I hate life. 
I canâ€™t share this in real life.
