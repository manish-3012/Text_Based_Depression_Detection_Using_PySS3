Has anyone else had a mood swing so extreme it causes a blackout?A thew weeks ago, an incredibly close friend of mine died of heart failure at the tender age of 22 and I have not been coping well, to the point where I was beginning to get my affairs in order before going to see her again. Last night whilst wallowing in my own sadness, anxiety got the better of me aswell to the point of chest pains. The thought that maybe I had anxietied myself into a heart attack filled me with such thorough elation beyond anything that words can do justice and I think it was about this point I lost conciousness. As I slowly came to, I felt... empty? Finished?...as though I had run out of emotions to feel. I'm not sure how to describe it but after crawling out of bed this morning, I managed to go about my day more or less normally for the first time since getting the news. Only thing is, I still feel an eerie sense of dread that this isn't permanent.  All day I have just been waiting for the next wave of sadness and despair to hit me. I still feel like a ton of bricks, but at the same time not. Aswell as the feeling that it's wrong to be happy despite knowing I will never seen her again in this life.

What the fuck is going on?
