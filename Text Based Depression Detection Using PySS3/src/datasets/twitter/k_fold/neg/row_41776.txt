I want to let goI donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I tried when I was 17 twice, and I told myself just hold on a little longer. Eventually it has to get better. Be stronger, work out, eat healthy, be nice to people, be who you need in someone else. I thought if I lived like that it would make a difference but it doesnâ€™t even matter. It doesnâ€™t get better. I donâ€™t have much fight left in me
