My Life Is OverMy life is over and I have no one to blame but myself. When I was younger I did stupid shit, I said whatever I wanted on the internet- politically incorrect shit. I consumed a lot of edgy content and I regurgitated it. My old friend decided to post it everywhere, and I mean everywhere. Heaps of people have screenshots, people I know and donâ€™t know. I tried to take accountability, I tried to tell everyone the person I was 5 years ago is not the person I am today, but no one listens. Theyâ€™re still spreading it. I think I might kill myself. I donâ€™t know what else to do. They wonâ€™t accept my apologies, they wonâ€™t listen to me. They just tell me I should die. Should I die? I already have lived with this guilt for many years, why should I not? I want to just sit in a bathtub and slit my wrists. Or overdose. I donâ€™t have a gun. If I had one I wouldâ€™ve blown my head into pieces already. I canâ€™t take this anymore. My life is over. How do I disappear. Please someone help me end my pain.
