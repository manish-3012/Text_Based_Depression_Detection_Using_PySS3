Practically every second is tortureI'm so unhappy all the time.  I only get like an hour a day where I'm awake and not unhappy.  I'm so angry and guilty and bored and scared and unmotivated and I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life.  Everything seems super pointless and difficult and the only reason I haven't killed myself is because I'm scared I'll go to hell.  Every little thing that goes wrong feels like torture and everything that I'm supposed to enjoy so much either does nothing for me or only cheers up a little bit for a little while.  I just feel like I'm in a never ending cycle of suffering and there's only one way out.  I wish I could feel happy like everyone else.  I wish I had social skills and a decent attention span and memory like everyone else.  I wish I could feel normal human emotion like everyone else.  I wish I could stop doubting everything all the time and worrying about silly things like everyone else.  I feel so lonely but I don't want to be around others.  Any reason why I should continue putting myself through hell every day?
