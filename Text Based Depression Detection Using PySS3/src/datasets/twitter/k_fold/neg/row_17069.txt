I'm only 16 years old, but my life already feels like it's over.I wanna die. I'm thinking today might be the day. The day I just, push myself. No backing down this time. I'm tired of being alone. The people I try to talk to just leaving or ignoring me. I have nobody to be sad about my death. Life's not fair, life's not for me, I'm done with this pain I'm feeling. Just thinking about ending it makes me so, SO happy....Hopefully I won't be around long enough to read any responses to this. Though, it probably won't get any. Goodbye People of Reddit. (Hopefully)
