I'm fuckedI'm almost about to kill myself. I want to be there for my sisters and All but fuck man, it isn't fair, nothing is fucking fair is it. The best way I can describe this fucking shitshow is a big black bear, it's always there but it's putting you in a bear hug crushing you except it's inside out, my heart feels scattered everyone I love hates themself, there is no point in going on. Besides it will help cut the food budget for the household and still who will fucking notice? I'm angry, I hate myself, I'm always stressed I'm 20. I shouldn't have to deal with this, no one should. Fuck it if I die who would notice. No one because I'm a worthless waste of space in a world of decent people that think they can help. It's all fucked, it doesn't feel real, why is this? Me and my siblings were abused, sexually, Physically, emotionally. Im a ghost no one can here the screams within and no one can help. It's simple as that
