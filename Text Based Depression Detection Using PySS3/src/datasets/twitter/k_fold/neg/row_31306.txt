Urgent help neededMy friend (female, early thirties) is at the brink of ending her life. She has no one to support her. She lives in Huntington Beach, California. I live in the other side of the world and I cannot obtain a visa to travel to USA. I am trying to help over the phone but I am getting no good outcome.

Please let me know of any good organization I can call, or any idea.

Thanks
