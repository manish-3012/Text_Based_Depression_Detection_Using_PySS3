I will never get to do my dream jobBecause of this fucking pandemic. I wanted to be a teacher, but i can't because this pandemic will last fucking forever. What's even the point of living anymore. I don't want to live in a permenantly socially distanced future. Fuck, I want to end it but don't have the balls to.
