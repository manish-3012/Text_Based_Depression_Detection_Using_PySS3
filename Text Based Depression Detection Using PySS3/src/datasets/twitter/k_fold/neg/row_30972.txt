When is someone serious?Does talking about killing yourself make you not serous about the whole thing? I constantly hear people say (when someone tries or succeeds in committing suicide or anything related to that subject matter): Oh I wish that person would've said something, I wish that person reached out, then we could've helped them - or something along those lines. Then, when you do say something ( to anyone really, so far I have yet to find a different response at its core) you are not treated as serious and even like an attention seeker of sorts. So then, what is the correct course of action here, since this is all a little paradoxical: Does one keep it to oneself (and hopefully end the torment) or reach out (seek attention in a disliked way)?
