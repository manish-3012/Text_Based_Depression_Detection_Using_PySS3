I have no hopeFor the past three years I have had this feeling of emptiness but in the past couple of months it has gotten a LOT worse. Iâ€™m always feeling empty and by that I mean I feel nothing. I also lost all motivation to do anything. Hell I can barely bring myself to get food now. I just give up. Iâ€™m done with myself. No mother what I do, who I talk to or what happens to me, I canâ€™t do anything or bring myself to do anything. I have always wanted to learn Japanese and I finally have to opportunity to, someone has offered to teach me. I actually accepted it and I was going great for the first week. But now, like everything I canâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s like there is an invisible barrier that I canâ€™t get past. Doesnâ€™t help the fact that Iâ€™m dumb as a brick and suck ass at everything. Canâ€™t even do simple things like kill my self. I just have no hope anymore. Nothing can help me.
