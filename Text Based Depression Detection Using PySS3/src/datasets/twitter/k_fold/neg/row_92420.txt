I'm a loserI am really frustrated right now because I pretty much have a phobia of girls. Like, not in everyday situations around strangers. I'm normal then. But when I have a chance and want to simply become friends, hang out, etc. I am a total failure. I have no confidence around girls I'm interested in and at this point, it's really embarrassing because I am almost 22 years old. How is it that I got to the point where I can't interact with girls I'm interested in without clamming up? 

I've gotten to the point where I just don't think I'll ever have intimacy. Being close to someone I find attractive just isn't going to be possible when they don't find me attractive because I am probably one of the least confident guys on earth.

I just feel like offing myself honestly. I'm strongly considering hanging myself tonight. I just don't see the point in being miserable the rest of my life.
