Don't want pitty just a reason not to. Please any.I'll start from the beginning I have a beautiful son with a lady that wants my life to be hell. that just turned 2. He lives in va I left their a year ago went to a rehab in fla and got clean from meth. Not easy but did it for him. I flew my current girlfriend. Well she broke up with me today. Down here in February. She's pregnant now moved back to va 3 weeks ago. I've been fighting depression and anxiety for 5 years now. She broke up with me today. I can't get back on prozac on count I have no insurance. My confidence is gone cause my teeth are rotten from the meth and can't afford dental work. The state of va is looking for me to take me to court for child support. And I already send every extra dollar I have to my mom for him she has 50% custody I get 1 hour supervised visit on weekend and cant do that cause I go back to jail when they find me I make 1700 a month working 6 10 hour days and come home sit alone. Only friend I have overdosed and died last week I should of did something said something to someone but didn't. I live in constant anxiety and depression I can't talk to any one cause I feel like I'm bothering them. Ive been fighting the thought of ending it but made my mind up on how and when. I was Google how it feels to die by heroin I think it will just be like falling asleep. When I heard bout this place I'm willing to try anything. But with out my kids and the love of my life. I honestly don't think I want to live I've had less anxiety since deciding on checking out. I honestly feel it's expected from me and every one is just gonna be better off with out me dragging them down. Idk Sep 9 Im planing on buying a 8 ball of h. And just go until I'm asleep.
