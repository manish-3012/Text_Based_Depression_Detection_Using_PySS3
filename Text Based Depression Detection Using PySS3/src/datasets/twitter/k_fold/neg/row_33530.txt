Not sure if this is the kind of thing I should tell my parents (M25)Not sure if this is the right sub for this post.  If not then please direct me to the right community.  I've had the occasional suicidal thought.  Never actually made an attempt since these thoughts are fleeting and I figure that it'd be pretty inconvenient to the people who care about me.  Last semester I took a job as a teacher that really increased my stress level.  I slept every other night due to stress and I was not handling it in a healthy way.  I had an uptake in the amount of suicidal thoughts.  I quit that job, and am in a healthier mental place, but a financially worse one.  My folks are trying to convince me to take another teaching job and I don't want to put myself back into that kind of situation.  I'm having a hard time explaining to them how bad it was for me without mentioning my occasional suicidal thoughts (which I've never told them about).  The issue is that I don't want them to make a big deal about it or get therapy or anything like that.  I just want them to get that it was a bad place for me.  I'd appreciate any advice that I could get.
