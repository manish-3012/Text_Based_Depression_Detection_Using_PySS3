Maybe tonight.Maybe I'll finally have the guts tonight. 
Maybe I'll finally stop letting others hold me back tonight.
Maybe I'll finally take the pills tonight.

My boyfriend doesn't want to be my boyfriend anymore. My best friend is tired of dealing with me. Neither is talking to me. And... they're all I have. That's all. Two people. And neither of them could care less about me. I had more people! I did! But they all left me. But. Soon everyone else will leave me too. No one cares. Nobody! I have a lighter, a razor to dismantle. I'll take care of this one way or another. I've been clean from SH for a few months now, but aren't records meant to be broken? Yep. Bye. Thanks for everything. Hopefully I won't wake up in the morning.
