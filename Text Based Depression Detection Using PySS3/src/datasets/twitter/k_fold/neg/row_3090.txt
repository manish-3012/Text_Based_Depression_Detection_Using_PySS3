Boyfriend just broke up with meIâ€™m so tired of people loving me then leaving me. It fucking sucks. And I know Iâ€™m a good person that people should want to be around, and I have value, so why the hell do people keep leaving??? I know and am fully aware how entitled this sounds. Iâ€™m just tired of people saying that oh Iâ€™m such a catch and tha tbullshit but nothing ever coming to fruition even when itâ€™s a healthy relationship that Iâ€™m selflessly giving my all to. Itâ€™s never enough. Iâ€™m done.
