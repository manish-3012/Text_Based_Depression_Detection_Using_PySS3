Thereâ€™s no joy leftI spent too much of my life trying to enjoy it- to find myself. To make magic or some other bullshit. I should have spent more time caring for others, empathizing. And now I have used up all the joy.. Iâ€™ve used up all the fun. And the prospect of living one more day like this is so bleak. I have one friend who will talk to me. One friend that I could maybe tell about these feelings, but they leave tomorrow. I hate myself. I canâ€™t stand to be inside myself. I am in the darkest place Iâ€™ve ever been and I donâ€™t see any light.
