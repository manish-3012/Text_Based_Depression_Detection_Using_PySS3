Always had the feeling I'll kill myselfEver since I was real young, maybe 9 or 10, I always had the feeling I won't live to be 30. I've just always genuinely believed it. My uncle who killed himself apparently used to say the same thing when he was young. He died at 31. Since then, his wife, and at the time 15 year old son have also committed suicide. I've also seen my sister attempt suicide more than once, and I know there will be more to die. Including myself. Is it possible I'm meant to kill myself? I think of it often, even when I'm not very depressed. I attempted it once when I was 13 at school, but my teacher saved my life. Maybe I'm just dumb and overthink. I think I'm dumb as fuck.
