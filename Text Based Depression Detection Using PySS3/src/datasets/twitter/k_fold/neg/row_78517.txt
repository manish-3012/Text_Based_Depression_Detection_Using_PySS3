I volunteer at the only suicide prevention centre in my cityIrony.


I guess you could say Ive progressed since it's been less than a year that i was going to them as a client. Now im a well known volunteer. I dont think I've come across anyone i spoke to last year as a client. I think I'm lucky. There must be high turnover.


It just kinda sucks that i don't have that place as a resource anymore. I'm on my own.


Maybe i should volunteer then. Listen to other people's harsh life stories to wash away mine. Yeah, that's healthy.
