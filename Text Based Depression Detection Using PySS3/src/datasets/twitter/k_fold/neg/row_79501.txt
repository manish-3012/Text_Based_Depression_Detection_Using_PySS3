Suicidal thoughts are backI already have a plan about how I will die. Iâ€™ll overdose on medication or cut myself until I bleed out into the bath.

I donâ€™t have a reason to fight it any more. Sometimes I think I have the actual ability of being invisible because of how often I go unnoticed at school and in my own house. Friends donâ€™t care, sister doesnâ€™t care, mother doesnâ€™t care, and my father doesnâ€™t care. Whatâ€™s the point anymore? Why live on if nothing matters any more.

Iâ€™m already giving in cutting my thighs. I think Iâ€™ll be dead by 16.
