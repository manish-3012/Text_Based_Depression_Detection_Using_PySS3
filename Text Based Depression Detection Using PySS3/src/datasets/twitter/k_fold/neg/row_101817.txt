How did I not die?Iâ€™m not amazing with numbers, saying I now have to repeat sophomore year of high school. A few months back I was watching some anime movie, five centimeters apart, and casually grabbed my bag full of pills layed them on my bed and just took them like it was nothing. I wasnâ€™t thinking and I just did it, I regretted it after thinking about how Iâ€™d be leaving my poor cat, at least my parents could have taken care of her. I took around 250 pills In total donâ€™t know exact numbers but have a decent ballpark of the numbers

100-81mg aspirin 
10- 25mg diphenhydramine 
10- 10mg ssri cylexol
30- Acetametophin ~500mg
50- pseudoephedrine 10mg

Some others probably canâ€™t remember very well.
I just went to sleep woke up, felt normal, went to school and just felt like total shit but I also felt somehow high as fuck.  I fell asleep in every class came home slept next day no issues. No issues at all, even had a unrelated blood test for my eye with arthritis called something blah. And came a little you see usual numbers for red blood cell count. 

I just donâ€™t understand how I survived, Iâ€™m not doing much better, I was but now everything is kinda fucked Iâ€™m realizing that I love to live but hate to be alive I really have no way to explain it. But life is beautiful and I love it because itâ€™s so diverse but when alone I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myself. Itâ€™s been this way for a month or so. I really want a person I can embrace cry and just be with naturally idk. But anyways back to topic 

How did I survive?? 

Sry for any mistakes in my writing
