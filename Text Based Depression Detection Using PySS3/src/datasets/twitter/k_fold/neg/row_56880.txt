I posted this in r/depression too but I'm feeling really shitty. Yesterday was my birthday... I don't know why I bother anymore.So I made plans to have a party today. I invited people a month ago, reminded them a week ago. A few people said they were down so I bought a 60$ bonfire permit for today. A lot of money for me right now since I'm broke but I wanted to have a happy birthday for once. Well my birthday rolls by and I don't hear from anyone, and had another loneliest day of the year. Today I reached out to the people that said they're coming and either got no reply or they couldn't come. From literally everyone.

This is the second birthday in a row that something like this has happened and I spent it all alone. Maybe 3, I can't remember. Not to mention every other holiday where people are out having fun(Halloween, ect.). I haven't actually hung out with any of my "friends" since before I graduated college a year and a half ago.

I've been doing all the things that are supposed to make you feel better, like going to the gym, trying to get into university for something not worthless like my college degree, quitting my toxic job, deactivating facebook but none of it is fucking working. I just want a fucking friend.
