I haven't felt like this in so long.I can't stop crying. Just a failure. It hurts to feel like this. I torture my friends by feeling like this. By telling her so many awful things about myself. I don't see a future for me. A drop out. A waste of time, energy and air. Why me? Why do I get to live? So many people deserve this life. So many people die and so often. Fathers, mothers. Why them and not me? Why am I here?  Jobless. Without experience. Fat. Stupid. So many people deserve this chance. And yet I am taking their seat. 
I don't want to feel like this anymore.
