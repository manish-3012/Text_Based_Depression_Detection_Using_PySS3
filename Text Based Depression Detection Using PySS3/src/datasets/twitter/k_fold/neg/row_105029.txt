No one is listening even though Iâ€™m crying out.Short story Iâ€™m feeling down as my mother died earlier this year. Got bad news about my step mother with cancer earlier this week and itâ€™s my moms birthday. Thereâ€™s  also some personal things going on thatâ€™s just making this too much. Iâ€™ve been sitting in my room staring out the window listening to music and itâ€™s making it worse. I know thereâ€™s much worse things people go through but Iâ€™m at a breaking point. I canâ€™t keep going feeling like this.
