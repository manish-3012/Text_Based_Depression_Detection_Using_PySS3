staring down a bottle of paint thinnerread a bunch of stories about life after death about suicides. they aren't all bad. it sounds like i'd spend a lot of time after death wondering wtf i did here and needing to wrap up loose ends, so i would just come right back. i'm ok with that. it's just my life right now is awful and it got really fucked up somewhere along the way where i'm incapable of doing anything for anyone anymore. nobody will hire me. what's so wrong with me you guys? can somebody help me get a job? it's been so long. i'm sitting here googling ways to make paint thinner taste alright.
