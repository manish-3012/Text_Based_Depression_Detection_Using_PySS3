Trauma on Top of Trauma; It's Too MuchSo, I read about people who hurt but they have boyfriends/girlfriends (someone who cares about them). They have jobs. They have family lives.
I cannot even begin to regurgitate my failure of a life story now. But aside from a car accident (third one, none my fault), my landlord who lives upstairs yelling at me for things that are not fair and making me feel unwanted and like I'm in a hostile atmosphere, I tried to get a second job...a tutoring company. I answered all the questions correctly, and they say they are desperate for tutors. After the online interview, they did not hire me. I can get nowhere in this world. And I am 57, unmarried and scarred by trauma. Why would someone want to live if there were no love to have, and the struggle with poverty has been wearing me down thin for decades and I am ready to cave. I see no reason to carry on.
