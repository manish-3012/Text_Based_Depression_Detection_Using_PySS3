I donâ€™t believe in GodI donâ€™t believe in God but how I wish he would kill me, the most brutal way possible I donâ€™t care. I want to die in pain, I canâ€™t handle this numb yet exhausting feeling of wanting to disappear into the fucking air. I want to feel my death, fucking take me you say you are the savior and love all your children. If you loved me youâ€™d let me die, 5 times wasnâ€™t enough. A 6th hopefully will be.
