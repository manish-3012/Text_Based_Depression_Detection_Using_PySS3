Do you trust yourself with high places??I dont know if its just me, doesnt matter how I feel at any moment, when I look down from my balcony, I feel a big urge to just like, jump down. I live on the 17th floor. I have to intentionally rush back out because I cant trust myself with staying and not trying to jump or so. Its like when I see  a knife, i have an urge to stab myself with it but I dont. How do you make sure you never follow these urges?
