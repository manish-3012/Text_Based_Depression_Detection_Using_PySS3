Itâ€™ll be over soon and Iâ€™m oddly calm about itThere's no hope for me, I'm plagued by depression and anxiety. Every day is unbearable and the distractions don't stop me from having these intrusive thoughts. Medication and alcohol help me cope with this anxiety, but it is no longer sustainable. I can't do anything anymore and there is nothing I can do.

By the end of the lockdown it'll be over, and this idea is the only one that's calming me down right now. It's all set.
