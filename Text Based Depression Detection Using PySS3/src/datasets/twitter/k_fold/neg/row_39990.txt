I shouldn't existI'm a stupid, ugly, boring, weird waste of space that does nothing. Everyone hates me, i'm always alone and theres no one that I love or that loves me. Suicide is necessary for me, I need to die. My life isn't going to get better, it just gets progressively worse every year. Why should I make myself suffer like this, knowing it's never going to get better when I can just be dead and done with it. It's not like anyone will really care.
I'm ging to kill myself on my next birthday unless something suddenly turns my life around and gives me a reason to live.
