Is it just me?I had a mental breakdown about ten years ago and actively tried to commit suicide. I was living with my parents at the time and was repeatedly told to "snap out of it" "stop dramatising life" and to just "get on with it like everyone else". That time passed but last year I found myself feeling suicidal again. It scared me. I decided to reach out to my sister and my husband and tell them how I was feeling. I was at breaking point. My husband wasnt too bad I suppose. He listened if nothing else. My sister though told me she had enough problems of her own to deal with and couldn't be coping with mine. 

Its left me feeling that if I do get to that point again there is nowhere to turn. People in my life dont care. Even when I make myself totally vulnerable and completely open to them. My biggest source of support is strangers that dont know me on the internet. It's pretty shit knowing your own family dont care.
