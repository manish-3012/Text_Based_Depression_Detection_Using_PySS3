Chronically ill. Suicidal.Sorry this is kind of long. I just have a lot to say and nobody in real life will listen. 

Iâ€™m chronically ill with, what my doctors call, a severe case of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. All of my joints dislocate on a daily basis, sitting too long will cause fabrics to rip into my skin, standing up makes me blackout instantly and I hit my head regularly because of this, I can no longer walk and use a wheelchair to get around, I have a problem with literally all of my organs from this, and Iâ€™m constantly in pain. There is no cure for this shitty disease I was born with. As of this year, I canâ€™t drive anymore without vomiting or falling asleep. 

Since itâ€™s gotten worse this past year, Iâ€™ve been struggling in school. Since I have accommodations through my universityâ€™s Accessibility Resources, I have excused medical absences and no late penalty for assignments. However, all of my professors tell me to drop out since I havenâ€™t been able to attend the last two weeks. Even before I got worse recently, they always keep trying to ask â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with meâ€ and Iâ€™m not comfortable sharing that with them and itâ€™s incredibly awkward. Additionally, theyâ€™d always call me out in class and say shit like â€œI know this makes you uncomfortable, [name],â€ or â€œWould this work for you? I know you canâ€™t walk.â€ I donâ€™t know if theyâ€™re actually trying to be helpful but they make me feel singled out in front of 30+ people. One professor even keeps trying to meet me outside of class to talk about my â€œmedical issues.â€ Accessibility Resources is in the midst of dealing with all of those problems, since I canâ€™t deal with this anymore myself but itâ€™s going nowhere. 

Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with Major Depressive disorder with psychotic features. Another doctor says Iâ€™m probably autistic on top of that but I canâ€™t afford testing, since my insurance generally only covers 1% for procedures. They covered $17 of my brotherâ€™s $15k sleep study. I see psychiatrists, therapists, rheumatologist, occupational and physical therapists, cardiologists, gastroenterologist, a connective tissue clinic, and neurologists. Iâ€™ve been seeing these people, from three different hospitals, for years now. Iâ€™m just not getting better. 

Iâ€™m going to have to drop out of college since I canâ€™t get to my classes or do any of the work. I have to quit my job because I canâ€™t get to work. However, this job is waiting to fully hire me (with benefits and better health insurance) when I get my degree, since Iâ€™m two semesters away from graduating. But Iâ€™m throwing that all away since I literally canâ€™t leave my bed. 

Iâ€™ve always been suicidal since I was ten and was constantly in and out of psych inpatient units. Since 2010, Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself 20 times. The last time I was in an inpatient unit (last year), one of the male nurses pressed his erection into my back, and I can barely go into hospitals anymore because Iâ€™m just terrified of male doctors and nurses now. 

Iâ€™m on ten different medications for a myriad of reasons and none work as intended. 

I donâ€™t have any friends, at work or from school, so I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to or get help from. I lost all of my friends within the last year because theyâ€™re â€œtired of being friends with someone as disabled as [me].â€ 

Last time I called 911 for assistance, they tried to put me in an inpatient unit, but chose not to after explaining what happened last time and that Iâ€™m actively seeing doctors on a weekly basis. 

Iâ€™m at a loss and feel permanently stuck. 

When I drop out, Iâ€™ll lose all of my scholarships and grants and wonâ€™t be able to even do part time. So college is pretty much over for me, even though it was my favorite thing to do. 

I donâ€™t plan on living much longer. Iâ€™m done. I canâ€™t live like this anymore. Iâ€™m so emotionally, physically, and academically exhausted. Iâ€™m truly not meant to live normally in this world and Iâ€™m tired of trying. I havenâ€™t left my bed in days and donâ€™t have energy to eat or drink. 

Thanks for reading this, if you did. Nobody bothers listening to me in real life, so I guess itâ€™s nice posting how I feel here. 

TL;DR: Canâ€™t do anything because of physical illnesses, probably going to kill myself soon.
