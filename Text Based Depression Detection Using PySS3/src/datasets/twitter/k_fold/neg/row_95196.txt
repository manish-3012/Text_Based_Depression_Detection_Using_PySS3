About to lose my wife, I canâ€™t stop thinking that Iâ€™d be better off falling from a bridge.Me and my wife have been fighting a lot the last few weeks. Last night she kicked me out and told me that she doesnâ€™t love me anymore. We were living with her mom who said that we both need to take a week or two apart. Iâ€™ve been with her the last 5 years and accomplished so much together. Ever since last night I keep wanting to just lean over a bridge and let go. I feel like Iâ€™ve been nothing but useless to her. I just feel all my options are gone because I donâ€™t know how to fix things. If just want the pain to end. If Iâ€™m dead than I wonâ€™t be a problem to anyone anymore.
