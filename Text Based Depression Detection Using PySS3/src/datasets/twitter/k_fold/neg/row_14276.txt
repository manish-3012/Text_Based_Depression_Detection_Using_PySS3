I'm coming off my antidepressants because I'm on them for all the wrong reasonsI want to kill myself and I want to self harm again and all that shit you've probably seen on here before. But I cant be on antidepressants anymore. I'm only on them to make myself easier for other people to handle me but Its against my morals and if i decide to kill myself that's my choice i dont care anymore. If people cant handle my emotions I'll be on my own. I'm used to it by now i dont need anyone whatever. Bye.
