GoodbyeHello and goodbye everyone. This message is being sent to all of my friends and family. If you're seeing this, that means I love you enough to tell you the truth. I need to go away for a long time. I've had lots of fond memories and I'd like to keep those memories neat and clean instead of adding a bunch of dirt and miserableness to them. I remember going to concerts and meeting my idols with my family. I remember going to dances with the people I love. I remember snuggling our pets and treating them as if they were my children. Everything needs to come to an end eventually though, and that includes whatever relationships you may have known me through. I've been miserable for a long time even though it isn't completely obvious at the surface. I've been abused by multiple people in my life. Some emotional and some physical. I've experienced things that one should never have to experience. My family is at civil war with themselves. I've been abandoned at times I've needed love the most. As it turns out, bad decisions have bad consequences. To make sure most of my life has been spent with the positives, I'm ending things here and now before the negatives can continue to grow. So, if you read this far, I love you. Goodbye.
