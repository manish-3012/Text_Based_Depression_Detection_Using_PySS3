Kill myself over constant dreams?My PTSD dreams are constantly with me and never leave. Vivid dreams every time I shut my eyes and itâ€™s so draining. Kinda had a bit of a break tonight because suicidal ideation is more active than usual. I want to just swallow all the pills I have and fall asleep forever. The only thing stopping me from really planning it is my dog. All my loved ones even my boyfriend canâ€™t stop me, but my dog can. Need some good vibes sent this way as I try to fall asleep tonight. Donâ€™t know if I want to wake up but donâ€™t want my dog suffering. God help me and my brain.
