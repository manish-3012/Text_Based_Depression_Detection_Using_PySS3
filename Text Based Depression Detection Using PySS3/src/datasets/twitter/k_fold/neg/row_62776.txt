Dear Dad*Dear Dad*

*I guess me calling you dad would shock you. I always called you by name because mum forced it on me.*

*I remember you admitting you'd punched her in the face. I remember you admitting to your criminal record. I remember that honesty was something you valued highly. And even though i don't condone domestic abuse or violence, I know how twisted and cruel mum can be. I understand.*

*I don't remember you that well. After what happened i blocked you out. I was obsessed with being strong and cold. I never spoke of you, well I never initiated it to anyone for years.*

*But i do remember us going out to the zoo. To the swimming baths. To the cinema. To blackpool. Caravans. I remember that i was too damaged and mentally ill to form a relationship with you. I desired the closeness but because of my mothers interference and how she poisoned me against you... i guess i was too young to even understand what I was doing.*

*But i miss sharing a bed. I still remember being 5 years old and us arguing about who would sleep on the couch. I felt bad and refused to let you sleep on the couch whilst i got the bed. Eventually we were both too stubborn to do anything so we shared the bed. That was our tradition, until the end.*

*I'd wake up to see you looking at me. You had the most beautiful blue green eyes. Sometimes you'd hold my hand as i slept. It happened quite often. We'd lay awake each night in the dark. Holding hands lying on our backs and we'd just talk. Near the end you seemed to be getting depressed. Sleeping a lot. But i still would sometimes wake up with my hand sweaty from yours and your face inches from mine. Even when i would wake up to see your eyes shut, you quite often would wake up a moment later and stare into my eyes. I haven't ever seen so much love in someone's eyes that way before. I never saw anybody look at me the way you did, I doubt anybody would love me anywhere near as much as you did. I will never forget it. It breaks my heart every time i recognise that expression in other fathers of young girls*

*I remember at 12yrs old when i got my first bra and period you talked about no longer sharing a bed. I vehemently refused to sleep apart and so we continued our tradition.*

*I know bits about you now. How you desired to be loved. How much you fought at court to see me. How much you loved me and wanted me to love you the way other kids love their parents. That's why you got engaged to that cunt who hated me.*

*At 18 you met a woman you loved with a young boy. You were a kind thoughtful man. Well known for being generous and would do anything for a stranger. I saw numerous times you doing selfless things for strangers. You were incredibly kind. 
You did a year or so in prison for breaking into a supermarket one night and stealing. You gave the money to a friend hoping he'd give her the money. He didn't. When you came out of prison you continued to support her and your "son". You only broke up i believe because she cheated on you. As a teenager you stayed with a woman, went to prison and helped raise a boy who wasn't yours. I won't pretend you were a saint because you weren't, but you certainly wasn't bad*

*Anyways*

*You had just turned 42 earlier that month, and i was 12. It was 2010 and you were in your long term girlfriends house. It was around 1am and you apparently heard a noise in the back garden. You were brave and loyal and caring. Careless and impulsive, you did what many people would do for somebody they loved, or thought they loved. You tried to protect them, you opened the door.*

*That was when you were murdered. September 2010. You were hit in the head with some pipe. Then stabbed in the heart. That was you... over. Gone.*

*Your fiance went into your flat later that day. If i remember correctly she took your mattress and your washing machine. She also took pictures you wanted me to have, other sentimental things that were of no value. To spite my family.*

*I was a mentally ill 12 year old in a special needs school who cut themselves and had attempted suicide 10 months earlier. I came home to see my paternal grandmother with my maternal grandfather. Mum was crying. My grandmother explained what happened. I got into my mother's lap and cried after.Â *

*A few were arrested. We pushed for the police to do more. I found out you sold cannabis, though only to people you knew well. After we complained again the police threatened to release the information about your criminal activity to the public.*

*When a parent is murdered the child receives money when they get older. If that parent has a criminal record then you aren't entitled to itÂ  i wasn't.*

*It took weeks for the funeral to take place because of the evidence. I became extremely close to one of your brothers.*

*The case was shut soon after. Nobody was ever caught. It's still unsolved and will always be unsolved. I'm sorry Dad, I wish there was justice for you. But there never will be. I'm so so sorry*

*Life got harder, dad. My boyfriend sexually assaulted me at 13. I held a man whilst he died of a heart attack. I continued to cut myself. I overdosed again at 13. At 15 my mother threw me out and your brother took me in and raised me. We're so close these days. He is like a father to me. He's not able to show love like you were. But now I can express love. I wish i had been able to do this whilst you were alive. It kills me to think you didn't feel loved by me before you died. The guilt and self hatred and loneliness is so bad that it took years for me to face it*

*I admit i started abusing drugs at 15. I'm a drug addict now at 20. I have more than 300 scars over my body. My legs, arm, shoulder and chest.*

*I also got piercings. I have 10 currently. If you knew where some of them are you'd cringe ðŸ˜‰. I don't think you would of liked the woman I've become. But i think you'd understand why I'm such a mess. I miss you so much. I lost the only happy optimistic person ever. My life has a permanent dullness that i need to escape from anyway necessary*

*I know if you had been alive you wouldn't of let my mum put me into a care home. You made the right choice asking your brother to take me in. He's treated me so well.*

*I'm 20 now. I have a boyfriend of 4 months. I'm unemployed and on benefits, but i know that's not forever. I'm getting my own place soon. I plan to make a little place in my flat dedicated to you.*

*I love you with all my heart. I know you loved me too. Your murder broke me and changed me completely. I'll forever be devastated.*

*But I'm getting better. One day I hope i can be the kind of woman you'd be proud to call your daughter. I'll be bringing my boyfriend around to your grave again around your birthday. Nobody should celebrate their 50th alone.*

*Love from E*
