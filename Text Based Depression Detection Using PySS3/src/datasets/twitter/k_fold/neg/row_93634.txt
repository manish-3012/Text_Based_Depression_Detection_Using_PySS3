Iâ€™m Considering suicideIâ€™m a full time student with 21k in credit card debt and 8k in loans so far, on top of that I need to help my mom pay for the house. Iâ€™ll run out of money in 10 day from now, after that I wonâ€™t be able to pay any bills.  And Iâ€™ll just be punished with more fees in higher apr. since the stress will basically kill me, I need to end this torture.
