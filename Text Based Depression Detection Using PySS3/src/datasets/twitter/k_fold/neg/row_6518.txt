What happens if I go to urgent care?If I go to an urgent care or emergency room and tell them I never stop thinking about killing myself are they going to just restrain me on the spot? Is there a scenario where I do that without being hospitalized? Keep in mind Iâ€™m in the US and I have no health insurance.
