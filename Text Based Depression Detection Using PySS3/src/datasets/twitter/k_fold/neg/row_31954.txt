It's like I'm screaming "help me" in my head but don't have the energy to even say itI don't want to be alone but I also don't have energy to be around anyone. I'm in pain physically and emotionally. I think about killing myself every day now. I don't know how I'm getting the energy to even type this. I can't get out of bed. I can't ask anyone for help. I can't tell if this is just depression or just my illness or a combination of the two. I feel almost no emotional connection to the people I'm around. I'm exhausted. My body feels like a million pounds. I'm too tired to even get water to drink right now.
