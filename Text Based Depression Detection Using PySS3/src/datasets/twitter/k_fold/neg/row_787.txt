I don't know what to do or how much longer I can keep on going.People say "it gets better" but this has been going on for almost a decade now and it's only getting worse. Now I'm afraid I'll have to do it for another decade. Every time I see one of those "reasons to live" lists, I can never relate to any of it. I can't turn to my family because my mother abused me and my father never did anything about it, because he didn't want to "deal with her" either, since he was too stressed or tired from work. My mother got rid of my cat when I was 15 as punishment. I've never been able to form any sort of real relationships, because I kept lying about myself and pushing people away out of shame of how bad my life really is. I don't have things I enjoy either anymore, but just things that help me escape reality for a short time. And now I'm slowly burning through my life saving because I can't bring myself to look for a job anymore because I'm so sick of feeling "not good enough" every time I get rejected. I'm at the point where I barely stop myself from breaking down and crying in public places. I'm so incredibly lonely and have absolutely nobody to talk to. Only person I have any sort of attachment to is my younger sister who is too young to understand what I'm going through and I don't know if I can keep on living purely just to not make her sad. I just don't know what to do anymore. At this point I just want someone to hold me, tell me they love me and tell me what to do, because I'm tired of making decisions that never seem to be any good.
