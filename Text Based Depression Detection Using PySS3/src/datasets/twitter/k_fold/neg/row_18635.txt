it just physically hurts to be alive...i have never attempted suicide before but at this moment i would really love to do it, i have no plan but if i knew a way, i feel like i would try it out it right now. my problem is that i am autistic and have problems with being assertive, because of this every single person around me expects the world of me, and nobody leaves some space for me to care about myself. a few years ago i was already on my breaking point. i grabbed a piece of broken plastic and kept slashing myself while screaming at the top of my lungs to my mother that she doesn't care and im just desperate to love myself for once. everyone expects me to fully live for them, and to brutally die for them. i am not allowed to love or care more for myself then for another person. and aside from that. my problem, wich is other people and their expectations, has no solution i think, and that's why i find life not worth living, i suffer, and suffer, and suffer, and then i die. im surrounded by borderline narcissists and need some goddamn help, sometimes i feel like im literally dying. i lay on my bed, i cry and gasp for air, i drool on myself, life is just too hard for me.
