There is no reason to be alive right now.I am 21 years old. I can't think of a single reason as to why I should stay alive.  I hate myself. I have mild agoraphobia, severe social anxiety, and general anxiety that I can't seem to control. I am so lonely I talk to myself daily to alleviate the pain. I have no friends whatsoever and every time I talk to anyone I get so nervous that I can barely get through it. My parents think I'm a demanding nuisance that whittles away their time because I am overemotional and get stressed out very easily. I want to move away from the city and escape but I don't drive because I have a phobia of it (I was in a bad accident 2 years ago) and no matter where I go I'll always be stuck with me. I am transferring to an in-state university in a different city this fall but I feel like it's not enough and I won't be able to truly escape all my phobias and issues unless I just off myself.  I am currently on suicide watch and was almost hospitalized because I admitted that I wanted to kill myself. They're putting me on all these medications now but I don't feel any different. It's just so hard living with all of this anxiety. It makes me trapped in one little house all day, I mean if this is the rest of my life than there is really no reason to keep going with it. I've been to tons of therapists and none of them have helped. Even posting this has caused me so much anxiety I can't even begin to describe it. I am close to giving up.
