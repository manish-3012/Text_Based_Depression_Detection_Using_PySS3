Nothing is wrong with my life and yetThis is the first time I'm posting something like this publicly. Only ever shared some of my thoughts to my psychologist. I've been wanting to kill myself for 3 years  , made plans but never went through with them because of either actual limitations (I'm a minor, can't get a lot of things) or the fear of failing and facing the consequences. 

Tried antidepressants but they never seemed to work for the long term. I don't live a bad life at all, and every time i come on this subreddit I see so many people out there suffering worse things than i do and yet I have the audacity to still want to kill myself. 

I don't want to have a future at all, I don't want to experience anything. I feel so guilty because I'm so privileged and yet so ungrateful. I simply don't want to exist anymore.
