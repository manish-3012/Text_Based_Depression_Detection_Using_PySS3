Don't want people to relate my death to Valentine's day since I don't mind it at all.Last week just decided to end it all around this Wednesday or Thursday. Did not realise it's going to be Valentine's day this Thursday until now. I've rarely checked the date ever since I gave up on life, hence lose track of it. Valentine's day doesn't bother me at all since I've never been eager to have a relationship, but it does annoy me that people will conjecture I chose to die at this specific time due to unfulfilled desire for partner. Which is totally not the case.

I'll do it anyway. Just feel like complaining.
