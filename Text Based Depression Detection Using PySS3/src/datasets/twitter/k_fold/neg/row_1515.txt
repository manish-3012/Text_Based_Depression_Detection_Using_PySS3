I'm not depressed, I think...I'm not depressed, I think, I'm just curious. So, I have been wondering in recent months what death will be like, what happens to our memories, what happens to us when "we are no longer here" what we do. So I was considering killing myself all that to answer questions, there are too many things that I don't understand about reality and life. What will happen after death? I don't know if I can live with that question circling in my head for a long time.
