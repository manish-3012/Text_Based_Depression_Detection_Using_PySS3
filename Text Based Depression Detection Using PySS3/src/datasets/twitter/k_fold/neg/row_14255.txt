I'm going to kill myself tonightI'm done with this life. Whether or not there's something after I don't want to be here anymore. I just told my parents that they'll never see me again. I said there were 3 options: 1. I stay with them, stick it out, and continue hating my life
2. I kill myself
3. I leave and become homeless

I have a feeling I'm going to choose option 2 since it's the best of the 3. My life's really not so bad. I guess you could say that I hate my own lack of control/power over it and I hate the uncertainty that I ever will have control. I've been considering suicide on and off since the 6th grade. I'm 19. I had better reasons for doing it before but at this point it just seems clear that I wasn't meant to survive life in this world. I know that sounds really dramatic and metaphysical but w/e. I don't care about being logical anymore. It never really did me any favors before. I'm writing this from my phone as I walk to the train station so I'm bound to run out of battery soon. Currently at 43% and was at 50% when I started writing. The only thing I really feel bad about is my girlfriend. I started dating her a month ago so she's basically just an innocent bystander in all this. I know I should care more about my family but I don't. Never attempted before so who knows? Maybe I'll chicken out. Ideally I'm heading to the bridge that my friend jumped at 2 (not sure?) years ago

Edit: just jumping in front of a train. It's faster this way
