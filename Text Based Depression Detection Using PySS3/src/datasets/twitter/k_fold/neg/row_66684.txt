How to even open up about this sort of thing?I have been struggling with these thoughts a lot the past few months, and now more than ever with a recent break up. I can't go a day without thinking about how I'd end it and just picturing it happening in my head. I want to be able to talk to my friends about it, but every time I picture the conversation in my head, it never goes well. It feels like I'm just using it to garter sympathy, and the only reason my friends would continue to talk to me would be out of pity and fear I'd go through with it other. It seems like such a manipulative thing to mention. If they dont care about me as it is, telling them isnt going to change how they feel, it's only going to make be around me out of responsibility. Has anyone else felt like this before? I dont even know know where to start going about this...
