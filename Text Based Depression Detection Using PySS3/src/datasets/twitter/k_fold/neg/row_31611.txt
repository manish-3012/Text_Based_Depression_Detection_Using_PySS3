I had someone genuinely me what depression is like and it made me realize that there are people who have never dealt with depressionThey asked me why I always looked like I had a bad morning. And then they asked if I had depression and how did I get it? As of it's something you just contract or get infected by. It's so unfair that some people get to live life without any brushes with depression or the pain that comes with it. Why couldn't I have been one of those people? What did I do to deserve this debilitating disease?
