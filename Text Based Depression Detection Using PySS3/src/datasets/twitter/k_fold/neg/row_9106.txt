I hate humanity and hope climate change wipes out everyone including meWe think we are so civilized and enlightened but most of us are trash. We treat the sweetest members of society like waste if they don't look and talk "right." 

Supposedly you can get nembutol from Mexico for 450 USD, but often customs nabs it and you lose your money. Don't know if it's a good risk to take but at least it's clean and painless. 

I hate all of you beautiful people who get life handed to you on a platter because you satisfy the lower order brain functions of other humans. I hope bad things happen to you. I wish it were true that the meek inherit the earth but it's not quite true. The meek inherit the bullshit.
