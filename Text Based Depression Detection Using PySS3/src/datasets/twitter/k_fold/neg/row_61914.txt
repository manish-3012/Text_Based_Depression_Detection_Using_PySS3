Double depression and dysthymia cycle for years.Dont feel like a human anymore, all I feel is grief, misery and how I failed my loving parents, how I lied to them for no reason and stuck with my lies. Pushed plenty of friends away because I cant relate to anything anymore, hard to talk with somebody when you don't feel. I wake up exhausted everyday, and its a hard task to fall asleep. I started seriously considering suicide months ago, because whats the point in living when I will not get cured from this hellish illness. Had a moment of clarity recently and I got so anxious I could not sleep at all. I saw how I wasted the last year of my life doing drugs, pushing people away and lying. i remember being full of energy and ambition, but as time passed the depression became so sever I would only leave my room to buy drugs. Eating feels mundane and I eat like once per 2-3 days. Cant look my parents in the eyes because of how I failed them. I remember the first time I told them about it, broke down crying, my mom too, but my dad just stood there silently for a few minutes and then walked away to watch some tv. This was truly sad. Sorry for the rambling guys, it is hard to write about all of this. I dont know what to do anymore. Feels like there is no hope. I failed college 2 times already.
