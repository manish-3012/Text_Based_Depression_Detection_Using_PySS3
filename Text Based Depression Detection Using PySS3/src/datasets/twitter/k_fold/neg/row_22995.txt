Iâ€™m not sure who I am anymoreOver the past few years Iâ€™ve been feeling various levels of depression, but as of late I have been in a very dark head space. My father decided to leave my life at 2 years and over the past 14 Iâ€™ve had two step fathers. I consider my step father now my real dad as he actually treats me like Iâ€™m his son and heâ€™s my father, but with that just knowing that my real dad was just gone in the blink of an eye has taken a toll on me. Iâ€™ve always had to fight for a place in the family, for the leaving of respect and love but even after years and years of mental abuse from my mother and my siblings Iâ€™m not sure what love really means at this point. My mother and sister have always tried to make me believe Iâ€™m something that I am not whether that be trying to make me gay, trying to legally change my name, trying to control my love life, you name it. Iâ€™ve been fwb with a girl for the past 2 years and sheâ€™s been trying to be my girlfriend for so long but I just know I canâ€™t be what she wants. I love her to death, more than words can describe, but I donâ€™t know if I really do? Iâ€™m not sure if I know what love really is. What love can be. Iâ€™ve never once felt it in my life and I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. Iâ€™m not sure what more I can do at this point and Iâ€™m starting to believe Iâ€™m approaching my inevitable end.
