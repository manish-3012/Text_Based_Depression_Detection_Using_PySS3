Need a friend or someone to talk to pleaseI just feel alone, isolated, alienated, out of energy, depressed and have absolutely no one to talk to at this point in time. I've practically got no one left and am leading a day to day existence of pure misery.

I just need someone nice to talk to so I can feel less alone and perhaps someone I can share my problems with. If you have kik (phone messaging app) or can talk on here it would mean so much to me.

I swear I'm a 19 year old dude and I feel like I've already hit rock bottom and reached a dead end with no way out. I wish things would just get better but everything seems so hopeless and futile.

Thanks for hearing me out anyway
