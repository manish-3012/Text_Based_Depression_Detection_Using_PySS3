The problem with getting help.Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™m so very tired. Iâ€™m tired of telling the same story over and over again; Iâ€™m tired of medication that makes you feel like a zombie; Iâ€™m tired of help costing $200 per hour. 

I recently wanted to go on a low dosage of Ritalin to help with my PTSD as there is evidence to suggest that it will help. My $200 per hour therapist said she has a responsibility to me and thinks cognitive therapy would be better... at $200 per hour. In Australia psychiatrists can bulk bill (government pays) about $130 so it still costs you $70 gap. However, you need to have that cash [$200] sitting in your account. There arenâ€™t any bulk billing shrinks. 

The problem with getting help is that help is not for the poor or the struggling. Itâ€™s for those that can afford to pay $200 per hour. 

There is no hope when help comes at cost that only sane people can afford.
