Thinking about suicide has become my coping mechanism.Everyday I regret that I couldn't kill myself last night. Waking up is a nightmare....and getting through the day .. don't even want to think about it. Planning mentally how I'm going to kill myself has currently becoming a coping mechanism. My anxiety and panic attacks have reduced thinking about suicide. But actually doing it is harder. How do I kill myself? It's going to hurt but not as much as my life hurts now. I don't want it'll get better messages rn. Even if it will I'm done with this life.
