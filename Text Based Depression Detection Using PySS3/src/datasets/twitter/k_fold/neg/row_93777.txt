it's overi tried patching things up from the group but nothing is working.

they all hate me, and the one person i have left doesn;t want anything to do with me

i can't stand the fact that one fight ruined everything

i can't fix it
i can't
i want to fucking die

i just want a friend. i want someone to love me. i want someone to care, i just don't want to be alone anymore.

i'm done. i hate this. i'm alone.

i want to fucking die
