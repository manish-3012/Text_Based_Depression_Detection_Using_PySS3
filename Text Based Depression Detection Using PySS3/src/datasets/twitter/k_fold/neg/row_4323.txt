Social media is driving me insaneI want to madly kill myself. I want to stab myself in a room of bullies, screaming and apologizing to them for my problems as I do so. I want to die by hurting myself. Stabbing and stabbing. Itâ€™s what I deserve for being a safe space millennial snowflake. Look, Iâ€™m punishing myself for social sins.

This is just a fantasy, my real suicide will go unnoticed by the world.
