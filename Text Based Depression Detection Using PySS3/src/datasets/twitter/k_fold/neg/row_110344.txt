My parents donâ€™t understand mental illness and says Iâ€™m faking itSo I just made this account just to share this. And letâ€™s get straight to the point. I have very close minded parents. Theyâ€™re the type that donâ€™t understand LGBTQ+ people, doesnâ€™t believe in relationships before college, I should inform them every 30 min where i am, you know those type of people. I had depression for nearly 3-4 years. I secretly went to therapy ( it didnâ€™t help me at all), tried â€œ snapping out of it â€œ and since Iâ€™m a teenager girl I thought like everyone else itâ€™s just hormones. I attempted suicide 2 times. I never actually overdosed cause I couldnâ€™t take the last pills. I tried self harming. I thought i could deal with it on my own. My depression led to other problems like passing out, social anxiety, losing appetite ( which caused losing weight obviously but Iâ€™m already underweight) , not being able to breathe sometimes, etc. I finally decided to tell my mom i had depression and i want to take anti depressants, which led to the whole family giving me speeches on how Iâ€™m just a terrible daughter and Iâ€™m getting affected by my friends ( cause newsflash majority of teenagers have mental issues). How i am breaking their heart and how Iâ€™m just faking everything. And Iâ€™m actually sick of it. My own family doesnâ€™t believe me when i say i have depression. And itâ€™s been a week since i told them and everyday theyâ€™re just reminding me how Iâ€™m a shitty person for FEELING! I honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Sorry if this was a bit long itâ€™s 1 am and i guess my emotions just took over. I just honestly donâ€™t know what to do anymore! Like is there any other ways than just ending it all!?
