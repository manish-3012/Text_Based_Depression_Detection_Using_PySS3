hey ;-; im not doing very well.More specifically im so starved for real physical affection but im afraid that i can never be a good partner since im always down. I dont want to waste peoples time. Its like if you are allergic and you need an epi pen, but when you get said epipen you always waste it. im horrible for relationships. I know. but i cant *live* without them. so I either become a functional human being or stop living. since im on this sub i guess you know which one im thinking of. Im sucha disease. ANother thing is i wasnt ready for college. im flunking. Which is ok, its a community college and is the sort of place that, if you were going to flunk out, you would want it to happen there because of how inexpensive courses are. the bad part is that i dont know what else to do besides school. if i flunk, what do i do? get a job? maybe. If I'm lucky. Anyway, im anxious about future living and loving, enough to make me want to kms right now. 

tl;dr: Lonely, sad, helpless, hopeless, self loathing, blah blah. You know the drill :(
