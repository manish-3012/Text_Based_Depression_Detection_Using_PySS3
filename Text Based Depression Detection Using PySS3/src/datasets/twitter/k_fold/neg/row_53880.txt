My best friend committed suicide like 3 years ago and I just canâ€™t recover from itI looked up to him so much. He was the leader of my friend group in which I was at the bottom but I looked up to him. He treated me like a human when no one else did. He asked me to be his friend when no one wanted me. He made sure I knew I was smart even though I believed I was an idiot. I can remember that day like it was the back of my hand. I remember having to tell my friends and hearing them breakdown. That pain never left and never will leave me. And one of them said â€œHey [name] wonâ€™t respond to my texts heâ€™s being weird.â€ His birthday is coming up soon and I know Iâ€™m not going to be able to handle it. God and I still feel like it was my fault too. Him and I had a massive argument over some stupid Minecraft stuff. And I remember me saying â€œNo stfu I hate you youâ€™re being stupid!â€ And leaving the call. Iâ€™m so mad at myself for that. I want him back even if he would hate me. If I knew the pain he felt back then I could of helped him. And now I feel his same pain. Iâ€™m sorry
