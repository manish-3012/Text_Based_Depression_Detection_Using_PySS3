I want someone to kill meI spent 14 months building a relationship. I sacrificed grades, money, mental health, friends.  And she left me. 

It's my birthday on Sunday. I'll be 20. I keep having visions of hanging from a tree. And I think I might. 

I loved that girl and she broke my heart. She shattered it. She told me she was feeling something bad, said she'd stick it through, and a day later she left me. 

I try and distract myself but all I can do is see myself hanging from that tree. Swinging. Lifeless. I felt this way before I met her, and I'll feel this way until I end it myself.
