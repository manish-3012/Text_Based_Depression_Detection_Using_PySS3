Where do I go from hereMy life has been objectively good. I'm surrounded by people who love me very much, I have pretty much everything I always wanted, but none of it made me happy. In fact I've been wanting to die since I was about 10 years old. Every night when I go to bed I wish I won't wake up the next morning. Every day I pray that I get terminal cancer and die. I married and had a child in the hopes it would give me a reason to live, but it didn't work. I really don't care what happens to them if I go away. Yeah, they will be sad and everything but while I'm there I just suffer so that they don't. I've been a putting happy mask on my face to keep people from worrying about me all these years but I've reached a point where I can't do it anymore. People have started to notice. I don't smile anymore. I don't go out anymore. I just don't care. All I want to do is sleep. My wife wants me to talk about it, but there's nothing I can say. There's nothing to talk about. Nothing anyone could say could make me feel better. I've been through this over and over again for more than 25 years now and it's always the same conclusion. I just want to stop living. I'm so sick and tired of it all. I feel like nothing will ever get better, because it's already as good as it's gonna get. So what's the point?
