I called a suicide hotline today. The lady that answered had the mother. forking. nerve to answer with â€œcan I help you with anything?â€ What the fork else did she think I needed when I called a suicide hotline?Tea?

Iâ€™m so sick of hotlines. Theyâ€™re useless. Each time I call, I am asked dumb questions or put on hold. Who runs these things anyway?
