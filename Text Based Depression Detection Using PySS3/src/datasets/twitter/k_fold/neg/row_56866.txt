At my witsâ€™ endIâ€™ve lost it, again. Everything was going well for me after successfully picking myself up from my last stint in the hospital for mental health and yet, I am worse than Iâ€™ve ever been. I moved across country, found a great job, fell in love, and moved (again) to restart (what I thought was,) the rest of my life. My depression creeped back after the season change as it was the first time Iâ€™d experienced it since moving away from California (lived there for about a year and a half without issues with depression.) Recurring memories of being abused when I was 17 would flood my dreams because it had happened during the season change and I hadnâ€™t lived in a place other than where I grew up for that time of the year. It felt different to not be depressed in California as opposed to Colorado where I am now. My ex (almost fiancÃ© but I was experiencing severe bipolar mood swings that caused me to try and eliminate the recurring memories of being abused by trying to be intimate with someone of the opposite gender ) left me and Iâ€™ve been struggling to figure out my future ever since. Itâ€™s mostly because we had our whole lives in front of us and I just canâ€™t live with what Iâ€™ve done to someone I truly loved. I walk with my head down every day and I feel unwanted and worthless. Iâ€™ve never been so depressed in my life. Iâ€™m on medication for my depression and have been for a few months but I still know how I truly feel about myself and what I have to live with. My head is plagued with thoughts of ending my life on a daily basis as soon as I wake up. I say that because it is a normal thought in my head and it is not something I see as irregular or threatening to myself. I lack purpose within and I donâ€™t know when or how things will get any better for me as I just continue on this bipolar spiral every few years. I just donâ€™t care to participate in this thing we call â€œlifeâ€ anymore.
