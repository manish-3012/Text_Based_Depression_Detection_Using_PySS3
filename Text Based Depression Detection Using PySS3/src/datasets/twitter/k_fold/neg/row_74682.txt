My life has been a lieI am 25, studying in Malaysia. I was a Muslim until around 3 months ago. I've learned a lot about evolution, abiogenesis and the big bang. I've learned that no God was needed. No magic. Mainly chemistry and physics. I've learnt that the Quran is full of errors and the miracles were all a lie.
I was a rather zealous believer. I've preached for Islam before. I've given up on the girls I fell in love with as zina is haram.
I've tried reasoning with my parents about why I no longer believe. They just told me to shut up and take it up on faith. I cannot have faith in something I know is false. I want to preach the truth but there are laws against blasphemy. I'm not sure what to do. Keep living a lie? Get in trouble for blasphemy?
