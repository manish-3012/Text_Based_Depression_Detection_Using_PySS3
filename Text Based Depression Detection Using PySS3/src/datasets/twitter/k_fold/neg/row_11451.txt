I'm sorry for posting again. today is just badi posted here before and people were really nice and tried to be helpful. i do appriciate that a lot. somehow i feel like it's not fair to post again. 

but things are not getting better. it's funny. because from the outside it actually looks like things are going better. I was offered a new good job, i have an amazing boyfriend who is willing to move with me to a completely different and new place (another country in fact), i have good and close friends. 

but somehow it all just feels worse. i don't understand why they accepted me to that job, i'm positive they made a huge mistake and that thay will be dissapointed with me. i feel like my boyfriend is putting too much faith in me. and that he loves me way more than i deserve. i just want time to stop. me to stop. stop being. stop trying. i'm such a coward. i literaly don't have any right to complain. but i'm miserable. i just feel too much and try to numb myself. that's the only way i could survive that. but - why live a life of numbness? just makes no sense. maybe that's it for me. maybe i lived all that i can? i don't know. i'm really confused. and scared. i will probably not kill myself. that would just hurt my mom and sis too much. i can't do that to them. but i just want everything to stop. i fantasize about being killed in some accident. so the pain of my loved ones won't be that horrible. or that at least that way they won't be able to see under my mask. 

thank you for reading. i don't expect anything, really. this is plenty.
