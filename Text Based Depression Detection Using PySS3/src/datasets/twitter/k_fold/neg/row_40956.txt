Why shouldn't I kill myself?I'm 18, but look and act like I'm 14. I'm stupid and have no aspirations, though even if I did, I'm too dumb to even fulfill them. I can't hold any conversations. The only "friends" I have are people who feel sorry for me and don't wanna talk unless they have nobody else to go to. I'm not only ugly, but I'm uglier than my sisters as well. Did I mention that I'm stuck in a Muslim house while not Muslim? I'm stuck wearing the hijab which only makes me uglier. The only person that wanted to keep in contact with me after grad was my teacher and he hasn't replied to my email in two months. My parents think I'm stupid. My brothers tell me I'm stupid. My sisters tell me I'm boring. Therapy is out of the option because my parents don't even believe in therapy, much less would pay for it. I can't seem to do anything right. The world wouldn't lose anything. The only thing stopping me from doing it is the only ways to do it are painful and I'm a goddamn weak piece of shit. I hate being cliche, but I can't fucking go on. I have nothing else left. I'm just stuck and have no idea what to do. Nobody likes me. I don't even like me. I just wish I could die instantly but I'm such a weak pussy I can't even do it myself. I literally can't do anything right. I fucking hate myself. I'm not worth it. I'm done.
