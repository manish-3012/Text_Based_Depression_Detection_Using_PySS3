Depressed but I don't know Why I should keep trying37 yo with bipolar. In the past 12 months I've lost my marriage, visitation with my 5 yo, my job, my home, everything. I don't understand what I have to live for. I think my son would be better off without me in his life. I'm currently living with my parents, I've given up on all dreams. Dying would be such a relief from the constant pain and anguish.
