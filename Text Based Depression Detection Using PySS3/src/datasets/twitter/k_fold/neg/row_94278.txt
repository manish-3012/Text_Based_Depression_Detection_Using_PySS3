Iâ€™m a hypocrite.Iâ€™m a drunk as fuck, so I apologize in advance for errors. And I know Iâ€™ll regret this tomorrow. 

I threw my husband a surprise birthday party today. I spent a lot of money and a lot of time and a lot of effort putting this together. I had no real desire to get drunk initially, but getting drunk was a better idea than going into another PTSD episode. I just went through one (one of the worst) around 2 - 3 weeks ago. I know Iâ€™ll regret posting this tomorrow. I know my irrational side has the most control at this point. However, I am rational enough not to harm myself. 

Iâ€™m a hypocrite because I want to help others. I give them (or try to) words of wisdom. And here I am. I donâ€™t actually have my shit together. I canâ€™t even help myself let alone someone else.
