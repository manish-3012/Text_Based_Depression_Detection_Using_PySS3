Life is just a constant game of luck.I think its actually ridiculous that anybody can say that life is great, Its only good if you're lucky.
Yes I'm one of the lucky ones, I have stable living condition, a caring family and even some money. Not many people have that, and I cant believe that people will just turn a blind eye to all of that because its not happening to them. Selfish fucking assholes.
The last straw for me though is that, even if you do get lucky with life, you could still just lose everything just because that's how the world works. Imagine waking up one day and your house has burned down, or you got abused so badly that youre now paralysed, or idk say a pandemic came along and now you don't have a job and  can't afford to literally stay alive. It doesn't seem so fun anymore.
I know I'm one of the lucky ones so I "should be grateful" But Fuck that. I just cannot stand seeing people who have done nothing wrong suffer just because they were unlucky while the rest of us just sit and fucking watch. 
Or even worse add to the suffering. Like war, abuse, poverty, inequality, homicide, climate change etc. Life already sucks do we really need each other making it worse, no. But they do anyway because they're fucking selfish. 
I really don't know how much longer I can take of this shit. The only thing stopping me throwing myself of a cliff is that I'm a pathetic lazy bitch. And I don't even want to get better because it still doesn't solve any of the problems, I can only "cope" with it. So basically just deal with it because there's nothing you can do, oh and you have to stay alive because we said so. Fuck the world. End of rant.
