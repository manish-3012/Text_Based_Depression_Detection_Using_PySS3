I don't understandSo here I am in the middle of the night lurking this sub-Reddit (for obvious reasons) and I just can't seem to figure out why every post is replied to with "don't do it" or "PM me if you need someone to talk to" etc. etc. Why does anyone care that some random, insignificant being is going to die? Personally, I really just don't care. When it came out to my family that I was depressed and wanted to die, the one thing that enraged me was how they immediately assumed that something is wrong with me or it is something that can be fixed. Don't get me wrong they are loving and caring people, and my life has been a breeze compared to what some people go through, but it's just like I think on a completely different level from them. I could spend the rest of my life trying to explain it to them, but I know they would never really understand. Maybe I just answered my own question. Not really sure why I'm posting this, but take it or leave it I don't care. At least it gave me something to do for a few minutes.
