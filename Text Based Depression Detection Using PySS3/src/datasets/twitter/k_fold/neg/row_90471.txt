Wrote a will.Almost jumped from a building yesterday morning. Walked around the city and tried to get as high up as possible. Realized I hadn't made any kind of will and after dealing with my fathers death these past couple months I know it's a pain in the ass for the family. My killing myself will already be hard enough on them, want to at least spare them the emotional turmoil of what to do with my stuff and body.

Might not jump from a building. We have a train here that's killed lots of pedestrians. I could just be another number. Either way, I can't keep going on like this. Life has sunk deeper and deeper and I'm stuck in the pitfall.

Love with all of your heart, even if it kills you.
