Today's the DayI moved out of my apartment, everything is cleaned out. I don't have any place else to go. Spent the last weeks tying up loose ends. I can't take the constant feeling of failure. I invested every penny that I had into grad school and failed out, this week all of my friends and colleges are graduating. I can't even sleep, the only way I sleep is by exhausting myself or getting wasted. 

I can't pick myself up by my bootstraps if I can't even afford bootstraps. I've tried cheering up by going to concerts, hiking and spending time with friends but god damn I'm beyond depressed. Sunsets or hand-jobs don't seem to cheer me up anymore. I feel like I have nothing. Later today I am going to drive my car off  a forest road, unbuckle my seat belt and hope for the quick death.
