Everything HurtsI feel like I'm in too much emotional pain to go on anymore, like I just can't do this. I'm no good to anyone and will always fuck up everything. I really never had anything to live for and nothing I enjoy doing. I have no talents or skills or aptitude for anything. I'll never have a decent job and on the unlikely off chance I figure something out I'll just ruin it again like I did now.

 I'm just too stupid, pathetic and weak to suceed in the world. I can't deal with the guilt, shame and self-hatred of knowing I've ruined everything and will have to start at square one again. I also know I can't function around people well and probably don't deserve to have friends. I don't think I could stand bring myself in public.

 Everything just hurts too much now and I feel like I can't function and I just wish that I could give up. I hate having to look in the mirror each day and spending each spare second thinking about how much I hate myself.I wish I was dead but also know I am too much of a coward to do much about it and feel trapped.

I feel like my life is ruined and I don't know if I'll even be able to yank myself out of bed tomorrow. I know my life is never going to amount to anything regardless and I can no longer deal with the disappointment of others.
