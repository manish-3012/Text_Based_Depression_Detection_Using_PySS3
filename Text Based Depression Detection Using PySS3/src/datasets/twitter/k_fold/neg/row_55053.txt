I pray I don't wake upI'm 19 year old guy in college and I come from a middle class family. My dad's father was an abusive alcoholic, and thus my father abused my (much) older brother. By the time I was my father's child, he had gotten a little better. He used to "spank" me and my sister when we were kids, and he is the reason both my sister and I completely shut down when someone yells at us. He has changed and gotten better, he doesn't yell or get angry and never lays a finger on either of us. However, I always expect him to, even though at this point in my life I know he cares about me and would never do that. This anger I saw in him has been ingrained in me since I was a child and I hate it. My mother's mother was an alcoholic as well, and she had a terrible childhood. While she never has physically abused me she has mentally broken me down. My ex-girlfriend was emotionally abusive and manipulative. Because of the combination of her and my mother, I live constantly with the thought that everyone is always being passive-aggressive with me and they hate me. I often do not feel like I am capable of being loved, because I hate myself too much to believe that anyone could not hate me. Nothing makes me happy anymore. Not my job, not video games, not movies. I have lost all motivation. I have a couple friends that tell me they care about me, but quite frankly I feel like they would be better off without me. I feel like my issues just weigh them down and they don't realize how much better off they would be without me. I have nothing to live for anymore, nothing makes me happy. The only reason I am alive is because I feel too guilty to leave my 2 friends and my sister. I hate my life, I feel like everyone hates me and is mad at me all the time, and everytime I go to sleep (when I can because I have trouble sleeping) I pray I don't wake up. Hopefully I pop a tire and my car flips over. I don' know why the hell you read this far but thanks I guess. That is all.
