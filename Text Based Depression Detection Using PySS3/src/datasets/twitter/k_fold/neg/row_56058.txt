Frozen In timeCant move like everyone else. Cant talk like everyone else. I just talk alone. Cant live at this house anymore. Cant live anywhere anymore. I just dont know how to do it... either do it or live under the care of medics...... 

Doing something for myself gets me stressed out... 
And maybe that IS the answer to my problems...
The light seems brighter that way... But I choose to close my eyes...
