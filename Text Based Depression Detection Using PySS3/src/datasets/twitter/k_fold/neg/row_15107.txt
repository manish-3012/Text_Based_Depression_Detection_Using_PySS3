Iâ€™m exhaustedI no longer desire life. I just donâ€™t. Living for others sucks. I am lost and confused and out of energy. Life has no appeal. Iâ€™m sorry you watch me suffer. Iâ€™m sorry you canâ€™t save me. Not any god could save me. Iâ€™m damned and Iâ€™m done. This bullshit is over. Iâ€™m not gonna die tonight but I hope to soon. Iâ€™ve always felt like this point of life was the end. Iâ€™m ready to make it true I just gotta come up with the strength to end it
