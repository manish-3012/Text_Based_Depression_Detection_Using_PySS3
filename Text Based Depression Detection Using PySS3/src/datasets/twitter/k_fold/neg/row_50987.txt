i feel unattrctive and worthless...for the last time.I can't trust anyone. I feel so broken and betrayed. The only person I love is basically sexting in group chats online. This hurts me so much he can't even imagine. I don't know what to do. I don't feel good enough anymore. I feel so unattractive and worthless. I'm feeling suicidal. I've been dealing with anxiety and depression and have issues and he was the one thing keeping me alive. Now, there's no point. I want to die. I don't want to hurt or feel or be beaten down anymore. My family life is awful. I can't trust the one I love. I have nowhere to run or get away. I will always be a failure. The world would be better without me. No one would have to worry about feeding me or me taking up space or oxygen. I have no purpose here. I have nothing.
