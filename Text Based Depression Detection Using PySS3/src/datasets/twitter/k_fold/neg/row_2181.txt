Ugly 29 year old man leaving on a suicide trip in a few days.Here is my long story, short. I am a 29 year old man, who has had suicidal ideations for the last 5 years. My biggest issue is living in self induced isolation that I deal with everyday all day. I really want relationships, but I hate the way I look, and because of that I have abandoned all my previous relationships, and hardly leave the house anymore. I have social anxiety, but it is brought about by self consciousness over my appearance. I also have a very young looking appearance, and because of that I have had a hard time getting ahead in my personal, and professional life in the past. 

On Sunday I am leaving the town that I currently live in, and going on a suicide trip in hopes that I can have a little bit of fun (if my depression will allow) so that I can end my sad existence on a somewhat high note. I plan on going surfing, losing my virginity to a hooker, and visiting several National Parks I have never been to. My plan is to travel around for a few days, and then buy a gun, and shoot myself in an isolated area outdoors where no one will witness the scene. I do not want anyone to witness my suicide, and I wish I could avoid someone stumbling upon my dead body, but that is unavoidable. 

I am not posting this to be talked out of my plan, because I cannot be. This plan is five years in the making. My life is not getting any better, and I would have terminated myself sooner, but I knew my Mother would be very hurt by it. I have not spoken to her in four months, because she now hates me, along with all of my immediate family. I am here with no other choice.
