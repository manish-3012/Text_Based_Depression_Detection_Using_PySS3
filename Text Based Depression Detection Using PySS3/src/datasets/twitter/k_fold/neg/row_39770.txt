Having dreams of my suicide.More like not what would happen to everyone else if I died because honestly nothing would happen. It's more dreams about the life I'll live after I commit suicide. Yes, I'm really trying to make myself feel better but I have to cut this guy off and shit so he won't know. He lives in Sweden and shit anyway, like how is going to know? Maybe he can realize I hate him for leaving me for being schizophrenic which isn't my fault. Who cares though? Anyways, these dreams are as if they're a totally different world and I can't tell which is which. I can't went tell who I'm talking to is real because now I feel confused? Now I do want to kill myself here really for many more reasons than just suffocating from living. 

Also Jesper , I know you might read this sorry for talking shit.
