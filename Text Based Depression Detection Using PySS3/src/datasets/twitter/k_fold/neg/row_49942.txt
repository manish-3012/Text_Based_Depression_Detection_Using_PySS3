Suicidal Ideation Due to Being UnsuccessfulHi there. I am 34 years old and I suffer from anxiety and depression.  I quit drinking almost a year ago and everyone says "things will get better" but they aren't.  I made the mistake of getting into Real Estate this past year so that I could work for myself and that has only resulted in 2 transactions.  I made the bold decision to quit being a server in August after being in the service industry for 16 years.  Being in the environment made me feel degraded and turned me into an alcoholic.  I have quit drinking and it's been almost a year and although I've lost weight and don't black out and lose things and money and bring random men home anymore, things aren't better in my mind.  I have THE worst anxiety now.  I have NO job, but I have a Bachelor's degree in English.  I have social anxiety and I feel like the only jobs that want to hire me are b.s. sales and marketing jobs which I do not feel comfortable doing.  I think about killing myself every day because I don't know what to do.  I feel there is no job suitable for me because anything I'm interested in, like research, writing, editing, exc...all requires EXPERIENCE and I have nothing but hospitality experience.  I've been told I'm attractive by many men and yet no men want to date me.  I wish I could be a house wife and have some shiny ring on my finger like all these other women on my social media but no.  I'm good at things that don't matter such as writing, music, and art.  I almost drowned myself last summer when I still drank and maybe its too bad it didn't follow through.  I just feel like I have no purpose in life and that every day is exactly the same.  I hate life and don't get why I was even born.  The world revolves around money and all of my dreams are dead.  I really don't know what to do anymore.
