Leaving this behindI donâ€™t think anybody knows I use reddit but I wanted to leave behind something for my family and close friends. Iâ€™m so sorry I decided to go through with this.  None of this is your fault and Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m putting you through this but itâ€™s become too much to keep going on. I know that everyone notices it everybody has been saying Iâ€™ve been acting different but almost nobody attempted to reach out. You guys are the reason I kept it together for so long, I love and cherish you even now. Please try to get over that this has happened. There was nothing left for me. Love you forever
