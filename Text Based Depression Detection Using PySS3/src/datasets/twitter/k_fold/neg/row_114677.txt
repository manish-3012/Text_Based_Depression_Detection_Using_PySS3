To my kiddoI have a kid. I don't want to do this to her. This was not what she signed up for. 

I have a spouse. I've dropped my life to follow said spouse around the world. It's not what I signed up for. 

I have depression following a childhood filled with sexual assaults and shitty parenting. And now I fail at adulting. 

My child is all that is right in this world. I don't want her to experience what I have. But I can't help but feel like my actions will only propagate the cycle. But my absence can only be the lesser of two evils. 

It's not you, it's me.
