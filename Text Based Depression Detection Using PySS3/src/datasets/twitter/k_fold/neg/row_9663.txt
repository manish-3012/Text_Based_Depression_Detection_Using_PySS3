My family is the only thing that's stopping me from Killing myself, and at the same time it's the No. 1 reason why I'm suicidalMy parents are two stupid, broke, religious, strict, close minded people who have been mentally torturing me since I was a kid. My depression began when I was 13-14, Now I'm 21. I try to do part-time jobs, but still I'm too broke to leave them so I'm dependent on them. Doesn't matter how much of a dumb fuck they are, they still provide me shelter and food (I wish they didn't, so I could go to a corner and die peacefully). It's like they are the universe's way of keeping me alive so I keep suffering. Yet I can't hurt them by killing myself, I can't imagine what these fuckers will go through. But I fucking hate them and I hate my life. It's such a fucking mess. I just have to wait and suffer untill they die.
