No help nothing but painI did ~$700 damage in my home this week from mood swings.  Insurance held my medication hostage.  It doesnâ€™t help me anyway.  

The girl I loved broke up with me on text months ago and ghosted me.  In the beginning of October I confronted her and she called me.  She said I had a friend in her.  Now Iâ€™m pretty sure sheâ€™s blocked me.  

I have no friends.  Girls I talk to keep ghosting me.  

My career is over, Iâ€™ve already given up and people are starting to get angry with how incompetent I am.  Iâ€™ll be fired soon.  I donâ€™t want to be alive anyway.

The girl has a new boyfriend.  

No one cares about me.  

No one believes in me.  

Theyâ€™re all gone, the ones who said it would get better.   Well, it didnâ€™t.  I legitimately - violently - regret not ending it sooner.  What was the point of enduring all this pain.  It just gets worse.   Every day.  For decades.  Why would anyone want to be friends with someone as pitiful as me.
