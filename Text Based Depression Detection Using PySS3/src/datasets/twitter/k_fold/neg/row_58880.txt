realisationsoon i will be robbed of the only source of happiness i have. but i realised that i do not need to deal with this, that i can kill myself and it will be over just the same. and what a huge relief it is to realise this! i do not have to suffer. i would not be missed. things will be just the way i want it. so i aim for my date. and i will not miss this time.
