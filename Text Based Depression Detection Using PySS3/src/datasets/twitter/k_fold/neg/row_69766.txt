Thousands of people, REAL people with jobs, a purpose, family and friends. People who actually contribute to society are dying everyday because of Covid-19. Yet my worthless ass is still here wasting oxygen.Like seriously, all these people who actually mean something to others are dying for essentially nothing. 

Meanwhile I WANT TO die. Itâ€™s seriously ashame. I wish I could trade places with a Covid patient. Itâ€™s really unfair.. for them. Theyâ€™re fighting everyday, clinging to life. Yet Iâ€™m selfishly trying to end mine. 

Please end this nightmare..
