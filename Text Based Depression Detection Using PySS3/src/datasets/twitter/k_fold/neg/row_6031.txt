I am commited to dying now, I dont give a shit anymore, I'm doing itThis weekend I am getting my shotgun, bring it home. On Tuesday afternoon, I am driving to the woods, getting drunk, assembling my shotgun from out of my backpack and then I am sticking it through my mouth and dying.

I will never be happy, I will never be a good person, I will never form connections with others, I will never be succesful. I am so ashamed and guilty and I am angry at myself. Ive been suicidal most of my life but only now am I not hesitant and i truly believe I will do it. Goodbye, I am sorry family
