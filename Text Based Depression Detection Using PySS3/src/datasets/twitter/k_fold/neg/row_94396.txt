I need a shoulder to cry on but I'm so aloneIt's happened again. Another girlfriend cheated on me. At this point Im thinking that i really shouldn't be getting into anymore relationships. I dont know what to do anymore. Everything was going fine. Until i fucked it up again . i stopped giving her attention, stopped treating her to nice things, stopped taking her out on dates its all my fucking fault.i had classes today. but i didnt feel like going so i was at the park all day. 


what the fuck have i been doing wrong. that they cheat on me?

once is a coincidence but two times means its my fault. what do i do. what did i do

all day. 

I always knew i was lonely. But for the past few months it's been fine because I had her by my side. A few weeks ago my best friend (nearly 9 years) moved out of the country. We would share verything with each other and he was the one person that I could really let everything out to. 

Its getting lonely reddit I dont know how long i can keep this act together. I've been pretending to be happy for so long now i don't know if i really am. gaming is a nice distraction but even lately i cant seem to get fully into the game.

It's a constant battle. I feel like shit for lying to the people around me and the friends i've made through reddit. All today I pretended i was someone that i wasn't. i pretended i was happy. i pretended my only problems were stupid things that happened in chat. i dont want to pretend anymore but if i stop will they like me?

I browse /r/depression everynight. i browse the new section and make sure i always comment on threads that have no comments. I'm wondering here right now, is there going to be anyone here for me?

I might actually hurt myself tonight reddit. And I don't know how to stop myself. I'm always saying that I'll be there to listen to others but there is no one to listen to me. I might actually hurt myself tonight. I've been crying so much the last hour that my eyelids hurt so much. my eyes are puffy and i cant see for shit. i really need someone's shoulder to cry on reddit. i need someone to hold me. for once i need someone to hold me. but i have no one.

i want my friends to read this. i want the chat to read this. this is who i really am. a shambled broken piece of shit. im not brave, im not happy,im not who you think i am. im a piece of shit. ive tried so hard to make my life worth something but this what happened today fucking broke me.

im not me


I really hope someone finds this post I dont want to die alone
