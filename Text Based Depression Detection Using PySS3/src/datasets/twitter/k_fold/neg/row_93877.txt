Iâ€™m so alone, I feel like giving up.Iâ€™m FTM17 and I canâ€™t deal with my shit anymore. People always leave me or let me down and I canâ€™t blame them- I feel like a fucking disease to them. I want to just disappear and then they wonâ€™t have to think about me anymore; they will finally be free of me. Iâ€™ve been trying to get better for years but I just canâ€™t. I feel like the best thing todo is give up now.
