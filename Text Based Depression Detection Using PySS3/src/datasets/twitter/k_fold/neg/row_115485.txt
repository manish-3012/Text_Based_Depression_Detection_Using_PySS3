No one ever responds on here they probably think Iâ€™m a troll or just donâ€™t careI get suicidal regularly despite trying medications, therapy (that I canâ€™t fucking afford and am putting myself in debt for) reaching out to people tho I donâ€™t feel like I have anyone.

I work in healthcare and am so sick of my fucking workplace. They donâ€™t give a shit if we get sick, despite 30 employees having covid and 6 outbreaks theyâ€™ve now started rationing masks more. I live alone and have no â€œbubbleâ€ because Iâ€™m treated like I have the fucking plague even when Iâ€™m willing to do distanced masked walks and I get tested regularly. I want to quit my job, but i know the economy is shit right now and Iâ€™m lucky to even have a job so Iâ€™d be making things worse for myself quitting.

Iâ€™m addicted to otc opiates (we have them in canada) and prescribed benzos that I originally got to try to quit the opiates. I started abusing both very badly after getting cheated on by my last ex. I really wanted a family with her, but am trans and one of her motivating factors for cheating/leaving me was that I wasnâ€™t normal like other guys. 

I went and spent 15k (the rest was covered) to get surgery in another country, 3 skin grafts later a lot of pain etc and now I have a penis. Iâ€™m happy with my body but still feel it will never be good enough for anyone else. 

I quit drugs briefly after surgery as I was happy with my body for once and had a few people reaching out to me just out of curiosity regarding the surgery. I then got really depressed about the fact that I went through it all by myself and healed by myself. 

Things have been getting worse day by day and the more I go to work the more I contemplate suicide. I fixate on my ex who doesnâ€™t want me back, I fixate on the isolation I feel in general. I spend most days in bed crying until I have to go to work. 

I said I wouldnâ€™t kill myself because I was afraid of becoming a vegetable and I also felt bad for my dog. Heâ€™s the only creature I feel actually loves me on this earth. Itâ€™s just too much though and now Iâ€™m at the point that Iâ€™m caring less if I end up a vegetable, I could at least leave a note to tell my parents to disconnect life support. 

Iâ€™m giving myself till New Yearâ€™s Day. Iâ€™ve found a spot to jump from. Itâ€™s slightly comforting to know that in less than 2 weeks I donâ€™t have to deal with anything anymore.
