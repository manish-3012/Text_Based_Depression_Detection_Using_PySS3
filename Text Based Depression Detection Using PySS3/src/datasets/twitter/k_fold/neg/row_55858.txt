I have no oneI have wanted to die for a long time. I'm sorry but I really don't want to type out all my problems again. But the point is, I can't go on the way I'm living.

I've been trying to talk to some people in real life, but it just doesn't work. I don't have any friends I really trust, and my parents criticize me every time I try to say anything about how I feel. The only reason I wasn't going to kill myself was because I didn't want to upset my parents. But now I don't know.

I just don't know what to do. Nothing helps.
