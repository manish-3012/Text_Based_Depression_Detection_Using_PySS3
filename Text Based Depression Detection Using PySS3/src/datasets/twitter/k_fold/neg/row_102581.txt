what. a. day.Hello everyone. I'm new here, so please excuse any housekeeping mistakes I make. 

I'm not having the best day. I would love to go into details, but I don't think that would do much for you all. I've spent my whole life under the thumb of a dictator and it's becoming too much for me to handle. As much as I would love to throw caution to the wind and run away from all of this, I can't help but feel like they'll turn me into the bad guy like they always do.

I'm just in a lot of hurt right now and have nobody to turn to. I'm gladly accepting kind words or whatever the heck y'all feel like giving to someome down on his luck.
