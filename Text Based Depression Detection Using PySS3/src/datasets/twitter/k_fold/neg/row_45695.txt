Haven't attempted in a while but it seems inevitable.I just don't know how to be happy anymore. I've tried and tried but all I can think of is how everyone abandoned me when I told them I felt a little sad, before I even started trying to kill myself. I've tried to kill myself over a dozen times, I don't even know how many anymore. People say they're glad I'm alive, but then they aren't willing to talk to me either. They want me alive, just not in their life. Which constantly leads me to believe the world would be better off with me dead. I give as much as I can to charity and eat very little, basically trying to use myself to do good things for other people but I don't see the point. People would be better off if I wasn't there to take up their food and oxygen. I've been on antidepressants for over 4 months, I don't know that they've done anything. My friends are all gone, my family lives in a constant state of fear that I'm going to kill myself. My family wouldn't be afraid anymore if I were already dead. I don't know. Rationally I should stay alive, but I'm so tired I just wish I didn't have to wake up anymore.
