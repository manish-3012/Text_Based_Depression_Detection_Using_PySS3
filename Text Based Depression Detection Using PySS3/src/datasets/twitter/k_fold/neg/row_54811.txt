What happens, if I tell my therapist that Iâ€™m suicidal?Iâ€™m considering telling them, but Iâ€™m afraid that theyâ€™ll put me in a hospital immediately, without my will (Iâ€™m 22, not a minor). Do they have the right to do this? Cuz I do have a plan, a note and stuff. Itâ€™s not just thoughts. Also itâ€™ll be my first therapist visit and idk how to start and what to say to them. Need advice.
