TonightI've liked this person, for almost a year now, and they knew I did, so I finally asked them out over text (stupid I know) and they didn't answer, I haven't talked to them at school, but someone asked them about it for me.. and they don't want a relationship. I can't take it anymore, seeing their face everyday, just wanting to hug them. I know I'm not good enough to make her happy, so I'm done. Everybody hates me for talking about being sad, and nobody cares because I've attempted suicide to many times for people to take it seriously, so nobody cares and everyone is slowly leaving me. All I want is that person I like, and I know I'll never be with her. So yeah, I want to die. Over a person I like. I'm fucking pathetic, I know, dying over some person. But I've dated people before I 'liked', and this feels different, I think I love them. I'm tired of feeling alone, controlled, and like I'm just an annoying slut who drives everyone who loves me away. I'm only going to write a note to the person I like, tell them the truth about why I'm doing it, and that it's not their fault at all.
