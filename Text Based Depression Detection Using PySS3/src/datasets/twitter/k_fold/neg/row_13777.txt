I don't know how much longer I can keep living in 2020My whole life is on pause in 2020, at first I could look at it like a needed break but now I'm directionless, I'm probably deferring from university, and I've failed so much of it already I don't know whether to bother continuing. Everyday I'm in chronic pain, I was meant to have surgery for it but the corona virus has pushed it off the schedule from the hospital indefinitely. I don't have a support system anymore since my friends are all scattered across the globe now and can't reenter the country. I'm not close to my family and I'm getting resentful that they never check in on me. I cant be the only one whose going through similar things this year. I don't know how much longer I can live in this void and I don't know how to change my circumstance. My coping mechanism are gone, my support is gone, and any hope I had at a successful future is dwindling  as well. I really don't know who to talk to about this, I've tried to book therapy and seriously nobody replies and I can't afford to look for specialised practices.
