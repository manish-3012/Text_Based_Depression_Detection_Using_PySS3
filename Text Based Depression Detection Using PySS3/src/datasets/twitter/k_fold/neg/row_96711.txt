No place to go.NOTE: EVERYTHING YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ IS WRITTEN BY A FUCKING WHINY, SELF-PITYING CHEATER. DO NOT BELIEVE ANYTHING.

I am a cheater.

Never has the world felt narrower to me, never have I felt so constricted that I can't breathe, I don't know myself, I am in a forest of lies, it seems, all the time, around me. Nothing but lies. I don't know myself, I don't know myself -- my death would bring some order maybe?

I am a cheater. I think I feel things like "I was did it because I was feeling distant..." or "it was a really temporary attraction, I lost control...".

What did I do? I had an internet friend I knew from before my current relationship. This internet friend expressed an attraction for me (my fiancee was the one who set up that conversation, and set up the question as well -- we were both logged into the same Skype account and talking to her as "one person"), and the next day, I fantasized about abusing her -- literally, making her do really nasty-erotic things for me, by abusing her attraction for me. I made a throwaway reddit account to message her about that.

I didn't go through with it.

A few hours later, while talking to my fiance, she told me how much she hated this friend of mine, how she'd want me to totally burn down the bridge. 

I sent a message to this "friend" to this effect, but then sent another one at the same time from my throwaway reddit account that I had made earlier saying: "please come online on this other Skype account of mine, and I can explain why it is that I want you to go away...".

I had shared all my Skype accounts and reddit accounts with my fiance, down to the password. I had this person blocked on my "main" Skype, after our conversation the other night (where my fiancee and I were both talking to her, and she admitted to being attracted to me). I had her blocked, but my fiancee would add her back because "she had a nagging suspicion". 

Anyway, the next day, my fiancee was logged into this account, when this reddit girl logged in, and proceeded to say "why are you being so confusing? one moment you want me gone, the other moment you want pictures and your penis is a 'tube full of blood'?".

My fiancee called me breathlessly, convinced I had sent her Skype/reddit messages asking for pictures and saying I had a boner. To this day, I KNOW I didn't say that, unless the reddit girl is referring to some conversations I had with her before I even met my fiancee. I will never know, my fiancee refuses to let me prove it, because she feels that I am "too fixated on her". 

Anyway, this was all a week and a day ago. My fiancee can find it within herself to forgive me, but she often still brings up two points that leaves us both sobbing, and wanting to die:

1) imagine a guy has a girlfriend that he actually loved completely, thought was the most beautiful girl, liked her personality -- would he cheat?

2) you think she is more attractive than me, that's the only reason why you could have cheated

I've stopped crying now.

I know this is really dramatic, and hard to believe, but both of these leave me feeling entirely...without...agency? I feel trapped, completely trapped, because all my words are hollow now to everyone around me. 

I really do think my fiancee is the most beautiful girl in the world, and that her personality is fabulous -- I believe she is perfect for me. She'll never believe me again though.

That makes me want to curl up and shrivel up in frustration, just absolutely, suicidal frustration.

She just wants me to explain why I did what I did...

I tried to put it as, I felt an attraction not because she was prettier, but because I am seriously fucked up and I was attracted to "abusing" her -- attracted to getting her to do what I want.

I tried to put it as (we are long distance), I felt a bit distant from you (it was her thesis week, this other guy who would accidentally brush her boob sometimes was always pestering her to hang out -- and she'd give in, she has had some issues with extremely low-self esteem, and she'd often hang up on Skype calls when I ask her to do something sexy for me, but she was getting better...she just would keep on questioning if she is my type, even when I insisted she was, but she'd be really quick to believe others that they thought she was their type), anyway...she counteracts with "but we were planning to live together! we were looking for a place that day on craigslist!".

I really was just not empathetic enough, and I was not patient enough. I cannot stress enough how much I really do purely despise myself like never before.

Maybe I didn't place much stock in our planning. I mean the next day, before she found out that I had sent that message, during our daily lunch conversations, she had said "I don't know if we should live together...it's going to be too hard to convince my parents...let's just not do it" (for various reasons, we have to hide our relationship from her parents specifically). This isn't the first time something like this had happened, we had made plans to meet again which had often fallen through for similar reasons.

I am a cheater though. Who can identify whether what I am saying is actually what I felt? I mean, I know that it could be totally irrational at points, but still...could it have been what I felt? No way. I must have cheated because I am attracted to variety in women, and because I wasn't attracted to my fiancee. It's the most believable reason, isn't it?

Would my death be convincing?

Will someone here at least admit that after cheating and feeling like you're going to lose the love of your life, and knowing that you are too dumb to properly vocalize what you were feeling -- what your reasons were, what your motivations were...can you please admit that capital punishment would be a mercy killing? One I really horribly need?

There is a highway so close by, if I step off...people will believe me, right? They might hate me still, but they'll think that I was confused and tormented? That I didn't want to be a cheater? That I really loved her? Would they realize that?

Please, I am not a real human being anymore. 

Help me understand myself. I have no voice anymore. 

What am I? Who am I? What did I do? We can make this a conversation, I will respond fast to anything you type. 

tl;dr: how do you live with yourself knowing you are the scum of the earth, without a voice forever? why can't people see you'd need to die?
