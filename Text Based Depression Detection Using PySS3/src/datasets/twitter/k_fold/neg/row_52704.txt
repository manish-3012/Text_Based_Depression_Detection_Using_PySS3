im not sure what to doi hate my life. i feel like i just keep completing fucking up everything. i'm 18 and ive already fucked over my life by doing really stupid shit as a teenager. now here i am. i wish i could just disappear. i don't want to die because i know that'll hurt the people around me, and my family believes that suicide is selfish and i'll go to hell for it. i just wish i simply didn't exist. i wish i could just fade from everyone's memories slowly. idk i just feel stuck so to speak. idk if i should live or die or what.
