Final thoughts (?)I really hate you striana. I hate you for destroying every last bit of confidence and esteem I had. I hope you are never happy again. I hope things only get worse for you from here on out. 

I really fucking hate you Alyssa. I hope you don't show your face at my funeral. I will make sure you cannot come. Fuck you and everything you did. Fuck you and everything you stand for. Fuck you you evil manipulative stupid bitch, get aids and die. 

I'm sorry Emily, I hate to leave my sister behind but you're 18 now you're going off to college soon and you have a completely different life path laid out ahead of you. Soon we won't be even in the same state. You'll be gone soon and it'll be like nothing changed. 

Fuck you becca, you obnoxious two timing gutter whore of a person. Holy fuck you are terrible. 

Fuck everyone who wronged me that I can't think of too. 

The only people I can regret leaving behind is my family dog and Emily. But it has to happen with one of us at one point, doesn't it? It could happen whenever. Doesn't really matter.
