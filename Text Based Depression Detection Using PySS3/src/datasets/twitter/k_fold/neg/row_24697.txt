Is there any hope for me?This isnâ€™t like a cry for help or anything, Iâ€™m just genuinely wondering, what are the options?

Iâ€™m a minor. My med trials are

 
 
1st round of Zoloft (2016)  (anxiety and depression diagnosis)
Prozac; (2018) first Suicide attempt at 13
Has been experiencing persistent depressive disorder from age 13-present
Increased dose of Zoloft in 2018; no reaction
9 more months of increased dose Prozac; no reaction (2018)
Abilifi, (5 months) (2018-2019)- no reaction
Lexapro; 1 year; (2019-2020) no reaction
Latuda; 40 mlg; beginning of 2020-current- no reaction
Current; Cymbalta (120 mlg)- no reaction
 Latuda upped to 90 recently 

What are my options? Nothing seems to be helping. Persistent severe depression. Suicide thoughts daily. My life is normal. No discernible triggers. Is my brain just fucked?
