I don't know what to do -- killing myself seems like the only way outI'm training to be a Nurse's Aid. I have a big heart for people and I wanna do what I can to help, but....I dunno. I just finished up my clinicals. While I loved helping folks out, part of me is screaming that I fucked up and that this job is a terrible idea for me. I also have a big skills test(failure of which will fuck everything up royally) in December in a faraway town; it'll be the longest drive I've ever made by myself.

If that wasn't stressful enough, my mom is hounding me to make phone calls regarding my personal finances. While I'd rather just pay my bills and not fight anything for fear of embarrassment and annoying people, she wont have it.

At the same time, none of my hobbies are entertaining me too much because I'm stressed about the above along with a ton of minor things that end up piling up.

I'm tired of everything. I just want to die. I cannot handle real life. I wish I could just be a kid forever. Since I can't, there's only the release of death.
