Suicide Equals Infinite PurgatorySuicide has two out comes 

1: You Kill Yourself , But Are saved that's you actually dying switching dimensions to nearby planes of existence and missing your chance on escape from life prison. you've successfully looped yourself forever.

2 : Infinite &amp; Indefinite Purgatory Only In no Out. = Nothing ......."Even Nothing Doesn't Exist In Purgatory"

I don't know why you want to die but its useless, you'll never get any satisfaction from death or life.
