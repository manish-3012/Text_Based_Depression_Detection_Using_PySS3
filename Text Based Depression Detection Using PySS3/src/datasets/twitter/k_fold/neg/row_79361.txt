I;m over itI'm tired of this rapid cycling. I hate how one minute my brain is telling me that everything's fine and then the next its telling me to off myself. I want to die so badly but i'm terrified of fucking it up and making my life worse. I'm worried and scared of my husband finding me. 

I want to die but i'm to afraid.
