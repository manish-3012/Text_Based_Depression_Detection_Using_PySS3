A week doesn't go by without me being so suicidal, that it makes my partner suicidal as well. And sometimes, my brain will convince me that the solution to it all is to just die.Today, like pretty much every single week for the past month, I would get into such a terrible mood that it would negatively affect my partner as well. It's so fucking stupid and annoying of me. I love him to death (inappropriate to say this now but oh well lol) but sometimes it feels like I'm a burden to him. So my brain is sitting here all "KILL YOURSELF NOW OR ELSE I WILL!" type bullshit, and I tell him quite frankly when I don't feel so good, which makes him sad and suicidal, which then makes me even more sad and suicidal, and then we both cry, act like we're about to do it, calm down, get over it. But that cycle really sucks. The guilt is also so ... intense.

But today, I was so sure that he was going to kill himself that my brain started immediately focusing on what I'd do to myself. That feeling of acceptance is scary and I do not want it ever again. I do not want to be okay with the idea of him killing himself, and then me doing the same. 

What sucks though is that our relationship is long distance, but we will meet soon. I wish I were with him. I think I would feel better if he were there in real life, and I would do just about anything to make him happy. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Traditional help (psychiatrist, medication, therapy) does not work. I've tried for years. What else could work? I don't believe in traditional medicine or homeopathy but I am desperate.
