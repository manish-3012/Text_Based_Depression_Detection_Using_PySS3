Thoughts are back again21M. I've been going through a passively suicidal depressive cycle for a whopping continuous 4 years ever since my last attempt &amp; release from impatient. My life feels like a sick joke, anytime something happens in the thick of it I think "This is going to be the thing that finally justifies my suicide" but then end up counting the full grind in my usual depressive fog. I don't know if it's a deep subconscious hope of life getting better that's keeping me alive, human survival instinct, or my flat emotionless demeanor. Living feels like a blinding pain that I can't stomach being apart of. So many bad things have happened to me, maybe I'm waiting for just one good thing to justify living instead.
