19 foreverIâ€™m so disappointed in everything I do, Iâ€™m stuck in a loop of temporary motivation to be the best at a particular thing, then I fail and my whole world is crushed. I wish I could be good at something without my emotions getting in the way, my frustration and anger gate keep me from being good at anything. Iâ€™m so sick of existing, I donâ€™t want to experience anything anymore. I want a relationship, but again negative emotions ruin it, i havenâ€™t felt a positive emotion since I was a kid. Iâ€™ve always searched for someone to guide me, since my parents were never around, but itâ€™s too late for that. Iâ€™m one more bad event away from ending it, doesnâ€™t matter how small it is. I love you all, I guess.
