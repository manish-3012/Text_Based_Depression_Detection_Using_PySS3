I'm literally a ghostI've posted here before, I tried to make life better, it worked, but not for long. It's gotten worse, I've progressively gotten more depressed I think and I'm at a crossroads almost. One road is try to make this better despite how hard and shitty it's gonna be, and the other I guess is just killing myself. It's not like anybody would care, sure a few people would, but yeah. Mostly aeveryone would just be like "huh..shit happens I guess". Doesn't fucking help either when you hear your own parents having a discussion over how shitty of an antisocial, unmotivated, hideous loser they have raised. You're probably wondering why I say I'm a ghost, well, that's because I basically am one. I talk to almost nobody, nobody talks to me. All I do on weekends is just sit up here in my room and be on my computer for like 10 hours. Now that school is over and summer is here my dad is constantly fucking pestering me to get a job. He doesn't think of my social anxiety as anything. He doesn't know how fucking hard it is for me to talk to new people. Maybe the problem is me and maybe it always has been. Maybe the reason I'm so sad is because of myself. I don't talk to people or ask anyone to do anything because all I'm ever gonna get is a "No" or a "sorry, maybe another time". I just have no fucking clue what to do with my shitfest of a life
