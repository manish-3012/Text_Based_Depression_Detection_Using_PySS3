my last post disappeared...so... i've typed up a nice note with a lot of phone numbers included, so that anyone who finds me can contact the people that would probably wanna know it's over. i cant think of any other bases to cover... it's more a matter of getting to it now. courage and breathing correctly and what have you. i used to make myself pass out on purpose when i was younger. using a rope instead of my hands will allow me to not wake up and for gravity to ensure i do not ever. i look forward to not having to suffer this world's shite any longer.
