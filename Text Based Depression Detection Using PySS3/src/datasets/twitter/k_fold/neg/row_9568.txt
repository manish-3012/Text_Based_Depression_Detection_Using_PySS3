My experience with pills overdoseHi, Iâ€™m 20 and Iâ€™m italian, so sorry for my english.

Iâ€™ve just recovered from a antihistamine overdose. I took 10 times the normal dose.

I tought I would certainly die. At first I was ok, after 1 hour I started to feel drowsy so I tried to sleep, but a terrible headache destroyed me, than I puke and started to call for help, my sister came in my bedroom but I didnâ€™t recognize her, I couldnâ€™t see shit, than I fainted.

I woke up in the hospital with a lot of people near my bed, I had a lot of tubes going thru my nose, mouth and arms.

I stayed in a 2 days coma. Now I canâ€™t do ant physical activity because now my heartbeat is shit, and I wonâ€™t drink any beer for a lot.

Stay safe.
