I donâ€™t fucking know what to do lmaoOkay so basically since i was 12 iâ€™ve always been severely depressed. I started using drugs to help cope but in the long run i think that made it worse. Iâ€™m 15 now and i have a dependency on weed, iâ€™m a borderline alcoholic, I use cocaine almost every weekend, I have unbearable hppd from abusing psychedelics and i canâ€™t go more than a couple days without popping a couple benzos. Iâ€™m failing all my classes and my parents are completely oblivious to my habits. All my counselors say iâ€™m not going to graduate high school and i should try something alternative but my parents just wonâ€™t have it.  They keep on pushing me and i canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. The only thing i have to keep me going is a school trip to Japan iâ€™m going on over spring break next week. After that i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m going to do. Iâ€™m losing all hope and the only things that bring me joy are my asshole friends, drugs and binge watching the office. Iâ€™ve tried to kill my self twice before but neither of those times have i even ended up in the hospital. Suicide is the only viable option in my eyes. Itâ€™s either death or eventual homelessness. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
