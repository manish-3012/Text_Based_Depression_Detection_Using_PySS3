I'm finally gunna do it.I'm finally gunna kill myself. I've just had it. I am so beyond done trying to fight to be happy and trying to fight my depression and anxiety. I'm going to do it. I've already got a couple ways in mind. I'm just so so so so so so so sick and tired of being alive. I HATE BEING ALIVE! IM SO DONE!!!!! I'm done asking for help that I don't get and I'm done being alone. I'm actually going to do it.
