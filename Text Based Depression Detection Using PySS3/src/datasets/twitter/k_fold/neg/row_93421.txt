i dont deserve to be happyhey!!
so my life is falling apart. im stuck in a routine, i have no motivation to change anything, my parents love me but they are really emotionally abusive. they hate everything i do. how i dress, how i talk, and even how i stand. and i always try to do the right thing and change for them, but its never enough. i hate living here and i cant move out any time soon. i also have serious trust issues. i was never in a relationship, but now a guy i like likes me back. and i dont feel happy about it?? honestly im just so anxious and feel like i will ruin it way too soon. whenever something good happens, i feel like i dont deserve it or it doesnt belong to me. plus i am so scared of the future, i hate it. time goes by so fast, i feel like nothing ever happens and days are just passing me and i cant catch up. i know i can change all of this but i feel stuck. i live on the 5th floor and well if i jump head first, maybe i can die. i cant keep on living like this. i will try to change something, but if things stay the same in next month, i will jump.
