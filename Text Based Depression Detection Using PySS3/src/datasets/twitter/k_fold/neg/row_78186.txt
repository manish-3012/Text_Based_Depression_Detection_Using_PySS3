Looking at a felony charge I got while having a paychotoc break. If I end up getting a jail sentance I am going to end my life. I cannot go to jail.I was in jail for 5 days and attempted to slit my wrists with a nail. I also smashed my head against a wall. It was traumatic and terrifying.

I am awaiting a court date this month, looks like I might be excused from showing up, i moved to another state and have been getting help and am closer to my family.

Been up tonight, I cannot sleep or relax because I know for a fact if I am given any sort of jail time I am going to leave my family a suicide note and end my life. 

I am not tough enough for jail. I cannot live with a felony charge.

Terrified.
