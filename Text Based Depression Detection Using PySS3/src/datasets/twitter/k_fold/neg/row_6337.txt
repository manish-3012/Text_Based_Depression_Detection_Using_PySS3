I canâ€™t take this anymore.I was doing so well, I was happy. I got a tattoo to mark this change. My parents were furious because apparently the body is not mine. My mom came in the room to yell at me about my being selfish and in the heat of the moment I showed her my self harm scars for the first time to explain I wasnâ€™t selfish and to not call me that since I have gone through a lot of trouble to ensure I stay alive for her, and I was doing therapy for years to get myself out of that black hole. Now she is wailing on the other side of the house being comforted by my father because of the terrible thing I did to her, and I am a monster. 
Fuck this. I should be dead. The only thing stopping me is cowardice. This will go on, and I will lose that cowardice to nothing. No one will read this, no one will care. I was happy, I was so happy.
