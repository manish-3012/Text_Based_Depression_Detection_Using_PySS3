Saying goodbye, one last time...I want to say, Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m the real problem.
Iâ€™ll kill myself and it will be the only way Iâ€™ll forgive myself and escape the pain.

I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™m not important to anyone. My life is replaceable, anyway...

My family is better off without me. My friends are better off without me. The world will be better off without me. You will be better off without me...  

I will do what the world wants me to do. Iâ€™ll kill myself after school in 2 hours...hopefully everyone will be more happy with me gone...

I hope I die...
So, I just want to say goodbye...
Goodbye, everyone... ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜”
