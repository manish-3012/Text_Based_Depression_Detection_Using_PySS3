"suicide is not the route" and other bullshit from ppl who dont careIn my old hometown, the signs on the subway say "suicide is not the route". Do you get it??? Because trains,,, have routes??? Ha ha!! And then some stupid suicide hotline. I have tried them. The hotlines. Got hung up on while on hold. Another required me to fill out a highly personal questionaire before i had the HONOR of being put in a queue behind six other depressed bastards. This shit is meaningless. People dont give a fuck if you want to die, they just dont want to feel guilty when you die and im sick of it!
