I attempted suicide on Monday. I wish I had committed instead of attempted.Monday Aug 28th I sought a means to an end. Im here typing this so I made...unfortunately. I spent two nights in the ICU and was happy to be released. But now Im really wishing the shit would have just worked as planned. On top of already being fed up with all the things, my employment was terminated before I even left the hospital, but unbeknownst to me at the time. That only added more struggle and negativity to me. I honestly no longer wish to be here. I want to be someone else somewhere else not being who I am. I have family I sort of have friends, but my phone could be off for a week and nobody would notice until they needed me for a ride or something equally trivial. I dont feel like my choice is selfish. Its MY choice. I didnt ask to be born, I didnt ask for this and I no longer wish to participate.
