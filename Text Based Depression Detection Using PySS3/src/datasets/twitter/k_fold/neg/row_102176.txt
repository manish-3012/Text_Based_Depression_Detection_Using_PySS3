The thought won't go away(Alt because my friends know my account and follow it)

I was really suicidal, had plans ready, wanted to end it on my Birthday... Plans changed a bit. A person, I consider my best friend now, kinda pulled me out of my dark spot and I genuinely felt alot better. I finally had friends, so instead of killing myself I threw a party. Well, recently my thoughts started coming back, beginning with a "what if I executed my plan", then "would anyone care", moving to me picturing me going through with it. I grew some balls and talked to my closest friends about it, they reacted with support and love but now I fear they might push or have already pushed me away because of me dumping my thoughts on them. My parents also left on vacation leaving me alone for some weeks. 

Yesterday I selfharmed again, feels just like I was 15 again. I really don't want to die and I know that selfharm won't exactly help me but the thoughts are still there and won't go away.
