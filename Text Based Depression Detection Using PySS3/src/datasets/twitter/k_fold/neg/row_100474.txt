Flying through the sky in the next two daysIm not going to explain in details why at the moment, not because people do not care, but simply because i don't feel like writing a proper explaination would matter at all. 

I will use this post as my final note: i'll update it properly when it's going to happen, so that those two persons living with me will be able to see what they have ignored for 20 years. I don't care if everyone else it's going to see it: i won't exist anymore so it won't concern "me" at all. 

I have access to a pretty tall tall building: there are 5 floors, plus a deeper platform on the main floor, kinda making the height close to a 6th or a 7th floor. 

If im correct, i shouldn't be to survive such a jump; even if i do, cracking my head against the concrete should be a fatal injury; given that people rarely pass through that specific plaftorm at night, i'll be able to bleed for hours, allowing me to die even if i somehow survive the jump. I do not fear the pain at all, so it's not a huge issue. 

If luck it's on my side, im expecting to die on the same moment i'll hit to floor; otherwise 20 to 40 minutes of bleeding out of my skull are going to be enough. In any case, the thought that i'll never have to experience any of this again it's a reward worth suffering for. 

I don't care what awaits me on the other side. 

Personally i like to imagine that the moment i'll hit the ground, i'll wake up somewhere else, as someone else; but an eternal or temporany void would satisfy me as well. 

Even becoming a ghost would be okay with me. 

Just please take me away from here.
