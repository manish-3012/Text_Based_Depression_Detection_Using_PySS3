My pillars: my job, my children, crumbling beneath meWent to groups.

Had one on one sessions with therapist.

Took meds.

Found some moments.

Lost hold of anything real.

Meandering through nothingness.

I just want to sleep through my days to moments I can spend with my kids who hate spending time with me.

Need my job to stay afloat, which is barely. Hate it, every day it gets worse and worse and I want to quit minutes after I get in.

I don't know how I'd do it, but I know nobody would care.

Just when I think things are getting better, and maybe someone I can connect with comes into my life, it's clear I'm setting some expectation of something not real.

Every minute I have to step into my old house to be present in my children's lives it's like daggers are being thrown through me as I walk around and see the life I had slip through my hands and move on. Not a picture of me, not a memory of me, erased from that life.

I seriously just want to go jump in the ocean and drown myself.

I'm done with this daily unhappiness, done with the unknown, done with struggling which I feel like I've done all my life. 

Nothing is helping, nothing is getting better, just further and further into this hole.

Fuck my life.
