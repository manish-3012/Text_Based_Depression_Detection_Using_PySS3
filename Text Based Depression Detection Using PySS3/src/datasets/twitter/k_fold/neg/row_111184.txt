Was cheated on, no more will to go onI don't want to go too in depth. I gave her my senior year of high school, and freshman year of college. She was my life, my pride, my joy. She promised she'd never leave and always love me. She spent the last month of the relationship cheating on me, and I only ended up hearing it from other people. She's official with the guy she was cheating on me with now.

She doesn't feel bad. I gave her back her dead dad's Bible, I held her hand at the funeral, but she didn't even thank me for it back, even though I said she didn't deserve it back after she cheated on me. No one sees what she did wrong, and everyone says she did nothing wrong. It destroys me that I gave her two years of my life only to have it crash down like this - she was my entire emotional investment, the only place I put my feelings, and it's gone. She was the only one who understood how depressed I could be and how important she was to me, and how much she lifted me up out of the hell I was in before. She invited me over and broke up with me on Easter. I've never been so depressed, and I've tried picking myself up even through a better diet, diligent exercise, and working on sorting my mind out, but I give up. I've tried for two weeks and still feel just as shitty about myself.

It's not getting any better. I really don't want to try anymore. All the other previous pleasures of life aren't enjoyable anymore, I usually go days at a time without eating, and all the people I've reached out to won't even listen anymore, no one does, and I'm really done with this pain. I'm finding a way out one way or another. The one person who made me feel okay in life left me in the worst possible way. I want out.
