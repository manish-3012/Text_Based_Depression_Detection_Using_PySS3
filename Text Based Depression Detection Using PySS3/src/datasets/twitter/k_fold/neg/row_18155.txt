My dilemmaIâ€™m depressed but donâ€™t want to kill myself so I always distract myself by playing video games and doing things that can keep me occupied but there are responsibilities i have and things I must do otherwise my life gets harder, but depression makes it too difficult to me to live like a normal person so I canâ€™t even accomplish a thing.
Iâ€™m tired of being this miserable, I canâ€™t keep distracting myself, i need to take action but I have no strength to fight back.
Iâ€™m always blaming myself for not being able to study like normal people, people around me make me feel guilty too, like if iâ€™m slacking off..
