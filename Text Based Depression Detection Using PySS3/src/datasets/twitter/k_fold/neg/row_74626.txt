Thinking of ending itDonâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth it to go on anymore. I have been spitting up blood for 3 weeks and the doctors iâ€™ve been to have been no help. they basically said they donâ€™t know and to go to the ER if it starts getting worse. No help no instruction nothing just go to the ER if i start profusely bleeding. It is slowly getting worse day by day and i am at the point where i can not eat anything without it happening. I have lost so much weight and i feel sick. Nobody will help me iâ€™ve begged for help from my parents from doctors everybody. It seems this is the right time.
