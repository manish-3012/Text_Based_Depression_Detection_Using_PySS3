What's the point of it all?Honestly, I don't know why I bother with anything. I work in a job that I hate. Like, hate hate. I got offered a new job the other day that I think I'd really love (just a simple barista job) but they wanted me to start straight away and my employer won't let me leave without a months notice so I had to turn the job down. I can't hand in my notice without having another job to go to, so looks like I'm going to be miserable for a while longer. I'm gutted. I really wanted this job, but alas it was not to be.

I'm lonely. I have friends that I love with all of my heart but I'm so depressed that I can't bring myself to do anything with them. I've been going to the doctors and I've taken all of the pills and the therapy they can offer and it's done jack shit. I'm still depressed as fuck and thinking of ending my life almost everyday. I'm stuck in a rut that I can't get out of.

I'm having to move back in with my parents next month due to me not being able to afford rent despite working full time. That wouldn't be a problem, except my parents have now told me that they're moving out of the place I've grown up in and I'm probably going to have to go with them. I wanted to move in with them so I could save for a few months and then just fuck off somewhere... but that doesn't look possible now.

I'm just stressed to the max. I feel like shit. I'm lonely. I'm miserable. I don't see any way out and I just want to stop existing. I've gotten to the point where I hope I get seriously ill and end up in hospital just to have a fucking break from everything. 

Anyway, I needed to rant. I'm debating suicide everyday and it just feels like sometime sooner rather than later, I'm going to succumb to it. 

Peace out guys.
