Can someone just say goodbye? I'm going to hang myself soonHi,
Sorry that this is so attention whoring, but I'm going to hang myself this evening and I'd just like to feel a bit less alone. Even a 'goodbye' comment would be nice haha. Everyone has their own lives and stuff but someone acknowledging I exist for a second is kind of nice now that it's so close to the end. 

I've never had a 'happy' period o my life. Just moments sometimes. I'm so sorry for my parents but i must not be too sorry. I just can't deal with reality. I have maladaptive daydreaming to cope, but I'm 20 and soon I won't be able to avoid reality like I can when I'm in college. I've wasted my life. I should have followed my passion, but it was a humanities so lol nope. But it's the only thing that ever made me feel fulfilled. I can't connect with people. I feel nothing except when I'm immersed in daydreaming. It's time to admit that I need to give up.
