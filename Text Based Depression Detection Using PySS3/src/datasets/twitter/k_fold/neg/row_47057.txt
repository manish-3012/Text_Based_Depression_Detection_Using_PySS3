My girlfriend died in a car accident and all I want to do is follow herIt was so sudden. We spent all day Friday together, and I told her how much I loved her. She was driving home from work on Saturday night and a drunk driver came roaring off the freeway and t-boned her car. She died instantly, according to the paramedics. Broken neck. The same neck I so lightly stroked with the tips of my fingers just 24 hours earlier. The same neck I would kiss, and nuzzle into and tickle with my beard and make her laugh and tell me to cut it out in her beautiful voice. 

I have a few recordings of us together, we would collaborate on projects and I'd always put a recorder on the table to record our brainstorming sessions. I listened to one and heard her asking me about the restaurant we went to the night before, and I broke down sobbing. 

I see her eyes every time I close mine. That gentle brown ringed with pure white. I can't live without her, I'm barely managing to exist. She wouldn't want me to die, I know that, but how do I go on? On some level I think everything I did was for her. Telling her about my work, my friends, my whole life. The way she lit up with joy at my successes, and joined me in cursing the world at my failures. 

I'd give anything to be with her again.
