Why can't I do itI get the urge to off myself every single night. I don't have the strength to talk to anybody about it. I can't talk to anybody about why I feel like this. I got to therapy and just lie to my therapist. I don't know what to do. Please just let me die. I don't want to do it because I don't want to hurt my parents and friends. They're what made the 26 years worth living. 

Please.
