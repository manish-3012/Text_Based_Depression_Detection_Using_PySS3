Don't think I ever thought I'd post this.I'm tired. I'm tired of being bored. I'm tired of not enjoying things I know I would. I can't feel what I really feel underneath. I can't stand the hell I'm experiencing.

The doctors couldn't tell what was wrong with me for over four years. To give you an idea of the discomfort, I would rather have had my legs chopped off at the knee than deal with this.

Everyone I know is moving on when I couldn't even experience my last few years.

It's not depression.

Edit: I really wish rule 1c wasn't a rule, because religion can really help some people. Believing that there's a purpose to life.
