Is ignoring everyone else's thoughts and just focusing on ourselves the key for happiness?Many therapists I've had told me this, that I need to be strong enough to stop caring about anyone else's thoughts, so that I only care about my own thoughts and world in the process.

Isn't that shutting the entire world?

Society is like... People can hurt others as much as they want, and those hurt people need to fix everything, not just their mistakes, but other's mistakes as well, and if they don't, they're called negative, toxic and stuff like that.

I tried to do what I thought was right, I tried to be kind, supportive and sincere... But it didnt' work at all.

My world is crumbling apart, I'm making my family (mostly my mom) suffer in the process since I'm not getting better, I haven't done the tasks my therapist gave me (if she finds out she'll probably get angry at me, and she would be 100% right in doing so).

Had I been a selfish person, would I be happier right now?

I know it's a selfish way of thinking but, I guess I can be selfish every once in a while.
