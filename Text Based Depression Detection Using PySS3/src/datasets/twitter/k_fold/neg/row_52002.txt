One good reason why i shouldn't kill myself?Every reason I've ever been given or heard is useless.

I have no ambitions or hobbies. No desire to work. No interest in getting better, since nothing actually works. Tried basically everything.

My entire life if I stay alive will be working a dead end minimum wage job for the rest of my life until I retire just to keep my boyfriend and family happy because I'm not dead. But honestly fuck that, why should I keep going if ***I*** don't want to?
