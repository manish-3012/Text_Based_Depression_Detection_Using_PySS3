Do I live to see another shit year?What's the point, I can't be bothered with all the drama of Christmas and New Years because it's over for me. I'm done with feeling down and depressed all the time. 

Some people are born into life gifted ready to excel at it where as some of us have a hard upbringing and have to live an unbearably difficult life.
