EvictionWhat do you do when you're 25 years old, have horrible credit, lost your job, and now have two weeks to make $900 for rent or you'll be evicted. There's no possible way I'll find a job and be put on payroll in time enough. This is my first apartment ever and I've been here for a year. This entire month I've been contemplating suicide every second of the day and it's driving me insane. Any advice?
