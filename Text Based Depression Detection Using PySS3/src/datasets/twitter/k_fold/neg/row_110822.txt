how do i get over the fact that i feel my suicide attempt wasn't "real."someone told me that i didn't really try to kill myself, and honestly, it was a very emotional stage of my life, where I drank, smoked, and used alcohol, and was planning on going to the bridge, but couldn't walk.

has anyone else felt this sort of "imposter syndrome" for an attempt before?
