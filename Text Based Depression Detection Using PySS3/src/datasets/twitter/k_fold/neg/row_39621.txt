29m lostIâ€™m 29 y.o male who developed physical/mental problems from moderate cocaine use in early 20s and heavy pot/oral tobacco use on and off until May 2019. I wasnâ€™t feeling well in mid 20s got blood work done and it showed I had low testosterone so after 1 yr of trying to get it up naturally I decided to go on hormone replacement therapy. Long story short it helped some with energy etc but still havenâ€™t felt the same since I was younger. I eventually made some dumb decisions from 27-28 and was using  not best quality cocaine on an off. I sit here with damage to my nose throat lungs and definitely brain and peripheral nerves with bad depression. Iâ€™ve never had a gf due to sexual dysfunction and walked away from 60k salary job last year from terrible anxiety. Most of my family hates me from some of the choices I made and Iâ€™m barely hanging on to a hotel front desk job at the moment.

Iâ€™ve messed my self up pretty bad and Iâ€™m not even sure why Iâ€™m posting on here. My only thought is to go buy a gun and end it   :-/
