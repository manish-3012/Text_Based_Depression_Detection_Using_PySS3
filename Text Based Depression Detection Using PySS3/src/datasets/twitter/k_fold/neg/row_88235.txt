I don't know what else there is i should wait for.So I'm going to be 23 in a few days, I've been lost in life for a long time, I don't know who I am, I don't know who I want to be, everyone else seems like they know what they're doing and I'm just drifting and never getting anywhere. 

I've already come to terms with the idea that none of my friends are really a big reason for me to stick around. I know everyone says "your family will be devastated if something happens to you". However at this point I don't even think they're worth me sticking around. I feel like they're better off without me.

I'm trying to see a silver lining, to see if there's any beacon of hope that's more than just a shiny mirage, it's all fake. I don't know how to think or change my mind, short of 23, doesn't sound too bad at this point. 

I'm writing this because I believe others have a way of explaining things to you when you can't understand them. I don't know what to do and now I just feel like a lost cause, a dead weight to everyone around me.
