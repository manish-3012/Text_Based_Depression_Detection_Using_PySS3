People don't really care......People don't really care, the only reason they want you around is to exploit and take advantage of you until they can no longer do so. Suicide continues to rise like a mountain, and it will continue to rise. You can't count on anyone for anything, that is why it is better to just do it yourself. Life is suffering, pain, misery, regret, and unpleasant yet people stick around and try to force others to do the same. It is out of fear that they do this..... The fear that they themselves along with their own lives have no meaning. When in fact that is the truth. Humanity is a cult, and it's purpose is to trap you here and use you until it comes to point where you will be discarded like trash and replaced by another automaton.
