Iâ€™m pathetic and I hate myselfI donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me or why Iâ€™m like this. When I was younger I was really outgoing and friendly, but now Iâ€™m socially fucking inept. I donâ€™t talk to anyone or go out. I have declined every invitation for over a decade, so no one bothers to invite me to things anymore. I donâ€™t answer my phone. I donâ€™t respond to texts. My only close friend since high school (Iâ€™m 24) was online and he has moved on to real life friends so Iâ€™m just completely alone now. I donâ€™t know how to talk to people. I donâ€™t like being drunk or high because I feel paranoid and out of control and like Iâ€™m going to do something embarrassing. I donâ€™t even know what people my age do together anymore besides go out drinking. Anything I can think of to go out and do for fun requires at least one friend to be with me and I donâ€™t even have that. I just moved far from home because I thought it would force me to get out and meet people, but now Iâ€™m even lonelier than before because I donâ€™t even have my family around. I just sit in my room watching Netflix and eating. Iâ€™m pretty sure I have binge eating disorder because all I want to do is eat all day long. I look at pictures of myself from a couple years ago and I was so cute and now Iâ€™m a big fat miserable lump. My life is pathetic and Iâ€™m too far behind to fix it. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.
