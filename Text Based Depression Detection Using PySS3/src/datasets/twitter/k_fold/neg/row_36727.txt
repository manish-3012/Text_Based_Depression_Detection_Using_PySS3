I don't see how I can keep goingI've messed up so many things in my life so bad. I've cut everyone out of my life because I'm sick of acting like everythings ok and I don't want others to know how fucked up my situation is. I don't see how I can continue living as I'm such a failure. 

In the bigger picture I was always a lazy, stupid idiot who couldn't do anything. My goal in life was to be somebody, but with the way things have been going I'm bound to be a nobody loser scum of the earth piece of trash and I really don't want to continue living until that's actually true
