Considering suicide over chronic pain and headaches.I have daily headaches and neck pain and despite seeing multiple doctors I've gotten no relief. I'm only 20 years old and my life is garbage I don't even want to go into it anymore. I can't play the sports I love or the activities I enjoy because of this wretched disorder. All I do is study, study, study and try to not think about the pain.
