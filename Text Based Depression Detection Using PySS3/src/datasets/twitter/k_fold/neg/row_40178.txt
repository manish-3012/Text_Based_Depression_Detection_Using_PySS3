BDD makes me want to die no matter what I doI know I have body issues. They're complicated by the fact that I'm trans. Nobody ever calls me a man and people seem to think I'm good-looking. I've had multiple surgeries on my face to fix the features I hate, and they've kind of helped. But things are still bad. I've been in therapy for years, am on my second antidepressant, and have upped my dose of lamictal a few times. Nothing seems to help.

At best I can look in the mirror from certain angles and think I look just okay. At worst the thought of how I look makes me want to kill myself. It's stupid, because consciously I know beauty isn't the most important thing, and I have lots of other things going on in my lifeâ€”good friends, fulfilling work, etc. but I can't shake feeling like I should die because I look like an ugly man. I haven't actually made an attempt but I've gotten close a few times over the past couple of years. Sometimes the only thing keeping me from grabbing a razor or pills is the thought of how much it would destroy the people I love, but I've also thought about how I could tank my following and pre-emptively drive away my loved ones so nobody would miss me. Has anyone else dealt with this stuff? I know other people with body image issues but none so strong they regularly inspire intrusive thoughts of suicide.
