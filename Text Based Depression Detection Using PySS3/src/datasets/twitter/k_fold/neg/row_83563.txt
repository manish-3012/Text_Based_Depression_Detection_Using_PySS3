Iâ€™m going to end it before ChristmasI have been in this relationship for four years and he treated me badly for the first two years. He logged in to my trading acct and lost me $170k on purpose. Reason? He thought I was cheating on him while I was working on my projects. He compared me to his ex girlfriend and said she was way sexier and smarter than me. I wanted to leave this relationship but he threatened he would never pay my loss back if I left. Plus we have a baby boy together. I donâ€™t want to leave him alone... but my depression and anxiety are getting worse. I will be a bad influence for him anyway...
Itâ€™s time to end things. Iâ€™m done with this battle. Iâ€™m done with this fucking relationship full of hatred and distrust. Iâ€™m thinking of jumping off the bridge at night when nobody is watching.  Ppl say I should be happy bc I just got my PhD. I just wanted to finish my dissertation and then call it off.
Iâ€™m done. I need to spend more time with my baby before I do that. Iâ€™m sorry for him. I donâ€™t have other solutions. My mental issues are killing me. Iâ€™m done yelling and crying. Just let me end my own misery.
Thank you for reading my rant...
