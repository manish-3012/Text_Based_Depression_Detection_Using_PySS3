My high blood pressure makes me want to kill myself.[I outlined why I'm feeling bad here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/35ib01/i_hate_summer_days_its_hot_im_in_pain_and_i_want/) but since I made that post, I'm feeling worse.


My allergies and high blood pressure are making being awake suffering and it's been like this every day this summer. I keep coughing and each time it feels like something might pop in my head. I want to sleep but my body won't let me.


Every time I go to the doctors, they're fucking clueless, too. They can't figure out why it's spiking and why the meds won't work.


Right now as I type this, my body feels stiff but my hands are shaking. It sucks and makes me want to kill myself.


Worst part is that I can't talk to anyone about this because nobody cares enough to respond back when I try telling them.
