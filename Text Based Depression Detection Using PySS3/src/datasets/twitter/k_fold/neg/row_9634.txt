Why am I like thisI feel like I have created my own Hell through my mental illnesses and there is no way out. I never asked for this and I never asked to be here. Just when I think I am seeing the light again nothing makes sense anymore and I realize I am alone. I isolate myself and I envy all the joy I see in those around me. I feel only glimpses of humanity. I have been diagnosed with ADHD and I am still left untreated. I am so scared. I used to think there was a grandeur purpose and explanation to my behavior and my decisions. Now I see nothing and I just feel I have no control. I canâ€™t describe this feelings Iâ€™m having anymore. Someone please help me. I am so scared.
