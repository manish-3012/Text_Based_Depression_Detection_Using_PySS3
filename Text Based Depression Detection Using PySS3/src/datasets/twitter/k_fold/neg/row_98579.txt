I keep on thinking about how involuntary most of my life is.I feel as if I have people subtly telling me how to live every day, subtly suggesting I conform to some set of principles which will improve my social standing in the system we have set up today. Some of the best people I've ever known have believed in me for who I am, it's so strange some of those friendships faded away after college yet many of the ones which are so toxic seem to have persisted. I mean there are definitely redeeming qualities for my friends and family, I don't want to say they're not everything I wanted or expect. I have no expectations for them, it's just that ideologically I am fiercely against many perspectives which feel untouched by their critical senses. Like, sometimes I feel as if the challenge I face is convincing people my values are actually correct and I do believe they are but they involve some pretty radical life changes in order to actually accept them so I really feel the pressure to adapt or augment for people. 

I just don't like being the odd man out anymore, I don't like being untalented, stressed, undervalued. I don't like to pretend my pain is less than it is, I don't want to punish anyone I just want to be done with this part of my life and it's being extended and extended the further into poverty I fall.  I'm ready to accept death but it won't accept me either, nothing I say or do will ever fill this void of purpose. I keep waiting for a fight worth my energy, a fight which really matters and which I am well prepared to participate in but the star never align and I am never really good enough to defend my lifestyle anyways so I will always appear to be a bum and I will die a bum to the people.
