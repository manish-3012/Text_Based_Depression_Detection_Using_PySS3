Am I the only one who finds everything infuriating?Iâ€™m writing this to see if Iâ€™m the only one feeling this way, it started around the same time (a little later) after I wanted to kill myself which Iâ€™m not sure if that matters or this is some form of disorder/illness. It didnâ€™t have to be that challenging at all even things from washing the dishes and tidying up were annoying even things I used to enjoy like Christmas gifts for example, I hated having to look for them, I hated having to leave the house on Christmas. 

(Sorry for any grammatical or spelling errors Iâ€™m not the smartest)
