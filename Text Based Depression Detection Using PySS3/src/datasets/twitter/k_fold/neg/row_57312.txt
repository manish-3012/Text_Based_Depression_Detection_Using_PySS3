HelpWhen I was born I was put into the NICU (I think thatâ€™s what itâ€™s called). After a couple of weeks I was released and sent to the house. At around three months my father supposedly shook me. Thatâ€™s what my mother told me. Growing up was not hard or anything, but I was one of those kids who just didnâ€™t have any friends. It wasnâ€™t until I was in junior high, that my mother told me what happened when I was younger. When my father did this I was rushed to the emergency room, and a shunt had to be placed inside me. Because of this I had to have many surgeries. Now that I graduated college and now stay at the house all of my feelings are come back. Iâ€™ve always had thoughts in my head saying things like, â€œwhat if I just drove my truck off this bridge?, or something similar. Now that my sister has her kid my father tries to be gentle with him. I know Iâ€™m not supposed to hate him, but I always start thinking that why couldnâ€™t you treated me that way. I get these feelings that Iâ€™m not wanted. Why would the person who you look up to do something like that? I made a promise to myself that if I ever buy the right gun, that I will try to make the pain go away.
