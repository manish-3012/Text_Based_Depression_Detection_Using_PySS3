I'm a psychology major and I can even help myself...I have taken the classes and I know the material. From the outside looking in I live a fantastic life with lots of friends and family who love me and I love them, I am well educated and not that bad looking. I have had some challenges through out the past few years, I lost my best friend when I was 16, was raped and assaulted one night on a run.. things like that. I've tried the different types of therapy and nothing seems to help. I can give advice to anyone but can't seem to take it myself. I literally feel, since my suicide attempt a few years ago that that is how I will ultimately die. I am a fun, energetic, kindhearted person and it would shock everyone, other than my immediate family and a couple of close friends if I took my own life, but I honestly feel it is what I need to do. I will never be truly genuinely happy and I feel so hypocritical advising people on what they should do from a psychological standpoint when in reality I just want to hug them and tell them I understand...
Any advice?
