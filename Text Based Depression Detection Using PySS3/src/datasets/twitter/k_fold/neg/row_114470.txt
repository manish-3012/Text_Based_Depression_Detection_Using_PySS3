I tried to hang myself with a beltWrote some notes. Set up the belt in the door. Sat down and faded out after maybe 15 seconds.....

...


But the FUCKING BELT SNAPPED AND I WOKE UP CONFUSED WITH A HEADACHE sometime later... CONFUSED and PISSED.

I just kept asking why the belt couldn't hold for a while longer...

That was 2 months ago....

All I think about now is slipping into oblivion again and being free of Life. I had a life. At least I thought I did. I had friends (no friends now). I had dreams. I had potential. Now all I have are thoughts about dying. Psychotic breaks. A need for weed and a food habit that has spiraled out of control. I do nothing. I see no one. I have nothing. I have no one. I'm a burden to my dad who took me in at 25. I'm a disappointment to my family. I'm an embarrassment to myself. Moved away from the city I grew up because of all the embarrassment and shame I brought upon myself. I am as useful as a rock in a pile of rocks. 

I'm going to end up putting that belt back in that door and completing the task. 

I can't help but feel like that is my destiny.
