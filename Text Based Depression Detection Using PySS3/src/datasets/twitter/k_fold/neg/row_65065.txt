Although I'm Not Directly Suicidal, I Don't Feel Like LivingI'm becoming more reckless, careless, depressed, paranoid, unneeded, unloved, etc. I really don't know how to get better. I believe it started when my girlfriend of five months all of a sudden stopped talking to me for about three weeks, then broke up with me without actually giving me a real reason why. It made me ultimately confused and I just feel less than human. I have this eye condition that prohibits me from driving and seeing at night or in dark areas, and it makes me feel really insecure, like who would give a damn to stick by me regardless of my condition. Although she never gave me a reason for the breakup, I feel this might be one of those reasons, but it's really messed up my mindset. She broke up with me two days before Thanksgiving and it's March now. I don't feel like I'm getting any better, just more hollow and I just want it to be over.
