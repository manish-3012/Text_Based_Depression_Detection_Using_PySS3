Being awake is too painful (vent)Iâ€™m in my 20s and honestly ever since I was 13 I wanted to kill myself. I was bullied heavily for my teeth and looks and my parents didnâ€™t do anything. They just yelled at me when Iâ€™d come home crying. Itâ€™s been a long time since those days, but I still donâ€™t feel any better. My mom just died and almost all my friends distanced themselves from me because itâ€™s too much for them to deal with. My dad recently had a stroke so my life has revolved around taking care of him and his needs, but he can still be very cruel to me yelling at me for being too emotional or being told I have too much attitude when Iâ€™m asking reasonable things of him like (clean up after yourself please). 

My boyfriend lives with me to help with my dad and frankly youâ€™d think having a partner would make things easier and Iâ€™d have support, but itâ€™s not if anything now I have no privacy to express my emotions like crying or being sad because heâ€™s always there. The other night I was crying (Iâ€™m still grieving my mom and just life in general because of covid) and he tells me with a lot of anger in his voice that heâ€™s sick of me crying every night and that I need to see a therapist and that itâ€™s becoming too much for him (I have been seeing a therapist btw they arenâ€™t helping). I have no place in my house where I can go to even cry anymore. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m being constantly watched by my dad and boyfriend and any chance they get to tell me to grow up or tell me Iâ€™m doing it to myself they pounce. 

I just idk Iâ€™ve always just wanted someone to be kind to me, my grandma was the only person who ever showed me unconditional love and sheâ€™s long gone, my boyfriend says he just canâ€™t give me the support I need. My dad has always been terrible with dealing with emotions (his own and mine) defaulting to yelling at me and rolling his eyes.

I just donâ€™t have anyone to talk to and I just wish I was worthy of respect. Itâ€™s getting really hard to want to be alive honestly.
