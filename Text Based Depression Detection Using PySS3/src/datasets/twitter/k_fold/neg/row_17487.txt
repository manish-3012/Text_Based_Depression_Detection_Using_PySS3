idkI keep getting really strong urges to kill myself. I spent the last 5 minutes just crying and holding my pill bottles, Iâ€™m prescribed sleeping pills and I have about 70. I genuinely dont have anything to live for. Iâ€™ve been in and out of treatment for 2 years with non stop depression and anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I canâ€™t stand the quiet for even a minute. Most of the time Iâ€™m just tired but I held all those pills in front of me and it was like the feeling I got when I was trying to quit nicotine. An almost uncontrollable urge to down them all at once. Just thinking about it gives me a dopamine rush and I havenâ€™t felt any positive emotion in a while. sorry.
