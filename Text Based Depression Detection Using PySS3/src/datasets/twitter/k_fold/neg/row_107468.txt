I attempted 4 times last year and was in mental institute AMAI figured thisbmight be a good place to do this so others can understand it does get better.

A little background:

Picked on as a child until yr 7

Had a baby when i was 18 (i am now 21)

I Was in a horrible relationship and only stayed for the baby

I attempted 4 times last year(not saying how) and i am so glad i didnt do it. I was in a mental institute and i even had shock therapy. 

I am living happily now with a girl i have been with for almost a year and i couldnt even imagine how i ended up in the state i was in

So there it is people. AMA
