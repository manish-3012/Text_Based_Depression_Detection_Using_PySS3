I cant seem to shove down my feelings anymore.I keep thinking about how awful I look/feel/am and it doesn't go away. I used to be able to hide it,mask it,or even shove it down for a little while using other things to make me forget. (Not drugs or anything but like video games and fun stuff) but it's not working any more. I can't seem to get out of bed hardly except to eat and bathe. My grandma is upset I don't do more around the house my job is sorts sloping. Any one have tips on how to get out my feelings in a healthy way?

-thanks. Onehundrendontyone
