Hey, I just want to release pent up emotionsI want to kill myself. It wouldnâ€™t be the first time I tried or even the second. Lately Iâ€™ve been getting more suicidal due to not meeting the ends for graduation and not having any idea of what to do. Iâ€™ve actually didnâ€™t even think Iâ€™d make it to my senior year in high school. The only reason Iâ€™m still semi-alive is because of an anime I like to watch that is far from complete and it comes with a new season every year so yeah.
Today though, I finally decided that Iâ€™m going to die before I turn 20 (currently 17, 18 on dec 22) because Iâ€™m obviously not cut out for this world as you can tell from my statements above.
Iâ€™ve had years of therapy and medicine. Had my medicine tweaked a lot but I donâ€™t have insurance anymore so I canâ€™t even get refills nor more therapy not that it helped much anyway. 
School makes me beyond depressed, it makes me so suicidal. Iâ€™ve asked my teachers for help and the counselors and my principal for help but, they say the exact same thing as my parent do, â€œyouâ€™re so close, just finish the yearâ€ but, I guess they donâ€™t remember the countless other times Iâ€™ve screamed for help throughout those years. Itâ€™s getting harder and harder for me not to suffocate myself in my own thoughts and emotions. 
It hurts and itâ€™s been aching for a years and years.
I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s on the other side but I donâ€™t care if I cease to exist, but I just want to end this.
