I canâ€™t fight anymoreEveryday is a struggle, everyday is a fight, I look at people that are happy and relaxed and seem to have everything going their way and I donâ€™t understand it. Why canâ€™t I have that? Why must I always fight for even the barest if scraps, Itâ€™s been 20 years of hard daily fighting just to survive and I canâ€™t anymore Iâ€™m just finished, I donâ€™t have the strength to continue fighting just to survive on the absolute minimum. How do people do it? Whatâ€™s the point of fighting and struggling your whole life and then dying? When comes the part where you get to enjoy being alive? I know my life is going to be a struggle till my last breath so what difference will today or 20 years from today make?
