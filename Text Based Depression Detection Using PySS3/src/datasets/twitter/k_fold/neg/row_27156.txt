I'm too mentally and physically tired to continueIm failing classes, i've felt myself distance myself from my friends, my love of my life doesn't love me back, everything I do and everything I think of results in a panic attack, and I'm too tired of putting on a fake personality to conceal how I really feel. I can also feel my body getting weaker, as if my body is giving up too. I've wasted my life away on video games, and I have no future. Nothing brings me true happiness. I see no reason to keep living. The longer I keep living, the more enticing a bottle of sleeping pills look.
