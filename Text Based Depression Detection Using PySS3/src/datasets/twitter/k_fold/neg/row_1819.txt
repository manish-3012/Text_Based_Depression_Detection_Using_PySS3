My Final Goodbye. A Letter.Tonight is the night my entire life has lead up to. After this is sent out to my few friends, family, and associated social media accounts, I plan to bleed myself out in the tub. My elavil has stopped working and I'm left with no other solutions. Hanging myself like my mom did feels too much like a slap in the face toward her and I've always been afraid that a gun would miss and leave me more scarred than before. This is the only way that feels right. There are a lot of things I've been grateful for, don't get me wrong. I love my dad, my brother, my sisters, and my step mom so much. They've always been supportive of me. They accepted my sexuality, they tried to get me therapy when it was needed, they've done so many wonderful things for me. I've gotten to meet my biggest idols, I've been sung directly to by my favorite singer, I've been to Disney more times than I can count. It probably doesn't make sense why I feel so down even though my home life is amazing. But there are some things I haven't told you all. I've been torn down, outcast, emotionally abused, sexually harassed and more. I'm at a stage in my life where presenting myself as normal to the public just isn't possible anymore. I can barely function and instead of getting the assistance with things from non-family members that I need, I was punished for not keeping up. There's one more person in this message that I haven't mentioned yet. You betrayed me more times than I can count. You lied to me my entire life then fucked me over when I needed you the most. This blood is on your hands. You know who you are.

Goodbye, I'll miss you all.
