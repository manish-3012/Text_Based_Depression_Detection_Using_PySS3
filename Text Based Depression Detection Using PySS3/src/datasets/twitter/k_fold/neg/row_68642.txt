spoke to the doctorspoke to the doctor how i'm feeling, explained everything and how long it's been going on she just said i need more of a routine in my life and didn't really take me seriously despite telling her i harm myself and it's hard to even leave my bed most days, everyone says i need professional help i try reach out and she underplays it despite me persisting i feel so much worse now
