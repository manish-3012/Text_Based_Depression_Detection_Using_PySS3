Comfortably suicidalI am suicidal. Let's start with admitting that.
I am not always attached to being alive, however, I enjoy life most of the time along with family and friends.
I could be having a good time with my BFF,  but suddenly, suicidal thoughts come to remind me how pathetic my life is. They knock every wall down and they take charge of the kingdom to make me prisoner of my own soul.
I fake a smile, even when I am breaking down, trying to figure out what went wrong. Nothing went wrong but me. I am the problem, but somehow, I can't fix myself. 
I feel like crying, but I'm too numb to shred a tear. I cannot express myself through other way that is not through poetry and writing. 
So, I said it. I am comfortably suicidal. 
I live in a world where  I wanna disappear, but my presence wants to stay.
I bet I am not the only one feeling this way.
Through this post, I reach for you all to express yourselves. You all deserve it.
