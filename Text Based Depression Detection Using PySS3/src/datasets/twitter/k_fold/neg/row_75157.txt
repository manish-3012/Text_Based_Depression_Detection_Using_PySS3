A semi-long vent.the past 33 years of my life have been me struggling to keep my head above water. I've been to so many doctors, been on so many medications, tried so many things to help fix my suicidal tendencies, depression, etc and none of these things have seemed to work. whenever things were bad though, I always had my mom and my brother to support me, and I don't think they know how much I love them. but last week I made a really stupid move and it cost me a trip to my brother's wedding, and now he and his wife understandably hate me too. all that's left to live for is my mom, and she's dying of cancer. I can't shake the "goddamn, everyone would be so much happier if I had never been born" feeling. I'm nothing like the rest of my family and I've never quite fit in there or anywhere. it just seems like the light at the end of the tunnel is slowly going out.  there just is not any hope left and it feels like there's nothing worth fighting for. I can't talk to my mom about any of this, and like I said, my brother/his wife aren't exactly speaking to me. I don't want to hurt myself, but I also don't *not* want to, you know?
