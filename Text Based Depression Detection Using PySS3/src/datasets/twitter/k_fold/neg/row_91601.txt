Stress is killing meIve had bi polar disorder for 12 years. Im a broke student and took too many classes (my bad) I'm terrified of losing money and have become completely catatonic and unable to complete anything. Im scared of homelessness, Im scared ill get hurt again. Im suffering from grief and some horrific things that happened to ym friends

some of the only hope I have is that I voted by mail and my family is alive. But I'm so tired of the pain. I wish I was never born because I wouldnt have to deal with this pain. I would have never had to experience all the abuse. My apathy couldn't be stronger than it is right now. Ive had 3 suicide attempts this year
 I want to die every moment of the day. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up
