Iâ€™m going to kill myself some dayI donâ€™t know when, all I know is that Iâ€™m just delaying the inevitable. The only thing stopping me right now is that I donâ€™t want to hurt my friends or family, they think that telling me they love me helps but it just makes me feel worse because I know one day I WILL kill myself and itâ€™s going to make them sad, my only other choice is being a leech on them and society until I hopefully die of a disease. I hate my body and want to damage it, and Iâ€™m not smart or motivated enough to go to university or get a job, I donâ€™t see the point in trying when life isnt fulfilling. I crave relationships but Iâ€™m a fucking retard who canâ€™t have healthy relationships, I just want to be a normal, functioning member of society but thatâ€™s never going to happen, I have no idea what to do, my entire existence is a mistake, Iâ€™m sick and shoudlnt be alive, itâ€™s not fair on me or anyone around me. I canâ€™t even masturbate to feel good because it triggers my dysphoria and makes me feel worse, the only thing that gives me endorphins is self harm because Iâ€™m a sick masochist, but that makes my family sad which makes me feel like an awful person. I canâ€™t do it anymore Iâ€™m a wreck
