I just tried to commit suicide and it didn't work helpI need to commit suicide. I'm 15. I dont have a future. Im a disgusting trans, parents and siblings dont accept me and are hyper religious, I have no friends, not in school, bullied in my past, have anxiety to where i can talk to no one, not even my parents, depression as well, the only person I have is my boyfriend who is leaving me for some random girl irl because he doesnt like long distance. He's all i had. I tried to hang myself and let myself dangle for some time but i didn't pass out. I could barely breathe, each breathe was a tiny wheeze... I was trying to get a therapist but my parents are gatekeeping me from it. I dont find fun in anything anymore, I have no one to talk to, i'm stupid, retarded, and a waste of space. My heart is physically aching right now. I dont know what to do, Im going to try it again later when my parents are sleeping/not at home and this time ill kick the thing that was under me to make sure i complete it.
