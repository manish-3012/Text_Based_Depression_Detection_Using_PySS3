I am a broken shell of a personI remember that once, my heart was filled with love. I tried to give, give and give as much as I could, thinking that I was preventing others from suffering as I did.

In the end, I fell into a path of self-destruction, where I kept giving until I ended up almost 100% dry of love, and when I found out my efforts were pretty much in vain...

I still have love for others, but it's not as much as it used to be. 

Also, I wonder... Will I ever have any kind of peace?

I've always had trouble to fit with others, from preschool, to elementary and high school, college and the internet as well. 

I ended up being bullied, turned into a person filled with regret, emptiness and indifference, and as much as I would like to think everything will be fine, I don't think so...

I got angry with people from my past, I'm angry with people from my present, and I fear for loneliness in a future.
