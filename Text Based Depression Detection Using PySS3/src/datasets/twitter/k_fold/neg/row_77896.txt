A month ago my best friend sent me his suicide note and I need help helping him.My friend, who I've known since I was born, is in every sense of the word a brother to me. In early June he sent me a suicide note. I immediately texted him back and every day after until he responded. About a week later I hear back from him, and he seems to be doing better. I remember the phrase "Well, I'm alive and I have no plans to change that in the near future" so vividly. It was such a rush of relief and happiness. I truly love this man like family so I was so happy to hear that he wasn't in such a dark place anymore. I continued texting him every day, but again, I didn't get a response for awhile. When I did hear from him again, he was telling me about some fun things he had planned in a few weeks. This went on for awhile and the other night I called him and we talked for a good while. He told me some of the things he was going through and I just kinda listened. When he was done I told him that I love him no matter what and that he'll always be my family. He thanked me and said he had to go to bed because he had work in the morning. I haven't told anybody about this except for a pretty close mutual friend that we have. I feel like I'm not doing enough or that he's not as healthy as he leads on and it's tearing me apart and I don't know what to do. He lives across the country so I can't just go visit him or invite him to hang out or anything. I just don't know what to do. Please help me, and please help him.
