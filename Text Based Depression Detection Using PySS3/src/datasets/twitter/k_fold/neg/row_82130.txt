I was supposed to end it last fridayI posted here before saying that I will end it last Friday. I didn't.

I wish I did go through with it.

I sat down crying that night. Drank some alcohol while I stared at my knife. I sat there and tried to call multiple people but no one answered. I sat there waiting to see if I anyone would call back. No one called back. Tried calling the suicide hotline here, lmao it kept ringing and ringing and ringing. Did I mention I have to use what little data I have on my Sim since it's not free to call? 

I sat there and waited. And waited. Not even the person I love called or answered. 

Do you know what it feels like to have finally truly realised that you have nothing else? 

To have what little light or hope ripped out from deep inside you?

I tried to play videogames, make art. But none of it is working. I remember people getting mad saying "we thought you died".... But they never really bothered to check????

I don't know what got into me last night.  Might be the booze. Might be the fact that I had nothing else to live for but I tried to confront my abuser face to face. It was a mistake. It was a horrible mistake on my part. 

I tried calling people again today. I tried calling the suicide hotline again. I tried calling anyone. No one answered. Nobody honestly cares here. Nobody honestly misses me. They told me I'm worth it but I guess I'm not worth enough for anything. 

I just wanted to feel like I'm something. I just wanted to feel safe. And loved. And wanted. Idk. Idk anymore.
