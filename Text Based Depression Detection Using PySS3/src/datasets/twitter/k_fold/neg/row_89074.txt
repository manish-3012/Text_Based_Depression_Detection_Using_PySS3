I don't get itI seriously don't get why everyone is like "oh life is great, don't die", well? What's so great about it? I seriously don't understand. I'm only 15, got a family, just a got a little sis like a week ago, got friends, but I still don't really want to live. 

Unlike some people with mental issues but doesn't want to die, I feel like I'm the opposite. I don't think I'm depressed, at least, not full on, but I am extremely suicidal. I've got my shit ready, just waiting for that day now. 

But seriously, what is the meaning of life? I've searched it on the internet, and no answer seems to satisfy me. There's so many people happily living in the world, struggling for money and shelter and other shit. I don't get it, if you are going to die one day, why try so hard?
