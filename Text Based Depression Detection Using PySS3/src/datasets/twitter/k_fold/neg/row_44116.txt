Going insaneHey guys. Iâ€™m a 16 yo girl living in northern Europe. Feel like Iâ€™m going mental. I honestly donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. I have almost everything you could ask for in life, yet Iâ€™m fucking miserable. Canâ€™t enjoy anything, canâ€™t feel anything, the whole time Iâ€™m awake I just think about sleep or death. I cannot for the life of me think straight right now. Havenâ€™t slept for 3 days. I want to die now.
