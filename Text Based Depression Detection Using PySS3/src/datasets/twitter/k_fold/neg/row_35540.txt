I'm feeling hopeless and emotionless.My girlfriend of three years broke up with me because she wants to be "single in college". We had plans on getting engaged and moving in together. I was supposed to go to a college close to hers but couldn't afford it. We've survived a lot together and gotten through all the hardships. So I don't understand why now. My life has been in a steady decline the past couple months and I'm at the lowest point in my life and she left me when I'm at my worst. She's a good person but she said I was depressing her and she couldn't take care of both of us. Ever sense I'm finding it hard to find motivation for living, I've always had minor off and on suicidal thoughts but it's everyday now. Always on my mind. Like what's the point. She meant the world to me and she abandoned me. I've been trying to get her back but she tells me she wants to be unrestricted like cuddling with people or getting drunk with people. She says she doesn't want a relationship or sexual experience but it's just hard to believe. I really don't know what to do anymore. Sorry if this doesn't qualify to be here.
