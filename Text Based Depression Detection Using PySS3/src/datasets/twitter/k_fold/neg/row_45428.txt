I kinda thinking about that nowLike fuck all financial stuff, I hate all money sistem and I don't know I had few frends who ended up like this. and now nobody remember them and now they don't have any problems, we all go a dye, I live in depression for the last 3 years, and I dont know what to do, everything I do always fall apart. not long time ago I did what I was proud about myself, I got on a spiritual yourney for few days, but when I came back all old problems fall on my from sides I didn't expect.  I funking love people, but all I see is money over people, and I dont wanto live like this. I'm afraid to kill myself but I know how to do it fast
