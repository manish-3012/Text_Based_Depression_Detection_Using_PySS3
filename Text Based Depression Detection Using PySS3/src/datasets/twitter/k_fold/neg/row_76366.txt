Depression or just a failureWhen I was 13 I was forced to see a psychologist because I had been cutting myself pretty badly. Not even with razors, but with serrated knives that I had to deliberately saw through myself with. Despite something that fucked up, the diagnosis was nothing. Apparently I just wanted attention. What kind of Fucking loser cuts himself for attention. I'm 24 Fucking years old and I'm still a loser. I've never had a relationship. I went through five years of college and got a degree just to be working 7 days a week doing two part time jobs making barely enough to pay my loan debt. All of my friends hate me because I'm such a piece of shit. I'm constantly thinking about suicide and I even fail at that. And now I post my sob story on Reddit like a little Bitch still just looking for attention. I let down my family,i let down my friends , I let down everyone I've ever met. I've never followed through on anything I've ever promised to do in life. Someone please just Fucking kill me know.

Note: I'm aware of the fact that you can't really diagnose me. I'm just ranting.
