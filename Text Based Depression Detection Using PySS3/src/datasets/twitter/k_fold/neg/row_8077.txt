I feel like Iâ€™m just existing now.I feel like Iâ€™m floating in an ocean that doesnâ€™t end and I donâ€™t even know where it began. I feel like if I move, the sharks that are swimming under me will attack. If I stay still, Iâ€™ll die. Iâ€™m afraid to move and seek help, but I canâ€™t stay still anymore or Iâ€™ll shrivel up and die. This isnâ€™t a note. This isnâ€™t the end. Its just a way to express how I feel. Although I feel like Iâ€™m close to the end, Iâ€™ve felt this before. Iâ€™ve gotten through it before. So many times. Too many times to count on both hands. Iâ€™m an empty shell of a person, but somewhere in that shell I have yet to grow. 

Fireworks are going off outside. Iâ€™m laying in my bed, in the dark, curled up in a ball waiting for them to stop. There are thousands of happy people outside watching the fireworks. Theyâ€™re cheering. Theyâ€™re happy. Theyâ€™re living. Iâ€™m inside a dark, desolate space and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. My head is being held underwater and Iâ€™m seconds away from letting the water fill my lungs. Once again Iâ€™m not going to try anything. I just need to get this out. 

I feel like Iâ€™ll never escape this feeling. Sometimes it lasts for days, sometimes weeks, and sometimes months. Sometimes Iâ€™m empty for only a few hours. Iâ€™m so good at hiding that no one really knows how Iâ€™m feeling. Emotions can be read on my face, but expressions change. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll thrash around and let the sharks get me this time, but I know that Iâ€™m close to the end of my time in this limitless expanse. I just hope I make it to shore before I get eaten alive.
