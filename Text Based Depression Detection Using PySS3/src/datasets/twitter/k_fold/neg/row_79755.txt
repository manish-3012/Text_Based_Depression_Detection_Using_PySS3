I don't know what to do.Hello, I am 14 turning 15 in September and I have had Social Anxiety since I was 10. When I was 13 I told my parents about my anxiety but all they said was " It will go away." It hasn't. My mom yells at me when I do small mistakes like bump into her or drop something. She called me useless on July 4th 2016 and it tore me down. I have been scared to talk to people face to face but Virtually is easy since they don't have to see my face. I have low self esteem because I am overweight. My mom calls me fat and that I should lose weight. I am starting to lose weight but gaining it back. I have thought of dying or not being on earth anymore. Some nights I just imagine what it would look like If I never existed. Life is really hard for me right now, I just don't know what to do. I have 2 cats and they keep me happy, also Gaming. What is clinging me on to not die is my cats and my Online friends, since I don't have any in Real Life. I want to lose weight correctly but I don't know how. I am just a 14 year old trying to live. Thank you for reading this. I'm sorry I took your time.
