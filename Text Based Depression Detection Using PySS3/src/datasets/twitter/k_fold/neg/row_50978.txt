I want to die.I'm 18 and have fairly severe bipolar disorder. I can't function. I can't hold a job for more than a couple months, sometimes losing the job in less than two weeks. I abuse illicit drugs on a daily basis just to feel ok with the fact that even if I tried I couldn't function. I just want to go into the bathroom and hang myself. It's overwhelming. I can't cope.
