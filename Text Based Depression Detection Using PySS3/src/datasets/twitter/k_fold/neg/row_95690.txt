Just turned 20, I have a strong feeling that I am going to do it within the next few yearsI DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO DRUGS OR FIREARMS. I AM NOT AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO MYSELF OR ANYONE

I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 11...

I can go on and on about everything but I just don't want to do it anymore. It's all my fault. I'm a nuisance to everyone. I can just feel the animosity towards me. My sister passed away yesterday and my dad is screaming at me... boss making me go to work... pharmacy lying about my prescription being denied to get me off her back because she made a mistake and forgot to call it in, when I really needed it. Everyone just wants me to fuck off all the time. I can understand why. I'm just a waste of life.

I don't think anyone will miss me at this point and that's why I've decided that I want to do it. I've just grown so tired that I've become completely incapable of performing human activity. I look like a crazy person when I go outside... hunched over, thousand yard stare, complete monotony, absolutely disconnected.. I just have nothing inside me. I look into my eyes and I just cannot see anyone or anything behind there. I don't recognize my face or my voice or my body anymore.

 It gets worse every day. It's not even depression or anxiety or PTSD that's eating me anymore... it's life. It's existing. I just don't want to.

I've just come to the conclusion that some people were made for this life... some weren't.  I'm not. The only thing I'm doing is suffering. I've tried drugs, working, traveling, going to college, long term dating, therapy, antidepressants, exercise... nothing. I've done all this "improvement", and I feel so much worse than I did before.

If I know that it keeps getting worse and worse I know what is coming... and I don't want that. I'm tired of it. There is literally no fucking reason for me to continue.

I have thought about it before seriously but I really think that I should do it. I'm at the point where I know that people would just get on with their lives, most would expect it and some would not even give a fuck... I just want to sleep.

I don't fear death anymore. I'm just waiting. Any day will do.
