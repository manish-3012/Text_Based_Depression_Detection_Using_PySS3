Thank you SW it's been 4 years and I'm still here [Success story, Must Read]Hello SW, Its been almost 4 years when I wrote this  http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/roifq/my_life_is_hell_and_i_dont_know_what_im_doing/

I was really down and fucked up but I successfully finished highschool back then and now I'm joining the army. I'm not depressed anymore ever since I left highschool and left behind all the bullshit and depressing memories and I'm glad all those people I hate are not a part of my life anymore. Things got better, we have a strong bond with my family, especially my mother who is still fighting cancer, she might have less than a year left... In this time we've built a new house and in the old one are apartments for 3 families so I can basiclly live good just off of the rent. I'm so glad I didnt end my life throught the long depressing years of my highschool. I'm happy I'm still here, things got better for me and it will for you too. I never belived this shit myself since I've been going through years and years and years of hard times and depression and humiliation and hate and my mom's cancer and all the other fucked up shit. Now I'm glad I've waited and still here as things got better, you just gotta belive and pray for better days. Please dont kill yourself, you will find joy sooner or later. When you will look back like I do now you will see this depressing years just as a small part of your life. Wait for the better parts, it's worth it! 

Much love, Zan
