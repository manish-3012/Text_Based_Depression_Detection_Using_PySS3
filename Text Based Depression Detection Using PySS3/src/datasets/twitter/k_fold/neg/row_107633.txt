Telling a suicidal person that itâ€™ll be okay because help is on the way is like telling a homeless person with no clothes in the winter that itâ€™ll be okay because itâ€™ll be summer in half a yearAt least thatâ€™s how it feels to me.

Hope is a useless virtue for me currently.
Who cares about what comes in the near future when you are suffering right now
