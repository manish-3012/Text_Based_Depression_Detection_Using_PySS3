I don't know what's going through my mindI been having some suicidal thoughts lately. I found out that im getting my ass kicked out of college, wich i had been already half assing for like 3 years, i pretty much hate myself for my actions, i feel trapped like there's no way out of my shitty life and i don't want to talk to anyone close about this. Sometimes i rationalize things and try to put my shit together but i found out today, while triying to hang myself, that i cant control what i feel. I'm a complete mess and i just want all. this bullshit to end. (And also excuse my english , it's not my lenguage)
