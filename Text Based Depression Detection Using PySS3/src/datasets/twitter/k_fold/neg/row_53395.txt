Are suicidal thoughts normal?I probably think about suicide at one or more points everyday. I don't have a solid plan and I don't think I'll go through with it so I'm not very worried. I am just wondering if this warrants looking for help or if it's a normal thing for people. Thanks, I hope I'm not taking space away from people who need it more.
