Leaving this subreditI've seen a few people posting something similar as they leave this subredit so.. here it goes..  I'm not alright yet, by any means but I'll work through it. I still think about ending it every now and then, but it's alright now. To anyone feeling desperate, I'm just going to say that everyday is different. If you're not seeing change today, maybe tomorrow or in a month. So, try your best. Times are hard but (as much as you hate hearing this) it's going to be alright. I also like this phrase. It's comforting. Thank you to all the people who showed genuine support from this sub, you dug me out of a dark place. Alright then, I guess that's it. Goodbye!
