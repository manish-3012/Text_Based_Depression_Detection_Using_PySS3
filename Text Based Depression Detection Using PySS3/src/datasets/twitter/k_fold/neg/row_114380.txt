I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™ve written out this post and deleted it so many times over the past couple of weeks but I really just canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m so, so incredibly lonely. Iâ€™m 17 and lost my friend group (Iâ€™d been friends with everyone in it since childhood) when I was 15 because of my depression and anxiety. I spiraled into anorexia, bulimia, self harm, and suicidal thoughts after that. I finally met someone I felt good around, and we started dating, and he introduced me to his circle of friends. Things were good until he broke up with me after a year of dating a couple weeks ago because he said our relationship made him sad and stressed him out and he didnâ€™t love me anymore. It broke my heart. Now heâ€™s dating someone else and weâ€™re still friends and I donâ€™t think about him romantically anymore but Iâ€™m so lonely. All my connections with people are superficial. My anorexia is coming back with full force and my ocd (which Iâ€™ve had since I was a kid) is really really rough. I canâ€™t talk to my parents about getting a therapist or call the suicide hotline cause the last time I did those things I got involuntarily put in a psych ward and nothing they did helped me at all. I just pretended to be happy until I could get out. Iâ€™m sorry this is so long but I just canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself so many times. Iâ€™ve overdosed on large cocktails of medications multiple times but they never did anything for me. I want out. I want this to be over.
