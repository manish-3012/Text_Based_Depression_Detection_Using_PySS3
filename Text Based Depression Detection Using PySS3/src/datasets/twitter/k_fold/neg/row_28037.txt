Worried I have finally reached my limit.Iâ€™ve dealt with severe depression/anxiety since i was 12. The self harm started then, too. That didnâ€™t stop until I was 17, and cutting stopped giving me the temporary distraction i was looking for anymore. I always thought finally becoming old enough to move out would be the answer to a lot of my problems, as my mother was extremely abusive and was often the cause of my breakdowns. But it has been almost 4 months now of me working what I thought was my dream job, living in my own apartment with my best friend/roommate, my own pets, doing everything EXACTLY the way I always wanted it. 

But every singly morning for the last 2 weeks I just wake up and instantly feel more dread than usual for my day, I sob uncontrollably for at least an hour each morning while trying to get ready to go to work. I sit through my meaningless job for 9 hours each day, to then go home miserable with nothing to look forward to, except doing it all over again the next day. I havenâ€™t felt this deeply submerged in sorrow this consistently for as long as I can remember. I feel I may finally snap and end my life, finally. 

I texted a crisis help line this morning while I was at work, trying not to start sobbing again. It provided temporary relief for about an hour, but all my normal feelings have resurfaced, and all I can think about is driving over the bridge instead of to my home once I leave this building in about an hour. 

Not sure what I thought posting this would do for me but, I guess I just needed to get that off my chest. Iâ€™m hoping I donâ€™t make it to tomorrow.
