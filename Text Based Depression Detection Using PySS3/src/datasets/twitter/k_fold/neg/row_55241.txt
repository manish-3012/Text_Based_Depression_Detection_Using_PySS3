Time to set up plansScouting out a secluded location to finish the job and drafting up my note and list of people to call before it happens.


The trick is to do it somewhere that's so out of the way that it takes too long to find me. If I don't pussy out this time. If I do pussy out though it won't be because "things might get better". They won't, I'll just persist for a little longer before I do the only thing I've ever done right in my life and snuff myself out.
