I want to end the pain and the sadness.I have tried to commit suicide before and I failed cause I am a fucking pussy. I am honestly just sick and tired of being sad but I am to much of a little bitch to actually talk to a therapist. I don't want to make my family sad but I feel like suicide is the only way out. I feel constant pressure and I feel like everyone hates me because I'm so sad all the time and that just leads to more sadness. I've secretly been battling with depression and anxiety but I don't want to worry my family. I think everything started going downhill more after my dog first died then my grandma died then my other dog died and then my dad had his second heart attack. I feel like I'm just selfish because everyone has problems and I'm trying to solve my problems instead of helping other people. I am just worthless and I waste everyone's time I'd just be better off dead hopefully I'll succeed with my next suicide attempt. Sorry if this is formulated badly I suck at everything I do
