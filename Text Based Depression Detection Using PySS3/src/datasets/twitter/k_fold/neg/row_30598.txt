My Full PlanI know the exact location and the day in which iâ€™ll do it. I live by malibu, so on ditch day of my senior year (iâ€™m going to be a junior next year) iâ€™m driving down kanan road to mulholland highway, taking a right on encinal canyon road, and going to godâ€™s seat. i will bring a large tank of helium and a bag to close over my head, and standing over the edge of the cliff. if the suicide bag doesnâ€™t kill me, the fall after i pass out will. the funny part is, i keep trying to get my friends to go there with me (they donâ€™t know my plan) so they can remember me with the beauty of the view, but they all call it lame and donâ€™t understand why i want to go so bad. i just wanted to let people know exactly what iâ€™m doing so somebody in my family can see this postmortem and know it wasnâ€™t random, it was a plan that has been brewing since 2 years before.
