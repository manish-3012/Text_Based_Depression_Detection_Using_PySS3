My life seems like a boring wall of grey, I feel so down and am losing people cus of it. I'd rather die so I'm remembered as how o used to be, fun, interesting.I feel like I've burnt myself out ive been so worried and depressed the last few weeks that I feel like I am just pushing everyone away, 
I feel boring. I've put similar thing on this page but hvnt got any help yet so pls reply.
Why do i feel so dull and cant keep the conversation going. 
I feel like my partner who is the rreason for my weeks of depression as I think I am losing her more and more, has picked up on my negative attitude, and that I am just making it worse.
I used to be funny, interesting, sharp, and good at talking.
Now I feel like I hv a major loss of confidence and cany think how to tlk to people. 
Even interests of mine I just seem so boring when I speak.
Does anyone know why this is?
I wld appreciate any help or advice.
I dont want to be like this cus I'm not feeling happy and I'm losing others from it. 
I feel tired from weeks of sleepless night, being worried. 
I copied this from advice cus no answers or replies, it is getting really much for me, potentially too much.
My life seems boring now, I'm just pushing people away cus they dont wanna be around this boring person, and I dont like this me either.
I want my interesting self. The future seems pointless cus I feel that I will not be with my girlfriend who I do lv and want to spend my life with. And I'll just be boring. Aand  alone.
