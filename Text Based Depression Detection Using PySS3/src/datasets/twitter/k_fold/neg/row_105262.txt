I feel like it won't get betterI've been struggling with depression for a solid few years now, but the past few months have been the worst of my life. Me and my first serious girlfriend broke up in January for a lot of complicated reasons, and I was okay for a while, but then I learned in March that she had gotten drunk with my best friends and they had all had sex with each other. I broke down that night harder than I ever thought was possible. I still loved her, and was just barely starting to get over her, and now I'm stuck in a cycle of missing her and wondering what I could've done better to avoid this. She doesn't seem guilty at all. They still all hang out together, and they all abandoned me without a second thought. I feel like I'm worthless. I have no other friends in my physical life. My internet friends are the only people to throw their arms around me lately, and my family I guess. It's been a month or so since I learned, and I still feel like shit. I don't sleep because I just dream about her, and when I lay down I only think about them doing it. I don't eat anymore. I don't feel hungry. I take a lot of advil to make me tired enough to pass out, or awake enough to play games or something to take my mind off of it. I usually have a breakdown every morning, and find myself crying and holding myself in a corner. I've had the noose around my ceiling fan a lot, but I can never convince myself to do it. I just feel so tired and empty. Everyday is the same routine of misery and feeling sad, and I hate waking up. I don't want to live my life anymore and I don't know how to deal with it.

Anytime I try to tell anyone about any of this, they usually pass it off as attention wanting or feel like I'd never really do it, but I'm struggling a lot. I keep writing suicide notes and getting really close to doing it, but I never can commit. I don't know what to do anymore.
