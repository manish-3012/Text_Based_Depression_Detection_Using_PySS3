How do I beat nihilism?I recently passed through a suicidal episode because of an accidental medication withdrawal. It was a wake up call that convinced me I need a change of perspective on life. Anyways, my life would've been a lot easier if I had a counter to nihilism since I could've taken refuge in the thought that a higher being had my back and that everything was part of a bigger plan. For people who have overcome the disease of nihilism, what is your recommendation to beat it?
