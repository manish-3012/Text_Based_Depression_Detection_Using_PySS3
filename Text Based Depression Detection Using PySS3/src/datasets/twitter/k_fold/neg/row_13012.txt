Just a thank you really :)I've posted here occasionally when I've been feeling down but more often than not, I take inspiration from your replies to other people's problems. I've decided to take the bull by the horns and go back into therapy :)

What I've realised is that asking for advice is one thing but actually heeding it is quite another. I'm sick to death of my life so I'm taking steps to better it. Thank you all for your kindness to absolute strangers. You're making the world a better place one orangered at a time &lt;3
