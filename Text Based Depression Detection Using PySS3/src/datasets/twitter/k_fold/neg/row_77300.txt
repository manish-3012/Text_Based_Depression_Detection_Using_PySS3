I feel apathetic about life.Hello

I am very depressed and have been this way for a long time. I fantasize about suicide daily. I usually don't think that I would accually commit suicide but it feels like a possibility more and more these days. I offer nothing of value to the world and I can't find anything that I want from it.

I've considered myself asexual for many years now. I have no desire for any relationship. I have sabotaged friendships many times to further distance myself from anyone.

I am unemployed and have been living off my own savings and now I have no money left. I have self-inflicted health problems that would take years of work to recover from and they also prevent me from working (I am a tradesman.)

I feel apathetic about everything. Getting myself to a place where I could be okay with life feels impossible due to the fact that I don't want anything from it. 

I am extremely independent, stubborn, and unwilling to ask for help. I am slowly becoming a burdon to people who can barely support themselves. I am unable to keep supporting myself and would need help financially to keep going past this month. I am unable to cope with this change and I do not see myself surviving much longer.
When I used to think about suicide I think I felt scared about it. Now when I think about it I feel relieved by the thought. I know I would create alot of pain for people around me but I dont think that the possibility of guilt can hold me back from doing it. All I can think about these days is how to make my suicide less of a burdon for other people.
