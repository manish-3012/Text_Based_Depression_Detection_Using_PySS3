Hotline just hung up on meIn the middle of me talking about how I felt like no one cared about me. She had given some advice but I explained further and then she suddenly went dead silent, I waited about two minutes and then the call hung itself up. We werenâ€™t even 15 minutes into the conversation

Lmao guess no one does care about me, even a professional canâ€™t pretend to care for 15 minutes
