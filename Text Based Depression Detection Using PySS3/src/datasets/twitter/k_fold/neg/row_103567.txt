Is there any help left?The battle of OCD is most likely going to be the end of me. I feel so depressed that any antidepressant I try makes me end up insane, and I keep getting worse at the point of not having any energy no matter how much sleep I get and constantly having pain everywhere in my body. I really want to kill myself if I canâ€™t stop the emotional and literal pain but luckily I still have hope left since if I didnâ€™t I probably wouldâ€™ve already killed myself.
