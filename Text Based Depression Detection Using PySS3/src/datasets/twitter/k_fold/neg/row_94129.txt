Best friend dismissed meI just reached out to my most trusted friend with the fact i've been feeling suicidal and she brushed me off and told me she can't talk about it. I feel horrible having exhausted my friend's goodwill of listening to me in the past. I know she isn't obligated to listen to me, but it's so painful to work uo the courage to tell someone only to be rejected. I've attempted suicide in the past and ended up in the hospital. I wrote my own suicide note a few days ago even. It's not really that i want to die, I'm just tired. I see people talking about wishing there was  third option and I really relate to that. My worst fear has really come true, that I would work up enough bravery to tell someone only to be shot down.
