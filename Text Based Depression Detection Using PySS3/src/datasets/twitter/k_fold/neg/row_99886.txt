I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™ve been feeling worse than usual recently, and felt that I should ask for help here. My mom verbally and emotionally (rarely physically) abuses me. My therapist diagnosed my with severe anxiety and depression, but did jack shit when I tried to sort of tell her about my mom, my divorced and remarried (to a wonderful wife) dad is kinda wealthy but terrified of my mom, I feel extremely ill around my mother most of the time, and I am too scared to truly reach out and make a change. My close friends are the only people I feel comfortable talking about it with. I have a sister that I feel is becoming more like my mother because she was berated in the same way as me. I have hurt myself on multiple occasions, had numerous panic and anxiety attacks in the last year, and even attempted suicide. I really need help but I donâ€™t know what to do.
