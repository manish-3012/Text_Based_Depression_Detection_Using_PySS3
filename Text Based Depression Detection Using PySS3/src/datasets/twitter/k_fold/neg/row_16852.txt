If I had the courage, I would end it.If I had the courage to commit suicide, I would. 
I was diagnosed with Depression, Anxiety, and Obsessive-Compulsive-Disorder a few years back, and my mental illnesses have ruined my life.
I don't have any friends, and I'm afraid my closest family members will leave me. 
I have a therapist, but I'm paranoid he will think I'm attention seeking/faking/making it up if I tell him about my suicidal thoughts.
I can't call a suicide hotline because my anxiety prevents me from talking on the phone, and I don't want to text a text-line because I'm afraid they'll track me down at school, and talk to my family.
I feel so alone, because I'm afraid of talking to someone, and I don't want to be put in a psych-ward. 
The only things keeping me alive are my family and my future. 
I'm afraid my family will die, leave me, or isolate themselves from me. 
I have a future, but it seems I will never get there. 
Any advice, Reddit?
