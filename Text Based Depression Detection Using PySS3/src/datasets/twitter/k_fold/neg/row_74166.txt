Someone please give me a good reason to stay alive.We all die in the end, anyways. I mean, what's the point of living if you honestly don't believe you will ever find true happiness?

People say that it's better to feel pain than to not feel anything. I call bullshit. There's no meaning to life, we're just here on accident. 

Everyday I wake up wanting to let go more and more. I'd like to think that something is keeping me from doing that, some outside force. But it's not. It's just my personality that I've always had--doing for others and not for myself. The only reason to stay alive is for my family, friends, and dog. I love them. But I'm not happy, and no matter how hard I try, I can never find happiness in just myself.

Really don't know what I'm saying, it's just one big rant. But I need something.
