If you've set a date or made solid plans, do you feel better?I certainly thought that I would, but I don't.

People on here will say "hey you know, if you're going to kill yourself anyway, why not have an adventure first?" Well for me, the answer seems to be "because you'll feel nothing, so why bother?"

I just went camping for the last time ever. I didn't gain an amazing new appreciation for nature. I didn't feel grateful for the friends I have or regret over leaving them. The whole time I just felt sad, like I do every single day. And then I went home, to be sad some more.

Don't wait. Don't go on adventures. Just get it over with. I wish I had.
