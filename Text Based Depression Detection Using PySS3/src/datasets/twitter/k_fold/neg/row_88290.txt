i am stuck in pain and it is getting worse every fcking dayI am m16 y/o, my father died on my 14th birthday on alcohol, living with my 4 siblings at my moms house. She has mental illness, shizophrenic or something like that. She is terrorizing us children every day. The only way out of it is we leave her and go to a foster family. Since we are 5 children we would get split up. I couldnt handle that. I want to fcking kill myself but the thought about my siblings having a even worse life than they already have is holding me back. I cant take this anymore.

(sorry for the bad english)
