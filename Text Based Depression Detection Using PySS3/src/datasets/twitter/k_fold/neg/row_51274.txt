I need a different TextlineI know this might be a specific request, and Iâ€™ll explain but the basic question is this: Is there a crisis Textline that works via website and not phone number?


I tried contacting the standard 741 741 but after glitching out my messages stopped sending. I do have functional WiFi though, and I can still use google. A hotline works too but Iâ€™m not very good at live conversations. I feel stranded  right now because my only recourse isnâ€™t at my disposal anymore.
