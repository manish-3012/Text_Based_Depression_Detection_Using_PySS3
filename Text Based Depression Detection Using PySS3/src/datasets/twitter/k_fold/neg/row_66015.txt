I am unloved, unaccepted, undesirableI got nothing to lose posting here.

I joined 15 dating sites and frequent them frequently each and every day since February of this year.

I went on one date out of all of them and it didn't end in a way that made sense to me.


I must have tried speaking to hundreds of girls and almost never ever get a reply back probably because I am unattractive.
No matter how polite and funny I try be on these sites I am never worth a response, I am not obligated a response I keep telling myself, but the fact I don't even get a first look makes me feel less than human.

I am a virgin, only had my first date at 20 and that is it, I keep thinking of this, like as a creature put on this earth I will never experience a natural act that creatures do, that I will remain untouched, unloved, undesirable in every sense of the word.

Every day just feels the same coming home and doing the same routine all alone.

I want sex okay? I desperately want to experience the touch of a girl close to me, it validates me as a person.

I can't even do that because I am ugly, and pale, and skinny and stupid.
I don't know why I can't even get responses back, I am not nasty I just am bitter from being unloved.


Try convince me downing a couple bottles of wine and all the pills in my medicine cabinet for a sweet death is not better than crying every weekend till I fall asleep
