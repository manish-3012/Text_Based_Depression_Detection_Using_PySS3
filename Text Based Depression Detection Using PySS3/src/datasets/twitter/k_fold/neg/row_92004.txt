I was happy for a few months after years of darkness and now I feel like Overdosing is my next stepI donâ€™t know how to say this, but Iâ€™m genuinely sad about this recent exposure to sadness, I had an amazing 5 months away from sadness but now it seems like itâ€™s coming back again!
I donâ€™t know what can fix me...
