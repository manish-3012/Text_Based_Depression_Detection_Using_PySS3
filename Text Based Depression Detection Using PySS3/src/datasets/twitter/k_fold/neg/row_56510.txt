Alone in a full houseHi everyone. My first ever post on reddit and itâ€™s to a suicide page. Iâ€™m 27 on the verge on committing suicidal yet again. I used to be proud to say at 14 I was a survivor of suicide, but now at 27 I hope I never have to say those words ever again. Two nights ago I called the suicide hotline and since then Iâ€™ve been writing my letters and getting my business in order. I need help. Iâ€™m not strong enough to ask for help in person so this is my next best thing. Long story short my therapist and the person on the suicide hotline told me I need to find the small things in life to live for. I stupidly lived on for my 3 younger sisters. At 14 I vowed I would never hurt or leave my sisters this way, never again. Now that weâ€™re all older, weâ€™re all grown individuals who need to be loved and cared for in different ways. With Covid Iâ€™m back at my parents and feel like a loser in my own home. So left out. There is a lot more that led me to wanting to kill my self, but thatâ€™s beside the point. I solely lived for my little sisters and now that weâ€™re no longer close let alone them rarely speaking to me, it feels like the ultimate betrayal. 
I need help finding the little things to live for. 
Guys, Iâ€™m back at my parents place, no car, no pets, single as hell, already graduated, no kids. What in Godâ€™s name will keep me from killing myself. I understand I should be able to find the little things in life, but for the past two days I cannot. The first day I didnâ€™t kill myself was because my little cousin picked up, well I did try, but it didnâ€™t work. Iâ€™m not killing myself today I want to die in the family house. I want to leave them with a few hours with them just thinking everything is okay. Iâ€™m so sorry
