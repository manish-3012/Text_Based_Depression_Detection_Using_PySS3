Health problemsAm I the only one with health problems here I suffer from nerve damage, torn pec , torn bicep , I think I tore my elbow ligament recently and torn rotator cuff. Seeing my second doctor on Tuesday since the first one didnâ€™t do shit!! Really a lot to handle at 17 which makes me want to take myself out my misery
