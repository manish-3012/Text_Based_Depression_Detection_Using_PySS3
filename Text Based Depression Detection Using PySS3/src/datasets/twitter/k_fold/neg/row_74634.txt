Body deterioratingI'm 26 and I got diagnosed with COPD and I'm struggling to see a pulmonologist. My insurance sucks and it constantly feels like I have an elephant sitting on my chest. My tonsil has been swollen for 2 years and now the lympnode in my neck is swollen. It'll cost me 125$ just to walk into an ENT.. I'm struggling with my BPD just constantly telling me I need to kill myself. My moods are so intense and I can't relax.. I want to go for a walk but my COPD drains much of my energy.. I keep comfort eating and I feel like a whale... I fucking hate this life.. no one cares and I'm just left to struggle in silence. I'm just done with this bullshit.. I live in a country where they don't give a fuck about people like me.. being chronically ill in this country is a death sentence pretty much. I can't do this I just can't.. fuck this shit.
