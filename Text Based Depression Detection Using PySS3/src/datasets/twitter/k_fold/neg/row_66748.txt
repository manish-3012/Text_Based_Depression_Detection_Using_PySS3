My cry for help.I have been severely depressed for 2 years and attempted suicide 5 times. I feel worthless and like I am a failure. I used to self harm and relapsed recently slowly. I feel like every time I get better, depression sinks in again and pulls me back to sadness.

I know I need help but my mother doesn't believe me. If someone can help me, please.
