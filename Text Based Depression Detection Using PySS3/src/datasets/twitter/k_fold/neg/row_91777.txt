Itâ€™s happening again...Doesnâ€™t matter what I try, I canâ€™t get the ideations out of my head. Iâ€™ve spent so much time in the hospital this year, been trying ECT, been talking to my counselor, and Iâ€™ve been staying compliant with my meds, but I just keep getting worse. Short of going back to the hospital I donâ€™t know what to do. I was told if I go back this year that my doctor would find long term treatment to place me in, and I really donâ€™t want that. Anybody have any ideas for me?
