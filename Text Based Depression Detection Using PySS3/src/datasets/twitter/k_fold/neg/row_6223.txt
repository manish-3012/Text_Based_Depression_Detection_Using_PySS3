So i really really need some help on this, badly. Please...my friend tried to commit suicide once before, he failed. Now his girlfriend left him and he's suicidal again, i love the kid. I don't want him to kill himself, it would destroy me. The reason for his suicidal thoughts is that he feels alone, he can't get a job because he dropped out of high school because of family problems. On top of that he's black and as much as people won't admit it, people are racist in NY. He has no criminal record. If anyone, i mean anyone knows of a job or place that he can go to please let me know. Anything that can keep him occupied (volunteering/etc) Also anything i should say to him or anything, i mean absolutely anything. Please come forth...Thank you..
