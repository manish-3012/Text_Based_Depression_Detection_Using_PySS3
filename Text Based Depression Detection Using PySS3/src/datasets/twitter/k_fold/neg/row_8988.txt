People ask you what's wrong; and when you tell them, they make fun of your problems.Whenever I tell someone that i was bullied nearly everywhere i went, and that i was abused by my family, they just treat me like it's nothing.
Things that you had been through during your childhood are so fucking underrated. No one cares. But those things fuck up your mind as you grow older. Anxiety, depression, sadness and obsessions keep pressuring your mind until it becomes unbearable. And that's the time when you kill yourself and somehow they suddenly start caring about you. 
But it's too late assholes...
