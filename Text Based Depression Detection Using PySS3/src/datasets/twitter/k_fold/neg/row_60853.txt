Im waiting until my parents die to kill myselfIts a step in the right direction to be honest. Theyre in their 60s and my dad is really healthy. I expect him to go til 78-80 (he has drank a lot throughout life). My mom will go earlier. Im afraid she has less than 10 years.

I cant kill myself with them still alive because I would be killing them as well. My dad would hit the bottle like he never has before, and my moms heart would give out with grief.  :'(


Its so far away but its the best plan I can come up with that feels right. It also gives me a lot of time, theoretically, to fix myself. But I dont see that happening. I see the same cycle of behavior. It is really obvious to me. The only difference is i keep getting older and worse looking in the process and I cant handle it anymore.

So yeah, no need to worry about me. I dont need your support for today. But im sure I want to end my life. Staying alive for now is just my gift to my parents who have sacrificed everything for me.... I cant have them feel like they wasted it all, even if it is true.
