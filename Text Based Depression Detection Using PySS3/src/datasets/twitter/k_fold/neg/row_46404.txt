I know that this si wrong subreddit but i just want to express myself.So i know this girl that i like and i think she likes me but ewery time she comes over i feel like paralysed, and cant ewen hug her, i dont know what to do. She knows that i hawe depression and probably because of that she is not giving up on me. Sometimes i think that im soo boring and i dont know what that girl sees in me. Every time im with friends and her i feel normal but when im alone with her i feel like i cant even talk to her, every time we are alone i barely think what to talk about. I want to hawe a girlfriend but i think if she would be my girlfriend she would regret it in first few days because im sooo boring.

Past 50days im feel like shit, suicidal thoughts, crying almost ewey day and i dont know what to do, i think im going to end up without friends because of this depression shit.
I know that im not going to kill myself but pas 50 days every day im thinking of doing that.

Sorry
