I am fully convinced that no one else is real and that I am living in a simulation designed to bring me the most pain possible without full confirmation of me being inside said simulation.I have experienced three separate inexplicable occurrences leading me to this conclusion.  
1. I had a timer going for 2 minutes at 8:17. At the end of the timer, the clock showed 8:21. Even if I somehow started the timer right as it turned 8:18, it would not have been possible for the time to show 8:21.

2. I was flossing my bottom teeth where my permanent retainer is. The floss was completely threaded through, and then passed through both the retainer and my teeth with no damage to the floss.  


3. I took a pair of socks from my drawer and when I went up my stairs and looked back at the socks, they had changed from one pair to a different pair.  


This post is not a joke. I completely understand this will not make me feel better at all. No one real will read this post. Anyone that interacts with this post is not real. None of my friends are real. My abusive parents are not real. Any good moment I have in my life is immediately overcast by terrible things happening to me. I will not be able to 100% prove that my conclusion is correct because then the simulation would fail. I believe there is an entity or entities that is watching me at most or all times as a form of entertainment. People experiencing worse pain than me are not real; they are designed that way to make me feel like I have it easier. I will kill myself eventually. It will not matter, since I am not truly real.
