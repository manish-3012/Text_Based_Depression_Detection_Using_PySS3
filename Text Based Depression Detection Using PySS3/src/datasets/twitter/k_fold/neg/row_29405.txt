It doesn't get better with timeThings just feel harder as time goes on. I miss my family and I hate this cruel world. Everyday I wake up and I just get depressed I didnt die in my sleep. My best friend the only person I could ever talk to wont speak to me anymore... hes all I had. Sorrow and depression overcomes my days everyday, I just feel like I'm barely here. It's such a worthless exsistance when everyone you love is dead
