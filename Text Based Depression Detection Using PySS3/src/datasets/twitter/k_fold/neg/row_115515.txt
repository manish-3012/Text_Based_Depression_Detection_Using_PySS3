My financial burdens are killing meIâ€™m months late on payments. Whatever I earn is gone in a week. These companies are threatening to take me to court. I have nothing to show for. Iâ€™m scared. I feel like the best way out is to just die. I donâ€™t want to go to jail. I donâ€™t want people to know me as the person who never pays back. Iâ€™m fucking scared.
