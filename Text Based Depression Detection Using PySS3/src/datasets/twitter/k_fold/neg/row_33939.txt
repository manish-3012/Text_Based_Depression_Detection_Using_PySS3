If you wanted to be in the just get in front of me[details inside]So I've been hooked on drugs. Cocaine, xanax, alcohol. I went too crazy and lost a great job secondary to my use. After the new year I did very well. Cold turkey....2 nights  ago we went out to a bar. After we went to their apartment.  Dave went to sleep. Me Janie, don, and steven. I've had the biggest crush on janie, we had a date planned and everything.  She says: I have molly in my car, me and don were down. I also called up my coke guy  and he was actually right around the corner. I went  to get the coke and I came back and they are fucking.  I wasn't mad but it's just like this happens all the time. A girl I like gets scooped up before I get a chance at all...the plane didn't even leave the tarmac. It's happened with quite times but with different  people.  Honestly I know I lay the good pipe but like not even a chance. Tonight I got dunk  and have been doing as many drugs as I can to escape the image and escape my insecurity. I'm sitting here on a ledge like what the fuck  does it matter.
