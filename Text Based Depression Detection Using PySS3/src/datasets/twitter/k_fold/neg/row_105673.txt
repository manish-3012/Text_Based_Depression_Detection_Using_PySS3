I want to die but Iâ€™m too scared to commit suicide(Iâ€™m on my cellphone so I apologize in advance for any errors- also not sure if this is the right sub)

I have a family that loves me. A boyfriend... kinda have friends. I have people who care for me and would be sad if I ever died. 

Ever since I was a young teenager ( Iâ€™m 20 now) Iâ€™ve been depressed and sad and kinda suicidal. I donâ€™t know how to explain it. I have a history of self harm but nothing super â€œseriousâ€. 

Every day I wish that when I go to bed, I wonâ€™t wake up. Whenever i drive somewhere, I hope someone hits me and kills me. I sometimes donâ€™t make the smartest choices behind the wheel. Maybe Iâ€™ll be a victim of a hit and run. Anything.  Just kill me. 

I donâ€™t want to live anymore, but I donâ€™t want to put my loved ones through the pain of living with the fact that I killed myself. I would much rather them have the memory of me that I was killed by someone else. Not by the hands of me. 

I donâ€™t know how to deal with this. I hate waking up. I hate living with the disappointment everyday that I made it home safe.
