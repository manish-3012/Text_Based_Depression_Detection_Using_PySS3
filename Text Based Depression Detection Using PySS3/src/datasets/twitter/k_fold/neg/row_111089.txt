My mom told me to kill myselfI asked my mom to drive me to the bus stop and a large argument ended up happening. She told me to kill myself before I came off, I thanked her for showing me how she felt about me and left. Today when I had a doctors appointment my dad told me I was a disappointment and would never be successful. Honestly I feel like this was a call to action and that I should listen to them. Sorry if this small paragraph is messy, my eyes are super glossy and writing this made me feel a type of way, also my eyesight is bad LOL .
