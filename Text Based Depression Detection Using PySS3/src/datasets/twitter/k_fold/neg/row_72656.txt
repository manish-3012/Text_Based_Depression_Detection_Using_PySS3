Lost both my parents plus some this year. I'm so tired of being strong.I grew up neglected by my mom then physically abused by my stepfather while my mom ignored it. I grew past that and am now fairly successful at 32. 

But last year I was scared of getting close  to someone and broke up with my boyfriend. A month later in August my dad died, we were really close. In March I got back together with the boyfriend, then found out this past may he had been cheating on me the entire time.  

Last week my mom died. One year and ten days after my dad. Our relationship was complicated.  But I've lost both my parents in the same year. 

I've been in therapy for five years now. And I'm just tired of "being strong" . I'm tired of nothing being easy. I'm tired of "being a survivor". I've come so far in life and yet it's not enough.
