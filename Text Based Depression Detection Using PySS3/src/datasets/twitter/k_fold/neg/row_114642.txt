Iâ€™m thinking I might actually do it...I no longer have anything to live for. All of my hope was just stripped away in a few little words. I canâ€™t keep going like this. I canâ€™t do this anymore. My depression and anxiety and panic attacks are just too much on me now. I think itâ€™s time. No one cares anyways and the last person who did just left me.
