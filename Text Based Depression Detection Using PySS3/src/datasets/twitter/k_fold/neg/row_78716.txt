Going back into an abusive situation and I donâ€™t know if I can handle it or not.Hello.

Iâ€™ve been job searching for 3 months. Iâ€™ve applied and applied over and over again. Job after job. Resume after resume. Iâ€™m so exhausted.

I finally got an interview and got hired at a restaurant. I was training to be a server, but at the last minute, I called in to quit. The situation wasnâ€™t good â€” the company was greedy and I started losing money on my training. 

Iâ€™m forced to go back to my old job now, where by boss and coworkers are abusive. My boss gaslights everyone, he lies to everyone, and he lies to my coworkers. He puts us against eachother and they all fight with eachother. I got pulled into the drama several times, but I blocked everyone on my phone because they couldnâ€™t keep it professional.

I only have $10.00 in my bank account and Iâ€™m late on payments. J canâ€™t afford rent, or even afford food right now. So I called my old boss to put he back on the schedule.

I go back into Hell tomorrow and Iâ€™m terrorified. My anxiety is up and Iâ€™m stressed to the max. I keep applying for jobs and nothing is really happening. Itâ€™s making me feel so worthless, and at this point, Iâ€™m afraid that it might be better to kill myself.

Iâ€™m so miserable. My boyfriend is trying to be supportive, but his birthday is coming up and I literally have no money to spend on him. I feel like a failure. A fraud. I donâ€™t see the point in living anymore.
