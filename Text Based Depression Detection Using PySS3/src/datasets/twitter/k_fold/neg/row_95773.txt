goddamn it what do i doI want to die. My friends hate me, my gender dysphoria gets worse every day (just found out I can't even get HRT in my area until I'm 18. I AM NOT WAITING 5 YEARS), I'm a hideous and embarrassing human being that is incapable of being loved, I'm dead inside, fuck it. I intend on killing myself for the sake of the people who hate me, i.e. EVERYONE, but my mom and brothers "would be devastated" and I have a pain tolerance of about -15. I'm a disgrace. I don't deserve to live, I need to die, I don't see a future for me. I know my parents love me unconditionally, but the fact that I'm even considering this PROVES that I should do it. Besides, they'll get over it, I'm sure. I don't want to die, I WANT to be normal with a normal life and not live dead inside, but I refuse to be selfish enough to go to a hospital and waste my mother's money on "fixing" me. I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. Fuck.
