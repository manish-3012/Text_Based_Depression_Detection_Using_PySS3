Still haunted, need help.So, since I was 13, I've... Well I've kinda went through a bit of hell, not completely though. But, now that I'm 18, it feels like hell now that my depression is catching up to me (this is the 3rd day in a row I've felt it), and of course, all the stressors I've endured, it doesn't help. 

&amp;#x200B;

At 13-14 I became much more aggressive towards myself, having anger issues and thoughts of suicide, self hatred sat in...

15 it got worst, I lost my grandfather, and I was also forced against my will to follow a religion I didn't want to be a part of (That being the LDS church), the little church dream of my family died off shortly before I turned 16 and then I was at least lucky and smart enough to endure the rest of high school and then graduate on my 17th birthday! How happy!

But then, a shit happened again after I started college, well, it took a few months in...

Just less than a year ago, I was trying to relax in a lounge in the student center before going to check my grades, of course, checking them, this is when the shit hit the fan. I was so upset from already having enough stress on my back, I had a mental breakdown. I tried going to the college's disability resource center for help (I wish I hadn't of done that now. That was a mistake.) and instead of just dismissing me, the director of the DRC, that ratfucker told on me to my parents and also put a record of this "mental breakdown" incident in "disciplinary actions", like if I commit some kind of crime or something (In which I didn't commit any crimes). 

&amp;#x200B;

Upon returning home later that night, I got yelled at in my face. This is what some of the things I had yelled at me:

"They must think you're a fucking idiot."

&amp;#x200B;

"Oh boo hoo mental breakdown my ass! Get over yourself."

&amp;#x200B;

"Blame everyone but yourself." 

&amp;#x200B;

"Get out of my face!" 

&amp;#x200B;

At this point, the thoughts of suicide emerged again and thus I felt like hell for the rest of that semester. The next semester at least I loved it!

Upon the start of June, I got fired from my first job thanks to conflicting times with my job and school (I was called a "liar" by my boss even.) I had also dropped a math class I was taking later on in the summer, and prior to doing so, I was complaining about how I didn't get it (Because of course, precalculus isn't the easiest subject one can do), and of course, I get mocked for complaining about it in my own home! 

They even said "You're like barbie, oh math is too hard boo hoo hoo." (Which I don't get that, what does a doll have to do with this shit? I honestly don't know.)

It's like nobody cares about me honestly. They only seem to care if I can help them. If I'm nothing more than a deplorable 18 year old stressed out over college who is now much more calm and collected than before, what is the meaning of going on? Where will I go in the future? I want to major in business administration or economics because I had a great idea for a business I want to start that would likely be super lucrative (but debt digging as well),    

This is now the 3rd day in a row that I have dealt with the thoughts of suicide. The thoughts of suicide were very vivid today as that one incident I mentioned earlier (About the mental breakdown, particularly the part I was yelled at.) still haunts me to this day, and it has haunted me since it happened. Am I fucked? Am I done? Because I sure don't like being depressed, thinking of suicide and being haunted by that one fucking incident. All I wanted was to live a good life, I don't want to be a loser at home who never progresses in life, because I would rather die than be that.
