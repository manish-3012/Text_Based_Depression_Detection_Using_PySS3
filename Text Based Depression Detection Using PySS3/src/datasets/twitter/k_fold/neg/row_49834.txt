I just... I just need to talkI feel like shit. I'm a university student, I feel like I can't manage it right now. I work part time, my bf and i are extremely rocky.. essentially he wants to break up because my vagina is fucked up. Everything is wrong right now. I feel like I can't talk to anyone right now. My bf doesn't really want to deal with me, my friends are shying away from me, I know nobody wants to deal wiht me. And while I would normally go home and take a break for a week or so, I can't because I have to move on Monday, plus I have to drive 4 hrs away on saturday for the weekend for work (absolutely no way to get out of it). I don't want to commit suicide (i've attempted it in the past) but I just feel like a royal fuckup lately. I just need to talk and get it out.
