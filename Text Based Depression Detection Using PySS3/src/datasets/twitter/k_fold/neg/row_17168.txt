10 yearsI realized that this summer, on my birthday, I can say that I've been struggling with the thought of dying for 10 years now. I've never taken action because I know that it would hurt my brother too much for me to be gone. But other than that, I can't say that I ever had anything else to live for. 
On the other hand, I really love making music but with the constant "I want to die" in my head I can't even care about what I like and what I can do. I can't change the thought in my mind and I feel so close to just giving up these days. I know I'm fucked up and I can't even afford the freaking therapy or do anything about it, but somehow I managed living until now. I'm not even sure why I'm posting here.
If this is how my life is going to be until I'm old enough to die of natural causes I'd rather just give up.
I don't even know why I feel like this, it's not like my life is shitty. I'm a 22 year old with my future bright ahead of me, I have food on the table, friends, I exercise and do everything a normal person would do. Still the thought remains in the back of my head even in the happiest moments of my life. I just want to die already. It's a battle that I can't win anymore. I'm not sure what to do.
