Well that didn't go as expected.... It was way worse than I could have expectedI had court today over contact with my son, I was expecting to loose because so far everythings I've done has made things worse.. How wrong and right at the same time can someone get..

She claims all this with no evidence other than her word, that I'm abusive, delusional and paranoid, that my son hates being around me and that I'm a danger to him.

I go in with evidence that she's lied.. His doctor notes, attendance to school including reasons for over 100 absences in 2 school years and chat logs from Facebook, 60% of the reasons school was told he was ill don't match with his doctors notes. None of what I'm told about doctor visits match with his notes or what the school has down as reasons for absences.

My son made a statement saying that his mother told him what to say yet this was ignored. 

And the judge agreed with her that I'm a danger and she has been granted full custody. I'm not allowed to contact him again. 

I now give up, may as well end my life tonight. It made me laugh when people keep telling me to fight as you've got evidence and that's all matters in a courts eyes. My life is over which ever way I look she's got years to make him hate me or will move making it harder for him to find me in the next 10 years.

Feeling so lost and have nowhere to turn
