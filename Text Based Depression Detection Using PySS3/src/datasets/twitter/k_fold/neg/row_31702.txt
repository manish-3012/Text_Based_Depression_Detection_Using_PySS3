Here are the reasons why I want to kill myself!I'm a piece of shit!

I'm an inferior person

I'm not talented

I'm not intelligent

I have no worth

I'm not attractive

I have no value in life

No one loves me

No one cares about me

I'm a piece of fucking garbage

People look at me like I'm a creep

I'm a creep

Everyone looks at me like I'm a rapist

Everyone sees me like a fucking ugly neckbeard

No one wants to talk to me

I have no social life

I'm an awkward piece of shit

No one wants to go out with me

No one is attracted to me

No woman or man wants to be my friend or go out with me

I'm not talented and I'm inferior to everyone around me and finally...I'm just another waste of life!

I'm simply not interested in anything anymore! 

All my life is worth is one single belt and I'm going to use it to hang myself!

This world will go on without me so it's not a problem if I kill myself!
