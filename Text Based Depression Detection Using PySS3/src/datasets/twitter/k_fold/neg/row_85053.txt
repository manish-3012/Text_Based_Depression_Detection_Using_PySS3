Next time a relapse Iâ€™m ending my life.I canâ€™t stand hurting people around me while I destroy my life. I grew up around addiction and Iâ€™ve seen what addicts do to everyone they touch...I know I lot of people wanting to die say everyoneâ€™s better off without them but for me itâ€™s true... I feel like my options are sober up, live a good life. Or fail and kill myself and die the person some people still love. I can still die that person....and not die the â€œaddictâ€ who destroyed everyoneâ€™s lives around them. 

Fuck addiction, fuck depression, fuck my fucking life I just want out.
