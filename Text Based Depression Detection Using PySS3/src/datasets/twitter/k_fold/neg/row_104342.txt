Everything is so fucking horrible. I don't want to die I just don't want to be alive anymore.Everyone keeps telling me to break up with my boyfriend. I *really* don't want to. Honestly neither of us are perfect. I really do love him a lot. But he's getting more and more mean lately. He keeps snapping at me and saying intentionally hurtful things. He apologizes and then keeps doing the same things. Every time people get comfortable with me they see it as a green light to treat me like shit. People are just goddamn awful. Everything is awful. I should just kill myself. I was stupid for thinking that my life could get better. Everything is my fault. I'm absolute garbage. I probably deserve all of this.
