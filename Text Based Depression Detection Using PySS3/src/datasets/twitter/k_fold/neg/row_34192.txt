I Can't Believe This CommunityI posted last night with my age and gender and I was called a catfish. I was harassed thoroughly. WHO CATFISHES SUICIDE FORUMS. 

Yes I do need help. Yes I am still alone. However, if you're going to judge me being alone to my gender. In this forum ? Please.

Guess I'll just leave this message again since I've been busy with work. Most of you know that what keeps you busy keeps you away from posting.  

I suppose I'll just post here genderless and ageless that I do need help. I do know this post will be ignored by all because of the ambiguity. Thats fine. 

This sub needs to come down hard on men using it as a dating site.
