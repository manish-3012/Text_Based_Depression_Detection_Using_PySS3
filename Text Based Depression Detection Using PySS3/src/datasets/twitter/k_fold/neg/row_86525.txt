TrappedI wanna kill myself but its too hard. I wanna go to sleep but my mind won't let me. I want to feel "happy" but I cant.

My depressive moods are getting longer and longer. It used to only last a couple of days and then I'll feel "happy" for a few days after that. Now I'll feel "happy" for about 5 hours or less and the thoughts start plaguing my mind again. On Thursdays and continuing through to the weekends, it'll last the whole day, but after that, it'll just be like some asshole switching the lights on and off over and over again and I'll go through a cycle of feeling like stealing my dad's car and driving to the tracks and wait for the train to run me over to diligently studying my books and shit and imagining myself being a successful scientist. I wish there latter would happen more often. Maybe I'm setting unrealistic expectations for myself and deep down I know I'll never be the ideal person I wanna be.

Even if I get what I want, I dont think I will understand the point of continuing to exist. Everything I do will lead to nowhere. None of us matter in this universe. I just feel like we are little playthings for God to pick and choose who to torture and who to not. This is why I never understood why people always use God to help me feel better. God is cruel and if he were truly kind he wouldn't put other people and myself through this mental torture. People will say God is testing us and if we pass we will be rewarded. I just think at that point, once God has had enough fun putting us through our mental torment, he'll leave us alone and that would be our "reward".
