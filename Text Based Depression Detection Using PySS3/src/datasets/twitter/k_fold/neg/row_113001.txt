SadI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m doing this right. I need so much help with my relationship I canâ€™t distinguish if heâ€™s abusive mentally or not. But /r/Relationship_Advice is always against relationship. Iâ€™m waiting to get in but I have to wait until the end of the month until I can see a psychologist. Iâ€™m so sad and lost all the time.  Thereâ€™s not a day I donâ€™t cry. Iâ€™ve decided at the late age of 31 to go back to school but I canâ€™t see it ending well.
