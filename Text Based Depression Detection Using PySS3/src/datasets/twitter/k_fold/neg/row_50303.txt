I made it past the date I was supposed to kill myself.So I made it past the date I was supposed to kill myself. Today the thoughts are so strong. Trying to hold on, but sometimes it's so hard. I hate feeling depressed all the time, and I hate the fact that I keep having these thoughts that I have to fight. It shouldn't be like this.
I'm scared of everything right now, and I wish I could just breathe and accept things for the way they are right now. I keep telling myself things won't be like this forever. 
Sorry I'm babbling, just don't know what else to say. My mind is full of thoughts and can't get them all out, they're like a maze (if that makes any sense) Anyway, thank you for listening.
