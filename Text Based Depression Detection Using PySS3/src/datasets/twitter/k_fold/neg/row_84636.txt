Pity Party of OneFor the past month the first thought I've had every morning is about killing myself. I'm in a business fraternity at a school with over 70k people, I'm not awkward or lonely, I just want to kill myself. When I'm around other people I find very temporary happiness until the idea of suicide rushes back into my brain, and I don't even know why I want to die I just do and it's become an almost natural reflex and this cyclical inner monologue of moping and rationalizing why I should stay alive. At this point the only thing stopping me is that I don't want to hurt other people.
