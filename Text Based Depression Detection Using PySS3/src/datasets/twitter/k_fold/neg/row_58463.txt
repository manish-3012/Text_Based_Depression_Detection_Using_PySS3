Is there any reason to live?Im 23 but I feel like there is no reason for me to live anymore. My entire family hates me and my mom is pressuring me to get a job when I graduate in December so she can cut me off for good. I told my my mom I was gonna kill myself but she told me she was gonna celebrate when that happens.I really don't think I am capable of doing anything at this point and the only thing keeping me alive is looking forward to drugs to possibly overdose and the fact I dont have access to a gun. As of now, Im skipping class so I can do drugs because I feel too much shame to go to school and I feel like Im wasting my time at school. Is there any reason to be living anymore because I dont think my life is worth anything to anyone anymore?
