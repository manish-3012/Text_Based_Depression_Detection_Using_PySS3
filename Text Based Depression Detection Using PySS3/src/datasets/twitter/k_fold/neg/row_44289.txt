I was too stupid to even get my way outEven if I wanted to, I donâ€™t have enough drugs to kill me tonight and I donâ€™t have a gun to do it. I tried bleeding out before and I change my mind last second every time. To get into my car makes it too real. Honestly, I donâ€™t think I could ever actually end my own life. The reason Iâ€™m writing to this thread though is because I am at a point in my life I never thought possible. Iâ€™m at a point in my life where it makes sense to end my own life. Iâ€™m at a point where I dont feel the passion of my family to encourage me not to. Iâ€™m at a point where I know I donâ€™t matter and I know everyone would be done with it. But I will stay here. I wonâ€™t do it because I know what itâ€™s like to be left behind. Itâ€™s all temporary so I wonâ€™t make a permanent decision.
What I want to know- the reason I am writing to this thread- is how do I go from feeling justified to kill myself to feeling too valuable not to.
Maybe Iâ€™m just a ranting idiot. Idk. But I need hope. So maybe itâ€™s some motivational tdocumentary or something but it would help. How do I choose to keep going when logically it doesnâ€™t matter if I do?
