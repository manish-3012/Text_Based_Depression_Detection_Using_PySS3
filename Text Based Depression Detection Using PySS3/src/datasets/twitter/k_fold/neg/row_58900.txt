Heartbroken and struggling to keep myself aliveI don't wanna live if I can't be with her. Ever since she moved out and broke up with me I've struggled to find genuine happiness. I wake up alone, go about my day alone, and fall asleep alone. I lay in our bed awake some night just crying and begging whatever power there is out there that she'll come back to me. The depression is weighing so heavily on me and it's making me so incredibly suicidal again. I wanna start cutting again because of just how stressed I am. I have thoughts about starting to drink and drown my pain in booze. It hurts so fucking much and the only way anything is ever going to feel good again is if she gets back together with me. I'm sick and tired of people telling me that I'll find somebody else. I DON'T FUCKING WANT ANYBODY ELSE. I WANT HER. SHE'S MY SOULMATE. She's the girl who holds a huge part of me. I used to think I'd settle for something mediocre, like a crappy job and a partner that would kinda care about me and just kinda live a half assed life, but since meeting her I decided I wouldn't settle for mediocre. I want her, I want a life with HER. I wanna wake up next to her again, hear her blasting her EDM music at 7 in the morning, make her nachos after work, joke about who's farts stink more while we stay up late and just talk and screw around. I want the love of my life back. I want my life back, the happy one that I had. I cry so much now, desperately hoping and praying she'll come back. She's the only happiness I have. I'd do anything to get her back.
