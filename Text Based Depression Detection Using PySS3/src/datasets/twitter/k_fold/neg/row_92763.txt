???Can someone just tell me what to do, i don't feel like anyone i could talk to could help. When I say i'm a failure I mean it. My grades are so bad, i'm basically in ordinary for everything, i'm in the worst math and English classes. I do french even though I don't speak a word of it and i'm going into my last year of school on the 29th of august. I always look for jobs because i feel like it would get my mind of things, the other day I actually got an interview.. my 2nd ever I've applied to like 40 places and it was McDonalds. I can't even get a fucking job at McDonalds.. I feel like if I stay through my last year of school i'll do terrible and not get a good job and i'll be living on benefits and the dole. I don't want that life. I almost want to attempt suicide but not for it actually to happen, and I don't know how. I don't want to tell people because I don't think they'll be normal about it, I don't want to be treated like a little child. I know someone is going to say 'But they're your family they won't' or some shit like that please don't. I don't know i'm just frustrated and it's not going to end well..
