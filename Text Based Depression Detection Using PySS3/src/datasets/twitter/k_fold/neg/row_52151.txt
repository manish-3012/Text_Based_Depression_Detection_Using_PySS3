Goodbye. This is the last parental abuse I can take.My Dad just woke up and said "Shut the fuck up, you fucking retard."

I had a panic attack yesterday and everything in the world is out to get me and nobody wants to help cause I'm just such a failure.

I lost nearly all my friends partly due to my autism, and I stand to lose so many more if I continue living.

I've planned out my suicide. I'm not going to give my rent to my parents this month, they'll threaten eviction, and I will commit suicide right there and then.

I want to kill myself. I just want to die.
