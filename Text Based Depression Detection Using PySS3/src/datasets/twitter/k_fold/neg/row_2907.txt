Iâ€™m really tiredThe first time I ever heard â€˜it gets betterâ€™, I was 10 years old. Freshly diagnosed with moderate depression.

Iâ€™m 23 now, severe chronic depression, and Iâ€™m so tired of hearing it. 

Bullied as a child, ignored in my teens. I went to school for law and medicine and Iâ€™ve been applying to jobs everyday since I was let go from the seasonal staff at a place I really enjoyed working with no luck. Iâ€™ve been rejected from Walmart, McDonaldâ€™s, gas stations, every basic retail and fast food service all the way up to jobs in my field of study. No luck, a handful of interviews for every hundred resumes and all rejections.

Iâ€™m only $20000 in debt for school but I canâ€™t pay it off because I canâ€™t find a job. My credit is getting lower as I type this. No matter how hard Iâ€™ve tried, Iâ€™ve always failed. Always fell short. 

My entire life, as far back as I can remember, has been a complete clusterfuck of pain and depression and Iâ€™m tired of hurting. Iâ€™m dead inside. Even my medication canâ€™t bridge the gap in my depression anymore. Iâ€™m just? Existing. Iâ€™m waiting to die. 

Someone told me today it gets better. I could do nothing but stare through them. It feels like an insult.
