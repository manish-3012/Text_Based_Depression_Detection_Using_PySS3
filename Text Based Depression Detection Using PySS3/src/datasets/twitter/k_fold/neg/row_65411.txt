How does one commit suicide with no pain and guaranteed success? (I can't get a gun so this is not an option) thanks in advance if someone replies. If not allowed, can you please tell me where can I ask and get proper advice on the matter, please?If I can't live a decent life, I would like a decent death with no pain and no fear of waking up paralyzed or with brain damage. I just want to go in peace and easy but the only place that has done assisted suicide because of mental health is the Netherlands and my understanding is you have to be from the Netherlands so they avoid suicide tourism. I just don't want to go in pain, that's all.
