Rope is fucking expensive?? The hell???It's been years since my last attempt. I've always tried overdosing. Doesn't work that well for me, so I thought to leave aside painless methods and stuck to traditionally hang myself. I can't shoot myself because in Spain is hard as balls to get a fire weapon. So hanging it is. But hell, even dying costs money. I'd be happy if some car rushed over my skull so at least nobody would blame me for killing myself. 
Good night.
