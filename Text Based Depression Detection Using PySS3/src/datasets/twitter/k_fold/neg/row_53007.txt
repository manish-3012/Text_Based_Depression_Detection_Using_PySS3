SuicidalityNot sure where to start.... Do not have a history of mental health issues, so this is a first for me. Something bad happened a couple weeks ago and I've had trouble coping. I'm usually a resiliant person so I thought i'd be upset for a while but heal with time. No such luck, and have felt suicidal twice in the past week (I have a plan, but I don't think I would carry it out). I haven't told my family and friends, because I can see the burden of their concern for me (recently I have been crying a lot, and I haven't been leaving my house really for anything and I can tell it's made them upset). I don't really know how to get help or how to start healing. Everyday I wake up is the same... feeling like my life is a joke and there's no puspose in living
