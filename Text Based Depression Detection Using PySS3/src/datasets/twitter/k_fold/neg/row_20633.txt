Had to write this somewhere.I don't know what the fuck to do.  A year ago I lost my job.  Failing to find employment, I tried shooting myself in the head six months later.  I missed.   Last month I ran through the last of the goodwill I had with my family.  So long story short my family bought me a plane ticket out of Alaska, and gave me a little bit of money so I can try and not me homeless.  I leave Friday.

Tomorrow I have to give my dog to the animal shelter, since she's a pit bull and I can't take her on the airline with me.  She's literally the only living being that gives a single fuck about me, and the last tether I have to caring about reality.

I wish I could've figured this out.

But it's okay, I know there's tall buildings where I'm going. 

Good luck.
