I want to kill myselfLast week I thought about hanging myself and then last night I was going to strip down and fall asleep in the snow to kill myself my dad hasn't told me that he loves me in years and my mother told me she wants me to die and that she hates me and my brother offered me his gun when I jokingly said I wanted to kill myself I had horrible friends growing up who would say things about my appearance and my extended family would also compare me to my cousin and they would always say I was fatter I developed an eating disorder at a young age and started puking at 13 and I was physically and verbally abused by my parents and one of my parents is a past addict and I felt like it was my responsibility to take care of them while my other parents would leave for work trips out of state and I would miss school because of this when I was young I was attacked by a man in a local place and no one helped me and from the beatings and that I developed ptsd one day a teacher had raised her hand to grab something I'm assuming near me and I flinched and backed up and she made the joke what do your parents beat you or something and I had to laugh it off I was diagnosed with depression when my mom finally took me to the doctor and that was only a few years ago and then I started seeing a counselor and so far I've gone through three and I've tried Prozac and St. John's Wort because I'm scared to take prescription pills due to my parents past addiction and I have always had bad anxiety along with OCD and these are all things I have to battle with each and every day I can't have peace or relax within my own mind and I can never have quiet time by myself I got into a relationship that I'm still in with my guy best friend and I started to get hostile towards him and accuse him of not being attracted to me and it's made our relationship ship go down hill we have recovered since then and I got better but then within the last month he started talking to someone who wanted to do sexual things with him in the past so of course I felt threatened and now ever since then I've been feeling more insecure and hostile towards him and I've felt like he hasn't been sexually attracted to me and my dog recently passed away and I accused him of not being there when he tried his best to be and I want to stop hurting the only person who truly loves me and I trust him more than anyone but he hurt me by talking to this girl because of what she wanted to do with him and now I feel like I might lose him and she's everything I'm not and I just feel like no one is there for me anymore and I can barely live with myself because I'm only rude to the people who want the best for me and I try to get the people who hate me to love me and I wish I could just stop getting upset over the smallest things and be normal like everyone else and I wish I didn't have to worry and I've been suicidal since 2014 and I've been really feeling it for the past two months especially during the holidays because I really don't have family or friends and it hurts to be so lonely all of the time and I never feel like suicide will leave my mind so maybe right now it's my only answer because no one could love me I'm unlovable and a horrible person I'm sorry for the bad grammar and lack of punctuation but it feels nice to get this off my chest I know other people have it worse so I'm sorry if this came off as a poor me situation
