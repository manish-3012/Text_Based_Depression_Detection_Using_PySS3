Holy shit Im doneI never felt like this before, Jesus Christ. I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself soon. 

I woke up at 11pm again. My first feeling after waking up was just dread. 

No matter how many advices I read I still canâ€™t get out of my bed except for eating and going to the bathroom. For almost 2 years.
