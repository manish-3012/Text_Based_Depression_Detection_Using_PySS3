Been spending an inordinate amount of time thinking about what others would say after I end itEvery day, to drown out the silence, I stick on those shitty YouTube documentaries about unsolved  mysteries or cold-case murders and the like; and they spend a lot of time talking to the families and friends of the dead. 

Now everywhere I go, and everything I do, is lined by an undercurrent of thinking, â€œwhat if this is the last time any one sees me?â€ â€œWould they look at my internet usage?â€ â€œWould they try to justify my death? Would they talk about how I was a â€˜troubled young womanâ€™, who â€˜struggled a lot with her mental healthâ€™?â€ 

Iâ€™m feeling that tired, pervasive, gnawing suicidal ideation. The kind that just eats at you slowly and youâ€™re never sure when the breaking point will be.
