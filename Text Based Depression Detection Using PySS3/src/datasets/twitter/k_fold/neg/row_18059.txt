I've lost hopeI've been great at music for some time now. Everyone used to compliment me and tell me how good I was. It got to the point where I thought it was all I was good at, and now my new Wind Ensemble director makes me feel like I can't even do that right
I'm thinking about overdosing.
I'll update later if I do or not

I've decided not to now. Besides, I don't have enough of anything to go with.
Thanks for your feedback :)
