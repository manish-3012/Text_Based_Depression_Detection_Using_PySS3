mistakes and failuresevery aspect of myself is awful. i've done morally repulsive things that have left me with a constant feeling of shame and fear, i'm extremely ugly, i have no social skills, i have no ambition, no interests, no hobbies. i have nothing to look forward to in life. i will probably never make a new friend or be in a relationship or acquire a job that i find fulfilling. all i do is make those around me miserable. i wish i could just die in my sleep.
