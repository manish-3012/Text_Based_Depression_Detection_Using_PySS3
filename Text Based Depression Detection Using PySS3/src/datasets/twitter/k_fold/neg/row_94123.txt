I am giving up. I'm done. I'm sorry.I have Borderline Personality Disorder. My life is is a constant cycle of apathy -&gt; depression -&gt; suicidal ideation. I freak out over the smallest things. I have tried therapy (DBT and CBT), medication (SSRI, SNRI, Tricyclic, MAOI), hospitalization (18 times, ranging from a few days to a 1 year stay). The first time I tried to kill myself I was 12 years old. I am 27 now. 15 years of therapy and hospitals and medicine. Nothing has worked. 

My mother was a terrible mother. I was molested at 6 by her boyfriend. She would flip between not believing me and blaming me for it. She told me: "Maybe it wouldn't have happened if you kept your legs closed." She called me a sl*t, a wh*re. At 15 she let the man that molested me move in with us. He slept with her in the room right beside me. I lived in constant fear he would rape me. He was my half sister's father. He had joint custody of my sister. I'm certain he molested her too. She shows the signs of it. 

I have a daughter. She's beautiful and smart and perfect. There's forums about children with BPD parents. How terrible their lives were growing up with that. How they have so many mental problems because of them.  I'm terrified I'll ruin my daughter's life, like my mother ruined mine. 

I intend on purchasing heroin. I'm going to overdose. I've heard it's not a painful death. I can't do this anymore. I can't live like this anymore. My husband and daughter will be better off without me. I know it will hurt them, but life will move on. They'll move on. She's too young to remember me. She'll be able to grow up without a mother that destroys her life.
