I donâ€™t get it.. seriouslyI donâ€™t understand when to stay shut, when to just keep it to myself. Iâ€™m hurting others when I say â€œI wanna kill myselfâ€ granted only one person really but still. He doesnâ€™t wanna know that or hear that from me. Almost lost him as a friend bc of it and I donâ€™t want that tbh. While I feel that way I donâ€™t have any real intention on doing so right now. But man do I feel hopeless an stupid, I donâ€™t get it!! When DO I go to people then? When do I shut the fuck up? IJUST DONT KNOW WHENNNN thatâ€™s all I need to knowwwww but no one is giving me a real answer. I wanna die but I also wanna be held
