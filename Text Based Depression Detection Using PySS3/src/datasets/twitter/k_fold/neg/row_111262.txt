One of my close friends is suicidal, help?Lately, my friend has been talking and acting different. He's been talking about how he "wants to be gone" and "wants the pain to stop." As far as I know, he's only talked about this to me and another mutual friend. He tells me that he gets abused at home from his parents and brother and can't take it anymore. 

We're both 14 year old boys, and I have no idea what the fuck to do. Should I tell a school councilor? Should I tell anyone? 

I'm really sorry if this is in the wrong place, I don't know where else to go.
