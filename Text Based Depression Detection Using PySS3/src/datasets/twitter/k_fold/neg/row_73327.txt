I dont want to live anymoreIm fucking tired of living, I really am. From the beginning of the year things have just gotten worse. I was diagnosed with cluster headaches (attack subsided after about a week), TMJ, neck pain, visual snow, a bunch of food intolerances, and I believe i have more that I need to get tested for too. My anxiety was the worst it's been in years at the beginning of the year, I was getting panic attacks and impending doom every single day, then my depression started spiraling out of control, and now I believe I have DP/DR. Everything has a plastic sheen to it, and i feel alien, like I cant connect with any humans at all. My libido has disappeared, I barley ever get an erection, I feel fatigued all the time, I don't sleep well when I do sleep. I hallucinate (unsure if they are migraine auras or something else) and feel like I'm going to lose my mind for good. 
Everytime I go to the doctor to check for a symptom, I fine. My spine is fine, my head is fine, my eyes are fine BUT SOEMTHING OBVIOUSLY ISNT FUCKING FINE. ITS NOT NORMAL TO FEEL THIS WAY. I don't get it I eat well, work out, stay hydrated, dont smoke, dont drink, dont do drugs, WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY.
I don't plan on killing myself, I know tons of people that love and look up to me, and i know it would devastate them and possibly ruin their lives in the short term. But why won't it stop? Why can't i feel like i live on Earth anymore? Why does everything seem off? Why do I have loose stool every day? 
I am so over living its fucking bullshit. Hopefully a therapist can help, but I/m not holding a lot of hope.
