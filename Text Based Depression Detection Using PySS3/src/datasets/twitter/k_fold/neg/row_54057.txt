Going sooni am bipolar, i have never known happiness, i have suffered through a lifetime of physical emotional and sexual abuse from my parents, now my boyfriend of 3 years is leaving me for other women. he makes it seem like everything else is better than being witih me. my friends don't understand what my condition is. i am alone. i have always been alone. i am a waste of resources. and i have always planned on taking my life, if not now, then next time. i have already had suicide attempts in the past, one which has landed me in a psych ward. i hate that they saved me then. i want to succeed now. i wish that people read more about suicide. i am thankful this subreddit exists. but no one in real life has cared enough about me to help. not even to read all these information that may potentially be life-saving.
