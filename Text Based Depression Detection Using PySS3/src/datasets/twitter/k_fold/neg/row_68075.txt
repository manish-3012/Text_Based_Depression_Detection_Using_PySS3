I can never be totally honest about how suicidal I amLong-term and recurrrent depression and all the accompaniments. With meds and therapy I've still ended up having severe episodes every few months/year. Each episode gets a bit worse. Ironically I am stopped from trying to kill myself now by the fears - fear of getting into trouble/getting caught/upsetting my family and getting into trouble, fear of just maiming myself, fear of the nothingness/unknown I expect to be on the other side. All the time the urge to hurt myself or just push all the way through is so strong. I keep deadening myself so that I can carry on acting normal and working etc but ultimately I see no point. 

I think I'm scared of the point in the sequence of actions where I would stop being in control of the process - at some point I would lose control. All the methods I tend towards favour retaining some control but I won't be able to keep that until the end, which scares me. I was talking to a friend today about these urges and he said that this means I'm not unsafe/dangerous to myself, because I'm still talking about it, as opposed to not talking about it and just doing it. That felt fucking invalidating. Not that I want to be "classified" as a danger to myself, but I really struggle to ask for help, and it's an irrational kind of confirmation that I don't need to be asking for more help right now - I'm obviously doing ok. 

I've seen my therapist an extra time, and I can't afford to see her for any more extra sessions now. I keep making plans for the future and acting like things are normal but at the same time it feels like I am constantly preparing to kill myself in the next few hours. Just having to postpone it until I fulfill xyz responsibility and don't spoil so and so's birthday.
