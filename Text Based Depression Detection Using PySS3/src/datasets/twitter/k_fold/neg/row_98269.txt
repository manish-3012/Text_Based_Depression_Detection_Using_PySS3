I think I sexually assaulted someone and I want to dieI convinced someone to  give me a blow job and I want to kill myself.  I 24 (m) am gay. This incidient was 2 years ago. I lived with a roommate who Iâ€™d had a crush on for ages as I was only juts figuring out I might be gay, but I tried to  d my best to hide my feelings because I didn't want him to feel uncomfortable. One night we were both drunk, him much more than me, and I talked him into giving me a BJ when he was quite intoxicated...he didnâ€™t want to but I talked him into itâ€¦ this was 2 years ago and I only just realized how wrong I was. I just want to die. I am so against people doing disgusting stuff like this yet I turned out to be one of those people. I feel no better than a disgusting rapist and just want to die.
