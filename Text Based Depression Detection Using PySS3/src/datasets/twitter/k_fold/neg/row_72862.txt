I don't think I can deal with life.I just need to talk about life. I'm a 22 year old college student, and I've always been so scared of just fucking everything. literally about everything, about how I look, about letting anyone down, about how I treat people, about education, about finding a job, about planning to move out. 

I have to say that at this point I've also distanced myself from a few friends, and my family. I feel so much better alone. I love when I have the place to myself, away from everyone's fucking bullshit. I just don't want to hear about your shit when I already have so much shit of my own. Late night when everyone's asleep is when I really feel at peace.

For fuck sake, at this point I am too tired. I bottle it up inside because I am supposed to man up.

Everyone says I look so confident, but I'm crumbling to shit inside. I'm so scared of the future, finishing college, getting a fucking professional career and just being able to live. What if I don't do any of those? Procrastination is always biting me in the ass because I'm so afraid I will not measure up to my ideals, so I end up putting things for the last minute.

Is this normal? how does anyone deal with this? Is there a good way of beating this?

I don't want to say that I want to kill myself, but the idea is starting to seem more attractive, just because that way I won't have to deal with life's disappointments . Sometimes I burst out crying and feel like smashing my head against a wall. Even if this is depression, I don't want to seek professional help because of the stigma behind depression. I don't need anyone's pity, I just want peace.
