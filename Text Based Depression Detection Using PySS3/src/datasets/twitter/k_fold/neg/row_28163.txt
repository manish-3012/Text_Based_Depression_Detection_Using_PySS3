I'm going to kill myself soon.I'm honestly done. I have tried. So. Fucking. Hard. To listen to people, to take their advice on life, including therapy. I've TRIED to be positive, I've TRIED to go through life without a care and not be negative. People still keep betraying me, leaving me, getting pissed at me and think I'm being selfish because I'm trying to better myself. I'm done. I have 0 ability to make more friends, I have a dark, hurt heart. I'm killing myself this Friday, I'll have time to reflect on how many people have fucked me over. I'm just done with it all. I just want to eternally rest, I want the pain to stop.
