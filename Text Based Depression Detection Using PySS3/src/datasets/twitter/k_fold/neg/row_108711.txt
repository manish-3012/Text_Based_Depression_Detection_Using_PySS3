I've been thinking about doing a very public suicide.I've been having fantasies recently about committing suicide in a very public place. The last time I did that was falling onto the Metro tracks, but I was saved at the last minute. 

But now, I've been thinking about a very public suicide, maybe jumping out of a window of a very busy building into a crowd of people would be a good way to go. 

I was also considering stabbing myself in a busy shopping area and slowly bleed to death while everyone watches on. if I could get a gun (I can't in the UK) I would shoot myself in the head in the middle of a busy street where everyone can see. I would also try and get run over by a train again and see if I can get run over or maybe stabbed by another person. There is endless amount of ways I could go and leave my shit life! 

These fantasies have been creeping up in my mind lately as well as in my dreams and it makes me feel that I'm ready to go. My life has been shit for so long that I wish i could end it now, but I would much rather make a spectacle out of it!  

I hate my life and I don't want to live anymore, I fucking hate myself, I hate my body, I hate myself for not being as good as I should be, I hate living in a shit place and I hate knowing that my future is fucked already! 

FUCK MY LIFE, I'm going to kill myself and I don't give a shit what other people think. No one cares about me, neither do you guys, you're just here because you want to make yourself feel good when in reality, you do not care about anyone here whatsoever! 

This world sucks and I can't wait to leave in the best way possible.
