I just feel alone.I have no friends where I am now living...I have a boyfriend and it's complicated talking to him about these things.  I have family but they all live states away from me and having suicidal thoughts isn't something they can cope with hearing from me.  I've attempted suicide almost two years ago and hallucinating essentially saved my life, unfortunately.  I was so angry when I woke up in the hospital, I couldn't stop crying.  I really don't want to live and to be honest, there really isn't anything stopping me from doing it...I don't think I'm someone worth missing....I don't feel attached to anything...I just feel empty.  I have like no hobbies or interests...I have no energy or motivation.  I am a waste of oxygen. Typing this now, it's just like GO FOR IT, why bother writing this?  I don't know.  I just wish I had some interest in life.  

I'm sorry.
