I don't want to die but I don't want to feelSuicide has been an option in my head for years but it's gotten to the point where I have the means necessary and I want to do it. I have people I love, people that love me, and I've been in therapy but since its through my university I had to have my last session yesterday with the school counselor I was seeing. It was very hard on me because we were very close and I've been feeling unable to cope for the past few weeks. I have no motivation and I'm just unhappy with my existence. I have a professor that knows whats up but I feel like I've been bothering her when I ask if she's available and if I tell her how suicidal i am she'll have to report it. I can't work on my finals (im graduating, too. this is all i have left!) and I just want to know if anyone else has sort of teetered this close to the edge cause I feel really alone and no one else I know struggles with suicidal thoughts. Thinking of the pain I would cause my mom and brother used to be enough to make me snap out of it, but now even that is starting to take a backseat to the bad thoughts.
