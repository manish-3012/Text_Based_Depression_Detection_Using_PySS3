Looking for advice for someone in a situationThis isn't for me - I'm looking for advice for another poster whose long-distance girlfriend may be in an alarming situation:

http://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1d91pv/long_distance_relationship_has_just_turned_from/

Short version: he's in a long distance relationship with a girl who has a bad home life and has made a suicide attempt before. Tonight, she said this to him, and then ended their conversation:

"Mark I don't know when and If we will ever talk again but I love you. I don't have time to explain so bye"

I tried to give him the best advice I could, which was to contact someone near her or call the police, because someone needed to check on her.

If someone could provide any advice to him, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
