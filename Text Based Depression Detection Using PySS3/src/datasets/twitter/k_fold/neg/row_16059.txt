My Boyfriend and I are Both SuicidalIâ€™ve been suicidal as long as I can remember. My boyfriend became extremely depressed after the loss of a loved one and grieves constantly. I feel like I trigger his depression and I know Iâ€™m no good for him since I lash out at him all the time when heâ€™s done nothing wrong.

I love him and I think he loves me too, but I canâ€™t even help him anymore. I donâ€™t list any reasons for him to live because I canâ€™t see any for myself. We often talk about driving off the bridge together so that one of us wonâ€™t have to endure the otherâ€™s suicide. 

Itâ€™s all so toxic. I hate hurting him like this. I just want to get it over with and have someone keep him alive long enough to see how much better relationships can be.
