I wish someone else would do the work for meI havenâ€™t amounted to anything, all my plans have fell through and I feel like it will never get better than this. I keep putting myself in weird situation hoping that something will kill me because I donâ€™t have the guts to do it myself. People say Iâ€™m crazy but Iâ€™m just so tired.
