I need motivation to end my lifeI have been so low. For so long. I dream of dying, of being killed. But I'm afraid my soul will never rest in peace, knowing the damage I will have done to the people around me by taking my life. That is my only reason left to live... I don't want to hurt anyone, but I want to die more than anything. I'm stuck. Please, just get me out this, someone. Please, motivate me to just do it. I'm going fucking crazy.
