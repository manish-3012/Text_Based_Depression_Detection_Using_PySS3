I want to do it.Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™ve spent my whole life trying to make others happy. Iâ€™m worthless, and they donâ€™t deserve me as a friend. Iâ€™ve met such wonderful people and it would just fit better if I wasnâ€™t weighing them down anymore. I think Iâ€™m gonna start planning it today. So I can finally stop being a bother to everyone. Iâ€™m sorry
