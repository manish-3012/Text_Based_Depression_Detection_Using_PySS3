I feel so depressed about timeI feel like I waste too much time on stuff that I don't like doing. I don't like my job, I work 9 hours for a shit payment and I can't even save a single dollar from it, not cause I spend too much, I need to give 60% of my earning to my mum and other money that's left I need to pay the bills so I can't buy stuff and I can't have a good time or I can't save up for a car let's say. I have this girl that I've been for a year now and when I spend time with her it's all good, but when she's not here it just feel so alone, I have to work, come home, spend alone time because she is not from my town and I don't have a car so I can go to her place. And i'm just wondering, am I going to feel so alone all the time? What is the purpose of all this? I need a higher meaning, I feel like I can be so much more in life, like this isn't what I'm supposed to be, and who am I supposed to be, I feel like I can be great, I don't like doing much things, and my work is depressing as fuckk and I always come home tired..... I don't know what to do. Today I didn't go to job because I was just so bored... I need something in my life, I wanna be somebody, I don't wanna waste my time on things that I don't like doing. I wanna do the things that I love and that makes me happy. I don't wanna be unhappy!!!
