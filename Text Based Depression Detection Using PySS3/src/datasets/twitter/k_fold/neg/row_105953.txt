Suicidal ideation for about 3 months. Not getting better getting worse. I'm giving up on life now.I used to stop myself because of my husband. Now I realize that i just can't live for him. His life is so messed up anyway and he doesn't have time for me.  

I should have done this a long time ago.  I've used up all of my 'try again' and hope shit.  I can't stand the pain anymore.  There are tons of ways of doing it. 

I don't care about how it will affect my husband. My son doesn't love me anymore anyway. I don't care about anyone else anymore because no one cares about me. I can't wait to be done with it.

I was looking at a memorial website for a 14 year old girl who killed herself a few years ago. She was really pretty and popular and her family loved her so much. I'm none of those things and I never have been.
Dying is the only suitable finish to this situation. I can't take the pain anymore.  No I don't care about my family. They never cared about me, and I'm sick of living for everyone else.
