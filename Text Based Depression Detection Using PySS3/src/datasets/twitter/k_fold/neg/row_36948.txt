Someone will feel responsibleIf I kill myself, someone is going to feel like it's their fault.

My sister because I confided my ideations in her. She'll think she could've stopped it.

My dad because my sister told him. For the same reason, he'll think he could've stopped it.

My mom wouldn't even know because I hide anything bad from her. I don't want her to worry.

If I use a knife, my dad will feel responsible because it would be one he made or bought for me.

If I jump from the top of my residence, the school will feel like they didn't have enough security on the top floor

If I hang myself, my parents will regret not seeing the transaction of purchasing a rope.

Theres no way to get out without someone feeling guilty about my death.
