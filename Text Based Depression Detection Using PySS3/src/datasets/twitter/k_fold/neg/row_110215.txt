I was 11I was 11 years old when I wrote my first suicide note.

I was 12 when I started to self harm.

I was 13 when I had my first psych ward trip.

Then 14... 15... 17... 19... 25... 26 and now I am 27. 

I was 13 when I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression.

I was 14 when I started coping with alcohol.

I was 15 when my depression diagnosis turned to a bipolar one.

I was 17 when I moved out.

I was 17 when my neighbor decided he would rape me.

I was 19 when I became pregnant and had a child. She is disabled.

I was 21 when her father put his hands on me and I fled with her.

I was 23 when my father was diagnosed with cancer.

I am 27. I have nothing to show for it. I am constantly ill in one way or another. Try as I might it is never good enough. 

Every morning I wake up and wish I hadn't. I hate my existence. The suffocation and numbness. I can't do it anymore. I can't do it.
