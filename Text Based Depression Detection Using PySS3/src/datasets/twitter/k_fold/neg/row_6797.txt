I feel sickHonestly, I do feel sick to my stomach, and it's just because of my mind again.

We've been talking about Corona - my mom and I - and I turned a "maybe it'll hit me, you know I wouldn't last long haha" into a joke. Mom looked at me and called me silly and went: "You shouldn't talk like that." But... it would be so much easier.

It would be easier to get Corona, because my lungs are so fucked up, I'd probably die weeks later. My immunity is so fucked up that I'll probably get it almost immediately too. And I still have bad cough so maybe the tests were wrong and I have it - I got tested as a precaution because of work.

It wouldn't even be suicide... no one would even know I wanted it to happen... the only thing holding me back is the fact that both my parents are old and I wouldn't want to infect them too... but damn it, I'm tired of this world...
