What's the pointI'm feeling very worn out. I had to move back in with my mentally/emotionally abusive parents last year because me and my fiance broke up. We were together for 5 years so it's been really hard on me. Had to fit half a house worth of stuff into a very small bedroom. It feels so cramped and makes me anxious. 

I haven't lived here for 5 years so I don't know many people who live in this city anymore. Everyone I used to know moved away. All my friends I had before I moved back also stopped speaking to me even though I've tried to reach out to them. I think my ex told them lies about me, and I can't bring myself to tell them the truth about what happened because it's way too fucked up. There was only one old friend that I started talking to again and we started dating a few months ago, but I already feel like his feelings for me are fizzling out. It really sucks. I have nobody to talk to.

Also, finding a job with all the coronavirus stuff going on is impossible. I don't even have a car (it broke down and was so expensive to fix that I had to get rid of it) and I've got problems with my immune system. I don't think I should be getting a job until the number of cases start going down again. I signed up for online college classes though so I can hopefully finish the last few classes to get my degree. But I'm starting to feel like there's no point. I'm almost 30 and my life looks so bleak when I think about the future. My parents make me feel like a burden and sometimes I feel like they're right. I don't feel like I have anything to contribute to society or anyone else's life. I feel like I'm just going to end up homeless again
