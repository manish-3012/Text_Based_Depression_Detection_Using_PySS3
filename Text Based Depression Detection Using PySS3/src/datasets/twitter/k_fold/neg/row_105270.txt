My life feels meaninglessIâ€™m 15m in my sophomore year of high school and Ive been depressed for a while, about a year and a half to be exact. I can never seem to find happiness in the things I once enjoyed. Iâ€™m not happy with who I am anymore. I lack the motivation to do simple things, Iâ€™m lonely and antisocial. I donâ€™t sleep. If Iâ€™m not eating too much, itâ€™s too little. I think that the world would be a better place without me in it. Iâ€™ve gotten the result of severe depression on every test Iâ€™ve taken, but I donâ€™t tell anyone about it. I lie on tests my doctors and counselors give me because I donâ€™t want to hurt those who love me. 

I cut, almost every day, on my thing where nobody will see. I think about killing myself but I know how selfish it is so I could never do it. Iâ€™m quiet, but on the inside Iâ€™m calling out for a friend, someone to confide in. I feel like every day I fall deeper into this darkness that entraps me and keeps my happiness from being free. I wish that music would bring me joy and fill me with happiness once more, and that someone would look at me like I am more than just another person.
