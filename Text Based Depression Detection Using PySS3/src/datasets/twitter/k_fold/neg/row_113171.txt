I'm so confusedI plan on killing myself after I graduate college. Everything is planned and I'm ready to go at a moments notice. However, I still work and study and act like nothing is bothering me. No one I know has an inkling of what I feel, and I want it to stay that way. However, why should any of this matter if I'm going to be dead? Why am I still trying? Why wait and not just shoot myself now if the result is the same regardless. 

I'm sad and angry and confused and I just want to stop existing.
