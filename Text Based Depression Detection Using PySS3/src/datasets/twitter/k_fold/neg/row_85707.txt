Hopelessness is consuming and destroying me. NSFW.This is a long post. I apologize for that. I have depression, panic disorder (I have panic attacks very rarely), GAD (general anxiety disorder), obsessive compulsive disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (I think that I was officially diagnosed with it a little over a year ago). Iâ€™m on day twenty-six of my cycle. Iâ€™ve been thinking about my purpose in life. I think that itâ€™s to help others, but Iâ€™m not sure anymore. I feel hopeless and worthless. My vagina is narrow, short, and tight. Most of the time, even when Iâ€™m aroused and lubricated, I canâ€™t insert two of my fingers. When I slide one finger in most of the way, my vagina becomes extremely tight and it feels like my finger is going past something. Itâ€™s hard to explain, but it hurts. I feel angry and hopeless. In one way, Iâ€™m glad that my vagina is tight because it would please a partner. In another way, Iâ€™m enraged by the fact that someone would profit off of my pain and agony. I hate when people say that having a tight vagina is a good thing. Iâ€™ve had users flat out tell me that tighter is always better and that a tense vagina feels better. Iâ€™ve never been abused. Part of me is just disgusted by men because they want a â€œtight vaginaâ€ and they just want to profit off of their partnerâ€™s pain and suffering. Itâ€™s like what feels good for the man hurts the woman. I'm horrified that it won't go in, or if it does, it won't go in all of the way, and when it gets into the extremely tight part of my vagina, I'll have to stop him. I don't want to take the man's pleasure away and ruin the experience for him. I feel hopeless in all areas of my life. I wish that I could just go to sleep and never wake up. I have no plan to harm myself. I also have a question about this sub. If people feel borderline suicidal, they arenâ€™t reported or punished, right? Thank you for reading my long post. I appreciate it.
