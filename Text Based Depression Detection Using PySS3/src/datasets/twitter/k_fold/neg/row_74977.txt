How likely is this to be lethal?Forgive me if this isn't allowed.

A friend wants another friend to give them some things which they are withholding for fear they could be attempting suicide with them. How likely is 40mg of oxycodone, 10mg hydrocodone, 125mg etizolam, 1.5mg of alprozolam, and probably alcohol on top of that to kill someone? They claim to need them for anxiety but no one wants to have them end up dead. Thanks
