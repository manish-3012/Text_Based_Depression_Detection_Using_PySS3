I don't want to be resilient anymore, I'm tired of being strongEvery. Single. Day. I wake up and feel horribly depressed. Nothing has happened yet, and I already want to kill myself. I look on this sub and the depression sub to maybe find some comfort in seeing how not alone I am in all of this. Every morning. 

I see all these posts about "keep being strong" and "being resiliant" and stuff. It's a nice message to send, but it doesn't resonate with me. Oddly enough, the ones that DO resonate are the ones that are stuff like "things will get better". Which, from what I hear, is damaging to say for someone who is suicidal. It's unrealistic to say that things are 100% going to get better, I get that. But I don't want realism. I want that stupid fantasy of me living the life I always dreamed of. The simple, quiet life ive always wanted. Not one of wealth, power, and extravagance. Just one where I'm just happy and content with being alive. I know what I'm saying is childish and stupid. But, that's what I feel. I just want someone in my life to hold me and let me know how amazing life is, because I clearly cannot see it. Someone to catch my tears and explain to me how wonderful and serene it is to experience all the joys life has to offer. 

All I want is some god damn hope, okay? I've been "resilient" and "strong" for so long in my state of hopelessness. I've kept myself from committing suicide for so long, cant someone just take the reigns for me and catch my mind a break? 

Mods, if this post is damaging or not okay to say to others, feel free to Thanos Snap it out of existence. I mean that with sincerity, not as some backhanded remark. I am well aware that what I'm saying is pretty dumb to say the least. I'm just in a horrid spot right now. It's so hard just living in a person that I hate more than anyone. It's hard to just stay.
