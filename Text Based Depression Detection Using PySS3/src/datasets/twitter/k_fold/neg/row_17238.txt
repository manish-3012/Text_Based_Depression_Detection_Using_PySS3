My mom just took her own life.Fuck. My SO wont let me talk about it, as she s too upset herself. (to her credit she starts a new job in the morning)

So lost, she blamed one of my siblings in her note. We haven't read it but some was hard to miss.

Everyone wanted to read it right away, but I think it would be best if we all took the time to talk to a counselor of some sort first. 

One did I think the other has not and refuses to. I haven't had a chance to yet, have a Dr. apt soon but still 3 weeks.
