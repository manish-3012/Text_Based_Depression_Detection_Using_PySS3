How is this getting worse. (3rd attempt)Today was like one of the worst days. I never wanted to kill my parents more than today.
So today we had another load for today sent to us. As usual.
And my parents I don't know why but they were, in a such a bad mood.
I did the homework. And after that she was looking into one of the works.
And finds out I missed one exercise. So the solution?
Control everything from this day and the day before.
And every little thing that I had wrong. Like a letter that could not be read.
In a scream "THIS IS WRONG! I CAN'T READ YOUR LETTERS"
Screaming the neighbors in the apartments could hear it.
And this went on and on and on.
I was so stressed but I was hiding it.
Because If i would probably get slapped.
So after like 3 hours of screaming and stress.
I kind of broke I don't know why.
But I sprinted to the bathroom.
And I was there for like 5 minutes.
And I remembered there was a cleaning product, that was deadly (at least it says that) and I still was stressed and the suicidal thoughts came in.
And so I took a sip.
It was f##king disgusting.
And I don't know why. I just put it back.
So my parents went out.
And said to prepare myself dinner.
I got the milk threw it in the trash. There was a few drops of milk they poured on the ground.
So my dad got extremely pissed.
Imagine a dude who looks like he's working out. And is 2x taller than me.
Screaming at full volume over a FEW DROPS OF F##CKING MILK.
Thankfully it lasted about 3 minutes.
Which is bad too.

I think I will post here regurally as some form of diary.
Cause I don't have friends , and I don't even dare to tell my parents.
So basically it's not good.
If you read this all thank you.
(3rd attempt and not even close).


        So yeah. Bai.
