Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™m going to lose my best friend if I tell her I tried committing suicide.I wonâ€™t get into the whyâ€™s but I recently tried hanging myself but failed. I pretty much have no friends and sheâ€™s my best and only friend (Iâ€™m a male). We had an argument yesterday and annoyed of me rn and Iâ€™m scared of losing her if I tell her. She already knew about my depression but I never mentioned anything about suicide. What do I do
