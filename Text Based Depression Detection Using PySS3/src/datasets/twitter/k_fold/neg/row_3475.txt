My blanketI've let so many people down around me that I've let myself go mentally...the only think i can think to do anymore is go to my blanket. shes shiny and pretty and sharp. And seems to be the only thing that gives me relief. At this time the only thing I want is support and my family seems to care less about giving me any. I'm failing school..I call feel myself go more and more numb everyday..I feel like a burden I've been called useless and I'm starting to believe it...I just want to let go..but now is not the time and I hope when the time comes I'll have someone there to help me stop myself..someone that understands.
