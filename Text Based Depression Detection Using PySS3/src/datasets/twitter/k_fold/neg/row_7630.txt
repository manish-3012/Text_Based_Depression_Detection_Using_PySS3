There's something wrong with my brainMy head is so clouded with negative thoughts, like how I'm such a burden or so annoying or worthless. It feels like a bullet to my skull would sort of 'release' these thoughts and let me think clearly.

The only reason I'm still here is because what it would do to my mom and one of my best friends.

My other best friend tells me how she cares and loves me but then goes and stands me up when we had plans. I then get the most insincere apology.

I used to have a crush on this friend and I honestly can't get her out of my goddam head. Why does a person I feel that I mean so little too, mean so much to me? I want to forget, I want my head cleared so badly, and it feels like there's only one way to do that. Even typing this I just think like I'm sounding like a freak.
