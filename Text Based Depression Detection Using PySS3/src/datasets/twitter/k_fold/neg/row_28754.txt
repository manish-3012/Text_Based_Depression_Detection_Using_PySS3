Advice?iâ€™ve been lurking on this sub for some time now but never posted anything cause iâ€™m too scared to but iâ€™ve gotten enough courage to post (:

iâ€™m planning on oding the coming saturday but my best friend told me to tell my cyw that i have a plan and wanna kms but idk if i should. i feel like being inpatient will benefit me but some part of me is telling me it wonâ€™t. 

i have rly bad anxiety and thereâ€™s gonna be a lot of kids there plus i have a hard time talking and making new friends 

idk if i rly want help but iâ€™m willing to stay inpatient but i donâ€™t wanna stay there for my thoughts if that makes sense
