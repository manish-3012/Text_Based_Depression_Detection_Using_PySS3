I want to tell you a story.When I was 20 I tried to kill myself.

I was in love, and she left. When she left, I left. Started fighting. Wanted to bleed. Started drinking. Eventually after months of drugs and,  and, I dont even know what... I gave up. 

I was at home, visiting my parents home. They were at work. I was mad. It was finally the day. I walked to the driveway and covered myself with gasoline, sat down and sparked my zippo. Fucking nothing happened. I was so fucking pissed. I tried a hundred times. By the time I finally gave up I was sobbing. I called my dad. I told him that I needed help. He said he was in a meeting. I knew then that no one would help me. I had to help myself. I took a shower, then I went to the doctor. 
He gave me some pills I never took (no judgement on medication often it is the right answer) and I got a referral to a Therapist.

I cannot overstate the importance of therapy. I was still suicidal for years. Even today I smoke. 

Everyday you must find a new reason to live. I Promise you, there is always a reason. One day it was a tree, with pretty flowers on it. I am happy that I got to see it. Seriously this motherfucker was MADE of flowers. The whole fucking tree! One day I saved a hummingbird. Broken wing stuck in a crack on the sidewalk. I found it. It flew away a week later. One day I had shared a six pack with a homeless guy. One day I called 911 after a car accident. There is always a reason. The trick is getting out of bed and looking for it. 

I am a survivor, and one day you will be too. 

P.S 

I will always respond to PMs. 

EDIT: For the spells.
