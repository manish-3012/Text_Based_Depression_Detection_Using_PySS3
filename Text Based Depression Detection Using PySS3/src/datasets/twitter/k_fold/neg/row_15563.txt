Everything in my life seems like itâ€™s going perfectly, but I still cry myself to sleepThe only person in my life that knows the scale of my depression is my â€œfriendâ€ but we donâ€™t talk anymore. To be honest, she kind of made me feel like shit. I donâ€™t have many friends, mostly internet ones but lately Iâ€™m getting too tired to even join those groups again and talk to them. I talk to this one really good guy online and heâ€™s honestly what keeps me going. 

But god, Iâ€™m going away to college next week and I just want to end it all. I donâ€™t want to stay home. God I donâ€™t want to stay home. If my parents knew the full extent of â€œwho I wasâ€ aka not straight they would hate me. Theyâ€™re loving parents and hell, I just watched a movie with my mom a few hours ago. It was great and we laughed and joked, but I know she would hate me and disown me like my father. Iâ€™m just sitting in bed crying and venting everything. 

When I was younger about 11 I used to self harm a lot and honestly Iâ€™m contemplating it again. I donâ€™t know why I do it, everything in my life seems perfect. Honestly it seems to me like Iâ€™m a whiny spoiled bitch. I hate myself so much when I look in a mirror I have a hard time believing itâ€™s myself. Iâ€™m overweight and have been my entire life, but I canâ€™t muster up any motivation to do anything about it. Iâ€™m fat, ugly, and I know Iâ€™m going to stay that way for the rest of my life. I have hopes and dreams, but when I think of it more and more I know itâ€™s bullshit. I know Iâ€™m going to amount to nothing and probably kill myself before 20. The only thing stopping me is my parents being sad, but maybe if I actually wrote a letter explaining why they wouldnâ€™t care. I hope not
