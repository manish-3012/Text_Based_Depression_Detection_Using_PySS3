I'm done. The world is ending. Goodbye.I want to kill myself in a few days, as soon as I find a good way to do it.

Let's face something: it's the end of the world. At least the world as we know it. 

Society is going to collapse, businesses will fail, people are desperate to go outside and end the quarantine because if nothing happens they are not going to have money to put food on the table and they will die of starvation. But we all know that if we just end the quarantine, the death toll will be horrific. I see it with my friends my family. My family could be in poverty by the end of this year.

Even if we were to take all the resources from the "rich people" we'd quickly run out, and society would eternally be damaged, there would no longer be any reasons for many people to try to succeed again when people feel they'll just have it all taken away if another pandemic ever happens.

In my home country, I am hearing reports from my own family of bodies piling up in the streets

I'm know this is a whole lot of 'society' talk, but the point i am trying to make is that **THIS IS DOOMSDAY. LIFE WILL NEVER. EVER.** ***EVER*****. BE THE SAME**

So the question is? Why don't we kill ourselves? It's going to happen anyways. And the bullshit excuse of "oh well there are nice things on the way", we don't even know if this pandemic is going to fully go away, it might become seasonal.

I wanted to have a road trip. It's been a big dream of mine lately to save up money to go drive to the grand canyon, now I'm too afraid to even leave the house, I was already a germaphobe, now this potentially unkillable, seasonal virus basically made life so that i'm bound to this house forever, and that's the GOOD outcome, the alternative is dying from coughing on the streets.

You fuckers lied to me. You told me that everything is going to be okay, that life was great. but guess what, we're always 3 meals from starving.

Why SHOULD I try to do this anymore? I don't wanna. I wanna just die NOW. NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW. I dont want this fucking virus to kill me, at least give the fucking dignity to do it right now.

There is no light at the end of the tunnel. there is no normal anymore. it's all fucked.
