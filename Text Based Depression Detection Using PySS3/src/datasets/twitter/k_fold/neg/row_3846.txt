The time is comingItâ€™s going to happen, and Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s going to be soon. 
My mother just told me to fuck off out of her life permanently and never to come back. The person I lived for after my last suicide attempt. The only reason I agreed to go to the hospital after my father found me. The only reason I pushed to survive when I was in ICU. The lady who told me god was punishing her for me being gay, and looked me dead in the eye and told me â€œI have to blame god or you for all the terrible things thatâ€™s happened in my lifeâ€. I tried, so god damn hard to get through this mental illness. Iâ€™ve tried for 9 years and Iâ€™m no fucking further ahead than I was when I started. I want the darkness to take me. I want this to be over.  And if I go to hell like my mother says, I hope I suffer in the darkest pit there is, because even that couldnâ€™t be as bad as what Iâ€™m experiencing now.
