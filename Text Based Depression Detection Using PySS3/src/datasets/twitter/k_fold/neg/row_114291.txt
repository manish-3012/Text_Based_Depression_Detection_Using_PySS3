ropethere's a rope that hangs from my schools recreation center that looks so alluring and beautiful. it hangs from the rock climbing section and it's always there and i see it every time i pass to go to the locker rooms. it's a bright orange nylon and it looks smooth but sturdy at the same time. the rock wall is three stories tall and beside it is a second story balcony with a guard rail. the rope hangs past it and it's able to be grasped from the second story. how easy it would it be to grab a hold of it, wrap the fibers around my neck, and jump. how easy and painless would it be. how beautiful would the sensation be of breathlessness. since the day of birth my lungs have always had the task of drawing in air for me. how amazing would the feeling be of not having to breathe anymore, giving my lungs its long due rest. how light would i feel hanging up there. how lifeless and numb would i feel to everything. no more pain. no more suffering. no more thoughts. no more talking. just complete silence. how beautiful would it be.
