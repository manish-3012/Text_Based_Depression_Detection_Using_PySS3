I don't know what to do with myself anymoreI don't know why i hate being alive so much, i know i have a decent life but i just dont want it. Its all just too much. I have my family...and a decent job. But i have virtually no life, my girlfriend is 3000 miles away, and i feel like i don't have any friends anymore. It feels like everyone is passing me by and im still here. Still the same worthless waste of air. Still wasting everyone's time. I'm just a burden anyways.... I just wanna go to sleep any never wake up. That would be really nice...
