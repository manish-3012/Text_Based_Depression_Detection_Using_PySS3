Would love if someone could shine meaning into all thisI am completely drowning financially. I'm actually hopelessly poor. Every day I go to work and work nine hours, then I clock out and sign in to Uber to do another three or four. That's 12 hours a day and I'm still barely making ends meet. The only time I'm home and not dead tired is on my days off from my actual job and I only Uber 3-4 hours. Then I just sit there like a vegetable unsure what to do with myself off the clock. I'm just a drone at this point, I experience almost no joy. I dream of being able to find a higher paying job with less hours and having all this free time to get lost in some hobby or something, but I don't even know what that would be. I haven't been blessed with any sort of creativity so I can't write or anything, and I'm terrible with my hands. My stepdad always told me all I do is fuck everything up, and now I believe him because I have peers tell me the same thing. I'm lost and suicide feels like the only way out, I can't escape. There is never a silver lining, there is never any hope.
