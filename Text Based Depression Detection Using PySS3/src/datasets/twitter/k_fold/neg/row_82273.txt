ER Update: FinalI just got out of the ER. I spoke with a crisis worker and she said I am in a very abusive situation at home right now. She's setting me up with someone from the COT program (Community Outreach Team) to help with medications, doctors, and housing as well as general support. I have my first meeting on Thursday at 1 PM.
