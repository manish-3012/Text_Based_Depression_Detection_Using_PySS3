Need someone to talk to.I've been depressed and suicidal for so long. I feel like I'm almost to the point of no return. Friends and family don't want to hear about it. I can't wait for a doctor, that takes weeks. If anyone has some time today to just chat and talk about what I'm going through. I would appreciate it. Thanks.
