Can't stop thinking about itI have manic depression and every single day I just think up ways of how to kill myself and can't stop, I'll be by the bus stop and have the urge to throw myself under, almost like the devil and angel on my shoulders type thing, one telling me that its painless, it will take seconds and you'll be out of your misery for good, you'll be free, I'm failing college, my parents have high expectations and put pressure on me every single day, I hate myself and just want out. I hate it so much, I just want to be normal.

Please, I need help.
