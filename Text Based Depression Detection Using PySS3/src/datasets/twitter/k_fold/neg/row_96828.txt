Hello thereI will absolutely die from suicide. I do not know when, probably not terribly soon. I hate being silly and dramatic.

&amp;#x200B;

I have done nothing remarkable. I find no interest in the future. It seems I only live to feel pain and occasionally relaxed. Everything is exhausting. Maintaining relationships, addiction to self harm, different medicines over and over, new illnesses, more expectations.

&amp;#x200B;

I've settled for cheap emotions. I want to feel something powerful, but I know I never will. Moments only exist in dreams and I doubt I will live them out.

&amp;#x200B;

I think I'll kill myself soon. I have the rope. I've been suicidal my entire adolescence. I can't do anything anymore. I see nothing in life. Music is cool I guess. This was quite silly and dramatic. I don't feel like myself. Isn't it weird how things just happen? One day you're super confident and the next you hate yourself for seemingly no reason.

&amp;#x200B;

I hate being alive and silliness and melodrama but this note was quite garbage.

&amp;#x200B;

I hope someone reads this. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hope people take me seriously when I say this. I am quite quite certain I will hang myself. 

&amp;#x200B;

I hate myself.

I'm weak and one day I won't be able to take it. Often I get through it but life only seems to get worse.
