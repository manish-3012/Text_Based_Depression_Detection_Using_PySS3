I'm nearing the end of my line, and I see no way out of my grave.I've never really had it easy in life.  
Pretty much everything that could go horrible, actually went horrible.  

After two decades of loneliness, abuse, neglect, and pretty much the shittiest of humanity, I'm left with a set of issues that only amplify themselves.  
Got social anxiety so severe, I can't even leave my room to go to the toilet or kitchen because I'm afraid of my flatmates.  
My depression has pretty much brought me to rock bottom a year ago and I've fighting for my sanity almost every day since.  
I've got absolutely no friend, nobody I can trust or confide in.  
I'm fat, ugly, nobody likes me. Never even kissed a girl in my life. I held hands with two girls so far in my life, once as a joke and once as a sort of trust exercise.  

I see no way out, short of an actual miracle.  
I've dug my own grave and I'm going to be buried in it some day.
