I just feel like if I died tomorrow, no one would careHi, a little bit about myself. 21 years old, never had a significant other, have zero friends, have a useless associates degree and been unemployed for who the fuck knows how long. Been suffering from depression and social anxiety for as long as I can remember, too. 

After finishing up my shitty associates degree at a community college I decided to take a break from school and since then I haven't been able to find shit for work. I apply to places from time to time but unfortunately nothing is interesting about me so I never get responses from employers. All I've been doing since finishing community college is just sitting in my room all day playing video games and being useless and talking to no one for the most part due to the fact that I don't have a single friend. Being rejected all my life has just made me lose motivation in everything and nothing feels enjoyable anymore, even the video games that I play throughout the day. I don't exactly feel suicidal at the moment but I really do feel like if I died tomorrow then there wouldn't be a single fuck given in the world because of how useless and shitty of a person I am. I just don't know what to do with myself anymore, anything I attempt to do results in failure and all I want is to just be accepted for once in my life.
