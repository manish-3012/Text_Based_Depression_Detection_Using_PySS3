I wish it was easierI wish suicide was easier. I try cutting but itâ€™s never deep enough. Most of the sharp things I have have been taken away from me now. I have tried choking myself but itâ€™s really painful and I clearly havenâ€™t succeeded. I want to just inhale co2 but I donâ€™t have a garage. Want to put a pipe from my car exhaust into the window but not sure if that would work. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried everything. I wish I had a gun but Iâ€™m not eligible to get one lol shocking. Man I hate living every day
