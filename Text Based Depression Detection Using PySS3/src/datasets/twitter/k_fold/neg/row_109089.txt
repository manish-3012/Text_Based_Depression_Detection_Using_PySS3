I don't feel like have anything worth living for anymore.I dropped out of high school in the last few weeks of school in 2014, since then I've gotten extremely motivated to make it to college. I enrolled at a community college and lived at home for 3 years. It was absolute hell. I hate the city I lived in, I felt trapped in my parents house, I hated my life for a solid 3 incredibly lonely years. This last august I finally did it. I accomplished my goal and I made it to a real university. I finally have my own space, I've made a few friends for the first time, and I even got a tiny bit attention from girls, which is completely foreign concept to me. First semester I didn't realize how hard it would be to adjust to this new life and I failed a class and got myself put on academic probation. Now I'm certain that I did not meet the minimum GPA requirement and I will now be dismissed at the end of the semester. My only saving grace is to retake classes in the summer, but I've now lost my financial aid and I won't be able to pay for them. I will also be losing my apartment, which has become my home. I love my apartment. My world is falling apart and I'm going to lose everything I worked so hard for. The thought of packing this all up and moving back home is making me feel suicidal. I've been awake  for several days and I've only eaten a couple of times this week. I feel sick all the time and I have no appetite. I'm trying so desperately to pass my finals. I'm so angry at what I've done to myself. I suffered so much to get here and now I just pissed it all away like it was nothing. I finally made some actual, real, human contact with other people and have a little bit of a social life for the first time, and I going to lose it all. Everything I have in the world is going to be taken away from me and it's my fault. I'm just a fucking stupid social retard and a habitual failure, I'm a fuck up just like everyone told me from childhood. I don't want to live anymore, I just want to die if I can't have this anymore. I hate myself, and I can't go back to my personal hell again. I can't face this and I truly don't want to wake up anymore. My life has been so lonely and terrible and this short time at my school has been the best of my life. I know how bad killing yourself hurts the people around you, but I just feel so defeated. I don't want to be here anymore, it's not worth it to me now.
