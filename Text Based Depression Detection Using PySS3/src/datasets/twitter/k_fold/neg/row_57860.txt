I DONT want to kill myself, but I'm fed up and depressed. Does that make sense?Hi ive been getting depressed because im lonely irl and have been the past 1.5 years. I meet up with friends but only occassionally and am very awkward at work..im seen as the weird quiet guy. This fucking sucks, like it sucks to be a young person yet so quiet/mature and unable to build any rapport with peopleI dont know what to do to get more friends at work people seem to not really listen to me when i try to make an effort i  group convos. Im 20 and male. Im still a virgin although average face/good body and i think its my lack of social circles etc. Its my 21st on Monday and I have no one to really celebrate it with. I just get scared a lot in social situations but because im a man im meant to be tough confident and stoic. I go to the gym and do boxing but certain social situations i feel like im having a heart attack. I have a  good job and everything else is fine except my social life but i feel i have no one to enjoy life with. i dont even know if posting here will help because how much can sympathy help? For 5 mins?. I know im not alone or unique in any way but i just feel like becoming a hermit. I dont want to, i want to make friends with people, but i have a lot of social awkwardness and anxiety i dont even know how friendship works yet properly. It just sucks i have to pretend i am a different person to who i really am because if my friends/colleagues saw who i really am they would see how lonely i am. I even started cuddling one of my male friends when drunk because iam so in need of companio snship  . I am Christian(not strict but believe god is on my side) but its getti ng hard for me.
