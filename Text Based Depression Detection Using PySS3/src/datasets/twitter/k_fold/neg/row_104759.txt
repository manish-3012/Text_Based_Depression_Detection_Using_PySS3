Untitled Not FinishedPost suicide on social media

Won't find my death on Wikipedia

In public view so just stay tuned

If this is the world we all doomed


I'm not going to be really famous

The problems do you blame us

All the sandals of what I did

How can I explain I'm just a kid


And I can't say what I think of you

But there is no telling what you do

I just keep my thoughts until my grave

And then hell I'm the one God can't save


I gave up on ever deciding my mind

Hide behind these eyes that are kind

You never know or understand

That behind my eye I'm an angry man


Broken and dead I'm out of order

I react when you cry on my shoulder

In a way I think I should I'm apathetic

So was my dad I must be genetic


What does the razor say

â€œI could end it todayâ€


What would this bullet do

â€œI will put an end to youâ€


I took a mouthful of pills

I started to get the chills


Sitting in a circle of suicide

How will it end, What will I decide

Guns, razors, pills and a rope

They talk to me I'm out of hope
