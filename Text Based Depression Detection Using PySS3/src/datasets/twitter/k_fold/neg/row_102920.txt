I am a failure and additionaly I'm scared of killing myslefI do aplogise for this post but I feel as if I have noone to talk to.

Even though I feel like my life is chaotic, I also belive that other people have more difficult and complicated lives than me

I deal with a variety of mental issuses and I'm really trying to better myself; I have the help of the best psychiatrist in my town but im just tired of everything. I don't have friends, I self injure, I am a fucking junkie with no money to my name, I couldn't finish my BA thesis and I can't stop crying today.

About an hour ago I had an argument with my\[F\] partner\[M\]. Long story short, because I really cannot present events objectively, after our meeting a few mean messages were exchanges. I broke down and from bottom of my heart I wrote him that I really want to hurt myslef but I'm too afraid in case he cares about me and I don't want to die with the belief that he does not. 

He has not responded yet, I'm scared of calling or writing to him more, I don't want to make him angry or something. I just feel worse than usually. I'm sorry that you've read all this chaotic post.
