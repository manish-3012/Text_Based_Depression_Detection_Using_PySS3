Finally taking that final step tomorrowI've been contemplating it for years, never had the means or the guts. Now that I enlisted (not us, not that that matters) I have my very own rifle, and 145 bullets ought to do the job. This military training is breaking me to pieces, never being home, being treated like a piece of garbage. I can't take it anymore. Everyone is saying it gets better. and i kinda know it does, I know it's just the training and that it'll be over in about half a year. But i can't survive that long. I also see no reason not to. Nothing means anything to me anymore. If i get to go home for the weekend, i just dread sunday the entire time. And if I somehow manage to enjoy myself for a short while, it's all over in a hearbeat anyway. Fun is temporary, expiriences don't matter, they pass and leave behind a bitter memory of better times. My SO doesn't deserve being treated like that, me being able to talk to her half an hour a day and all.
I can't handle 17 hours a day with no time for myself, even meals are stressful since everything is timed and we run everywhere. I don't feel like a human being anymore. Just a shell of who i used to be, a disapointment to everyone i know. Why am i so weak? Why am i the only one who can't handle this. I've had this empty look on my face for the past 2 months, and I can't shake it off, I can't trudge through it, I can just give up.
 So tomorrow when i get back there, and get my rifle and my ammo, it'll all be over in a heartbeat.
