Feeling like it's too lateI'm 22, dropped out of high school in 2011 and haven't done anything since. Never got a job anywhere, never had any intentions of going to school. I chose to do nothing and rot away in isolation instead. I spent my birthday alone just earlier this month as well. 

I've read about disconnected youth. I feel that it fits me to a T. I feel I've fucked my future already by doing absolutely nothing and being a hermit instead. I'll talk to people and they'll say, "well, you're young. You'll figure it out." I don't really have any kind of passion or ambition, though. I thought about seeing a therapist, but I just feel like I'll tell them what I've said here and they'll say the same thing else everyone else has been saying. It's fruitless. I intend on hanging myself this Halloween. I'd hate to devastate my family, but everyone in my life should see it coming anyway.
