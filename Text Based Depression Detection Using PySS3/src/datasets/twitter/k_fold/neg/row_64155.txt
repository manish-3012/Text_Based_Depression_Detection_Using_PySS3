Iâ€™ve given up.I broke down and cut for the first time in around a month. I hacked into myself with no holding back. Iâ€™m disappointed it wasnâ€™t deep enough. My life has gone to shit and Iâ€™m ready to end it. People donâ€™t care how youâ€™re rotting away from the inside out until it starts to negatively affect them. Everyone just turns their head the other way when youâ€™re being hurt by others against your will, but when you decide to hurt yourself off your own decision everybody will lose their fucking minds. I guarantee it. I canâ€™t handle my family only treating me like a human when they need something. The only thing for me to look forward right now is the huge ass party the world will throw when I can manage to lodge the boxcutter deep enough into an important vein. For this moment, Iâ€™m gonna try to favor my left arm because the right one is really sore right now.
