An open letter of the courage I found on the other side. I hope this helps &lt;3Hi everyone! 

Iâ€™ve been doing my best to avoid all forms of social media because of everything going on but in the midst of it all, Iâ€™ve found clarity. I would like to share my story.

I am a survivor of attempted suicide and Iâ€™m speaking as an advocate for mental health. Something I think we all could really benefit from right now.

In 2016 I lost my best friend, my mother. Anyone who has lost a parent knows the pain and anguish that it brings. My world fell apart and all my goals and aspirations ceased to have any meaning. My entire life, all I wanted was to care for my mom in her old age so that I can repay her for making me the man I am today.

For 3 years I felt unbearable pain and hid behind social media posts of normalcy and forced smiles. I shared my success stories with others to avoid suspicion. I felt void and empty of all feelings and there was a darkness that clouded my mind and eventually manifested physically.

I would be at work and without any warning, I would suddenly lose my vision and feel my heart racing uncontrollably. I became more concerned when it happened once during my drive home from work. I learned later that these were panic attacks caused by severe anxiety. It was crippling and so difficult to live a normal day to day life. In suppressing my grief and all my traumas in life, something bubbled up to the surface and started showing itself. 

Fast forward a few months and everything that I knew was falling apart. There I was sitting in a dingy room in Alhambra, California. It was a mental hospital. I was sent there from Cedar Sinai after people reported to the police of a huge disturbance in the home of the person who I now call my saving grace. 

I canâ€™t quite recall every detail but I know that the pain I felt was unbearable and in my mind, there was only one way out. I spent a lot of time in that hospital.

Oddly enough, my experience since then has been nothing but a positive upward climb, though I could not have done it without the help of mental help professionals and my partner whom I love so much. Iâ€™ve done an immense amount of work on myself and where there was once a darkness to escape, is now a beacon of hope for a better life for myself and the two most important things in my life, my boyfriend and my dog.

Unfortunately, in the process, I consistently face challenges with the people I choose to surround myself with. I want to fill my life with positive people whom I love and those who have the same outlook on life as me. In the past and up until this point, I have been made to feel by family that through illusion of cultural lenses these things must stay hidden. Because of this, Iâ€™m experiencing how painful it is to sever the ties from those that make me revert to my negative thinking self.

Until recently, I felt so ashamed of my suicide attempt and told myself that I would never speak of it. But Iâ€™ve realized that I can never truly heal unless I rid my shame of what my depression actually was.

My depression was a result of chemicals in my brain that made me really really sad and because I didnâ€™t know how to deal with it, it manifested physically and made me temporarily lose my grasp on the value of life. Simple right? Lol.

Because of this I learned a VERY important lesson. You canâ€™t use your traumas as a reason to be a shitty human being. 

This pandemic is horrific and has taken so many lives but the one silver lining I see is that it is giving everyone a chance to show their true selves at their core. Because of this Iâ€™m learning that the only relationships that truly matter are the ones that make you feel like you want to live a long and happy life.

There is a wave of change happening in our social climate. I have learned from my LGBTQ community that sometimes chosen family is all you need in life. Iâ€™ve learned from the powerful black men and women of this nation that justice can prevail if you make some noise. We need more defiance so that people can actually listen to what is truly important.

If youâ€™re still reading, I implore you to really look inside yourself and decide how you want to live the next few years. The world is not going to be back to normal anytime soon and time is too precious for you not to be kind to others and love one another.

Like seriously.. itâ€™s not that hard.

Eric.
