I think I'm losing my mental health even more. I wrote a wall of text here then delete it afterwards cuz who the f wants to read an essay about how depressed and suicidal a stranger is.
 Long story short I got aspergers and dealt with lots of issues and had severe depression for almost all of my life but I somehow survived all of them. I've always had a perfect academic career and got in one of the best architecture schools in Europe but I live in a country with really shitty economy so I had to leave college and that's was the last drop for me. I've been really suicidal before but non of them was like that, I'm losing the control of my body, laughing and crying for hours then pass out. Usually after I wake up i got fresh wounds without having any clue about where they came from. I got no goals, I got nothing to do. I'm just floating in an endless void and feel like my room is purgatory. I can't take it anymore. I don't even know why I'm posting here but I thinj there's still a little hope left inside me thinking that someone can somehow help me. Sorry for wasting your time.
