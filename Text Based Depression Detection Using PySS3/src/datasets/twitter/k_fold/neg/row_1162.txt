Everything happening around me has been taking a toll on my health. My immune system isnâ€™t what it used to be and my mental health is deteriorating.I know my problem is stupid but Iâ€™ve already obsessively stressed about prom for nearly three years. My anxiety never improved but only worsened. My prom is in February and I donâ€™t want to go, but I canâ€™t ditch it since itâ€™s part of my grade. I just want to die, or escape. I canâ€™t do this. But if I donâ€™t go, Iâ€™ll probably regret it. If I do go, things may go terribly wrong and Iâ€™ll be humiliated and I may never regain my dignity again (like I even had it). No one understands the reason for my opinion. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
