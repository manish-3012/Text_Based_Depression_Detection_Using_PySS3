I am in limbo, and I have no one in my life that loves me...Throw Away for obvious reasons.

I fear that I won't get the advice that may help due to my actions and choices that I have made after my girlfriend cheated on me. 

Long story short, I have never been able to motivate myself, and a part of my relationships motivate me to wake up in the morning or go to work, or be happy because I let them so far in, so close, because that's what I need. But when they leave, I am empty with no ability to push myself, and a crippling loneliness and sadness that my anxiety history doesn't help, making me feel so terrified and alone... 


I haven't eaten in 5 days, and I have only been able to start drinking water again the last 2. Noting with my last relationship has been cleared up or settled, and I'm waiting for a call today that never happened to figure out what is going to happen. It is stressful being on top of this debilitating feeling I get. 

I think I need people to talk to, but what I honestly need is some one to love me... Something that would take so much time to find again... Talked to the local hotline, they helped, but I can't keep bugging them... 

I'm not going to kill myself, I don't think, but I have tried in the past, and unfortunately, once an option, always an option in my brain, even though I hope it never comes to that.
