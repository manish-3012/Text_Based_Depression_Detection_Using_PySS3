I guess this is it.I wasn't planning on making a post in here, but I guess I've changed my mind.

This is something I've been planning for over 2 mths now. Ever since my previous attempt, which I miraculously recovered from (and never told anyone about). A few close friends and family members know I'm depressed, but that's it. None of them know it has reached this point. None of them seem particularly worried.

I feel like a bit of a coward, i'll admit. It's not like anything traumatic has happened to make me this way. There's nothing too wrong with my life. But, I'm just so tired. And so lonely. And so afraid...of the future in particular. I know where it's headed, and it's not one I want.

There really wasn't much point in posting this, I'm unlikely to change my mind. Some of you are likely to be frustrated that I'm joining the ranks of others on here who make meaningless, dramatic "it's all over" type posts. And I understand that. I just felt like I needed to say something, to someone. Let someone out there know where I'm at, since nobody who knows me personally does. They're going to be devastated. I feel guilty as hell.
