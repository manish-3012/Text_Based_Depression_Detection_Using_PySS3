I fail at breathingI don't have anything saved for retirement. I have no skills or career path. I have failed at everything I've ever done. I spill milk when I try to pour it. I somehow saved up for a few years and put thousands of dollars into stocks in hopes that I was going to help my family out. I was proud of myself for doing it because it's not easy for me to do. Except every stock I have chosen has failed (not penny stocks). I'm now down 34% and thinking about suicide daily. I just can't take being a failure every single day... day after day. Every time I wake up I feel so depressed. Every day is a bad day and I just want the pain to stop.
