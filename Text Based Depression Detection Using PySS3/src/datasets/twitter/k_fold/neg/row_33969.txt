Breaking point for meSee before this lockdown my emotions and wanting to stay alive was great especially feeling positive everyday. But throughout this lockdown I'm having so much difficulties everyday, I hardly want to get up in the mornings, I tend to sleep at different times of the day, I prefer each day to be over , I'm not even talking about my issues with my family, I'm even down on myself too. Throughout my life I've had issues relation to mental health especially wanting to give up on life . I just don't know who to turn to for help.
