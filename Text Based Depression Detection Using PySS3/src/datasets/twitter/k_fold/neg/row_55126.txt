Just a questionI am new to the subreddit, and I am here to ask a question.

Why do suicidal people feel like death is the only solution?
I know the reasons like losing someone important, having depression, e.t.c, but I mean why people go for death?

In my opinion, some say that all the pain, suffering, humliation, e.t.c will end when they commit suicide. I want you i.e suicidal to answer me this: how do you know about this? Do you have any evidence that after death you will feel better or will it end your suffering? I always remain curious about what happens after death, IF anything happens. Sometimes, I think that it may end suffering, while other times, instead of minimizing pain or suffering, it may worsen it. I sometimes even theorize what will happen after death, such as reincarnation or if we happen to wake up in some sort of "dream" i.e life, and go a different cycle of life.

If you have no evidence of what will happen after death, then don't try to commit suicide and value your life.
