No where to turnWhere do you go when there is no you can talk to? With a mother with an overburdened heart (literally), a cheating girlfriend to whom I can't say no and a group of friends whose links to me are as strong as a dead leaf on a tree. I can't scream lest I call down an avalanche on those I care about. [The father is absent btw]. A failure of college from depression and addiction, and my mind rotted from its one sharp intellect.  The only thing that remains is a husk of who I could have been, who I should have been. I don't long for this world any longer and satisfaction finds its strongest root in the tearing emptiness I feel being vanquished. So this is goodbye, the pills have been taken. It is only a matter of time. I'm sorry I couldn't have been stronger.
