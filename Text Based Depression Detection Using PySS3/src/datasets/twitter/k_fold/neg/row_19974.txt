I lost the only person who supported me.So about 6 months ago me and my girlfriend break up. Recently in the past month we have been trying things out again and she seems to really enjoy the changes I made but I don't believe that anymore. She's talking to multiple other guys and going on multiple dates a week with our daughter at the house. She's the only person who ever sat down and listened and she is the only person who was there when I cried, laughed, sang. We used to do everything together and now she's of running around. She told me she isn't sure about us and seems really torn though between getting back together and being with someone else. She always tells me she doesn't want to be with anyone else but idk what to believe.

 I really want to get her back but I feel she's lost in her own world now. My daughter suffers because her mom is glued to her phone talking to multiple guys all the time and not taking full care of her.

 I lost the one person I realized cared for me and she was the only person I could talk to in my life and now she ghosts me and sometimes doesn't respond when I ask to come pick my kid up. I'd do anything to get her back but idk if it's the right thing for her or me but I've been thinking of going upstairs and blowing my brains out. She was my only friend and my greatest love and the only person that was there for me in my life.
