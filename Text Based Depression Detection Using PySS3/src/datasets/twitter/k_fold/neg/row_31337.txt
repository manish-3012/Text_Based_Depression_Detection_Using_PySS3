Why do I always have to be the strong one for everyone else? Why canâ€™t anyone be strong for me?Thereâ€™s just so much shit thatâ€™s gone wrong in the past week. April as a whole is a terrible month. On Easter, my dad was drinking and yelling and trying to fight every one of our family members. Theyâ€™re deciding within the next few days if heâ€™s going to jail or not for wrecking his car when he blacked out, trying to fucking kill him self. 
&gt;
Tomorrow is the 1 year death anniversary of one of my dear friends since middle school. Itâ€™s been a year and I still canâ€™t handle it well. She shot herself on impulse. 
&gt;
The sky is always fucking grey. 
&gt;
I havenâ€™t been sleeping. 
&gt;
I have no friends to hang out with. 
&gt;
I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing with my future. I donâ€™t want to do anything. I just want to be dead. Iâ€™m sick of being â€œstrongâ€ for my loved ones when they donâ€™t even do it for me. I understand my dad is really sick and has severe issues, and my boyfriend has a lot of trauma, and that my â€˜friendsâ€™ are always busy, and that itâ€™s April so itâ€™s gunna rain a lot, and most people donâ€™t know what theyâ€™re going to do with their life. But I canâ€™t live like this. Why do I have to be the strong one for all of them? 
&gt;
I feel worthless. Ugly. Stupid. A humiliating thing to be around. I feel like I donâ€™t come first in anyoneâ€™s life except my momâ€™s. People are only nice because Iâ€™m ugly and stupid, so they pity me. Why canâ€™t I just fucking be dead?
