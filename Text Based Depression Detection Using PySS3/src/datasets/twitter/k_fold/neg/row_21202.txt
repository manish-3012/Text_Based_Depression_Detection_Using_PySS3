UK police, 'swatting' over suicide tip?I am not suicidal, however there is a real possibility that somebody is going to attempt to 'swat' me (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting) by contacting my local police force &amp; telling them that I intend to kill myself.

Does anybody have any knowledge how seriously UK police respond to such tip offs?
