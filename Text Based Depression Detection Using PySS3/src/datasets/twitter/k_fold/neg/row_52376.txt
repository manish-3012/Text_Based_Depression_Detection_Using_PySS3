I have everything yet I want to die everyday. I can't commit suicide though, but I literally get jealous of people with terminal illnesses. I've seen therapists and they've helped a bunch but I can't help thinking life isn't worth living. Ps, I'm a high functioning depressed person hence many people don't know how I feel everyday.
