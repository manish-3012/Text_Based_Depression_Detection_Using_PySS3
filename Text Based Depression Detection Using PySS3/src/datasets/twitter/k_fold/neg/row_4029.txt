I am not meant to live.I got laid off, the room Iâ€™m in has no heat, started snowing so itâ€™s cold as balls, I had a breakdown over my ex and just my life in general. I havenâ€™t eaten all day, donâ€™t really have the energy to leave my bed. Not even food to eat even if I wanted to. Iâ€™m tired. I feel absolutely nothing. Iâ€™ve lived a bit over 7,000 days and the average live span is 22,000. I have nothing. I am not meant to have anything. I lost everything. Is it even worth it? I can simply just - walk out. No one will stop me. Itâ€™s snowing so I can maybe freeze. Or I can take the extension cord and just hang.
