I don't want to go on...I'm a 15 y/o school student who has been experiencing suicidal thoughts since I was 10. Despite doing well at school and in music, I still feel like a disappointment due to several bad behavioural tendencies, such as a short and violent temper. I have a lot of issues with anxiety due to constant bullying, and a lot of the time I feel like I have no worth.

I have tried to get help in the past, but it hasn't worked, and any time I've mentioned wanting to kill or harm myself to my parents they've gotten angry and called me stupid. I feel like I cannot get any form of help, due to an ingrained paranoia that something will go horribly wrong.

I have tried cutting myself, but have always been to weak to do it, which doesn't help matters either.

So, long story short, I feel ready to end it all. But I feel so conflicted, as people keep trying to show me the good in my life but I just throw it off, or they threaten to replicate it if I do kill myself.

I don't know what to do anymore...
