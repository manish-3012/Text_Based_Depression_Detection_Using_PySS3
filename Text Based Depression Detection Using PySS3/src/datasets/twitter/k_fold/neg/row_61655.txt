I just want to feel lovedI'm 20 years old girl with a very ugly face and social anxiety.
Feeling depressed since I was 10 years old.
Just a burden to my family my only friend said that I'm pathetic and coward had an abussive boyfriend who didn't cared about me at all.
Dealed with a lot of bullying in my childhood at school people always told me how ugly fat and stupid I am. Once a girl told me nobody would ever love me and maybe she was right.
But why should I live like this being lonely and depressed all day having nobody that cares  what's the point if I never get what I always wanted in life: to have somebody that loves me for who I am. Maybe I don't deserve this but then I don't want to live anymore.
