nothing feels good :/Heâ€™s been talking down on me ever since I can remember. I think itâ€™s starting to get to me more because Iâ€™m seventeen now and I understand things more. He always tells me Iâ€™ll be nothing in life and that Iâ€™m dumb as shit. Sometimes hits me too. Itâ€™s not even because Iâ€™ve done anything wrong, anything I do pretty much triggers him then he goes off. What a fkn asshole. Wish I could kill him or myself god.

Me and my girlfriend of nearly three years just recently split too and Iâ€™m leaving the school I was in for 7 years because I just failed all my exams and I have to be in a new school. Iâ€™m gonna be leaving all the friends I have behind and Iâ€™m anxious as shit to meet the new students and how theyâ€™ll treat me. 

My dad beat the shit outta me for failing every single subject and he told me I should kill my self because Iâ€™m worthless. This is just one of the many things he does. If he doesnâ€™t like the way I dress he beats me up and calls me all types of things. Same with if I accidentally stutter while talking to someone or if I have mood swings. I tried explaining teenagers have mood swings and itâ€™s normal but he doesnâ€™t care all he does it â€œnO sToP gIvInG mE aTtItUdEâ€ 

Anyways I just needed to vent to someone thank u
