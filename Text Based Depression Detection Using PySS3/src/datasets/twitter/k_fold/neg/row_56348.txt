Please just say something.I've been depressed for awhile, and I have no reason to be. I'm engaged, I have a good job, and without me even realizing, I'm mean to people. I hate that. It keeps happening. I can't change it. I just upset most people I come in contact with and I'm worried that my fiancÃ© could honestly do so much better if I wasn't here.

I don't have anyone to talk to, that's why I'm here. Just- something? I don't know, anything. Please.
