My birthday is this coming month and it will be my lastI am done living, come the 20th of this month I am done. it is my bday and I am going to end it and no one can stop me.

I am 37 and have PTSD and severe social anxiety and severe chronic depression. no I did not serve in the military. I am on disability and unable to work because of my mental issues.

I have no family, no friends, no one. I am literally alone in this world and spent the past several years trying to find a good woman to get to know and date but none want me and none will give me a chance because I am obese.

I am just done. I can't take living life anymore and can't take being alive anymore especially being single and alone and lonely. I was going to give it till I hit 40 but I can't make another two years. This year is it. I am done and there is no turning back.

I am going to spend what little time I have left just sleeping and sleeping and sleeping until that day gets here then going to get very drunk and end my life. I can't take this crippling loneliness anymore and not having a life companion to build a life with and to love and to be loved. I can't take being alone anymore.

Goodbye.

Sidenote I made this post to say goodbye because I have no one else to say goodbye to. I did not post this to find someone to talk to.
