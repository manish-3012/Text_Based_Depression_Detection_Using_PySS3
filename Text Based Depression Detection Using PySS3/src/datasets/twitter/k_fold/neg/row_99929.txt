it's time, but it's terrifyingEvery time I get close to the point of no return, I suddenly think, "I don't want to die." So then I start crying and pull back, and then I remember all the reasons I don't want to live. I don't want to die or live. The pain of living will last longer and ultimately be worse, but dying is so hard.

The reason I am suicidal is because of losing my job and then doing all sorts of terrible things, which I will not bother to enumerate, during a state of bipolar mania with psychosis. Suffice it to say that the things I did, although not criminal, were extremely destructive to my own interests and those of my loved ones, and cannot be undone. Thinking it over this evening, if I heard that anyone else did such things, I would probably assume they were headed for suicide, because it was clearly a mortal blow. There is no way to fix all the problems I caused and salvage a life that would be bearable. The things that are holding me back are pain, fear of death, and pity for the horror it will cause my family and pets. Even so, I still don't feel like there are other viable options left to me in life. I am naturally a pretty optimistic person, but I literally can't think of any way I could improve things. I am tired of feeling sorry for myself and should just get on with it. Thank you for reading this.
