Lost it allHere's my humdrum tale reddit: I've never really had many friends 2-3 at a time tops; two years ago I fell for one of them, we started dating, I fell in love. Head over Heels. She made me love more than I'd thought possible, she showed me a future together that made the whole world just seem right. We talked about marriage. I had a ring picked out, $3,000 saved I was going to propose my ass off to that girl. Two days ago I found out she's been sleeping with someone I'd considered a friend. Someone I trusted almost as completely as I trusted her. Everything was shattered. I don't have anybody left to turn to. I honestly just don't see the point of fighting it anymore.
