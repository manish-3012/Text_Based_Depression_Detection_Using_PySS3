Why dont you try to get help?Obviously this question is only directed to those of you who didn't try to treat their depression. Why? I think suicide is a tragic thing, its mind boggling how someone can be so sad that even the deepest urge, the strongest directive, to survive is disregarded. Its tragic for whoever experiences such feeling.
So while I don't support suicide I can understand why someone would want it, I had depression once, nothing like you guys have but I was in a terrible state for about 2 years, infact for 2 months in those 2 years I didn't even leave my home.

But there are some of you out there who constantly contemplate suicide without even trying to get help, my question is why? What do you got to lose?
