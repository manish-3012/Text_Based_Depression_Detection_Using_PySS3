I hate my fucking lifeThroughout all my life, Iâ€™ve always been known as the dumb kid. But ofc Iâ€™m not only a dumb kid- Iâ€™m a loser since birth, as worthless as anyone except more, as useless as littering. The only way I can describe myself is in total negative ways. I donâ€™t think I will make it till college and I donâ€™t think my mom does either. She knows how dumb I am, I will not get in anyway. If weâ€™re all born for a reason, then my reason is to end up as a hobo- maybe Iâ€™ll make friends living under a bridge with them. Maybe theyâ€™re more worth it than entrepreneurs and their bragging asses, who knows?
