Share experience of hospital when suicidalI'm going to give my fiancee my check Thursday then check into a hospital. My goal is to be there for a week, despite the fact that I will lose my job and will never be able to work again after this and will never get disability. I planned on killing myself Sept 6th but I will give it a few days after I get help.

But here is the problem. Jersey Shore Medical will hold me for a week if I tell them I am suicidal and am a danger to myself. This places nearly killed a friend of mine, plus I am unsure of what to say or do. Furthermore I don't think I can have cigarettes while there so I guess I'm quitting that too?

I know that this place probably won't help me. Because NOTHING helps me for more than a few minutes. I don't plan on living to see Halloween, Christmas, my anniversary, any of it. I feel the worst for my fiancee. My parents deserve to suffer. And my friends, well, for the most part are back stabbing fucks. I hang on for these people, and the truth is, my fiancee doesn't want me to suffer. She has told me she understands but just hopes I don't do it and end up in hell.

Hell doesn't exist. God doesn't need hell when there is love.

Anyway, curious about YOUR experiences. Don't try and help me. It can't be done. If anything, try and persuade me that I am wasting my time so I can just pull the trigger. The gun is loaded. KILL ME.
