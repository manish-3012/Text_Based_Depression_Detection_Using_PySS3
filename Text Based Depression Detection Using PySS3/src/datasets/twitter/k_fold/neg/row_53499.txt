HelpI'm not in a good place right now.

I haven't been for months.

Over the last year my wife and I have been fighting more and more. I've had a bad job to go with it and I moved an entire country to be with her. The last two months are where things got worse. 

She revealed that she was afraid of me. I've never hit her, or done anything to make her think that I would hurt her. She even said she knows I would never hit her. And yet she was afraid of how I might react. The more she talks the more she says that things were bad in the past but she never told me because she was afraid.

I'm not sure I can live with myself knowing how miserable I made her over the past two years and knowing I made her afraid? It's terrifying . It's hurtful and horrible. And I hate myself for it. I hate myself so badly. I've found out how she felt I was controlling, how much of her life I was ruining. How unhappy she was.

She's so close to leaving me and I had no idea this was going on. She is and was my entire life. I would do anything for her and now it's all going. I have no idea what to do. And I'm terrified.

I've found myself looking up suicide methods. I've even considered just buying a gun. Seriously, I adjusted my W4 so I get a little extra income so I can squirrel it away before I buy a weapon.

I can't live like this. I haven't had physical contact with my wife in months. And I wanted nothing but to make her happy. I never realized I was doing any of these things and I have no idea why she didn't tell me in two years,

I'm angry at myself. I'm hating everything about myself.

I just want her to be okay. And I don't know how to do that. I'm really close to just doing something so she can be free. I have no idea what to do anymore and in in hell. I don't know why I've written this. I don't know if it's help I want or someone to know that I just love this woman and I never wanted to hurt her. No matter what I never wanted to hurt her. I only ever wanted to make her happy.
