Tale of two citiesI wish I could kill myself in some grand gesture that was purposeful and valiant.    I wish I could die saving someone or preventing bad guys from getting away with it.    Deep down Iâ€™ve always wanted to sacrifice my life for live like in a Tale of two cities.   But I wonâ€™t.   Iâ€™ll eventually kill my self like most people, selfish, sad and labeled mentally unstable for doing so.  I hate you all.
