Why keep going?My best friend and only person who ever gave a shit about me completely cut me out of their life. It's not fair she gets to live her happy life and I sit here alone all day everyday alone with my thoughts. She was the last friend I had and now she won't even talk to me. I'm not surprised because it always happens. Everyone I ever get attached to always ends up leaving me, so why continue? I'm not good at anything, no job, no friends, and I'm no good at talking to people. I'll always be alone and I don't see a point in continuing if I'm just going to suffer this much for the rest of my life. Sitting in this empty house with tons of guns and knives is so tempting, but Im too scared to die. I wish I could just fade away or that I had never been born in the first place.
