I feel like I've spiraled down so far that I'm getting near manic.I had a pretty awful night last night and today at work the pressure has been compounding pretty bad. I'm damn near a breaking point. It's getting real bad, and I'm not exaggerating, it's really really really bad. I didn't think it could get this much worse after the absolute lows I've experienced. It's a complete wonder how I'm still standing here functioning somehow. I feel dazed with stress. I feel like I'm walking around in a dream right now.
