I don't want to dieSeriously. I have things I want to do. I have people I want to see, stuff I want to go to. Lately I've even been starting to think that there's someone in my life I love, who I think might kind of love me too?

There are things I want to live for. A lot of them.

But... My life feels fucked up. I'm 22 and live at home and work a stupid retail job even though I know I can do more. (Like I literally know I can do more because I have, I just don't have access to the opportunity.) I'm terrified of everything, there's always this deep fear in me that something will go wrong, that I'll do something wrong, that someone somewhere is Judging me. I have ADHD to the point where I can't pass college classes (I only have like 40ish credits from two different schools) and most importantly, I think my parents are starting to just give up.

I've been depressed before. When I was 19 I was severely depressed. Everything felt flat and gray and pointless. I don't feel depressed right now. Just defeated. I don't want to die, just like a chess player doesn't want to lose. They want to win, *I* want to win. I want to pass classes and play Magic at school with my friends. I wanna see my friend J, like... A lot. 

That doesn't mean that those chess moves will help me win though. I think they're supposed to, but it's like sometimes when I try to move a piece, someone rolls a die and says "Sorry, natural one. Leave your Knight where it is." And if course, I'm like "That's bullshit, nobody else has to roll a die to move." And they don't, and it isn't fair, but that's how it is. I feel like I'm being slowly but surely checkmated, and at some point I'm going to be forced to knock over my King.
