Frustrated with lifeI'll try to be concise though my mind is very messy because I barely slept.

I am stuck living in an incredibly homophobic place. I can't talk to anyone about my sexuality, and the only person that I told is a counselor, who suggested that I best keep it to myself. It's so suffocating to bear, but the alternative is getting beaten up, disowned, and being homeless.

I had the chance to spend two days with a guy and... it was the best two days of life. Not much happened aside from kissing, but for me that was everything.

But he was just here visiting and I won't see him again, unless I can by some miracle move closer to him, and there is very low chance of that happening. I developed feelings and now I'm just :(

My head is really messed up. I had the best two days ever, and I can't even talk to anyone about it without risking things. 

I can't bring myself to eat or sleep, and I am can't focus on anything but the fact that I am alone again and stuck in this hellhole. 

I wish I had more time with him. I wish I wasn't stuck here. I wish I had hope that I can ever have a happy relationship. I wish that I could see him again. 

I am so lost and frustrated. I feel invisible and like I am not allowed to exist. I don't think I can push on.
