I Just Don't Know AnymoreThis is weird for me to type out. But you guys seem to know what others are going through and maybe by chance you'll understand me too. No one I know knows I have reddit and probably won't see this so I'll feel safe saying this. And no my actual name isn't in my username, its just my online name so no one knows me. 

Okay here we go

I am 22. For the longest time I always dreamt of a way out my life like planning escapes or screaming at God to take me already. I've been in this state of mind since I was around 9 years old. 

I feel bitterly alone. My mother left when I was so young I barely remember her. She never wanted to talk to me but was okay with calling and writing my sister. I feel like she knew I'd see the letters and hear the phone calls. I never understood why she hated me. What did I do?

About less than a year ago. I realized no matter what I'm gunna die. And honestly I started to fear about where I'd go after I die. Like I don't want to be done. I just want to be dead and not be here anymore. 

I've been so panicked these past months. And I don't know why. I had the worst panic attack in my life on Thanksgiving. Why? Honestly I don't know. Things are starting to work out for me. I have someone who loves me and wants to be with me. And I have a steady job. I finally live in a working house. I have a few good friends who love me and will do anything for me. So why am I sad? Why do I still day dream about ending it all. I don't wanna die. 

The best way I can describe it. I feel trapped. I don't believe these people actually love me. I want to do it. I feel like someone is holding a gun to my head and when I say okay they'll pull the trigger. 

I just want to feel okay
