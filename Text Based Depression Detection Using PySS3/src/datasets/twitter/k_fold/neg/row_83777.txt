Killing the body is just a formalityI was going to travel across the country to meet a random guy I met online so we could kill ourselves together. I regret that I backed out, though I know the risks. The thought of continuing to live while experiencing this much pain is more terrifying than dying. I don't have the strength to continue and I have no reason to continue. I'm alone. I'm useless. I can't move. I don't know who is benefiting from me continuing to live so many years in pain. The important parts are already dead. Killing the body is just a formality.
