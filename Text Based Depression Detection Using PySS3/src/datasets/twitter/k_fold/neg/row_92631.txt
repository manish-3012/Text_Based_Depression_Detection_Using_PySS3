Possibility of suicide is getting closerI'm [33 M] finishing up a Ph.D. program after many years in graduate school. Even though I've done well in graduate school, making friends and having the support of advisors, the job market is shit and I am applying to every job I can. I've struggled with suicidality, depression, anxiety, and have been treated for Bipolar II since high school. I'm on antidepressants and mood stabilizers and see a therapist and psychiatrist regularly (though I moved to escape Covid and the SoCal fires and to visit my parents). My mom is also battling cancer and the thought of losing her is paralyzing. 

I feel like the end of the degree is the end of my life. I am single without children, friends are all moving away, and if I don't find a decent job when I'm finished then my self-worth/dignity will plummet. I also am in a lot of school debt (all Federal so if I find a full-time public service job, I'm not worried). But what's the point of going on? I had accomplished a lot already; I'm not living for anyway. I feel like it's time. **I'm just tired of being sad, anguished, and mad at myself for all the mistakes I make.** My life feels empty of just doing work, applying for jobs, reading a lot, and playing video games. That sounds like a good life, but I don't really have a purpose. Those are all just chores... I want to end it and am looking for the right time and method that won't cause too much damage. Already filled out a will and wrote my obituary, leaving as much as I can to people that matter to me. Doing the will looked more natural during Covid, though I'd wanted to do one for a while.  I just feel like life has no meaning *for me.* Wish the pain and distress would just cease.
