I feel lostIm not sure how to start this honestly. Im 22 year old university dropout (one of the biggest mistakes in my life). For the past year and a half ive been trying to find a job, sadly no lucky. Only interview calls and one tryout which i got told im just not good for this job. I constaly have the feeling my life is running out day by day.  This has destroyed my self esteem. Lost contact with a good part of my friends because of depression. I feel like im a disgrace to my family. No motivation to do anything anymore. The relationship my parents is on a tight rope. My plan was to get admited in university this year again with a different course but that went to the shitter when i didnt get in. Now wtf em i supposed to do for another year had plans but guess nothing once again. Im alos dealing with other health related problems which have helped to destroy my life even more.  Ive been thinking of suicide for a really long time now and the feeling is only getting stronger. Only reason that i havent done anything is because i love my parents way too much and the thought of them blaming themself will destroy them. But im starting to see that my mental health is starting to effect my mom. Sadly not sure how long will i be able to take all this slowly destroying my life. One of the worst parts is that now i have no one to even talk to, all day alone with the demons in my head. Been thinking to maybe seek help from a profesional or get on some antidepressants, not sure how much will this help. Sorry if the post is large just cant even express what i feel or say anything to anyone.
