Killing myself seems like a very good option, pretty much just failed my lifeI've had the worst week ever, I witnessed a horrible death which keeps reoccurring in my mind and today just got my A level results and fucked up. I have no chance of getting to university and feel like an absolute failure. I called the university and they said my grades were not high enough. They don't know what the fuck it's like having depression and anxiety having to drag yourself to a place you hate and motivate yourself at least ten times harder than normal people to even achieve mediocre shit. If I succeeded in killing myself last year there would have been no major difference, one year and I still fucking hate myself. What was the point of all that fucking effort, and stress and trying so hard that I burnt out. I honestly just feel like hurting myself really badly, I really really do hate myself
