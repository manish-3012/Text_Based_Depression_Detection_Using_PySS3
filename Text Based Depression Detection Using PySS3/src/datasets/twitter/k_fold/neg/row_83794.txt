Itâ€™s all gone to shitIf i had never of moved to this stupid city my boyfriend wouldnâ€™t resent me for being depressed and things would be fine. Iâ€™m tired of being a burden to everyone around me and I just want it to stop so badly. I miss where i used to live and my friends and i miss being happy there. I threw away such a good thing and i suffer the consequences of it everyday. I ruined my own life and destroyed my relationship just because i wanted to go to a better school. Iâ€™m such a piece of fucking shit and i hate myself so much. All i have ever wanted was someone to listen to me and no one will listen to me. I am hurting and this is a cry for help.
