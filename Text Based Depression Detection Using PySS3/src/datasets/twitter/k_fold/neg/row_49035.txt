I think im going to kill myselfIm a 14 year old boy and i love in Sweden. I have Russian parents and they love to drink. I hate it. every single moment my parents become drunk i fucking hate it. i was with my cousins the last days until they wanted to meet the whole family. My parents were on an island with their friends and my younger brother. Of course they had to be fucking drunk. I would understand if it was like afternoon but no. At the moment i arrived it was around 14:00 and they were drinking all kind of shit. When i asked my mom to at least drink less and later she told me that i could go home if i didnâ€™t like it how it was. I DIDâ€™NT WANT TO GO THERE ANYWAY. It feels much better to be at home playing some games with my friends who at least support me and care about me. when i sat at my moms bed and crying she came in and said  â€œget the fuck out of my bed with wet shortsâ€ (i was swimming earlier). i would love to go home but iâ€™m on an camping island with drunk parents and with nobody who could even get me over to the mainland. What should i do?
