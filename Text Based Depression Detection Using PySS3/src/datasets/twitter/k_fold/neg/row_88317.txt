Hey guys, if you need someone to talk to, go to compassionpit.com and speak to a caring listener immediately.I found this site while I was battling some inner demons a while ago, and to my amazement, there were people who genuinely listened and cared about my problems. Strangers helped me out that ditch, and I am greatly thankful.  I believe no matter how alone we feel and no matter how much we think no one cares, there is compassion in this world.  This site deserves more attention than it currently has, so please spread the word.  

I try to be on this website as much as I can, so do not hesitate to try it out in fear of noone being there.

I care and even though I don't completely understand what you're going through, I will try my best to understand, and I will listen to you.  Most importantly, I promise not to judge you.  Everyone has flaws and everyone has problems.  We can get through it together.
