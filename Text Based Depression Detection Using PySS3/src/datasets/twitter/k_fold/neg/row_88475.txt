I wish I wasn't so lonelyUp until a couple a week ago I was able to distract the feeling by doing my hobbies and my job, but now it just kinda lingers in the back of my head. I don't have family and I fuck up my friendships so I try to keep to myself now. I just wish the feeling would go away is all.
