StrugglingMy credit is in the toilet. Iâ€™m working 4 jobs, but every time I feel like I get ahead I get knocked back down. The smallest inconvenience is a major blow for me. I live with a debilitating chronic illness that I can barely pay for to keep me alive. I have no family or loved ones that will miss me. I feel that if I just kill myself then Iâ€™ll finally have relief. Just disappear into the darkness.
