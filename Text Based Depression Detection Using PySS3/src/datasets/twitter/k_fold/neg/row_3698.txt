i dont want to be here anymoreIt is becoming exhausting living inside of my head every single day. I contemplate it every other day. Ive thought about almost every day. It seems like no matter how hard I try - nothing is ever good enough. I feel like a waste of life. There are people that are struggling for life every day, that would actually make a difference in this world. Im not even sure what my purpose is here anymore. I have all these goals..that just keep getting further out of reach the more i try. Its just never good enough.
