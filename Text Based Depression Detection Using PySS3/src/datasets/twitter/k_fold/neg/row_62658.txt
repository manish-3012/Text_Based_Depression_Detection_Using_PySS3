My Life Is Going To SuckI have 3 choices right now

I tell my parents I donâ€™t want to go to college, and they make my life completely miserable because I canâ€™t afford to move out when I turn 18

I do go to college only to drop out anyway and be left with the student loan debts

Or I can just save myself the pain and just kill myself

The third option is way better actually. It might be hard to accomplish but at least I wonâ€™t suffer the consequences since Iâ€™ll be dead. Iâ€™m definitely going to do it in 2 days when everyone is gone
