In the United States, are there any special programs for high school students with mental illness?Due to worsening mental illness, I'm finding it nearly impossible to want to go to school. It's not the work that's ever bothered me, but my fear of people and the way they treat me. At this point in time, I'm really, really suicidal and thinking about committing suicide sometime today because I don't want to have to face the pain of going to school tomorrow. I stayed home today, but I don't think I can tomorrow. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for years, and have attempted suicide in the past, and I'm trying to keep from doing that again, so I'm looking for alternative options.
