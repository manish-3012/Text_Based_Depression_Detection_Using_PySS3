Hanging vs exit bag and police investigationSo I know the police investigate deaths. Plan is either hanging in a secluded area or exit bag in a hotel. (I have a rope, tank or argon, made the bag, regulator, and hose).

Hanging is a very common suicide method, I believe itâ€™s the second most common method in the US. (Iâ€™m not talking about drop hanging. Also, Iâ€™ve watched videos of hanging and people often lose consciousness in a matter of seconds due to their carotid arteries being suppressed, itâ€™s not like theyâ€™re slowly suffocating contrary to popular belief. I prefer full suspension to partial suspension because I canâ€™t back out and the survival instinct wonâ€™t be able to ruin it for me).

I donâ€™t know how common the exit bag is, but I know terminally ill people sometimes use it, as well as those who can no longer help themselves and sometimes a loving family member will help put them out of their misery if physician assisted suicide or euthanasia isnâ€™t available where they are.

Just from what I know, I imagine the hanging will be ruled out as a suicide pretty quickly, especially considering I have a history of depression, suicidal thoughts, and have even attempted it. Iâ€™ve known some hanging suicides being ruled out as a suicide at the scene. 

Could the exit bag be ruled out as a suicide as quickly as hanging? 

And Iâ€™m over 21 and have been suicidal since age 9. My only regret is not offing myself earlier. Iâ€™ve made up my mind.
