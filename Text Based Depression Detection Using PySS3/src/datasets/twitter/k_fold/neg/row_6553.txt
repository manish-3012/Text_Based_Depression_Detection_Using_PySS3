Just venting...I just submitted my college applications about two hours ago, all of them. I should have nothing to stress or worry about. I should get in to one of them, and if not, no big deal. But no, I am here moping. I should just get over myself, because isn't that how distress works? You turn it on and off like a switch? My mom says this is normal around this time and it will just go away. I don't have the heart to tell her that this has been going on for two years. I've learned that people like me on the plus side, but now it means I can't just go away without a trace. 

People tell me I'm smart; I want to believe them, but then why I am  I always moving forward, then like a dog, looking back and waiting for more instructions? Why must I always ask others for help and feel unable to help myself? How can I tell if my problem is real or not? Real, what does that even mean? As though all people suffering at my age are suddenly discounted because they pain might just go away. What then? "I'm sorry we didn't think you were suffering?"

My head is pounding so much and all the time.
Can I have just half a day to do nothing and let go?
