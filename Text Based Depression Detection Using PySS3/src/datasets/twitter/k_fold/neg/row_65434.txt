I want to live but death is the only option!This may seem like a rant but please bare with me. I am a 22M with debilitating OCD. I tried fighting with it and nothing is successful. Already I was a big failure in life hoping to make things right. Just when things were going smoothly OCD attacked and now I am a even bigger failure. Tried to cure it on my own but failed. I don't want any luxuries from life. All I want is my sanity back ,the old me. But guess I am never going to get it. I am sorry mom and sorry to everybody who I was a burden to or anybody who I have hurted. Please don't show any kind of empathy on me.i don't deserve it.  I am a mentally weak pussy who just wants to die but I don't have the courage to kill myself. I love the life I have but guess I have to kill myself. If anybody knows a painless way to die please let me know.
