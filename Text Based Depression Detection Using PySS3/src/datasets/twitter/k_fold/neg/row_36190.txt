My mom is afraid i would bully my sister after my mom passed away, but she doesn't know i planned for my death in a few years.Such a funny idea my mom has, that i will bully and make my sister's life miserable after she dies, she tries to divide her properties and money into 2 even parts, so we wont fight for them after she's gone. But she didnt know money means nothing to me now. I planned to die soon in few  years, and my sis can have everything included my own money. My mom never understands who i am, she keeps hurting me more and more.
I was disapointed with this life, and now i hate it evenmore.
