I just really want someone to tell me, even if its a lie, that what I'm feeling is valid.I've had depression for a long time, and I dont feel like I can ever speak my mind, even if I wanted to. I dont know how to explain what is going on in my fucked up head. Whenever anything goes slightly wrong, I over react and freak the fuck out. Everyone is tired of me, and worn out of trying to help and its all my fault. I've ruined my families lives just be being a selfish prick. I've talked to many therapists, and while my current one is great, I never feel like I'm making any progress, mostly because I dont care enough to try any of the things he tells me. I've left behind so many people and screwed myself over by alienating any people I used to get along with. Now I sit along at home everyday, too afraid to speak my mind, and too cowardly to ask for help. I feel like no one around me believes that I'm this badly off, or if they've just given up trying. Now Reddit is the only place I can turn. I dont know what the fuck to do and even if I did I would be too cowardly and scared to do anything about it. I'm such a selfish piece of shit
