Remember that there is an IRC channel if you just need to vent or chat in real timeSuicideWatch has an IRC channel. It's not very active because not to many people have spoken about it, but it is there. Point your IRC client to irc.snoonet.org:6667 and go to #suicidewatch if you want to chat. I will be there pretty much all day and evening. 

I can't fix your problems but I can be there to at least try to point you in the direction of places where you might be able to find resources to get the help you need. 

Also, if anyone else would like to volunteer some time on this channel, it would be greatly appreciated. I think this is a great way to help as some folks feel desperate when they don't get immediate replies. 

Anyhow, it's just something to think about. Peace.
