I don't know how much longer I can do itevery day feels like i'm wading through heavy mud. i feel like i shoulder the guilt every day of breaking my ex's heart when he was the greatest person i've ever known. i can't make any lasting platonic connections, i bury myself in food and alcohol, i exploit my family's love, i can't accomplish anything. my problems are so insignificant and internal and stupid compared to real issues that i feel like a fragile fucking idiot for suffering in the way that i am. if i can't deal with this mild bullshit i don't think i'm cut out for life. i'm so fucking tired of feeling like a social pariah and having nothing to look forward to. it's getting close, i can feel it.
