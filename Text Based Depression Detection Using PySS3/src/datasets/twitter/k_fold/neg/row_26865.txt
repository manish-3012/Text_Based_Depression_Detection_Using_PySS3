How can I change my life?I've spent the last few months planning my death. I've said my final goodbyes to a lot of people and I have been waiting for April 10th...but today something switched. It was instantaneous, I got chills, and I felt like I could make it. The only problem is that my life must change. 

I have got to leave this place and these people. I cannot live in this city/county/side of the state any longer. I know that if I do not commit to change, REAL change, then I will hang myself. I just do not know how to do it. I am socially immature and I do not have any social structure. I do not have anyone I can lean on for help. I don't know anyone anywhere else...I don't know how to restart my life. 

On top of all of that I still have debt and a car that is worth less than the loan I am paying off. I will probably be laid off in the next year, anyways. What do I do? I am afraid I will lapse and this feeling will just be temporary. I cannot continue with this life...I have got to move on. Can someone give me some advice?
