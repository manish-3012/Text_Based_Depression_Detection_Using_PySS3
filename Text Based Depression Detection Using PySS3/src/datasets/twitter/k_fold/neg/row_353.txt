I feel like I am slippingnot sure what to even say...

I am just in a bad place. I have friends that I usually go to, but they have both been venting to me tonight so I have felt like I shouldn't go to them tonight. Also I hurt one of them (unintentionally) recently and the guilt is making things so much worse.

I have struggles with anxiety and depression for years, I am on meds, I don't like therapy but I really should start going again.

I can't really say what is causing today to be so bad other than the guilt and the feeling I always seem to have.

Tonight is the first time in my life I have gone to self harm, I cut myself tonight, 3 small cuts on my arm. I am afraid of this happening all the time and of it escalating. I heard someone say today that they can't wait for this week to be over....And all I could think was "I can't wait for my life to be over"
