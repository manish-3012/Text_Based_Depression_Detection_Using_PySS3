Hearthwarming wordsTrigger warning! (Suicide)




My life is falling apart, I can't do anything abt it and my GF just left me on top of it.
I've never been this close to the edge and I just can't bear myself the thought of that the one I loved just gave up on me.
I just need some hearthwarming words just to get it by and don't give up on everything yet.
And the worst to part is that I've set some of the stuff for after I'm dead. I'm ready for it. I won't fail.
