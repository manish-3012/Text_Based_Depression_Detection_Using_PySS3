I wish I could do itLove of my life (5yr relationship) left me just before Christmas and I just found out hes already in another committed relationship. I meant nothing, it was all for nothing, he never really loved me. Not to mention the state of this rotten country, my overall mental state and how Iâ€™m literally never going to be good at living. The only thing holding me back is the guilt of what it would do to my loved ones. I wish I could just turn on the car in the garage and go to sleep. I donâ€™t wanna do this anymore
