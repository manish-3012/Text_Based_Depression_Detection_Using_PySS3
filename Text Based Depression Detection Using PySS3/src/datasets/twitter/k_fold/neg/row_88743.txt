fear and laziness about transitionhi all, how are you?

the cornerstone of my story that needs to be clarified before anything else is: I will end my life and the decision is final.

the support I seek is somewhat lateral.

I am a 32F recently graduated from medical school. in order to get my license in my country, I have to first complete some clinical rotations (atm, almost finished) and then a few more months to process the license.

once the license process clears, I will apply for a residency program in a different province, moving away from my hometown once I graduated has been a decision for decades.

I will move cities and begin working as a physician. I will end my life around that time.

I am not ill, al least not anymore. I had severe mental health problems for decades, but I was cleared of any on going diagnoses a few months back.

I have been thinking about it and I can't find the ethics in forcing people to live when they simply don't wish to.

my reasons for suicide are not medical (i.e., depression or such).

the thing is. and here's where I need some orientation. I have some 7-8 months to go before I get my license, move and start residency. I don't want to go without my diploma, graduating medical school has been exceedingly grueling and it's worth it. and the hardest part: I have to prepare to sit for the exam. I don't know what residency exams are like in other countries, but it is like nothing ever known even to medical school graduates. it's grueling enough to just prepare to sit for a residency exam, let alone do that while simultaneously being suicidal.

my only idea is getting therapy for this transition, but I could get forcefully hospitalised and that's not a helpful solution for my reasons to end life.

how do I face the following months?

thanks.
