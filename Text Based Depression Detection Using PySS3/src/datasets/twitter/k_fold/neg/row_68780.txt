what music helps bring you down from that edge. . .i don't know if /r/SW has any kind of official song or songs for it but if it's possible i would ask if "Rascal Flatts - Why" could be added to it's list.

For me i'll admit that i've been on that edge quite a few times in the past. how ever it seems that music has brought me down from that edge quite a few times. granted that Rascal Flatts song ain't the only one on my list. here is a short list of songs that help me:

The Pretenders - I'll Stand By You

Creed - One last Breath 

Garth Brooks - One Night A day

Moulin Rouge OST - El Tango De Roxanne

4 Non Blonds - What's Up

there are just to name a few.
