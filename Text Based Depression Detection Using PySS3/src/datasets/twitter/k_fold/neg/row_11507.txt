Does it ever get better? i'm a girl in my teens and i'm just really confused. there has never been anything in specific that might explain my depression. i've been seeing a therapist for a while but that doesn't seem to be helping. i don't understand why i keep living if i'm suffering. it's like, why should i keep doing this, if life is what's giving me pain? 
i have supportive parents who love me, i have a lot of friends and i don't get bullied. i'm just depressed. every person can handle so much and i feel like this is just my limit and i really can't take it anymore. life just isn't for me. 
i cry myself to sleep every night and i just want to die. the only reason i haven't killed myself yet is because of my parents. i don't want to upset them, because i really do love them and i don't want to bring sadness to the family. but lately my depression has been getting worse  and i'm thinking that sometimes it's better to be selfish.
