Iâ€™m scared to kill myself but I really want to just die alreadyI know Iâ€™m a parasite, a baby, a waste of space, a pain to be around, ugly, worthless and I know that everyone pities me, everyone hates me, everyone will leave me, no one tries to understand me, no one notices my emotions, I donâ€™t fit in with my family or friends and I should just die so no one will worry about me anymore but Iâ€™m scared to kill myself because I probably wonâ€™t even succeed at that. Iâ€™m also scared to live on because my life will just get worse and more miserable. 

Iâ€™m not sure if this is even the right subreddit to post this on since I donâ€™t do any destructive behaviour or planning to kill myself but I just need some support please
