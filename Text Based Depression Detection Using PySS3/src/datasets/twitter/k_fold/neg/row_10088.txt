HelpFor the past year, Iâ€™ve been writing down dates I thought about committing suicide and there are only about enough dates to make a month but on these dates, I really thought about killing myself. I thought about getting in a car, running into a wall at full speed on the freeway, and a lot more. I wonder about all the people it would affect but for some reason I canâ€™t help but to feel it would make their lives easier. Iâ€™m confused, Iâ€™ve begun to hate myself again and I donâ€™t want to go back to being that way. Some days I hope not to wake up the next morning because I donâ€™t want to live in my pain and regret. I feel I canâ€™t talk to anyone, to try and see if they can talk me out of suicide. At the end of the day, I feel alone but only because Iâ€™m fighting myself. These dates have just become more consistent which is yelling at me for something but I just canâ€™t wrap around the feeling that I can be happy again. I just donâ€™t know what to do, someone please help me.
