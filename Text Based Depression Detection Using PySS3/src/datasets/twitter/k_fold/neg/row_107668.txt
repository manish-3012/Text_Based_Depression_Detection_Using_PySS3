I can't take it anymoreMy thoughts are driving me to commit suicide. Constant repetive thoughts that wont go away. I just want to end it, nothingness is better than this. I don't want to hurt my family but I honestly can't take it anymore. I've been looking for spots in my house so I can hang myself. I just want a way out with the least amount of pain possible. I feel absolutely trapped in this life and theres only one way out.
