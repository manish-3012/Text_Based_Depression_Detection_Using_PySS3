What's the pointI've hit that wall. Made some dumb drug/drink mistakes which led to bad choices. I'm withdrawing from alcohol and it feels awful. 

I can't bring myself to tidy my room; it's disgusting. I mean, actually embarrassing not just messy. I've let myself go. These last few months have been awful. I don't know where to start. I need to lose weight, I miss my anorexia. It was like a friend. My body hurts from constant laxative ODs and right now, I just need to ramble and write. 

I'm sorry it's all about me; I don't think I'm meant to be alive. If an animal was violent, ill or just not functioning it would be humane to put it down so why not me.
