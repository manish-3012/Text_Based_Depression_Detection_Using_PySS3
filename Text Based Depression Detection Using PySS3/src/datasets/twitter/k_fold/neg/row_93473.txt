I'm tired of lifeI guess I'm not really suicidal. I just don't want to be alive anymore. I feel enough guilt about the first time I tried to commit suicide not to do it again, but at the same time, I don't like being alive. I got a bad cough this winter, and I was really hoping it was cancer. I don't even care if it's an awful, painful death. I just want to know that there's an end. I don't want to have to live another 50 years.

I'm 35. I've only had sex once. I met her online. She wanted to take a guy's virginity and it was clear mine was available. I almost wanted to say no, but who could turn down something like that? I would have regretted it forever. And it's not that sex means anything to me. It's just that now I feel like I'm addicted to heroin and have no way to get it. It's not that I haven't tried to meet women and get them interested in me. But they never are, and I guess I don't blame them. I don't have any confidence.

I'm just tired of fighting. It's never done any good. I'm just bitter now. Bitter and disappointed.
