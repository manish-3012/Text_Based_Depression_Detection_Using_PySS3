I am nothing.How come I feel like everyone is just fake. It seems like everyone thinks I'm annoying and doesn't like me. It makes me feel like they pity me and only. I always get ignored over other people by almost everyone. It makes me feel like I'm worthless and I'm starting to believe it at this point. I've never fit in with anyone I "hang out" with. I'm always pushed out of the circles of people talking and if people are walking together I'm almost always pushed back and fall behind.  Hell if I am talking to someone alone someone will come by to get them out of the conversation. I know I can talk a lot when I feel comfortable with people but it's because I have no one to talk to. No one that I can just get it all out to so it's just built up and here I am posting this. I just live in everyone's shadows since I can't make a name for myself due to my fucking dumbass anxiety. I'm always just following people around like a fucking dog. I'm not even sure if I'm able to make choices by myself at this point. I'm never asked to do anything with anyone except when I fucking complain about it. The only time they'll invite me is if I'm there while they are making plans and don't want to look like assholes. I just want to know what I've ever done to deserve this shitty life. I've always tried to do shit on my own and make friends on my own but I'm just too fucking annoying to people so I don't talk very much. If I do I will ignored and talked over. It just feels like I'm non existent and I think it's because I'm not supposed to be here. It's not like I'm tough and I'm fighting this depression but the only reason I haven't ended my life yet is because I'm scared of dying and don't want to hurt myself but I'm in this never ending loop of wanting to live and wanting to die. I just don't have a fucking purpose and am just a waste of space. I'm sorry for wasting all of your time if you read this. I'm am nothing
