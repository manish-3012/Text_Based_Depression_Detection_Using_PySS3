Everything feels like the next thing that happens is it for me.Iâ€™m venting but also looking for some help. Iâ€™m a female 23. Grew up with abusive parents and a sibling. Learned not to stick up for myself or say a thing because I got in trouble either way... even got kicked out of church. I had pretty much no social skills. I was known for keeping my parents together and everyone was jealous of me. Little did everyone know I came home to fights everyday and spent most of my time alone with suicidal thoughts. I fantasized about my family dying and never told anyone what was going on. Im emotionally unavailable. Most of my friends have been shit because I thought I couldnâ€™t have a friend who was considered normal. Always hung out with the partiers and troubled kids. Iâ€™ve always been very hyper and impulsive and like to have fun. I hate rejection. So Iâ€™ve lost most of my friends at this point and then they blame me or ghost me just like my parents did. my high school boyfriend cheated on me and messed with my head. I had derealization/depersonalization and tried to stab my ex at a party then I started hooking up with him and using him and then he cut me off again. Started dating a narc who raped me and paid me money to stay with him after abusing me. I punched him in the face and he stalked me for months. I ran out of money for nursing school and got a factory job. Fell in love with a newly divorced man who was just like me. We loved to drink and laugh and have fun. We would get in pretty bad drunk fights and he started taking his problems out on me. I gave that guy everything. It was the happiest Iâ€™ve ever been. I moved in with him and got away from my abusive parents. He was in money trouble and kept finding reasons his family and I didnâ€™t love him and I stopped him from committing suicide. He blamed it on alc and stopped drinking. He got jealous of a guy I was friends with and they threatened hr if he was going to make it a big deal. He broke up with me over it and went back to my parents house and he committed suicide. Itâ€™s been 8 months of hell. Iâ€™ve come so close to ending it all. I didnâ€™t deserve that, he was my best friend and he put everything on me just like everyone else had. I just wanted him. I have pretty much no one and now I have ptsd. If people blame me for anything or criticize me or I make a mistake I lash out..and canâ€™t regulate my emotions. I get super suicidal. I canâ€™t just tell someone how I feel because I feel defenseless so I just cut them off. I donâ€™t want to die I just want it all to be over. Everything has built up to the point I feel the next time is my psychological break. Iâ€™m trying to go back to school but if I donâ€™t get through..thats all I have left going for me.
