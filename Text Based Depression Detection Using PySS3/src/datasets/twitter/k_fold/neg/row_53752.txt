How the fuck did we get hereOne day our moms just pushed us out her vagina then were here. We're forced into this life. Go to school for a hella long time then random shit happens in between, also work for a long ass time then YOU DIE.  Like wtf. Nothing matters. And our lives arent worth any more than a fucking cow we kill or an ant. Were all stuck on this fucking earth and when we die we are LITERALLY NOTHING. wow ok... thanks God.
