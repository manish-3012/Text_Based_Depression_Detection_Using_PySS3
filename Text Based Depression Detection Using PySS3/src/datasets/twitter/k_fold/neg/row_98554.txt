I canâ€™t fight anymoreIâ€™ve been suffering alone and in silence for as long as I can remember. I try to get help but everyone turns a blind eye except for one. My girlfriend really tries to help but she lives far away and I canâ€™t cope with being on my own again. I feel disconnected from real life, like Iâ€™m just going through the motions of day to day life until I die. I have no future. Every endeavour I went into has been an utter failure. Life feels like itâ€™s moving at a snails pace and that Iâ€™ll have to feel this pain for an eternity. I just want to be happy. All thatâ€™s keeping my head above water is my girlfriend but sheâ€™ll find someone better eventually, sheâ€™ll be off to college soon and sheâ€™s gonna meet so many amazing and motivated people. People that can provide what I canâ€™t, people that can make her happy for the rest of her days. I just want her to be with someone thatâ€™s happy and stable. Someone that isnâ€™t an utter failure. Iâ€™ve accepted that when that happens itâ€™s the end of the line and Iâ€™m at peace with myself. This is my future, thanks for your time.
