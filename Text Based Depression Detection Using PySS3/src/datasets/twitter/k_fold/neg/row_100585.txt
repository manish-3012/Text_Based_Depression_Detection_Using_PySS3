Does anyone else feels that they are not going to make it to 2019?I'm so sick amd tired of life. I have fantasized many times how I'm going to kill myself. Thinking of my death makes me feel peaceful because the pain would be gone. I'm tired of feeling like I have to try to survive everyday. Surrounded by a dysfunctional family, no career, no friends or significant other. I have nothing going on in my life. I feel so lonely in this world. I already planned the method. I just need to stop thinking so much and do it. I don't have an exact date. But I don't know if next year I would be alive.
