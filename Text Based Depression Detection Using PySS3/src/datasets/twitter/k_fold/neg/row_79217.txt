Guys I need urgent help for a friendMy best friend and I recently made friends with this nice girl about 2 months ago ( we are both males ) and she started falling for my friend but he was already taken so he rejected her advances, she became depressed and today her behavior was very off and she was complaining about how she wanted to die, we think she might go through with it, she has had a history of suicidal attempts, but she is currently about 5 hours away from us and there isnâ€™t much we can do, does anyone know how we can help?
