All AloneI'm a 13 y/o girl with no siblings just a mom and a dad. My past school years have been going great, I've been passing classes with amazing grades. But something happened this year... I started to fail my exams even though I study really hard. My parents always shout at me when I get bad grades, telling me I'm never gonna make it and to change my group of friends. My friends have been around with me through thick and thin, it's impossible for me to let go. I got and A + in my science and world history, those were the only grades put up. Since they were good grades my parents ignored it. When my math grade came it it wasn't very good. My parents shouted at me and threatened that if I keep this up I'm never going to make it anywhere in life. They simply said that they have given up on me and they told me I can stay on my phone all day and do nothing. They said that I have no hope no matter how hard I try. Please if you read this, tell me how I can improve my studying and how I can learn to do things on my own WITHOUT my parents. ( Tutors are NOT an option )
