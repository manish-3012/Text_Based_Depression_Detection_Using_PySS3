I deserve all that happens to me, said dadThe only person who I truly loved and helped me pull through every day for 4 years got tired of me and left. 

It's like I'm back at starting point and nothing makes sense anymore. I can't find happiness in anything anymore. Everything reminds me of him, reminds me of when I used to be happy. 

I'm so desperate I've been numbing my brain by abusing xanax more and more, my self harm is worse than ever and I can't stop thinking about ending it.

Everyone will eventually leave me, no more how much they promise they will be there for me, it keeps happening, they all leave because I'm ill beyond repair, he said im toxic, I just wanted to make him happy.

My life and future are shattered and I can't see ahead of me, nothing has a purpose anymore. I don't want my family to be sad. My whole life I've been a coward but I will prove him I can be brave for once, own my mistakes and end myself. 

I'm sorry for everything, I wasn't meant to live this life.
