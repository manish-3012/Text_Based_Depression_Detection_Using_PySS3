Losing my controlI spend my nights thinking about killing myself. It's all in abstract. I fade in and out between feeling nothing/feeling everything. 

When the emotions come out it hurts my chest, it's like waves of physical pain. I bury my emotions a lot of the time so that I can get through whatever trauma it is this time. 

It's cool dad you can get in my face and tell me what a worthless daughter I am, shove me, hit me. I'm not here right now. I retreat into myself and I feel nothing  

It's coming out though and I am losing control. I get overwhelmingly angry and depressed, I laugh and scream and I hit things. I want to destroy everything in my room. I want to smash my stupid fucking tv and throw my bookshelf on the floor and tear the pictures off my walls. I want to take a hammer and bury it in the wall over and over, I want to throw everything out my window and scream outside. I want everyone to know how much I fucking hate them and my life. 
I think about using my knife to cut my neck. I think about filling my house with carbon monoxide, that way when I kill myself I have no family left to mourn me.

All these thoughts go through my head. I feel like I'm on the edge of my seat just waiting for something to push me. I feel sad and overwhelmed. 

I keep trying to pick myself up and my family has me by the throat and drags me down. Everytime I think I'm doing okay and things can get better, they remind me that life is nothing but suffering. I just want to be better and I can't. And I'm just wondering if there's really any point in continuing. 

I feel like I'm losing my goddamn mind.
