Mentally, Iâ€™m a vegetableOver the past couple of months, my life has gone to absolute shit. The events that took place, caused me to lose control over my mental health, and I canâ€™t really contain myself anymore. My brain wonâ€™t let me focus on any important task for more than 10 minutes, and whenever I do, suicidal thoughts jump into my brain. This has caused my grades to severely drop, causing my parents, who know whatâ€™s going on but refuse to acknowledge the severity of it, to pressure me to get them back up. The fact that I physically do not have the mental capacity to get these grades back up, paired with the recent loss of all but 1 of my friends, and many other issues surrounding my life right now are making my mental state similar to that of a vegetable. Iâ€™m afraid that Iâ€™m not going to be able to mentally function in society if this keeps going on. My life is going to plummet, and there isnâ€™t going to be anything left to live for. Right now I think Iâ€™ve decided that I am going to wait 3 months, and if Iâ€™m still in the same mental state I am now, Iâ€™m gonna end it. I really hope it gets better, but I donâ€™t want to have to live with it if it doesnâ€™t.
