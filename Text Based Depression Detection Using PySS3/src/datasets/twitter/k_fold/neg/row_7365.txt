My depression drains all my friends...I haven't felt like this in a long time, I managed to get over my depression for a few years and I thought that everything was going to be okay.

I finished my GCSEs and most of my friends in real life moved away, I now go to college and talk to absolutely nobody.
I have 4 close friends online who are basically the only reason I cope.

One of them brought up how I was really draining them with constantly being anxious about whether I had annoyed them (anxiety makes me question if I messed up, often and I apologise a lot)
And I realised that this applies to all of the friends I had online... I just drain them and bring them down because I'm just inherently anxious and depression...

I've cut myself off totally from them and honestly I can't see any other option than ending it all.

I didn't think I would ever feel like this again but here I am posting on this sub 3 years later...

I'm sorry for the awful formatting and spelling. I'm not in the best place right now and can't think about it too much.
