Therapie makes me even more want to die than ever.Actually my therapist is very professional and good at his stuff even if it is just a collage service completely free for students. He tried to convince me that I'm good enough but it just fixed my mood for a few minutes. Because there's way to change your mind to feel more comfortable in this world, but we can do basically nothing to make the world treat ourselves better. What if my therapist and I reached the goal, I got mentally healthy but still am an absolute asian gay virgin. What he's doing is basically teach me how to live on with useless confidence but any actual change.

And I started cutting myself, I should get used to pain if I still want to have the last say on my life.
