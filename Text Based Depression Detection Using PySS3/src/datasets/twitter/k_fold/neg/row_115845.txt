Things will only get worse.  I don't want to keep trying.I can't do this anymore.  I love my boyfriend.  We're going to get married.  Or we're supposed to.  He says he loves me and I know he does but he doesn't want to do something to make his life better.  He's been going to school for 8 years.  He's getting his PhD.  His lazy advisor torpedoed him to the committee and when he went to talk to the head of the department, she wouldn't help.  He wouldn't stand up for himself either.  He figured it was his fault.  Now he's at home pretending like nothing is wrong and he's talking to me little by little while he listens to podcasts.  I know now that he may love me but he is in real trouble.  He doesn't have a job outside of grad student and if he gets kicked out of the program, it's all on me to support him.  He does this with his family too, and even sells me up the river to make himself look better to them.  He lied to them that he was only coming to see me because I was making him, when in fact he asked if he could come stay with me because his family was being so awful to him.  I've been there for him every step of the way.  I love him to pieces.  I know that he is the one that I'm supposed to be with.  It's him, or no one, but I can't take his total apatyh for his own situation and neglect of me/us anymore.  And he won't change.  If I try to bring up these issues with him, he just blames himself in the moment then forgets about it later.  

I can't take this anymore.  I'm ready to be done.  Maybe then he will understand the impact he had.  Or maybe not.  I'll be gone and won't have to worry aobut him/us/his family hating our relationship anymore.
