Spoiler: Then answer's No.Do you deserve help, if you wont take what's offered?

I know all I have to do is go back over there and say yes, I'd like to play. yes, I'll go to the thing, I just don't want to be alone right now. I know that if they had the slightest hint that I was feeling like I am, I'd have never gotten out of that house. For some, inexplicable, reason, I know they care, at least a little. 

But I said no, and I left. And as I break down now I wonder who could I reach out to, who could help me this time?

No one, because I don't accept help from others. So I guess I'll be my own success...or my own failure.
