Life is pointless...     My life isn't going very well and haven't been for the past 4 years. I am currently 13. I'm young. I haven't been telling anyone that I'm contemplating suicide. I always have been the kid in school to try to be happy but it never works. Constantly people ask me if I'm fine. My life is so bad. I am growing up in a decently poor family. We can pay all Bill's but no spare money. My dad is self employed. My mom got out of jail last Thursday and she didn't text me or call me when she got out. My old friend carder killed himself 6 months back and I'm constantly thinking about joining him. My grandma is dieing rn and I live with her. I was just thinking if Like I came home from school and she would be gone. No goodbyes. I can't seem to get people to like me. I smoke pot and drink. I guess that's the only thing that can help me at this point. I have gone through therapy and it didn't help. I live near a bridge. I'm thinking on it. Idk yet. It is currently 11:30 and I have school. I am doing decent but I dont really care at this point. We live to reproduce and die. I'm useless.
