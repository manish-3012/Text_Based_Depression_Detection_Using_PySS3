And I'll go tonight, not knowing what a girl's lips feel like on mineI tried to do the whole "exhaust fumes in closed car"charade yesterday and it was just useless. I've had my pistol for a while and tonight I think I'll man up finally.

I always wanted to kiss a girl... I really did... I've loved a lot of women but no woman ever loved me, and I don't blame them. No woman *can* love me. I was made to be raped and tortured and hated. But I can't live this life. I've tried for years to come to terms with the fact that I'm inherently unlovable but I can't bear it anymore.
