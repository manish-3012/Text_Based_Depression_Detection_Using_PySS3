My fiancÃ© is always angryWalking on eggshells all the time. I'm always censoring myself because if I don't I'm afraid it will end with smashing furniture and holes in the wall. I feel so worthless, like no matter what I'll never be good enough. I want to start working again but at my last job I was bullied and ostracized to the point of an attempt. I want to go back to school but I can't concentrate and I just feel stupid. I really think I am stupid. 

When I quit my shitty job he assured me that he would take care of me but recently I've been called pathetic and helpless. I cry almost every night as he sleeps next to me. I can't survive on my own and the world seems an increasingly terrible place. My anxiety is just getting worse... I want to die.

Edit: Thank you all for the responses, I really appreciate it!
