I see no reason not to kill myselfEveryday things are looking grayer and grayer. I dropped out of college last year, lost my job recently. I've stopped texting my friends (really acquaintances). I just don't care about anything anymore, and I hardly have the energy to care anyway. 

My brain's all fucked up and wired wrong. I have social impairments and have been teased my whole life. I was never welcome at the "cool table" in school, I always ate my lunch on the curb outside the cafeteria. everyone around me was making friends and getting laid and getting their lives set up..

My life has been a laughing joke. When I think I'm passionate about something, I fail at it. My parents have always wondered what was wrong with me because my grades were always shit in school. My step dad even calls me a faggot since i can't get a girlfriend. It wasn't until I turned 22 I learned from a doctor I have pretty bad Adhd, which is probably why I dropped out of college and can't stop doing drugs.

My sister who's my same age just got a puppy, so I think now would be a good time to end it honestly. The dog should help make my death less sad for her I think (I hope). I don't really give a fuck about my parents; it's their fault I'm alive. This is just the chance you take when you have a kid and force another innocent being into the world.

Oh well.. just a crappy hand of cards is all it is. I see my therapist this week so I'll talk to him one more time I guess and then it's ðŸ˜µðŸ”«

Wish there was a way I could let u guys know what's on the other side... hopefully nothingðŸ¤ž
