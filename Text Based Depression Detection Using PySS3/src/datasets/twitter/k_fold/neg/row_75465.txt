The closest I've ever come and no one will ever know.I just sat there with my gun in hand crying. It's funny, you try to get better for once, get on anti-depressants, sedatives and go to therapy. And here I am worse than ever. I have never in my life felt the urge to not exist so strongly before. I took a bunch of benzos a while ago, I'm contemplating taking more and more till I can feel something. I've been on them entirely to long so my tolerance is pretty high at this point. I think I'm at 180mg so far in the last few hours.

Edit 240mg now. Definitely feeling it now. Perhaps more, can't really get around with out well...being tipsy, no one even notices, it's kinda ridiculous.
