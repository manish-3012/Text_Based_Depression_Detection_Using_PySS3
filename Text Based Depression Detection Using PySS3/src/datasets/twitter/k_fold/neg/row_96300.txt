Writing stuff outHey, not sure if I'm going to hit submit on this or not. If you're reading this I guess I did.

I can't keep feeling like I do now. I have no energy, I don't want to do anything, I've worn out my ability to cry so now I'm just an empty numb shell waiting for it all to be over. There hasn't been a point in the last 2 years where I consciously thought I wanted to live life, at best I've been indifferent- maybe if there was a fire and someone was trapped inside I could run inside and help, and if I died at least it would be for a good cause, that kind of thinking.

A few months ago stuff got a lot worse and I don't know why. I asked my doctor if he would run any tests and he said no, I asked to see a psychiatrist 8 weeks ago and I'm still waiting, I'm on antidepressants that I know aren't going to work because it's week 8 already but the last mental health person I talked to told me it was too soon to try something else so I'm just stuck day after day after day not wanting to carry on. A couple of times recently I've been really close. 2 weeks ago I went to buy a rope and stopped before I did it but I don't understand why, it wasn't a conscious decision or anything.

I feel like I owe it to my mum to try speaking to a psychiatrist, and if that hasn't worked after a few weeks, if I feel like this again, I can just stop. It would suck making my mum upset but if she knew how i was feeling she would understand. Honestly the only thing keeping me from doing it right now is knowing I can just do it later if I don't seem to be getting any better, if I knew for a fact I had no chance of improving in the next month or two I would just kill myself now. I guess it's kind of like I'm finding an excuse to keep living a bit longer, because I know I shouldn't feel like this, but I know I don't have the strength to do this long term.

Nothing really feels real any more, actions don't feel like they have consequences, and sometimes I have to deliberately think to myself that I'm really here in this moment, because it feels like I'm watching a memory. I want all the help I can get, I even tried to get admitted to hospital, but nobody has the time to care.
