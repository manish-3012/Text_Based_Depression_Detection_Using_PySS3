How to get a quick psych appt for suicidal depression?I have dealt with depression/suicidal thoughts for years. I'm in the middle of a very bad episode now. I think I am bipolar.

I would like to see a mental health professional, but I live in a small town, and I have no idea how to find a good one, much less find one that will see me within the next few days. Every appointment here takes a month or more generally.

I have seen several therapists and psychologists here in the past, they tend to be very judgmental and religious. I'm not sure what to do.

Any advice? I am at the end of my rope here. I am considering going to the ER.
