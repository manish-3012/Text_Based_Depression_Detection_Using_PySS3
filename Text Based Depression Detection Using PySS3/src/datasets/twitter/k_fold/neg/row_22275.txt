Trapped with emotionally abusive father and can't escapeMy whole life, my dad has yelled at me and has dumped all of his problems onto me. Nobody has helped me with this. Not my family, or the police, or anyone. I have no job and had to drop out of college due to not being able to afford it and not getting any financial aid. I'm hopeless and my life is a fucking mess.

Last year I decided to try to end it but then just went to the Emergency Room to see if they could actually help me. Mostly because I couldn't find any place high enough at home to hang myself from.

All they did was recommend I see a therapist twice a week.

I started doing that and my therapist was useless. I ended up feeling even more angry and hopeless after each session. After a while my therapist recommended I be put on medication. So I found a psychiatrist and he prescribed me a medication.

It didn't help.

When I told the psychiatrist that the medication wasn't doing anything, he recommended I be admitted to a hospital so they could monitor me and figure out how to treat me.

I spent a week in the hospital and they gave me another medication and sent me on my way, with treatment at an outpatient center to see a therapist every week.

And now I'm here, jobless, no friends, a NEET with no future, money or hope. I don't know what to do anymore. My dad yells at me all the time about my mom (they're divorced) and I don't know what to do. I can't get out and my life is going nowhere. I've tried getting help but nobody is giving me actual help.
