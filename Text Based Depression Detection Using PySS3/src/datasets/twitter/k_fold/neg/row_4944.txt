I'm at a party and I've never felt so bad in my life
Im taking meds for my depression and all. I thought everything was going well then a friend i haven't talked to in years invited me to a party. I accepted because I was bored and he insisted. Every progress I made im the last 2 months with my psychiatrist disappeared, I feel so depressed and suicidal and I am taking meds talking to a therapist and I am at a fuckinh party. Why do I feel so bad, why do I lie in the couch for 4 hours straight while everyone else is dancing and pitying me? I feel like thisz will never end. I always end up depressed and suicidal no matter what I do, and I tried everything. I feel good for some time them I fall down again. I'm tired. I almost killed myself on the 4th of July. Next time will be for good
