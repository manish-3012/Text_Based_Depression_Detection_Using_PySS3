IdkMy spouse just confessed to me that he has been lying for the last month about taking his bipolar/borderline meds. He made a big event about it yesterday, going to get his meds from the mail, he even pretended to fake taking them infront of me. I believed him. I guess I should have checked under his tongue but I didnâ€™t feel that necessary as I fully believed him. He told me he stopped taking them for the â€œlast 3 daysâ€ in that moment.


I had noticed his behaviors changing and those tell tale signs for much longer than the last 3 days.


But it isnâ€™t as shallow as it sounds, all about him, why would it bother me so much.

Itâ€™s been a hellish relationship that Iâ€™ve been trapped in while both in the army since 2016. It has pushed me into two suicide attempts, alcoholism before the age of 24 that I now have liver damage from. Itâ€™s caused me to do things I can never forgive myself for and I just have to carry with me til I die.

It turned me into just as empty and hateful of a monster as he.

I ruined my body, im covered in scars, I canâ€™t drink even two beers without pain and being immediately sick for hours. I canâ€™t remember anything short or long term from the memory loss and severe stress over the last 4 years.

Iâ€™ve been so trapped.

Now I think heâ€™s gone, after coming clean about lying over he last month. 

I suffered as a result of him not taking his meds, meanwhile he told me â€œI thought I felt great but if this is what happens when I donâ€™t take them it makes me feel badâ€ 
It doesnâ€™t and didnâ€™t cross his mind about the effects he is having on me. 

And I believed him, and tried so hard to work with what he was doing to me.


I donâ€™t know what I want to do in life.
I just got a job at subway and I like it, but I think I only like it because I havenâ€™t had a job, or friends all year. I donâ€™t have friends. I havenâ€™t had friends since maybe 2018. It was too hellish for me to talk to people. I suffered at his hands if I even mentioned a co-workers name while we were both in the army. Most times inadvertently, so if you lay it out flat he â€œnever did anything wrong.â€

I grew up like this by my mom. She fucked me up. She destroyed me since birth, and I mean literally because she tried to kill me as a n infant from stress and abused me every day of my life until I was Big enough that when I hit back as a teenager i was strong enough to deter her.

On top of that Iâ€™m in the south and Iâ€™m somewhere in the LGBT acronym. My family hates me for it. I canâ€™t trust them.

Iâ€™m alone.

I finally made it out, but for what. I donâ€™t want to be here.

I donâ€™t know who I am anymore.
