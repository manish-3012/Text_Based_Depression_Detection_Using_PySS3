What follows are some incredibly depressing musings of a suicidal insomniac.âš ï¸âš ï¸This gets really sad guys. If you think it will hurt you, please read something else.âš ï¸âš ï¸

Lately when people talk about zombie apocalypses or a meteor hitting earth or nuclear destruction, I donâ€™t have the same fear response I used to. Iâ€™m almost comforted by the idea. 

Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself 3 or 4 times now, depending on how you count it. Iâ€™ve resigned myself to being alive, but Iâ€™m not always happy about it. Sometimes I am, donâ€™t get me wrong. But Iâ€™m constantly dancing between wanting the quiet of death, and wanting a quiet life. When it gets too loud, and too painful, I just want oblivion. Drugs help. But they donâ€™t fix anything.

So when people talk about the end times, I feel a weird mix of sadness, excitement, and calm. Iâ€™d be able to die and no one would care. Iâ€™d be able to fade from existence and it would be normal. Iâ€™m sad that everybody else would have to die, and I donâ€™t want the world to end, not really. But if it did, Iâ€™d be fine with it.

Is there any hope for me? Is there any hope for anything? Should we care about hope at all? I was taught that caring about things is the only way to give yourself meaning, but lately itâ€™s hard to care about anything. I get bursts of joy, and each one is shorter than the last.

I dunno. Itâ€™s midnight here, and I wanted to type this. Itâ€™s just a shout in the darkness that no one will answer. Iâ€™m okay with that. Thatâ€™s all life is anyway. Maybe thatâ€™s what makes it beautiful, our collective ability to shout.

If you want to call me â€˜deepâ€™ or edgy, go ahead. Right now I feel an absolute slump of emptiness and half baked apathy. Right now I hate myself. Right now I want to die. Any mocking you send me way would be like adding a cup full of misery to a swimming pool full of it.  I wonâ€™t hate you for it, Iâ€™d understand, so hit me with your best shot. I hope it gives you happiness. I hate myself so fucking much. Iâ€™m a fucking edgelord whoâ€™s never had an original thought or good thing to contribute to the world. My lukewarm grasp on the English language is the only thing I have going for me.

But, I digress, if the world ends tonight, I wouldnâ€™t be happy or sad, Iâ€™d be dead. Iâ€™m okay with that.

Goodnight world. I hope we all make it til morning.
