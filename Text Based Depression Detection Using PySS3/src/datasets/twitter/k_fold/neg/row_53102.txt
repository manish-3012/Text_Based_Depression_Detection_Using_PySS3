Do you ever just miss yourself?Like, the person you used to be when you were younger? Full of life, energy and goals.

Caught myself thinking this, I used to be so happy and innocent, now I'm hopeless in everything, all of my dreams are gone, I have no passion for everything, and completely tired â€“ always, no matter how much I sleep.

I'm only 19 (almost 20) and working in a dead end job in a office, about to quit college so I can save more money so I can leave my terrible third world country to search for a better life on the other side of the world, just start a new life, from scratch. I'm on the second semester of journalism and I only made 1 actual friend, who I haven't seen in 2 months â€“ he just dropped everything and completely ignores me.

I'm not even sure this "running out to the other side of the world" is the right thing to do, but, what else am I going to do? I'm completely useless and hopeless at everything. I feel like this is my last chance to find a reason to leave. And if everything goes to shit, I'll just check myself out. I was probably going to do it anyway at some point in my life, might as well be in a beautiful country in Europe.

I know no one is going to read this, but I needed to take some steam out, and I have no one to talk to. Also, sorry for my bad English, not my first language.
