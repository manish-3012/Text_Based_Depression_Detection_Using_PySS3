Shrooms made me realize that I want to commit suicide.I took shrooms a few weeks ago and had a lot of realizations that are ultimately leading me to heavily consider suicide. The shrooms gave me the ability to truly realize how small I am in the grand scheme of things. And it also allowed me to comprehend that moment of peace right before you die, when you know you're beyond saving and you don't have to worry about anything. All I can think about is that moment of peace. I can barely even comprehend it because I'm so used to just feeling anxiety or depression. My death won't affect anything in the grand scheme of things. Even my boyfriend and family's grief will eventually pass. Right now they are the only reason I haven't done it yet. I live with my boyfriend and it would just crush him. I'm all he has here at college. That's why I haven't done it, because I can't hurt him like that. But even that is starting to work less and less.

I'm just sitting here a lone in my room thinking how I want to do it. I think tonight I'm going to smoke all of the weed I have left and then jump off the bridge near my campus. I just want to feel better.

I'm sorry for the rambling. I didn't even really know what to say, so I just wrote what went through my mind.
