What keeps you goingI'm just so unbelievably sad. I've felt depression for so many years. I've felt such a flurry of emotions and fears. I don't know if I ever want to feel again. Is it really all worth it? What makes it worth it for you. Please tell me what makes you happy. What keeps you going or at least sane? I am 20 years old so I'm very young but I've fought this and fought this and I just hurt so violently but yet none at all.
