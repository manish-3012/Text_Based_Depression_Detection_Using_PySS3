I just tried to hang myself in my dorm while my roommate was in the shower.Title. I am failing all my classes and no longer have the energy to try. I stopped taking my depression meds a month ago bc they made me sick. But now my highs are higher and my lows are lower. I do not really have anyone else to go to.
