16. No real friends, no future. Little sis dead, living with an abuser and a family that doesn't care.Hi Reddit. This is going to be a little vent post.

I feel as if 2017 is the year I'll finally get to leave this place! 

I've had depression since I was a little girl, my parents didn't (and don't) care. I can't focus on schoolwork. I just imagine the ways I could escape, and get a bit giddy. 

My parents divorced a few years ago, after my mother began cheating on my father with an alcoholic and abuser. He'd hit her, steal our things, sexually harass me, and choke my sister. The police were called a few times, but they either decided there was nothing they could do, or my mother lied/refused to press charges. 

September 1st this year, my little sister (14) hanged herself in her room from the ceiling fan while staying home â€œsick.â€ I myself feel guilty for this, because my father (who she decided to live with) picked me up from school that day, and I asked to go to the store instead of asking to go home and talk to her. Maybe she'd be alive. I found out from my father at 9:37 PM that day, after my dad called me screaming. I was the one to call the police. She left no note. 

I have good grades, sure. But I feel as if they don't matter anymore. I don't want to go to college. I don't want to care about my future. I always told myself I'd kill myself before I turned 18, and so 2017 seems like a very nice year. I've tried three times- and my "friends" told me I was being an attention whore, and told me to use more pills next time. 

But this time I'll use something else. I won't be a coward anymore.
