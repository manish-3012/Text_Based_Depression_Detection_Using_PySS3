I want to die but not kill myselfI have been sad my whole life. I realize people have it worse and that makes me sad. People would dream to be in my shoes but that doesnâ€™t make me feel any better. I donâ€™t want to pass my pain on to others by killing myself. I know itâ€™s selfish but I want to be dead. I donâ€™t want to try to make myself better anymore. The worst part is that I do have people in my life who love and care about me and would miss me. That should make me want to stay here but it doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve attempted to kill myself one time but I called my mom after I took pills because I kept imaging the pain I would cause her. BUT Iâ€™M TIRED OF BEING STRONG AND SELFLESS. I want to do this one thing in my life for me. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. I used to be able to sleep and wake up better but now even my sleep makes me wish I was dead. Every time I drive or walk outside or am in public or at home, I wish some freak accident would happen that would kill me. 

I have two options: 

1) I could hire someone to kill me. 

2) I have gas in my house. I could have an accidental gas leak and kill myself that way, in my sleep. Then no one could blame me. It was an accident. 

I donâ€™t want a response from this honestly. Iâ€™m just putting my thoughts into space. I realized today I have been slowly planning for months. Making a will, giving away things, being selfless more and more, telling my siblings my passwords. I am now realizing that I am all set to die. And Iâ€™m excited. Iâ€™m just worried for my family. But I have to get past that. I need to do this for me.
