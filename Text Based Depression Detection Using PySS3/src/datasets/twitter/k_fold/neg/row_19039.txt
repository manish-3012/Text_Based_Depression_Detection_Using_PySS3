I don't know.This has been a long time coming for me, back in school, I was a straight A student in AP classes, pretty popular even. But at some point, something switched, I don't know why, but I became afraid of interacting with people, to the point that I would just spend my days sitting in an abandoned car in the woods rather than go to school.  Of course, being a cocky high school student I assumed I could just drop out and quickly get my GED. Unfortunately, everytime I went to talk to someone about it, I'd freeze up and just walk away.

Since then, it has just gotten worse, I can't deal with people at all anymore, I can't talk to friends or family unsolicited even when I really need to. Even going to a restaurant, I can't communicate my own order. Sometimes it has gotten to the point that I break down in tears when asked a normal question by a stranger.

Obviously, I am not really a functioning human being anymore. Without my dad, I'd probably be homeless still, and really he takes care of everything for me, but he is dying. I just don't want to wait until I die of starvation, or I am truly miserable and take my own life. It has gotten to the point that after every single task I complete, I ask myself: "Can I die yet?". The only highlight of my life at this point is when me and my friend go and do pub trivia(She does the talking, and I answer most of the questions.)

I have no money, no social skills, no education, the only means I make any money is building and selling gaming PCs occasionally, but I always take a loss... 

To be honest I feel like I am pretty dead-set on doing this at this point really, I am just waiting for my dad to pass so he doesn't have to know.

All that said, I know I need to at least allow someone to know about this. I mean, I obviously don't want to die, but I know where my life is headed, and it's worse. I want to go out on a high note.... If there are any left for me.

Ya'll have fun, and never forget to bring a towel.
