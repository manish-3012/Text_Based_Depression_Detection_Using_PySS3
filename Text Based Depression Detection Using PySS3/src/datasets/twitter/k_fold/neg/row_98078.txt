I'm feeling suicidal because I hate the way I look and feel like I'll never be able to truly physically attract anyone even after I lose weight.I have never felt happy when I look in a mirror. I went out and got a haircut and my eyebrows waxed this week. I've been eating better and working out and doing some skin care stuff.

And still when I look in the mirror or try to take a selfie I feel like I'm looking at a fucking monster. I hate it so bad sometimes I just want to punch a hole in the mirror or through my phone into the wall.

I can't express how much I hate the way I look. 

Today really just took the wind out of my sails. I posted on equalattraction for some dumb fucking reason yesterday. No responses. I figured that would happen though because I'm ugly as fuck.

But then earlier I was scrolling through that sub. I saw a girl and she was pretty so I just clicked on it and read the comments.

Imagine how shocked I was to see someone posted me as her match...only to be downvoted into oblivion. Then someone else posted another guy as her match. And looking at that guys picture made me want to kill myself. Seriously I just can't compare. No matter what I do, I will never look that good.


This makes me wander why the fuxk I'm wasting time in the gym and with this diet. It'll never matter anyway. I'm just a big black ugly fucking monster.

They called me that in high school. Some kid saw me and called me monster and people kept calling me that until I left the school.

But they were right. That's all I am.
