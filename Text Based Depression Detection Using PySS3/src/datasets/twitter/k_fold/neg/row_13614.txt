Molested again after almost a year of it being overBasically life has been rough lately. My uncle recently molested me again after almost a year of me escaping the situation. It went on for 3 years. I was finally beginning to heal. I was so numb during the time it was happening the trauma of it didn't kick in recently. I don't think I have the courage to out a stop to as my family doesn't believe me. I think I'd rather die than live through this again. I don't know that I'm going to do anything, but all my will power is saying to end it. I used to cut, I'm over 200 days clean. I don't even want to do that though I just want this to be over. I don't want to live to see a confrontation tear my family apart, but I also don't want to live dealing with this again. I just don't want to be here anyways. Only 2 people in my life would give a shit anyways. I've always been selfless, why not be selfish just this once?
