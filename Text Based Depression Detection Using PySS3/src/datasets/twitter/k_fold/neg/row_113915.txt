One step forward 10 steps back...So sick of being so fucked up all the time. Been in and out of hospital recently for my depression. The last time i was in for two weeks, the first time one week. I just seem to head on a downwards slumber the minute i'm back home. So sick of trying and seeing the damage in inflicting on the people around me.
