iâ€™m done. iâ€™m so fucking done.this world has gone to shit. with all of the racism and politics and riots and homophobia and sexism added onto my personal life, iâ€™m done. iâ€™m so stressed and this made it 10x worse. quarantine fucked me up so bad. so fucking bad. iâ€™ve tried to kms already and now iâ€™m so fucking tired again. iâ€™m being ripped apart from the inside. i hate my body even tho itâ€™s not even bad, my fucking eating disorder keeps screaming at me and i know itâ€™ll never go away. idc what anyone says none of this will ever end. depression is so fucking horrible and anxiety is so draining. iâ€™m done. itâ€™s over for me.
