I feel like dying is my only option.I really feel like just dying sometimes. I have really bad social anxiety and I keep making plans that I never even start. saying I'll get a job or my license. I look in the future and I know I won't be able to pay for a house, healthcare, or anything I want in life. I'll just live with my mom until she dies and then I'll be homeless. Maybe I'll be able to get disability but where I am you only get a maximum of 700 and less if they think it's not a serious health condition. With that money I wouldn't be able to afford anything except a house and food. I feel like my only option is to kill myself so that I don't end up becoming homeless and a burden.
