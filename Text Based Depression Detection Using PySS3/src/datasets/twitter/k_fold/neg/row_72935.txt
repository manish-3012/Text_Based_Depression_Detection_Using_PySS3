CuriosityI am way to curious to say what afterlife is like. Iâ€™ve thought about ending it a lot lately. These thoughts have made me realize that depression has to be a mental illness because my life isnâ€™t all to bad. Iâ€™m just sad a lot and canâ€™t live up to set expectations. 

Anyone feel the same way?
