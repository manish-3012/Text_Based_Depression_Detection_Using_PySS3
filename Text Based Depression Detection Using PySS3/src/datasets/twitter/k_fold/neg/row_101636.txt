The more I think about it the more I see my family as a cageI love my family and it makes me hate myself even more than I already do to find myself thinking like this. The closest thing I have to meditation has been thinking how easy it would be to tie a noose, how much better that would be but I know it would destroy my family if I did. And no matter how much I hate myself for the thought a piece of me resents them for being the only thing standing between me and my one remaining dream.
