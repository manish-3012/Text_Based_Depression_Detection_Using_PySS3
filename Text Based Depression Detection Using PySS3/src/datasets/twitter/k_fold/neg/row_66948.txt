My girlfriend considering suicide.I love my girlfriend very much And she loves me very much. Weâ€™re struggling economically as none of us have a job. Recently she met another guy, that she thinks of all the time. She tells me that she loves me, but in her head we are constantly fighting each other to win her heart. Sheâ€™s stopped seeing this guy, but she tells me that in her head I am still fighting this guy. She says itâ€™s too much to handle. And she wants to kill herself so she can rest. The only reason she hasnâ€™t killed herself yet, is because she doesnâ€™t wanna hurt me!

What can I do?
