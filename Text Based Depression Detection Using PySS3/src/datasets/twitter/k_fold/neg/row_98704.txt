I feel so aloneMy mum's in hospital and my boyfriend got angry with me on the phone so I have no one to talk to. I'm really sad today and he got annoyed because I don't feel able to do what he advises.

I want someone to notice me and help me. I live alone so no one would help for a very long time.

I hate being around people, it's exhausting. But I want someone to save me because I'm hurting so much.
