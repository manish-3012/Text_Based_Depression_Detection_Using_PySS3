Iâ€™m truly finally done with this lifeIdk where to start, Ives been through so many things over the years that to write out every incident that led me here , thereâ€™s not enough room in the post to fit it all so I guess Iâ€™ll just sum up  the highlights. multiple traumatic experiences with the suicide of famly , nearly killed my best friend. Enlisted and then got kicked out with only a few more months to go . Two failed marriages, a daughter who wants nothing to do with me . And just fuck up after fuck up. Iâ€™m a miserable person to be around and I say things I shouldnâ€™t. Tomorrow Iâ€™m starting the process of the Oregon death by dignity law. O yea Iâ€™m also crippled due to a diving accident in 2010 and Iâ€™ll never recover. Iâ€™m going to commit myself to psychological care to prove Iâ€™m sane and capable of administering a lethal does of medication on my own . After that itâ€™s just a 15 day wait until I formally ask for the medication a second time and I should be ok to finally end this cycle of pain
