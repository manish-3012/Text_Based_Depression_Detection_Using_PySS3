Thinking itâ€™s overHad a kid earlier this year and it wasnâ€™t what I expected at all. Everyone always talks about how beautiful and perfect it will be when you see your kid for the first time but thatâ€™s not how it went for me at all. 

My wife had complications and we went to the hospital at 8 months and they said that we had a choice of waiting 24 hours to see if her blood pressure went down or we could induce right away. I said since sheâ€™s obviously in danger we should induce and she agreed. It wasnâ€™t what either of us wanted and we werenâ€™t ready. We hadnâ€™t finished all the stuff we wanted to do to get our house ready and just felt under prepared. Labor and delivery took almost 36 hours and we had a healthy baby boy at 6 pounds who didnâ€™t need to go to the NICU. It was shocking and stressful for both of us and I was honestly more concerned with my wife being healthy than my son.

Fast forward 4 months and our kid seems like heâ€™s cried non stop. Weâ€™re stressed out and my job requires me to leave for  16-18 hours a day for a month straight every 3 months. Iâ€™m in the middle of one of these months and my wife calls me on a walk and says she is just over everything hates our son sometimes and just wants to jump in front of a car. I immediately leave work not even caring what it would do to my job and go to talk to her. She tries to act like everything is ok but Iâ€™m still shook from what she said and sheâ€™s said things a couple of other times that make me think sheâ€™s not ok. I end up calling an ambulance and she gets out on a med hold in a psychiatric hospital where they do nothing other than keep her locked up for a couple of days. 

Fast forward 5 months from that. Weâ€™ve done everything we can to repair our relationship. Our son is growing and doing well but my wife hates me. She doesnâ€™t trust me. Her family acts completely disconnected from me and everyone thinks I was just being dramatic and punishing my wife for saying she was upset. I donâ€™t know what do do anymore. My wife doesnâ€™t think anything I do with our son is correct and says she loves him more. She literally said that. And when Iâ€™m watching him and he cries she thinks I did it. 

On top of all that my time in the military has broken my empathy. I just donâ€™t care sheâ€™s upset I donâ€™t care when my son cries and I donâ€™t care that our familyâ€™s all donâ€™t like me. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m considering ending it. Iâ€™m trying to decide if a care and Iâ€™m thinking I really donâ€™t.
