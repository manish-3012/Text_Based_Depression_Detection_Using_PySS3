Someone talk to me, I just went through the most traumatic psychologist experience ever.I have no words I am shocked, went into this run down really weird and ghetto place / office, had to wait half an hour and then go into a room with a 450+ pound man on a couch with a tennis ball walker thing. The walls were scraped, the lights were broken and the room was almost dark. This was the most ghetto and worse place I've ever been too, one of his eyes were twitching too and he was being really strange and saying weird stuff. Sketchiest and most absolute ran down shit place that ever exists.  

Someone PM me I can't even check this, I need someone there for me.
