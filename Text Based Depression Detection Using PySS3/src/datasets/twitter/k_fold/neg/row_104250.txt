OMG itâ€™s so bad todayMy brain is broken. Today is especially bad. Itâ€™s been 6 months since my dad passed from COVID. Iâ€™m living at home taking care of my mom now. I have Bipolar and anxiety. Iâ€™m on Depakote but I have hit a brick wall. I see no point in life anymore. My son is grown and living on his own. I have no pets. My siblings and I donâ€™t speak. Iâ€™m not in a relationship although there is a guy I can booty call once a week or so. I donâ€™t drink or smoke or do any drugs. I have no hobbies and no interest in doing any. I have just sat in my dark room all day and sobbed. Iâ€™ve called my psychiatrist twice and emailed her once. No response. Fat lot of good she is.
