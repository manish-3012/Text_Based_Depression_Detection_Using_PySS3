I made a promise 2 years ago.I promised myself and my best friend that I would give myself two years. In those two years I would actively try to better myself and to not kill myself. I have gone to multiple doctors and tried therapy, I have continued my studies, got a job, I was on medication for a bit over a year, i have tried to become closer with my family, and my friends. Yet, itâ€™s two years later, Iâ€™m approaching my set date this Wednesday and still have no doubt I want to kill myself. I want to thank my best friend for supporting to me, and Iâ€™m so sorry I couldnâ€™t be better. I wish you the best life has to offer, and promise you I will be better off. Thank you. I love you and always will. Iâ€™m sorry.
