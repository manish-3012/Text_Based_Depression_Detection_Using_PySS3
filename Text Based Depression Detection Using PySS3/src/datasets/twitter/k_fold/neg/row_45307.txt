I just want to SCREAMI'm at breaking point. I have tried to hold it together for so long but I can't go on like this any longer. There's no point trying to get help because they're not going to fucking believe me anyway, nobody ever has. There's just so much fucking wrong with me and I can't even begin to explain what's going on in my head. My coping mechanism all this time has been to ignore my problems. Lock them away and pretend nothing is wrong and just get on with it. But life just keeps on crushing me more and more and I can't take it. Every time I try to open up everyone tells me to shut up. I feel like I'm going to explode. I can't live like this anymore but the thought of opening up to anyone makes me want to slit my wrists. I feel like a prisoner in my own body. I just want it all to fucking END.
