I'm apathetic and nothing brings me joy or hope anymoreOr well, nothing has for a very long time. Any possible future I could imagine feels like a drag, everything I currently do feels like a drag which is exhausting and I wonder if there is even anything that could make me happy. Meds and therapy haven't worked for me so I'm giving up on trying to find a solution to this feeling. 

I'm going to end my life because there's nothing that's going to make it feel worth living for me.
