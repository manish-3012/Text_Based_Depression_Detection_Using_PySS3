Listening to the same song from almost a decade ago...truly feel terminally illNearly a decade ago, I listened to "Not Afraid" on repeat, trying to find and believe in recovery...slumped into a chair. 



Today I'm listening to it again and I know with all my being... I just know I will never find it and dying is the choice. And Ive been sick even before that. It's been 18 years and I'm not strong for hanging on and making it this far. 



No, I am weak for living and burning relationships, friendships and wasting space. Year after year. I swear I've tried. Inpatient three times, residential for weeks, five outpatient programs, medications, meditation ...



Im not looking forward to Christmas. I don't want New Year's to come, but maybe if these will be my last, I can try and gather the energy to fake happiness the best I can. 


Thanks for letting me vent and not feel alone.
