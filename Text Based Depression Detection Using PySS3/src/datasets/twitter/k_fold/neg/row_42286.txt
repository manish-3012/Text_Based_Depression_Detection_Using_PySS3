Feeling so lostI have no ambitions or goals in life. I'm 20 with no job, not at uni and no drivers licence. I feel worthless and have not a single clue on what to do with my life. My friends are all making it in life and seem happy, whilst I'm here waiting for death. Crazy how as a kid i figured i would be dead once i was 30 and now i feel as though it'll probably be true.
