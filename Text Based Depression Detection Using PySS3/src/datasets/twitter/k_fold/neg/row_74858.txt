Nobody knows the truthI'm getting closer and closer to the day a head to a pawn shop and buy that 9mm I've been looking at and heading to the river then blowing my brains out. Nobody knows how I feel Inside and nobody cares enough to ask. I go to work everyday with a smile on my face and depression in my head. A few years ago I attempted to drink bleach and kill myself but it failed and landed me in a mental hospital and that was the first my parents ever heard of my depression. A few weeks later I got out and told my parents I was better  (I lied). Skip forward a year and my girlfriend of 2 years dumped me saying she liked girls  (but currently has a boyfriend) but it was because I was just too closed off to the world. I messaged her so angry telling her I was going to slit my wrist and so on blah blah and my imessage was signed in on my mom's phone so she seen it and asked me about it so I lied again saying I was just upset. 




And now here I am today. Thinking about blowing my brains out. An i will  soon
