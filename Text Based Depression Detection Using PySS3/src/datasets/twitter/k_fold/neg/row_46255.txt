Does anyone want to live but want to die too?I want to live because there is some happy times and moments but most of the time my life sucks i ruined my life in may this year and i have tried to kill myself 2 times since then but failed. I want to live like but the days i hurt so bad make me want to just die so ill never be hurt again and people wont have to put up with me anymore then. I am so torn between living and dying i just dont know what to do. Will things get better? or will they stay the same like they did for last few months if so i just want it to be over now if nothing will change. Only one person talks to me but she stopped the last few days because i think she finally had enough of putting up with me and finally doing what she wanted to do which was to stop talking to me. Maybe she is just busy or life is in her way or something but i doubt that going off how often she talks to other. Is it time to finally leave this hell? My life is a fucking mess and my head is a mess. Just dont know should i go die this week or should i keep going and see will it get better. I cant see it getting better if i am honest. I know no one will probably even bother to reply to this but idk guess i am just lonely now she stopped talking to me. I need to prepare everything if i decide to go through with it. Hope my family will understand and i hope she will too and hope she does not blame herself as shes  the one who ruined my life and only thing i have left to hold onto.
