kind of want to give upi really just dont feel like im able to do it anymore

2 jobs and school is just exhausting, and i feel like i annoy people. i'm afraid i won't pass classes but i'm too lazy to do anything about it. i'm embarrassed to admit that and i know i would disappoint people if i failed

especially with what happened today i really just feel like opting out.
