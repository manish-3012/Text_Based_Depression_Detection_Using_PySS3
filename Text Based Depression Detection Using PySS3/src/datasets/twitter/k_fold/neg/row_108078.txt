I have nothing leftI've experienced probably the most traumatic year of my life next to the years as a child I was sexually abused. I'm living out in the middle of nowhere with no transportation because I had to drop everything and move due to my mother's disability. Car stopped working a month after that and can't afford a new one or to fix it. 

My one and only friend recently dropped me because she can't handle my situation or the depression it brings. Talking to her was the one thing I could look forward to outside of these 4 walls now that's been ripped away. 

I love my mom and my pets but living the way I do feels so unbareable. I'm 18 looking at the responsibilities of someone in their 40s. I'm not in college like normal people my age or at least working. If I could just make a rash decision i'd probably end it.

I don't see a way out and things inevitably find a way to get worse.
