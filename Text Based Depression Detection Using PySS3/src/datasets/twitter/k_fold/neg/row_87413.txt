just don't see the pointAs school progressed, I became more depressed by the day, and I broke up with my girlfriend so I could fix my issues. Now I just don't see the point in life. I lied about some things afterwards, but I never stopped wanting to be with her. Now it's a struggle to keep her on the phone for a few minutes and even then she won't always talk to me. I want nothing in the world but her. Now I feel like every step I take is just more into the wrong.   I think now a few too many pain meds might just help me more than anything can
