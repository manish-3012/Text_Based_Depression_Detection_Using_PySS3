College: Need Some AdviceRight away: thanks for reading, if anyone does.

Last semester(1st year of community college) was an utterly miserable experience, driving me the closest I've ever been to killing myself. I really don't wish to repeat that; over break I've fostered a lot of positivity, and I don't want it squandered by the stress of school so I can fall back into my destructive habits. Hell, I already have just anticipating this upcoming semester. 

I don't feel ready for college at this point in life(I am intent on going somewhere down the line), and I wanted to take some time off to regain my bearings prior to this year. 
However, I live with my mother and she overwhelmingly encourages me to continue(and convinced me to go in the first place) because financially, it is worth it. Despite voicing my mental health concerns, she is unwavering in her stance that I ought to stick it out and attend this semester. 

I acknowledge that going to school and applying myself could surely be good for me(and is irrefutably a good idea financially), but my attitude isn't there - if that makes sense. I'm too depressed at the core to be invested, I feel. I'd much rather be taking time to work on self-improvement and pursue long-latent goals so that I have a happy(or content, realistically)baseline, one that I can eventually enter college with so that the process of education isn't one which is conducive to a downward spiral of depression. 

Maybe that's just a ridiculous, foolish pipe dream.

I really just don't want to wind up dead because of the stress.
