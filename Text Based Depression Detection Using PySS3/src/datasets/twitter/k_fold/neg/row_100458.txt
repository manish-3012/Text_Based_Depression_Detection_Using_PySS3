a reset button would be fucking nicerewinding my life and even just these past couple of weeks i've made so many dumb fucking decisions because of anxiety or depression i am tired of dealing with the feelings of guilt and regret. sometimes i think maybe i'm just full of shit because i don't think too poorly of myself and haven't really had a difficult life or childhood, but holy shit is thinking about the past fucking killing me. the problem is the pattern keeps repeating i always pussy out of anything i should do i was always a coward and soft, always ran instead of fight, always allowed for people to push me into the ground and hope its gonna stop eventually. i cannot control my anxiety it is literally crippling, comes on in social situations mostly. having thoughts of killing myself right now because these past couple of days a bunch of shit happened (or rather didn't happen) and I cannot take this bullshit anymore. maybe i am not cut out for this world and considering i'm gonna die anyways might as well make it easy on myself right? only issue i have is my family's reaction. couldn't imagine bringing them the pain suicide would bring, so i guess i'm not really going to end it but the thoughts of killing myself are just so comforting right now.
