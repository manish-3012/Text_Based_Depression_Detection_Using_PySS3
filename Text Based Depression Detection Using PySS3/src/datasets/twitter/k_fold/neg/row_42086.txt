I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been this closeI donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been this close to suicide. Iâ€™ve always been depressed and suicidal but itâ€™s so bad recently. I work a dead end job, have no friends, except my boyfriend who I do think I love but I feel like I just have him around because if I didnâ€™t,  I would literally have no one. Everyday I wake up and all I think about all day is killing myself. I want to slit my throat in my bathtub. But heâ€™s probably the one whoâ€™d end up finding me if I didnâ€™t answer him.. I also donâ€™t want to burden my landlord, heâ€™s this super nice old guy. I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do. I want to commit myself to the hospital but thatâ€™s a fucking mess. I just want to sleep and not wake up. Wish there was something I could take.. or maybe drink myself to death. But I need it to be for sure. I need it to work. I donâ€™t want to wake up the next day feeling even worse than before. Iâ€™m just feel like Iâ€™m out of options. Im 22. Itâ€™s just so hard. Itâ€™s always been so hard and doesnâ€™t get better. Just venting.
