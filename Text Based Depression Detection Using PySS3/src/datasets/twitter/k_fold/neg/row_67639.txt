Has anyone experienced this?I donâ€™t have any memory of this because of my age and probably my mind, but thereâ€™s evidence it happened like a court case etc so itâ€™s real. I was sexually assaulted as a child. 

The thought that I was hurt in this way as a child definitely hurt me. I found this information out at a young age too, so not good. I never really faced the truth of accepting this as something that happened to me and never really talked to anyone about how it made me feel. I lived my life in this anxiety/depressed ridden bubble, also had a couple of traumatic things happen since but not near as bad. As young as elementary school I can remember wanting to die and being in so much pain internally but not knowing why. I tried once, but got scared when I realized thereâ€™s no going back. Iâ€™ll spare details. 

I always felt like I just wanted to be done with and end it. Well 20+ years later I finally seeked professional help for my anxiety and depression. I wanted to tell my therapist about this thing that happened to me in my life that I have no recollection of. Well the day before this specific session I had my first panic attack that I at least can recall. 

I was going to tell my bf about what I wanted to talk to my therapist about, the sexual assault. I immediately fell into the attack and completely disassociated. I felt like I had no control over what I was saying or thinking and I remember telling my bf some disturbing things that were very detailed but it all felt like a dream. In this state, I remember either thinking or saying (I canâ€™t tell you which my thoughts felt LOUD) the only way out of this dream is to kill myself and then thinking or saying how I didnâ€™t want to because I was happy now and of course crying hysterically. 

My bf put me to bed and I woke up to him looking at me very worried. I couldnâ€™t remember a lot and it all felt like a dream. He wouldnâ€™t disclose details to me about what I said and I didnâ€™t press because I vaguely could recall some of it and it was awful. I could tell whatever I said really hurt him because he was on the verge of tears. 

My therapist couldnâ€™t give me details as to what my brain did or what that even was. Iâ€™m curious if anyone has ever experienced this or have an idea what happened? 

Now, Iâ€™m doing much better and have learned to manage my anxiety and depression.
