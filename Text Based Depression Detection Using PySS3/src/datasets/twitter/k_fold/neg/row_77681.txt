Today's The DayI've been praying it would happen by accident for the last decade, but I'm too tired to continue down this road any longer. Haven't felt anything for years, so I can't imagine putting a bullet through my chest will be any different. I've only made it this far because it would hurt my parents, but I don't care any more. It's time for this to be over.
