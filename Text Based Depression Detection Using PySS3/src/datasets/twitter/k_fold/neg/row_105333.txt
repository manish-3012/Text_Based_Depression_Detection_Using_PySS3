I'LL KILL HER THEN MYSELFSHE DOESNT DESERVE YOU. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE MINE. SCREW EVERYONE.

No one deserves my goodbye. I was too good for this world. You all contributed. I'll kill everyone who hurt me. ALL THE PEDOPHILES. ALL MY RAPISTS. FUCK YOU. 

And of course thank you to my boyfriend who is trying his hardest. 

I'll meet you in the afterlife. I love you.

 I said I would get help. I need to get this out. Then I'll go get help. Of course I cant actually do what I say. That's who I am. Fake. 

  
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful.
