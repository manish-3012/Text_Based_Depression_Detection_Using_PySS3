I'm burnt out, I have nothing to show for it, and I never will.I'm spread so thin. I'm so exhausted. I dont get sleep. I dont get to laugh anymore. Even if we weren't on lockdown I wouldn't be living any kind of life because I am isolated anyway. My job is going to fire me soon. My school dropped me from all of my classes because I was too fucking stupid and didnt even know my account was overdue. I'm so behind everyone else and I have to work so much harder for just a crumb of stability or just something to show for it. And in the end nothing was worth it. I'm tired of everything in my life being a fucking constant battle and constantly humiliating and disappointing myself. There is no life worth living for me. I DONt want to have to fight constantly and overcome everything I just want one fucking thing in my life to be dependable
