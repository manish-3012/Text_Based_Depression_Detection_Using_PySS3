I set the date for Nov. 1. Advil and Bleach.I'm thirteen and i cut. I feel like a failure and a disappointment. Everyday I wake up alive is a day of money, energy, and breath wasted. I'm fat and I don't deserve to live. I guess I'm kind of at peace for now. Everything is set up. I have a plan that's probably too detailed for my shit. I'm selfish to think this way, I know. People have it worse than I do and they care too much for me. They should give all their attention to my younger sister. She's kind of spoiled, but she's really smart and talented. I wasted my time when I was younger and didn't work hard enough. I ran away from home when I was nine, heading for the railroad tracks, not to run away after my mom and dad dragged me down the stairs and tried to hit me with a hobby horse. I was barefoot and was dragged home by the police. From then on, I started to be depressed. On some days, I would withdraw from my family and friends. My mom and I fought more often. She cared about high math grouping. High grades. She made sure I didn't read too much fiction. She pushed piles of non fiction books at me. She told me I wasn't smart. She denied she ever said anything when I confronted her. I started to cut when I turned eleven. Just scratches, no blood. Then I found glass and a scalpel. I cut deeply until my mom found out. She gave me the silent treatment for a day. Then I found myself halfway up railing on the Kennedy center roof in DC on a school trip. I regret not jumping. I cut more. I cried over a bottle of pills. I wrote over five separate note hidden in my room. I made a plan to jump off the golden gate bridge. I saw 3 therapists. And here I am now. I'm done with this life. A little over a month left. I've told myself to stay strong, keep the mask I've been keeping for four years from crumbling. I've given up all hope.
