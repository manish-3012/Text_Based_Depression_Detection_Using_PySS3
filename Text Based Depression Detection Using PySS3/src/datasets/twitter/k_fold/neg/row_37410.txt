Iâ€™m more scared of leaving my dog to my family than I am of dying.Iâ€™m a coward, and I wonâ€™t ever actually kill myself. Iâ€™m starting to commit educational and social suicide though.

Iâ€™ve failed every class this semester. And Iâ€™m lying about it to my dad. My dad is controlling every aspect of my life, and nothing I do is good enough. Iâ€™m a romantic failure, and even if I try really hard to show people the good I have to offer, I am just someone to leech off of emotionally.

My heart isnâ€™t in this anymore. I love my dog so much, and I have some of the nicest people that I can talk to online. But now my dad is taking my friends away since he sees them as dangerous since I havenâ€™t met them irl.

Iâ€™m not scared of dying. Iâ€™d just really miss my puppy. Heâ€™s a really good boy. So for now, Iâ€™ll settle with scratching my forearms with my nails and hope that itâ€™s not visible tomorrow.
