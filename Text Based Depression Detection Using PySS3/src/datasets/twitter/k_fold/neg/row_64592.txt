People get punished for wanting to kill themselvesIt makes me angry. My parents said that if I say I'll kill myself I'll be sent to the mental hospital and that those are the consequences for saying that. Maybe I just won't even mention it then and go kill myself anyways. Then maybe people won't use that as a punishment against suicidal people.
