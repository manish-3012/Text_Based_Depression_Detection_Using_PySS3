Feel like I'm getting closer and closerI'm probably about to get fired for the second time in just over a year. I have a mountain of student loan debt from getting a master's degree in a field I apparently suck at. Every day it just gets worse, and I dig myself a deeper and deeper hole. My job just beats me down every single day. Everyone in my life is sick of listening to me bitch about it, and I can't blame them. There are so many things I don't want to leave, and I hate the amount of pain I would cause, but I just want it to end.
