Of all the things I've lost I miss my mind the mostNot having a good day just sitting here smoking (yes I know I am evil) I'm just so exhausted from shitty sleeping patterns lately and from having to jam needles in my belly multiple times a day. And feeling like every coughing fit I have breaks my ribs repeatedly and the threat of valley fever rearing its ugly head again. I am just so tired I want to sleep till a cure is found for all of it. On top of that I am in my own apartment and my parents are starting the lectures on I should be saving some money every week from my weekly stipend except I have a bit of an ocd landlady who wants me to go out and buy stuff to protect the hardwood floor. Which I have done but has caused me to go broke the last 3 weeks in a row. Stop the world I want to get off I am just done with living like this I am not looking forward to my birthday in about a month.  Fuck this NOISE
