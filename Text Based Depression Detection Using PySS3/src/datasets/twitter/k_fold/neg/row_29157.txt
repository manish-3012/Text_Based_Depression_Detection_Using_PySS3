I'm so utterly alone and insignificantIt's a saturday night. I'm sitting alone in my room, crying my eyes out. I feel so alone and isolated. I have no friends, no girlfriend, no one who cares if I exist or not. I'm invisible and insignificant. Everyone I used to know has now left me. My own mother has said she wishes I was dead more times than I can count. Nothing makes me happy. There isn't a day that goes by where I don't think of killing myself. I'm ugly, have no social skills, unfriendly, no positive traits. Been this way for years. Don't see any future for myself. Will never find happiness. Just wish I could escape this miserable existance.
