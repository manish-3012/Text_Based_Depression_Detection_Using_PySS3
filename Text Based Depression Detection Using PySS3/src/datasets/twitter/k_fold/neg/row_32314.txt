I sad, depressed, lonely, overweight and dead from insideI just can't stay like this anymore. I hate my fat body, I don't have the confidence to talk to people which makes me isolated in a room whole day long. People stare at me in weird ways cause I'm very fat . For very long time I've talked to strangers in real life and my loneliness is killing me. I'm in financial crises and I tried to do some freelancing for more than a year and not even one paying client I ever got. I hate my laziness. I'm 20 years old with nothing worthy to live for...
