I'm about to start going to the psychiatristI'm scared, I really am... I'm 24 with 2 kids and going through separation with my wife (she left me), I've been feeling depressed and suicidal since I was 10 years old, but the separation and the pandemic took me to a point where I was with a belt on my neck just about to suicide, but I decided to take another chance (because I was already going with a psychotherapist) and I told her all of my suicidal ideas which I had never talked about with anyone besides my wife, she told me that I might need medication, so I'm ready to start not feeling anxious and depressed all day... Hopefully it will work, I'll try to keep my story and progress in here, because I think it will encourage people to get help, and be hopeful that we all can get through all that struggle.
