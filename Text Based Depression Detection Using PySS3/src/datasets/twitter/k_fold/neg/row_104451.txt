I want to be doneWriting this on my main because oh well. I feel like a toxic person. I just got out of a relationship and I hurt the other person post-breakup (emotionally). I apologized profusely but yeah. Reached out today to my previous ex to apologize for my actions 2+ years ago and found out she had to go to therapy after watching me try to OD and kill myself so many times. I push people away but I can.â€™tomorrow escape myself. Iâ€™m 20 &amp; in college and am looking forward to starting back at school but itâ€™s so hard to make it there. My mother is a narcissist and I was sexually abused. Iâ€™ve tried to kill myself many times but Iâ€™m just too scared. I plan on taking out a life insurance policy where suicide pays out after 2 years and leaving everything to my sister to take care of her. I donâ€™t want to live like this but I think Iâ€™m broken. I want to stop feeling like this but I canâ€™t get it to stop on my own.
