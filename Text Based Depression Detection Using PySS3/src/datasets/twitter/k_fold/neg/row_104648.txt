Feeling the worst I've felt yet.When I was a senior I started to feel depressed and overwhelmed but I never contemplated suicide and was critical of those who did. Close to the end of the school year one of my closest friends shot himself.

I decided to attend a community college instead of one of two universities where the only friends I had all left for. In the semester I was enrolled I started to speak to myself, referring to him as "Other (my name)". I decided I could save my mental health by going to university and it almost worked. For the first few months I spoke to myself less and less but then the depression came back harder.

I left the university, slept all day, and realized that I was talking to someone I call Barry, not "other Jon". I reached out for help from /r/depression and similar groups but was ridiculed and insulted for fearing that I would be judged for feeling this way.

Now I have to keep myself occupied at all times to stop thoughts of suicide and I take sleeping pills so Barry won't talk to me at night and I feel like I've lost every real person I know. 

I have trouble talking to people on the phone and need to find someone to talk to, is there some kind of reliable anonymous suicide help online?
