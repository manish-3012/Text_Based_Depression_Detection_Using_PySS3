The most pain I've felt.I was supposed to go in for a job interview today at a local restaurant, the first place to actually give me a response about my application and I was super excited. Then they called and said they can't hire anyone until May.

On top of that I've been sick since last night, and i think it's food poisoning and getting out of bed was hard as hell, let alone shower.

And the man I'm in love with broke up with me and I'm so lost and scared and I don't know if I can keep trying to be happy anymore.

I want to end it all so I can stop the constant stress and hurt and fear, but I don't think I could even try. I'll probably just live a sad and miserable life alone.
