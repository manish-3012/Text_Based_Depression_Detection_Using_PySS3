I tried to overdose on sleeping pillsAbout two weeks ago I decided that I was done. I took a lot of pills and tried to overdose. I ended up waking up the morning feeling like absolute crap. I couldnâ€™t even figure out if I was still alive or not. It took hours and even some vomiting to get back to a proper state of consciousness. Once I was I was devastated and angry that I was still alive. Itâ€™s been two weeks and I still feel that way. Iâ€™m worried I will try something like that again.
