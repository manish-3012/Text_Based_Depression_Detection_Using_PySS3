I feel like my suicide would be perfectly fitting/ poetic justice
Is that the right term?? This is what I mean:

As far as I know, my schoolâ€™s never had a suicide. If anyone should kill themselves (not that anyone should), it should be me. It would have the biggest effect if it was me. It would seem reasonable and people would be shocked but wouldnâ€™t be SURPRISED. 
I was very severely bullied every day for 4 years by 13 people, and about 6 at once. The teachers had never seen bullying so extreme. The ENTIRE YEAR hated me and almost everyone knew it. I was the most hated person in the year, maybe even the school, for NO REASON. Or at least nothing in my control. Bullying is one of the most horrible things of humanity. 
I have been depressed for about the last 2 years. And I have very very few friends and no social life at all. Having no friends damages your self esteem in every way possible. I never did ANYTHING intentionally wrong to the people who bullied me. I just burst into tears writing this. I didnâ€™t deserve a single SECOND of the hell they gave me EVERY DAY for 4 years ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

If I killed myself, all those kids would think â€œShe really did itâ€ and would say â€œWE drove her to thisâ€ and kids at neighbouring schools would say â€œYou know (my name) who got picked on? She committed suicideâ€ and â€œA girl from (my school) killed herself!â€ And â€œEveryone made fun of one girl for no reason and always made a joke out of her and were so mean to her and there were always so many bystanders but NO ONE EVER STUCK UP FOR HER because they all just wanted to follow the crowd, thinking â€œOh itâ€™s (my name) so itâ€™s okay to treat her like SHIT and look down on her and TELL HER to KILL HERSELF and then just go on with their day like itâ€™s nothingâ€ and now sheâ€™s dead.â€

Then my death could at least raise awareness and maybe (definitely) reduce bullying at my school and the pastoral support would double. Maybe that was my purpose after all. Also no one would care if I wasnâ€™t there.
I would walk into our house common room and the same boy would announce my entrance to the whole crowd and while everyone silenced would shout â€œGET OUT LARA. NO ONE WANTS YOU HERE.â€ in such a sincere way. They made it pretty clear I was unwanted there. 

No one really cares about me. Or maybe they all care, just not enough. 

The only way people would care about me is if I was dead. Similarly, Iâ€™ve been thinking.. what if the only way to not feel bad is to stop feeling anything at all, forever?

I donâ€™t want to stall too much so that Iâ€™ve left school when I do it because then the school wonâ€™t take responsibility and will be able to say it wasnâ€™t because of them. I donâ€™t want the wrong people to be blamed. 

I donâ€™t know how much longer I can go on. Itâ€™s like a candle is burning, and I donâ€™t know how much is left of it (height) but I can tell from the puddle of wax on top it isnâ€™t much. 

It wouldnâ€™t be a loss if I died and I would actually be doing people a favour.
