I'm sorry.I've wronged many people. I'm selfish, lazy and a mean person. I don't think about other people's wellbeing. I am a shit person. I want to commit suicide because of that. It's what I deserve. I don't know if it will make things any better but atleast I won't hurt anyone ever again. I don't know what else I can do at this point. Everyone hates me and I hate myself.
