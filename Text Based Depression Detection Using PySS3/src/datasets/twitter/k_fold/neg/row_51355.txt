I hate living with my brainI can't handel it if nothing changes. I moved away and started a new school where I'm supposed to live and make new friends. But it's same old shit. Same mental problems. I just can't get over the voices that are constantly filling my head with doubts. Making be overthink thing's and making me say stupid shit. I have allways been the weird kid. I've just gotten better at masking it. I feel like a fuck up. A screw up. I lose my temper over the stupidest shit. I get annoyed at small noices and I judge allmost everyone in my head because of my own shallow fucking mind sett. So many times I've tried to fix this shit. Woken up with hope, but it's all so poinless. A small victory means shit. It will allways end up the same fucking place. I have never gotten close to taking my own life, but I have thought about it before. I just want it to stop. Just for a while.

There is so much pressure to be social. I just can't handel it. I'm not good at making friends. Why do I have to be so shit at everything as well. How the fuck am I suppose to have any confidence. I have this fucking urge to have everyone like me. It fucks with me so bad. I just hate it. The worst it that I should have a good life. I just can't fucking do it. Everything needs to be perfect. Fuck me, fuck me. 

I just want to be at peache. I constantly feel like I need to be popular. Why? Idk. I just feel so hopeless. That's all. It's the same shit on repeat. I thought I would be more at peache when I was older, but I'm not. I might end it I just don't know.
