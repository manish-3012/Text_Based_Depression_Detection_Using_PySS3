i need some helpthis is a long thing

hi. im 13. ever since i was like 11 ive had a bad week every couple of months where iâ€™ve thought of suicide and such. since about january though, itâ€™s become every single night iâ€™ve thought and done some suicidal stuff. i havenâ€™t ended up in hospital, and nobody has ever noticed this. for the past 2 months itâ€™s just been 24/7 suicidal thoughts. 
the issue here is, i donâ€™t really have the other symptoms of depression (weight loss/gain, not leaving the house, etc) i donâ€™t do the stuff i like to as much though, but itâ€™s not noticeable. i donâ€™t have a good relationship with my parents where i could tell them this stuff. they give me the responsibilities of my parents, but the freedom of a 4 year old. 
i just want help with this stuff, i hate wanting to die but it seems like the only way i could get out of this hell that is my life.

basically, how do i tell my parents (or someone that can help) that i feel like this.
