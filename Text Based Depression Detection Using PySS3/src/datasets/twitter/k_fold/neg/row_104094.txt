Regrets of a man too weird to live.Supposedly I'm some sort of prodigy.  160+ VCI, calculus at 12, grad classes at 16, you get the gist.  But I can't keep living up to expectations.  I have ASD, and although I'm "high functioning," I never feel like it when dealing with quotidian, everyday tasks.  Maybe I have some ability in a few academic disciplines, but when it comes to real life I'm completely retarded.

I hate dealing with people.  Always have, always will.  I had some very bad experiences as a young child and first considered suicide at 7 or 8.  The psychological trauma I suffered has persisted for almost 10 years, but my paranoia has recently intensified.  Perhaps my contemplation of how arbitrary, cruel, and fundamentally self-centered humans are has led me to this point.

I'm isolated on so many levels.  My disability renders me incapable of navigating many practical social encounters (although I understand social conventions *in theory*), and my ability has produced interests shared by very few of my coevals.  I don't think I'll ever marry, have true friends, or network properly.

I can't write my way out of a paper bag, so the college admissions process is going to fucking crush me.  Even if I make it in on academics alone, I'll have to choose between a quality education and getting credit for the work I've already done.  I neither want to languish in Calc III when I was doing the equivalent at 13 nor be forced to receive subpar instruction.  But I can't have all that I desire.

Everybody hates me.  I even hate myself.  Why the fuck should I keep going when my slowly-decaying cadaver is going to wind up six feet under anyway?  Why prolong the agony for the few tantalizing scraps of hope interspersed throughout it?  Our species is a blight upon this world.  Technology will soon obviate concerns of privacy.  We'll all be forced into utter capitulation to the whim of Big Brother.

I just want the nightmare to end.
