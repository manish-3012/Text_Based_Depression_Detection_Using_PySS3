It's Going to be SuicideI have every reason to be happy. I've been through countless hours of therapy over the years with multiple therapists. I've tried every drug combination. It doesn't work.

I don't have a timeline, but I've started to come to the point of accepting that when I do die it will be at my own hands. I've thought and researched enough that my plan is more detailed than I'd ever fully admit to a therapist.

My writing in my journal has become increasingly suicidal. I've got rid of everything I own and live like a monk. Everyday I make some sort of arrangement for death. Today I adjusted the trustees on my bank and investment accounts. Every arrangement makes me feel lighter and I wake up the next morning happier.
