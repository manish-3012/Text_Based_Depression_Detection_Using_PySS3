Is it bad that I want people to think I attempted suicide?Iâ€™m begging for the help I need, Iâ€™m on my hands and knees, nobodys helping me. My school doesnâ€™t give a shot about me, they donâ€™t want me there and have now forgotten about me. Iâ€™m not getting the support from medical professionals because Iâ€™m on a waiting list, and Iâ€™m not â€˜high priorityâ€™ because apparently I havenâ€™t told them enough about the constant suicidal thoughts I suffer with, every waking moment of my life. Apparently being kicked out of school and having no future is not enough. Apparently not leaving my room in months on end is not enough. Apparently self harming seriously isnâ€™t enough. Nothing is enough to get the help I deserve, theyâ€™ll only take me seriously if I attempt suicide obviously. Iâ€™ve attempted it before, but havenâ€™t told anyone. If I told them now, they wouldnâ€™t believe me, theyâ€™d dismiss me as attention seeking. I donâ€™t get what else I can do anymore
