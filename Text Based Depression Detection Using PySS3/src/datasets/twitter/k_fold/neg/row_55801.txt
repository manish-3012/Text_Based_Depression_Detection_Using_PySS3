In case things turn out uglyHello guys. I'm at a point in life in where I may end it up if things get bad enough. I have had enough of the struggle and of the addictions , and of the misery and of myself. I carry 800 mg Doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant) from an old prescription) in my pocket at all times. I am positive this dosis would be enough. My question is the following:  there another way more instantaneous and less painful and more low-profile to die? Theoretically I could go to the bathroom at work in one of those horrible  anxiety-attack episodes that I have and take the pills, however I don't know how many minutes it will take and if I would suffer too much pain from headaches and smotach that I would cry involuntarily and people could hear me. Isn't there something like cyanide that spies used in the cold war for those cases they got uncovered? That would work fast enough.
