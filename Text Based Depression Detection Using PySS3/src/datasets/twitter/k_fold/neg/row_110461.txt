Whys it so hard?Last night I got drunk, wrote a suicide note, laid out my diaries that are filled with every suicidal and depressive thought of the past year, and tried to hang myself.

I've been on anti depressants for only a week and they've taken away my fear of killing myself, before I would chicken out and breakdown, this time I sat trying and trying for an hour. and I can't cry anymore.

There's no where I can drop from so I go with one of the methods that just cuts off the carotid arteries. And it just hurts. Maybe I'm not cutting off the carotid arteries enough. It's one of the worst pains I've ever felt in my head, it's a throbbing at the front of my brain and it almost feels like two knives have been inserted above my eyes.

I kept trying but I wasn't falling unconscious whatsoever.

At one point I started a stopwatch on my phone to see how long my attempts were, one was 24 seconds before it hurt too much. I tried adjusting what I was using so it cut off my airwaves too but it just made me choke and cough.

My last attempt, I didn't time it, but instead sang along to the song playing on my itunes in my head, as it was distracting me from the pain. It was the longest attempt until it hurt too much and a Kayne song came on, and I wasn't fucking dying to Kanye lmao.

I gave up. Put everything away. Went to the bathroom once more before going to bed and noticed my eyes were completely bloodshot and I have burst capillaries all over my face. They're still the same now 12 hours later.

Why's it so hard to die? I don't know how people successfully do it.
