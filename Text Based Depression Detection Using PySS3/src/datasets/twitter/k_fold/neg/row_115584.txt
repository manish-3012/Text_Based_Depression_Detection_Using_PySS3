Life is just too much I don't know how to take itMy only reason to live is because a fucking video game I like is getting an update soon. That's fucking it. I have some stupid hope that that update will be the thing that magically makes me happy and gives my life meaning.

I'm so fucking pathetic.

You know what's going to happen when that DLC comes out? I'll play it for a few hours and realize that my life is still shit. I'll realize that I'm still worthless garbage who is just a drain on society. I'll realize that all I contribute to the world are memes I took two minutes to make and regurgitations of tired jokes. I'll realize that that will never change and that it would be better for everyone if I just died.

I'm still thinking of how I'd do it. There are some good options. My mom's gun, the train track within walking distance...

I'm shit. My life is shit. I make everything shit.
