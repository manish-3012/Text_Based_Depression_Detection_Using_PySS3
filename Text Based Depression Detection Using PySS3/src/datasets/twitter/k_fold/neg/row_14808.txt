Depressed, crohn's disease, feeling like I want to fold the cards and play another hand.I'm depressed, tired, feeling like the cards aren't in my favor.  I'm sure I'm not the first, or the last to say this.  But I dont know what to do.  I have crohn's disease, which really changed my life.  I have an engineering degree which I've somehow been unable to sucessfully turn into a career, or even a job.

I am not acutely suicidal.  However I think about it all the time, in the context of, is this an acceptable choice?  Do I really want to live thru all of the disease flares, depression, pain, financial strain - or should I be easy on myself.  Endlessly looping thrugh thoughts along those lines.  It's a terrible way to live.  I don't know what to do.  

I had seen the effects of chronic illness to older family members growing up, from as early as 9 or 10 I remember promising myself that if I were to ever become seriously injured or disabled I would decide not to live.  4 surgery's, an entirely deaf ear, multiple auto immune disorders later I'm now understanding I grew up with this understanding because I was so fearful of what I saw my family members going thru, and now I'm left debating where exactly that line is.
