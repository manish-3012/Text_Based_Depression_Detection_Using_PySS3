What counts as a suicide attempt?I've walked to a local cliff every few weeks for a few months now. Is that usually considered a suicide attempt or is it just meaningless? I guess I'm just curious about where I am compared to others - have I made dozens of attempts? I've tried using other means (pills, salts etc.) which do count. 

I carry a suicide note with me every day (just in case I get the courage) and sometimes go over after work. I know I'm getting closer. Lately I've taken to balancing on the edge like a tightrope. Honestly in those moments I almost feel free. I am jealous of those who can buy a gun. I know I could pull a trigger.

From what I've read I'm likely to regret it on the way down, but that's OK. 5 seconds of regret is better than waking up every day being disappointed that I'm still alive.

The worst part is when I walk home after going to the cliff. All I've done is failed again. Soon I'll manage it, I'm getting so close now. I'm going to go every day this week. I only need to succeed once.

Why am I writing this? Maybe I just want attention. That's probably true. I'm reading this back and it's just the rambling of an insane person. I guess that's also true.

I guess I just want to 'speak' honestly. I haven't had a real conversation with someone for months now. Every time I talk to somebody at work, which is the only time I ever speak to other people, half of my thoughts are just me screaming at myself 'WHY AM I STILL ALIVE? YOU'RE ALREADY DEAD INSIDE, JUST DO IT YOU PIECE OF SHIT'.

Thanks for reading. It feels good. I really think killing myself will both be the most difficult thing I've ever done and my greatest achievement.
