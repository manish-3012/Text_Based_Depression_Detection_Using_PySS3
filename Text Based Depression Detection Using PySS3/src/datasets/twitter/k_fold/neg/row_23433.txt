I have ruined my potential life, I have a 0.8 GPA.I was diagnosed with severe ADD at the age of 10, but we could not afford the medication until now, at the end of my Junior Year. It will be Impossible to bring my GPA up, and Im also very unlikely to graduate. This disorder has ruined my life, and I have no idea what I will do. I see my friends pass me by, advancing through life, learning to drive, getting jobs, scholarships, and I will be left behind, scared of being an adult. I always feel like I'm being watched, even alone in my own room. I just don't know what to do.
