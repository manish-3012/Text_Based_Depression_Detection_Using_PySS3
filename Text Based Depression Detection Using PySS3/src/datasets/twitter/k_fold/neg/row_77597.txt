I'm finally going to see a psychiatrist tomorrow, but I don't know what to talk about.My thoughts come and go and the only reason why I'm seeing him is because I had a mental breakdown during a test in school and wrote a lot of negative words I felt all over my test and simply turned it in. Is it possible to break free from these thoughts and will this psychiatrist help?
