No more happiness?It's scary... realizing nothing makes you happy anymore. It's been half a year since everything started. Everything started going down hill. My days are full of tears and painful thoughts which lead to highly considering suicide. I'm sure many can relate...?  
Just turned 18 though and I don't see how someone's supposed to keep fighting thru all the pain when nothing manages to bring them joy. How do you manage to go to school/work with that in mind?  
It feels like I've fallen in this dark pit of pain... and it's making it seem impossible to get out. I'm just trying to avoid falling in deeper. Advice...?
