i'm in too much paini can't take more of this, i failed my suicide less than two weeks ago and since i got out of the hospital i feel even more horribly bad all the time


i'm just suffering so much, it's a total hell, i should be happy, i'm with people i love with all my heart but i can't even feel any spark of joy, at best i'll be hyperfocusing on a game and feel more neutral for a little bit then it's just excruciating pain all over again


i don't think i have enough meds left from the last time to do a successful attempt and i hate this, also peoples irl would stop me from most of the possibility i could have

i'm too weak to bleed to death, ironically i'm traumatized of seeing peoples i love doing it


i have no escape, nothing help, it's just pain and more pain and how am i supposed to survive to this, it's horrible


i don't even want things to get better anymore, i want it to end, for good, i don't want to suffer while doing so tho, i don't want any more pain, physical or emotional
