AcceptanceI watched a TV show today. One of those silly family soaps. The feel good town and the little dramas that happen. And one of the main characters died in an accident. He was fairly young, had a child and a loving family and friends....I absolutely bawled my eyes out....the emotions hit me....

Not one person in my life would react with that kind of sadness that you see on there. Not one person would care like that....and honestly....I thought....I wonder when my time will come....sooner I believe....

But I guess its the portrayal of the hurt and sadness that would occur....but its not real life....that doesn't always happen in real life....and it sure won't happen in mine....I guess that's a good thing in ways....

I'm sad that no one cares. That I'm not good enough for anyone to give a damn. I feel so worthless. And the loneliness is eating at me. 

But I guess that's life for now....until it becomes time....
