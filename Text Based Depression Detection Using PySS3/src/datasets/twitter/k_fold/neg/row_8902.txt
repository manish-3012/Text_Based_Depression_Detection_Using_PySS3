I've been fantasizing about taking my life since I first had a grasp on what exactly "life" was. Suicidal tendencies is just literally a personality trait of mine at this point. I'm tired of people trying to understand my perspective when they can't. Or acting like their words mean anything to me.I dont fucking care if people can understand where I'm coming from. I dont want them to. I don't want anything. I'm going to be a useless drain on this fucked up system until I eventually kill myself. Years, maybe even decades from now. I'm going to get no where and do nothing. I wont ever have friends, and when the few (very old) family members that I'm in touch with die, ill be totally alone. And they have no fucking problem reminding me all the time that theyre going to die soon. 

I just don't understand why someone would take the time to talk me down, when thats the reality I face. Oh fuck if my life story was brutal to listen to up till now, it is gonna get a loooooooot fucking worse from here on. I've always wanted to be a mom just to get one fucking stab at my own mother by showing her i could do it a million times better than she did, but then I'd kill myself eventually and leave this theoretical child to the same fucking fate I've seen others relegated to. So even my dreams in life end up being nightmares eventually.
