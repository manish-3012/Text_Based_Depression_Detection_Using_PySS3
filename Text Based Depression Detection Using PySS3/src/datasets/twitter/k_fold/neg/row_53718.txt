School makes me want to kill myselfI feel like Iâ€™m doing everything for nothing, losing money and losing time. I canâ€™t stop thinking of the past and I feel like I want to crawl out of my skin, theres no amount of washing that will clean me from feelings of being violated from an old friend that occurred years ago. 
Since then Iâ€™ve lost those who I thought were my friends. Iâ€™ve made new ones but I cannot help but feel detached. 
Today is 4 official months with the person of my dreams, but how can I ever maintain a relationship if these feeling come back. I feel like Iâ€™ll drag them down.
