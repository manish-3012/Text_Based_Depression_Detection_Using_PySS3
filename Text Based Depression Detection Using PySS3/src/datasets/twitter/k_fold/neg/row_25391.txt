I want to be dead, and not go through the process of dying.I want it to be quick. I hate the cards I've been dealt. 

I tried to make something of my life. Finished university, had my dream job, quit on my own demand. Have relationship. But I want to die every day, he thinks im ok. Thinking of hurting myself every hour. Closest thing I have to self harm is starving myself daily. Feels ok. Leaves no scars at least.
