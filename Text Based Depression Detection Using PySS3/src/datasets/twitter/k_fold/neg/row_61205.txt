things will never get betterI'm really really tired of hearing people say "it gets better". When? When is that supposed to happen. I've been hearing that literally my entire life. I'm almost in my mid 20s now. Maybe at...40? 50? When. I don't want to suffer just for the off-chance one day I won't want to die. I've actively wanted to die since I was 8. 8!! I'm 23! 
I'm in therapy. And I have an appointment to see a psychiatrist coming up. I just don't believe it'll ever be better. Ever. My uncle killed himself and my family is fine. Had fun at the memorial. Wasn't terribly affected. My mom legit told me that she thinks it's better when mentally ill people kill themselves because then they're happier and the people around them are happier because they aren't being drained by the person's mental illness anymore. What am I supposed to do with THAT?? Honestly, last month it marked 5 years since I last attempted, but I can't see myself sticking around for the entirety of 2019.
