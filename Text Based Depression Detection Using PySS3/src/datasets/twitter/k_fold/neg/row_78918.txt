QuestionsSo here's the gist of whats happening. I'm a 16 year old boy, very athletic, and supposedly borderline genius. Despite everything in life that is in my favor, I want to die. I can't explain this feeling. I know that my life is good. I live in a wealthy family and go to a very good private school. I know I sound like I'm bragging, but i'm not. Im just filling you guys in on my troubles. The problem is that ive wanted to kill myself since 5th grade, but i just don't have the balls to do so. i don't know what im gonna do. my parents are sending me to get tested for depression next week, but obviously I'm gonna lie to the quack because who cares? I have stopped caring about everything: my school work, wrestling, friends, and just about everything else. Every part of my life has started to go downhill. I have a nicotine addiction. I started because i didn't see myself living that much longer anyways (its been 2 years). I do everything that i can do wrong on purpose just because i can and i want to ruin my life as much as possible to the point that suicide is easier. I hide my pain behind a wall of edgy humor and random comedic feats. I used to be extremely popular, but i isolated myself from everybody and push away everybody that gets remotely close to me. To sum it all up, what should I do and if you guys have any methods of suicide hiding up your sleeves, I would be honored to hear them as long as they are quick and painless. To any of you that have taken time out of your days to read about this, i issue a genuine thanks towards you. please write suicide suggestions in the comments if you deem fit
