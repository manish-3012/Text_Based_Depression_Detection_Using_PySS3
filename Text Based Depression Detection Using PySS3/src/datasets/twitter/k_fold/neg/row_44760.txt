Did something greedy, immoral, selfishI was attempting to restore a wooded area overgrown with invasives. I cleared the invasive species, and a forester came in and told me to girdle (kill without cutting down) "undesirable" trees. I blindly listened and did it. Now I see the dead trees and I feel like an awful human being. I did plant thousands of tree seedlings in their place (over 5,000), but heavy summer rain, weeds, and deer have wiped many of them out. What eats at me is the fantastic, foolish greed that would drive one to remove native "undesirable" healthy trees in place of "better trees" in the woods. How could I have listened to this advice? Two of these "undesirable" trees were 50+ years old. Many were 15 - 30 years old. 

Now I find myself stuck in a toxic cycle of rumination, doubt, anxiety, and self critique. Some of the dead trees are in view of the neighbors, and I'm fearful that they know what I did. I also feel tremendous guilt for affecting their view of the woods. I have been working to clean these dead trees up and split them for fire wood. I have hand split 6 truckloads thus far...
