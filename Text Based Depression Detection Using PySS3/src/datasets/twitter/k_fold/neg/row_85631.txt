How do I just be happy?I've been suicidal for the better part of a decade now, and have survived 4 attempts now. This last week is the first time I've been kinda happy in a long time due to a really nice relaxing trip, finally meeting someone I like in person, and starting a new medication. However I can't shake the feeling of dread that it's all about to come crashing down around me. I'm worried I'm going to stress about this so much that I'll derail myself and that the sudden drop will kill me. How do I get through that feeling, and if I don't how do I stop myself from falling to hard?
