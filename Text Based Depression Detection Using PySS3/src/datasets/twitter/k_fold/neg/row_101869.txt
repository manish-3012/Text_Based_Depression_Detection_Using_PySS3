Zoloft is making me feel suicidal...Hi. I'm not even using a throwaway anymore because I don't care. I've been 25mg of zoloft now for only 5 days. I was told I wouldn't feel anything besides side effects, but starting the night of the first day I have had suicidal thoughts. It doesn't feel like I'm going to act upon them, but I keep making plans in my head. I've also had dreams about suicide since I've started Zoloft. Overall, I just feel really terrible all the time and the suicidal thoughts aren't going away. I'm also puking and I have terrible headaches. I won't bee seeing my psychiatrist until Thursday, but that seems like it's forever away. Should I ask for a different SSRI? Are there ones that work differently than Zoloft? I don't feel like this is the right one for me if it's making me feel this much worse...
