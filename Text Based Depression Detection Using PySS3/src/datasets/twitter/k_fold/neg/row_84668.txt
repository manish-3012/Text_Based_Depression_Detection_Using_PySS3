If Something Doesn't Happen In A Few Hours I Will Be Ending It TodayI've screwed everything up with my families money.  I tried to transfer so money into our bank account to get us out of overdraft but it didn't appear to go through.  I think there back got tired of my screwups and have closed the account.  My wife gets paid today via direct deposit, so if when I wake up in the morning and it's still in the negative that will be a confirmation of sorts.  She has no idea how bad our financial situation is.  Send like everything I do just makes the problem worse.  I'm just a terrible person who didn't want to go on anymore.
