I don't like being treated this way.I will try to make this short. Let's start with my mother, my mother has created some idea that it's okay to mentally  abuse your child that it's okay to bring him do and admit that you only want your "16" year old son for child support and lie to him about his angel of a father. I have done everything she has asked of me I get A'S and B'S and got a job (under the threat she would throw me out) I do everything for her! It has even come to the point where she causes me blackout anger: an example of this is I got into a fight and went for her *Throat* I would harmed her that night if not for my Stepdad who hates her as much as I do. I don't want to harm my family especially not the one who has birthed me. As a result I have contemplated certain "Things" and have tried once but to no avail. I just don't want to her anyone and I don't want to be angry for my entire life I want to move forward eyes towards the horizon but I don't know how.
