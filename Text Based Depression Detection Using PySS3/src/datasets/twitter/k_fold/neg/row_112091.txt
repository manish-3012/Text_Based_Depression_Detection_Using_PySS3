I thought I was doing better but I feel like I could impulsively careless end my life any time. Hard to gain stability.I thought I was doing better. Apparently not. Life sucks, I hate who i am, my future is glim and pathetic, ill always be alone and never better. Im jusr tired of it all and sick of who i am. All my effort to improve just feels fake and like im pretending very hard that theres hope or i can be ok etc when i know its a lie. I have no stability, i can gwt suicidal suddenly and just feel hopelesa and careless about my life. 

At these times, i have access to lethal means and feel like i coukd just do it. Im not even crying or anything, im not a good person and dont even care how my family will be effected. I could just do it and wont risk getting prevented
