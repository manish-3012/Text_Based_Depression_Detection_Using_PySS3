This is it.I finally am ready to just fully kill myself. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Nobody is on my side. My family hates me and I have no friends. Just now I spilled a lot of tea on the carpet/couch and I felt so bad. And then my grandmother made me feel like absolute shit. In her words â€œyou make me feel like an idiot, so I should do the same to you.â€ I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™ve been a year self-harm free and this time Iâ€™m just going to cut until I bleed out. Iâ€™m over it. Nobody wants or needs me. Iâ€™m better off dead. Thank you to anyone that reads this and just listens to my rant. Iâ€™m just so worthless and everyone hates me. Goodbye.
