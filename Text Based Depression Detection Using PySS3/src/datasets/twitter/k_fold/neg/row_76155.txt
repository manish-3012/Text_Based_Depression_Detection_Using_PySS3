Need GuidanceI have been feeling lost the past few days. Naturally I am an unhappy person but for most of my life I have been able to hide it. A year ago my best friend died due to drugs (which I got him) mixed with a heart condition. He died in front of me and might have been saved if I had realized he was dying rather than thinking he just passed out. Im not exactly depressed I just don't have a real will to live. The past year has further fostered this thought since my father has been working months at a time away from home and my parents have been fighting but nothing really worth complaining about but still I just seem to be getting worse. Yesterday, I sat when I was home alone and drank some whiskey from my parents. I played After the Storm which is one of my favorite songs while looking pictures of my friend. I began to drift into suicidal watches and got to the point where i got a knife and was planning on stabbing myself. I mainly backed out because while I dont wish to inflict pain on me but at the same time I dont want to deal with life. Obviously I backed out but now im just kinda confused.
