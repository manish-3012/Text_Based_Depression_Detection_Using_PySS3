I have no motivation and want to dieI can't get myself motivated to do anything anymore. I want to succeed in life and go to a good university but I can never make the effort needed to get it done. Very rarely I get glimpses of motivation but as soon as something isn't the way I thought it would be I plummet and lose all hope for my future and my life.  

Every day I think about how I want to die and ways of doing it and when I should do it. I think the only thing stopping me from doing it is how it would affect my family but lately I can't help myself from thinking about how they might not care. I usually can convince myself they will but lately it had been getting harder.

I can't maintain a normal sleep schedule anymore, now I just sleep till 5pm and am awake till 8am. I've tried to talk to family or even councilors about what is happening but I've lost trust in telling my family these things and the last councilor started to ignore our calls to book appointments.  Whenever I do try to tell people how I feel I can't fully tell them the truth and end up lying to them so they don't have to worry.

I hate everything about myself, I hate my hobbies I hate how I am a failure and I hate how I put on a mask to keep my friends and family from worrying. More and more lately I just don't see the point of living and I'm struggling keeping my emotions in check. One minute I'll be "happy" sitting there watching a show and the next minute I'll be super sad thinking about how I want to die or super angry wanting to break something.

I don't know why I posted this on here maybe it's a last ditch effort to see if anyone bothers to reply or say something that might help. I fear that one day something will happen with a close family member or friend that will be the breaking point and I won't be able to convince myself not to end my life.
