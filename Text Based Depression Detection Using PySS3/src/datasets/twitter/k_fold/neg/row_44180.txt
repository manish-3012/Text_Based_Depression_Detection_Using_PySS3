I feel stuckI want to die, but I'm stuck.

I know that a lot of people who come here are all alone, and I feel for you. I have been there. But right now, by some crazy accident, I have friends. Really really good friends. So, I feel like I need to stay alive, so as not to hurt them. 

But.

I hate myself. I am pathetic, and disgusting, and bad. There is something rotten in me, at a very core level. I can't prove it, but I know it. I'm 35, but I don't even feel like a real adult. I am not responsible or mature. I am completely lost and have no idea what I am doing in life. I am a total failure. I have depression and anxiety. I have nightmares and panic attacks and PTSD. I go to therapy and I take meds and it sort of helps but right now I feel like I'm getting worse. I have thoughts of suicide, *often*. I want to do it. I really really do. I don't want to hurt anyone though, so I don't. I'm not afraid of dying. I just don't want to hurt anyone. I have a few friends that I confide in, that I talk to online. I feel like I burden them and frustrate them with my constant whining, but for some reason they stick around. They have been very good to me and helped me way more then anyone should. I don't want to fail them by giving up.

But I don't know how much longer I can do this. It hurts too much. When I get depressed I feel like I'm going crazy. My mind gets obsessed with suicide. When I have nightmares I wake up and think they are still happening for a few seconds, and then I get panicked and it's so hard to calm back down. Sometimes I drink to cope but it makes me feel horrible the next day and it makes me act like an idiot and say things I don't mean. I'm so tired of dealing with this. I hate myself for being like this. I just want to be okay, but I don't have much faith that I ever will be. 

I don't know what to do anymore.
