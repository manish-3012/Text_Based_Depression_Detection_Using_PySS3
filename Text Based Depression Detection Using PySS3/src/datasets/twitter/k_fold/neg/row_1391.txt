I want to end myself, but can't because I'm scared and worried about my younger siblingsI live with a narcissistic family. 

I feel so helpless. Not having anyone to believe me is frustrating and it makes me really sad and angry.
I don't have physical scars to show as proof, which makes me feel invalidated. I know my situation could be worse â€” especially when compared to others. But I just want someone to believe me.

I live in constant fear of not knowing what'll happen tomorrow, because I don't know what mood my narc family members will be in.

I should be strong by now, but I'm not. I can't get any (professional) help either. No one believes me. I badly want to end myself. But I have younger siblings to look after. I don't want them to see me in this state. I don't want them to find out about my helplessness because I know that they too, want to disappear.
