i really really want to kill myself for real this timehere's the dilemma: way back in the day i wrote notes sold stuff did my research and had my method sitting in front of me when something happened(? i forget) i ended up having a good evening and then didn't. fast forward i have spent time in the hospital messed up my friendships because of this (least of my concern) likely will not graduate without extreme efforts (and the efforts i am making even with reduced difficulty and multiple supports are going nowhere) my reputation if i had any has been ruinedi have been harming myself out the wazoo i destroy my beloved possessions for fun i have pretty well lost my mind and break out into maniacal tearful laughter every so often i go back and forth from starving myself to force feeding myself bread and chip products until i am more than stuffed my habits are becoming harmful tomore than just me and i want to protect my very young siblings from my parents but now i need to protect them from myself, i have been more than exposed to everybody and everyone knows about my fucking "tendencies" :D i find comfort only in sleep, physical pain or hugging someone who i love 

aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanyways as i was saying the issue is i GOTTA kill myself i WANNA kill myself but i CANNA kill myself so WHAT THE EEFCAK DO I DO 

and no fellas, i am on fluoxetine (prozac) and "ththththththerapy" but this fucking nutcracker needs more than midlife crisis pills and chit chat time

SO HELP ME CAUSE THE FUCKING CLOCK IS TICKING :DDDDDD
