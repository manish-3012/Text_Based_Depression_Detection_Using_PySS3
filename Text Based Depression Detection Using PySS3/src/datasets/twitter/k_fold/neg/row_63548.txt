Iâ€™ve been confused and lost (Trigger Warning: depictions of past suicide attempt and current thoughts)I feel trapped. Iâ€™ve been this way for 5 ish years now. About 4 years ago I came very close to doing it, just a couple more minutes and I probably would have gotten myself to swallow the bottle of pills, and some days I wish I had. I worked hard and I got better, I finally felt free and like this weight had been taken off my shoulders. It didnâ€™t last, it started again about 2 and a half to 3 years ago. The depression, loneliness, and anger crept back in. Itâ€™s gotten to a very bad point. My mind has created a movie for me, and I have no choice in seeing it. Itâ€™s either a still picture or a full out scene. Iâ€™m holding a knife, and very specific knife from my kitchen. In the still photo Iâ€™m holding it to my wrist but in the movie I see myself going down my arm, and the blood. I donâ€™t know what to do, it feels like this thought isnâ€™t my own but some bad and dark part of me forcing myself to watch it, hoping to push me over the edge.
