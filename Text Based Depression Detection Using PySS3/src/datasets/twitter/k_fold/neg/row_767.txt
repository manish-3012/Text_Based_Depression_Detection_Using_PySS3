Iâ€™m scared going to the hospital will make everything worseIâ€™m scared of how much itâ€™ll cost. Iâ€™m scared of how much time Iâ€™d lose that I should spend on work. Iâ€™m also scared that they wonâ€™t be able to help, and I want to keep it as a Hail Mary when Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™ll do it. Iâ€™m scared that Iâ€™ll be kicked out of school again for going to the hospital. Iâ€™m ashamed to admit that things got so bad. 

Is it still worth going? Iâ€™m at my witâ€™s end. I just donâ€™t know how honest to be with my therapist if it could get me big hospital bills and medically suspended again.
