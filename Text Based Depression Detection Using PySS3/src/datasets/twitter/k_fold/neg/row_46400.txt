Typical rant.I'm guessing no one will read this, and I'm ok with that. I am so lost. My husband no longer loves me. He refuses to admit it. He hasn't touched me in 6 months. He doesn't want to be alone with me. He is literally torturing me with his words by saying there is nothing wrong. We are in so much debt. I know that is why he is upset. I am not working. I'm a loser. I am in so much pain all the time. My back hurts all the time. Anyway I have put a plan into action a slow plan I am hoping one that they will attribute to ignorance rather than a plan of some sort. I took a very large dose of acetaminophen a couple days ago about 10,000 mg and I have been taking about 3,000 mg / twice a day since. This way I can just say that I was in pain. And I didn't know there was a difference between Tylenol and ibuprofen. I know it will be slow going but I will wait until the last minute to say anything about the pain. I can't handle it anymore. I  tired of the pain. I want out.
