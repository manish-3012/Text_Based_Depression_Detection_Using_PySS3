I never had a friend in this life but now it's too lateSince I am going away, I'm just thinking about life and how it didn't work. And how it would have been nice to have certain things, like friends. I was always too boring or didn't know enough about something to strike up a conversation. That's completely my fault and I'm the one to blame. It's good I'm leaving. Things will get better for you all, I promise.
