I survived childhood abuse and rape but I wish I didn't.People really disgust me with their virtue signalling nonsense. When they hear about child abuse or sexual abuse they act all concerned about it. Yet when they meet the mentally ill adults these kids turn into they often act with disdain towards them, commenting on what a trash human being that person is.

This is why I wish for death. I'm broken and no one gives a shit. Sometimes I even think it would be nice to take a few people with me so their loved ones can feel what it's like to live with this pain. Maybe then they'd give a shit. I know that's a terrible thought but then again why should I have any respect for a world that has none for me.

All I know for sure is that I'd like to be dead or for the pain to end. I've tried using drugs to numb it out but it's always worse once they wear off. I'm tired. I've had enough. I want to be gone.
