No more point any moreBad grammar I know but it's 630 a.m.

My father has passed away. It happened 4 months ago but seems like yesterday. I never really was able to accept it was even real. 

I loved him so much. I have some health issues so I lived with him and my mom these last 10 years. Haven't worked all that time.

I just can't grasp he's gone.
