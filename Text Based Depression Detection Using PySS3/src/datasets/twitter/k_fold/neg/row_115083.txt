What should I do before I die?Do I write a will and sign it? Write letters to my loved ones before I go? Iâ€™m giving all belongings and money to my parents.

I want to do something useful before I go. Iâ€™m a mistake and a burden to this world. Everyone would be happier if I was gone. I survived so many near death experiences from my momâ€™s complicated birth, big car accident, getting hit by a car, etc. and yet Iâ€™m still here. 

Iâ€™ve been seeking therapy for years just to get put into a mental hospital a few weeks ago because my new therapist thought I was going to kill myself. It was a big misunderstanding and nobody would listen to what I was saying. No way am I coming back. 

I contacted a few friends to hang out one last time and everyone put me on read and hasnâ€™t responded or theyâ€™re busy with their lives. I tried playing a new game to get my mind off of life and my teammates got frustrated because I suck and told me to kill myself. 

I knew everyone would be happier if I was gone.
