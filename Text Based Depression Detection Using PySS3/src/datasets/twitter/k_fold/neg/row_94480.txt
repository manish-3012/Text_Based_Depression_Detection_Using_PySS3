Preserve my brain! (Why I won't do it)I wait here in disarray, confusion, and sadness. That long dark hallway...my grandfather, father, and uncle have faced (some still) this horrible degenerative disease. 

I admire their perseverance. I'm not so hopeful. Too many people in my family wish to try to convince me that I won't have this disease.

Those of you who know this scenario, know it well. It's coming, I'm watching my future in motion. I don't want it. 

I would destroy myself expeditiously once I show symptoms. However, I want to preserve my brain so they can study this condition. 


So, blowing my brains out, is out! 

The persistent thought is execution within a bed of ice. Healthy? No. However, I can offer much more than a questionnaire. 

It's there. It's real. Like a bill that gets lost in the letter basket, I have to pay the piper. It needs to be done and I wish there was something to eradicate this fucking horrible disease. 

If not, I ask for mercy. I will not put someone through this.

Learn from this and take my brain. Take it young if you have to
