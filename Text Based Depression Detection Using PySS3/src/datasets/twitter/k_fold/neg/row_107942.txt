Will to live in spite of othersThis sounds ridiculous which it is.. But I just can't help it. Mental illness deep pain and emotions this all compounded by now age 18. Honestly I'm ok with death at this point. No longer religious nothing to live for many mistakes made the list goes on. I'd love to give it another shot just doesn seem worth the effort shut might hit the fan at any point.

Some of the things that have happened to me over the course of my life. Mainly negative or people that have fucked me over. Sounds crazy and maybe I am, but I kinda jut want to live in spite of that. The thought process goes something like not only am I gonna die that's okay. I just can't let my mistakes or certain people that fucked my childhoodup win.
