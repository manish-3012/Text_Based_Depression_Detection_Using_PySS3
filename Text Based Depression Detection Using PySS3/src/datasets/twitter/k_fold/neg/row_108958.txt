Hearing about my suicidal tendencies is hurting my mother, but she asks me to be honest with her. Should I continue to share?I can only imagine how difficult it is to have a child who is in so much pain that they want to commit suicide. Each time I share a recent panic attack, suicidal thought/attempt, or "emotional paralysis" her grief clings to her face. The way my mother handles these discussions is commendable. Although she doesn't understand why I can't see "the beauty in my life and how things can improve," I know those sentiments originate from the love she has for me. It hurts me to hurt her, but she urges me to keep the lines of communication open. What should I do?
