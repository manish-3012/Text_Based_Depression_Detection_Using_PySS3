Iâ€™ve hit rock bottomI am 14 and Iâ€™m already planning on committing suicide very soon only reason that I havenâ€™t done it yet is because Iâ€™m terrified how will my sister feel but I just canâ€™t do it anymore 

Some reasons are the 
1. pandemic and me being scared of not getting sick 

2.my parents donâ€™t have a lot of donâ€™t have to much money saved and Iâ€™m a waste of it

3. My sister is working a lot and when sheâ€™s home she never want to talk

4. I just went through a break up

5.my aunt thinks I stole money from her and I didnâ€™t 

6.my dad is toxic and my mom also even tho she tries 

7.i always am just an annoying and un trustworthy 

8 I am putting a burden on everyone around me

The list keeps going and I donâ€™t know what to do because my therapist doesnâ€™t do his job right and cutting doesnâ€™t help so Iâ€™m going to end it
