People keep saying seek help and it is such a bull crapI told people around me. My family multiple times that I am suicidal. My friends too. You know what happens? Absolutely nothing. They send you to shrink which fixes nothing. You get anti depressant whopp do do which damages your brain permenantly and does nothing. There is no such a thing as help. Only you can help yourself everything else is pile of turd.

I failed at that too. I am tired I am so tired of everything. I will end it all next week. Why next week dunno. Maybe I am hoping something nice will happen. Regardless I will probably chicken out and countiune living this shitty life. I tried to have a happy life. IT DOESN'T WORK. Fuck everything.
 Wish I treated you better M.  You were the only good thing happened to me and I ruined it...
