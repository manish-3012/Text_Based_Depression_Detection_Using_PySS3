Please someone respond quickly.I need help badly. I'm suicidal, I have thoughts and I know what I would do. I want help and I even know where to get it but I can't do it. If I tell someone about what is going on and they involuntarily hospitalize me I might lose my job. I was hired less than a month ago and have already missed nine days due to illness. If I lose my job - what I am depending on financially - I will end up homeless. I either get help and risk financial instability and homelessness or maintain my job but risk my mental health and sanity.
