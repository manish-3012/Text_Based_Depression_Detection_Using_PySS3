Immediate actions to take when feeling suicidalI really apologize if this isn't the place for this. I've looked through lots of suicide resources, but a lot of them seem to be articles trying to talk you down or hotlines to call. That's not what I'm looking for. I just want like, an emergency action plan. If I find myself on the brink, I want to know what I can do instead of walking into oncoming traffic. I've seen people say that you can go to the ER, but that just sounds like a lot of judgement and a big bill that I can't afford. I'd really appreciate any other ideas or information.
