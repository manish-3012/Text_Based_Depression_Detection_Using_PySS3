My parents are really mad at me. I feel like I'm slipping again.So, on Friday, my boyfriend swung by to get a hoodie I borrowed bc it had his library card in it. He isn't even supposed to come to the house at all when they're not there but mum made an allowance because dad was in my car so I couldn't go to take my boyfriend the hoodie himself. Boyfriend isn't allowed into my room at all but that's where the hoodie was and he followed me up when I went to get it. Neighbour saw us through the window in my bedroom and told on me. My dad was furious, he told me I had to get out of the house until he says I can come back because he'll do 'something stupid' if I'm there. I know my parents don't like me. I know they don't want me. I've known that for two years. But idk. This is just pushing me closer to the edge again.
