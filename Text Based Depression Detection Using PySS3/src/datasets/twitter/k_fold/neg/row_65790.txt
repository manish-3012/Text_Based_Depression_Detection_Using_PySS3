Can anyone help meHere it is, for the past year or so, I've seriously been considering killing myself. I haven't gotten as far as planning the actual event out, but it's always at the back of my mind. If you knew me in person, you'd never guess, I wear a great mask. It seems like no matter what I do, there's pain and sorrow involved. When I eat meat, I feel like a piece of shit for the fact that animals life was ended so it could be fed to an animal, me, that didn't even want to live in the first place. Or if my younger brother starts acting like a dick, and we get in a fight I feel bad immediately after because I think he might be mad at himself or feel bad about himself because of something I could have said. He could have just said the worst shit imaginable to me, but it wouldn't matter because I can take it, and I'd feel bad for just making him think I didn't love him. My life is in the constant state of me feeling bad for other people, and empty on the inside. I would love to kill myself in all honesty, but thinking about my family crying and them thinking it's their own fault is the only thing that's kept me from it. I feel like I need to get help soon or I might do it, and I was wondering what you all thought I could do. I have no one in real life to talk to, I'm the last person any of them would expect to kill themselves. My parents would start treating me like a cripple or something if I ever brought up anything of the sort, and I feel like I'm running out of options. I really think it might just be best for me to end it, but we'll see. I just want to know your thoughts on my situation, and what things I could do to get better. Thanks for you're help
