Havenâ€™t felt this way in awhileI just lost one of my best friends of 11 years. Not in the traditional sense of death, although I did lose her sister (whom I was good friends with) five years ago to murder. This person was the one person in this world I thought would never leave me. The one person I thought would be in my life forever. I have always been there for this person and vice versa. One misunderstanding via text ruined everything. I havenâ€™t felt this empty in a long time. I feel I trust no one because the one person I trusted more than anyone is now gone. Iâ€™ve thought about reaching out to my therapist but part of me likes the idea of sinking deeper and deeper until I feel nothing. I have no active plan in place but Iâ€™m starting to think more about it...
