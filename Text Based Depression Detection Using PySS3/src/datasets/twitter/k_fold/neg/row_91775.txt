I keep messing upthe past 8-9 years of my life have been a giant joke. I worked so hard at every job I got, it didn't even matter if I could barely get up without being in pain, I kept supporting the man I loved. I think he worked 2-3 times ever and I actually saw any financial support from him. He would beat on me senselessly just because he was upset about another woman he was messing around with or his family and would physically take it out on me. Mind you, I did still love him through all his and until the bitter end.

In that time I was mentally gone. I was pretty much broken like a horse. I did anything and everything he wanted even if it wasn't what I wanted. I don't know why. Maybe I was desperate, who's kidding me of course it sounds desperate. Earlier this year he stole all the money in my bank account and ran back home. He's pretty much been stringing me a long ever since. Giving me hope when I know he won't get better so I leave him to make a better life for himself.

So now the back story is done. He left in Feburary. I tried to kill myself and failed. I came out seeking help only to almost get thrown in the crazy house. At this point I've been living just because of the funeral costs or because I would just be a bigger disappointment to the people I love for doing it. I've probably been depressed most my life. I rarely had a friend and my parents were, well, still messing up on being parents. Overreacting, beating, yelling, screaming, threatening, lol alllll the crazy stuff.

I feel like at this point I lost everything. I was beaten my whole childhood and made to feel like I was nothing. Jumped into a relationship with the same thing. I met another man in these months and he is he most amazing man I've ever met, but he will soon move away and move on in his life without me.

I feel alone. I feel like no one understands how far gone I am. I'm popping so many different pills every day and getting high as I can to try to ignore the thoughts of throwing my life away. Just because I don't want to hurt the people I love.

I don't have my own home, a car, or even a job because I quit it. It was a call center job that was making me even more insane. I don't know why I should live for everyone else because that's all they want (well of course).

I thought by now I would have a child and a home and be married. I worked so hard with a man that never really even loved me. He just used me.
My family uses me
My friends even use me

I'm sorry for the giant rant. I just wanted to be loved and I tried so hard. I want to love myself and I can't even do that. I quit my job today. I'm a gigantic burden and a loser. I wish I could be told what my purpose is and why I'm here. I wish someone could tell me if I even have a purpose or if i would matter if I was gone.
