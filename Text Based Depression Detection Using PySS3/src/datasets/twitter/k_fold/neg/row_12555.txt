I can't take it anymore. The years of pain and suffering are too much.I have been depressed for years and no one seems to care. I have no one in my life and no one who will care about my death. For the past four years, everyone at school has bullied me and told me to kill myself and I just can't take it anymore. I have the date set for my suicide and the note prepared. I have tried to kill myself in the past but failed and no one even noticed. I try my best to make others happy but it only makes me more miserable. I am writing on here because I have no one else to tell. I wish you all the best.
