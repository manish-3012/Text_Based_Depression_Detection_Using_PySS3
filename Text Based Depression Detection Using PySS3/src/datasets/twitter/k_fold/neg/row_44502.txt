How can I die, without killing myself?I just wish there was a way to not exist, nobody remembers you, nobody feels any type of way that you're not there anymore because you don't exist anymore and never did. The only reason I haven't killed myself all these years is because of my siblings. If they were to forget completely about me, I could finally end  it in peace without guilt tripping myself into staying alive.
