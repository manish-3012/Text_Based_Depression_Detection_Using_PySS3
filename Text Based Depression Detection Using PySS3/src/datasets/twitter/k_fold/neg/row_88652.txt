One last timeIâ€™m actually done this time. I canâ€™t trust anyone. I canâ€™t depend on anyone. All I have is me and I donâ€™t have anything. The only thing keeping me going is being fake happy for everyone. Why canâ€™t I be happy? Iâ€™m not important to anyone. Iâ€™ve never been important. Why am I here? Who even wants me here? Thereâ€™s nothing left. Thereâ€™s no one left. I donâ€™t have a passion. I donâ€™t have friends. I donâ€™t have anything. I donâ€™t matter. Itâ€™s all over. And Iâ€™m not sorry.
