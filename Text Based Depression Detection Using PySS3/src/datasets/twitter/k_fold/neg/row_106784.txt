A friend is in trouble, and I don't know what to do.I have a friend who lives a long way away that is planning to commit suicide soon, and I don't know what to do. We have a mutual friend that lives in the same city as him, and he's currently with him to keep him busy, but we can't get any progress made to get him to stop his plan.

We've tried to convince him to go to the ER or somewhere else that could give him a psych evaluation as per MY therapist's request, but he's unwilling to go anywhere. We're trying to get his parents involved, but I haven't heard back from them in a while.

I need help figuring out what to do next.

EDIT: He has attempted two times before, and he is very secretive about what's happened to him in the past, so it makes it a little difficult to make a plan for this.
