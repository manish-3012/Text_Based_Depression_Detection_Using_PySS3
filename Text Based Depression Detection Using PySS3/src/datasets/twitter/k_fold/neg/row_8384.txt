I still have suicidal thoughts.I got my first job and started no less than a week ago. Before that I was doing nothing. I'm not in college or anything but before the job I just stayed home and did nothing felt like a burdened. Felt suicidal. Now that I'm working I can hang out with friends without getting told to get a job or to get my shit together. I thought maybe getting a job and getting my shit together would be my elixir. And I know there's no cure for this but what if I had to live my life with no future or plans. Just a repeating thought of death in the near future. This is going to be my last time posting here. I've been posting here for a while and I'm even getting annoyed of myself.
