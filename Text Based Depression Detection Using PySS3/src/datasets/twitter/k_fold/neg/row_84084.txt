my anxiety and stress dont let me live life anymore and probably never willmain source of all: im a lesbian.and i live in a homophobic country, in a homophobic home. and im poor. i study and work all day to get out of my parents house, everyday i feel like im dying. i dont even have the energy to talk to my friends anymore and my therapist is on vacation.

to top it off, my head goes 120000 miles an hour thinking about the time ive wasted, the chores im not doing, im even about to pass out from anxiety and feel doomed due to fear of pregnancy. im a virgin, but i dont trust anyone, and im constantly wondering if i was raped or touched in my sleep.

it all comes down to money and needing to go fast, and i feel ill never be free so whats the point 
ill never be safe, rich, and happy in another country. its simply impossible to get this kind of money without winning the lotto. so what am i here for?

i just dont want to be me anymore, i wish i could be someone else or at least rest
