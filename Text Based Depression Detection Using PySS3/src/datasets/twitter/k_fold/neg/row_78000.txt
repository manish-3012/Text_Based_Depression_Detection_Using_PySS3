How do you tell a loved one you want to end your life?I want to die, but I donâ€™t want to do that to my loved ones. I want to scream at the top of my lungs how much I despise existing and I want to get help, but Iâ€™m afraid of how everyone will respond. SO, best friend, and mom all know I struggled when I was younger and SO knows I still have my sad days but itâ€™s more than they know and I just want to talk to them. I want to split open my brain and let it all pour out to them but I donâ€™t know how. They all have so much going on in their own lives and I donâ€™t want to put myself on them like that. Iâ€™m no ones responsibility and I know theyâ€™ll take me on as if I am. Iâ€™m just lost and I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™ll find my way again without them, but I canâ€™t put myself in front of their ongoing things. What the fuck am I supposed to do.
