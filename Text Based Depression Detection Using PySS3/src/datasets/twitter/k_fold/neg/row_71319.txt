Someone to talk toI just want someone in life I can talk to. It just feels like all my my â€œfriendsâ€ donâ€™t really care about me. They only ever hit me up when they need something. The other day my friend was asking me for something and I was unable to get it for him but I definitely expressed interest in joining him and my friends that night. But of course, I wasnâ€™t invited when they found it on their own. I just feel like everyone forgets about me, they just have better things to think about then me and Iâ€™m always just being left out to dry. Thereâ€™s this girl I really fucking like. But I just canâ€™t seem to figure out how she feels about me. I struggle a lot with social anxiety, so I donâ€™t have the balls to just make a move on her anything. But I hate seeing her slip away and I wish I just knew how she felt about me. I hate this stupid life, I hate feeling so all alone all the time. I just want someone that I can talk to about my problems, someone to vent to and someone that can understand me. I lay in bed last night just think about how my life has been one upset after another. I realized there was nothing worth me living for anymore, I realized that Iâ€™d rather just be dead than live through this dumb awful life.
