Iâ€™ll commit suicide February 21st if my life doesnâ€™t change drastically for the better. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll do it. But knowing I have a date makes me feel more relaxed about lifeIt takes away any pressure Iâ€™ve put upon myself or have from others. Because I know wether I do so or not (expectations) thatâ€™ll all go to waste because Iâ€™ll die soon. It also kind of makes me want to do everything I can before I go. I already thought of how Iâ€™m gonna do it, and is it weird to say Iâ€™m excited? I feel relaxed knowing I donâ€™t have to live through life anymore.
