I should goI've hurt too many people in my life. 

I don't really understand how my brain works, you know? I do things I don't understand. I'm so fucking afraid of so many things that I'll do anything, hurt anyone, anyone I have to, even people I've never met. I want to go. I should have gone so long ago. I've hurt so many people since the first time I thought I should go.
