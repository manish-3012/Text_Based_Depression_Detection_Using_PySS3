Main argument against suicide is so bad it actually has the opposite effectThe main argument against suicide is:

* You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve.

This argument really is the main argument against suicide, as it doesn't apply to people, like the terminally-ill, for whom suicide is considered a viable, acceptable option: euthanasia.

The widespread rationale behind suicide can be summarised like this:

* If you're suicidal and depressed because of a **terminal illness**, your suicide is legitimate and is called **euthanasia**.  
Only physical suffering is real suffering. Only if you're sure to die soon, you can make it quicker and less painful.
* If you're suicidal and depressed for any other reason other than terminal illness, your suicide isn't legitimate.   
You need to stay here for the long haul, and die of "natural" death after years of psychological suffering.

When people say "*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*" to suicidal, depressed individuals, they can be increasing the chance for the individual to commit suicide. For two reasons:

1. "*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*" contains two **fallacies**
   1. [Argument from ignorance](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance);
   2. [Appeal to probability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_probability).
2. Since "*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve*" is a trite, hackneyed, fallacious , sound-bite-like argument, it shows **a lack of respect** for the suicidal individual.
   1. For their **intelligence**:  
As if a suicidal individual couldn't intuitively see through a bad argument;
   2. For their **ability to assess** the potential outcomes of their own lives;
   3. For the **value of their life:**  
If you think someone's life really matters, you don't just repeat something that could literarily apply to every single suicidal person.  
"*You can't be 100% sure your life won't improve"* just shows you can't see any individuality beyond the potential suicide. That **makes someone who is suicidal feel even more lonely** and therefore likely to commit suicide.
   4. For their **personhood:**  
The idea that suicide isn't a legitimate, valid choice often makes the suicidal person feel like their life doesn't belong to them, but to the community of people/society who cornered them into depression.

This is why I stopped talking about any suicidal ideation to people and therapists.

If I listen to any other "Life can be beautiful", "optimism can pay back" touchy-feely argument, I'm actually gonna make the jump. It's just disrespectful.

Coaxing someone out of committing suicide requires recognising an individual's right to commit suicide.  
If you delegitimise suicide as a choice, you'll just make the suicidal person feel less empowered, more lonely and devalued.
