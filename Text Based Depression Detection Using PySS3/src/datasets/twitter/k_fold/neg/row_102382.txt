Spare a kind word?I understand the psychology of my mental health disorder and know that moments like these, the downward sprial, will pass eventually as long as I dont give in to them. I am just so down in my life and wanted to know if anyone could spare some kindness to help keep me going? Some words of advice or a phrase that helps keep yourself going would be well appreciated.
