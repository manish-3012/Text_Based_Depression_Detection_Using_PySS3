everyone else makes life look easy.I'm a 30 year old female and it is hard to exist in a circle of people who seem to have nice lives with their husbands, cute houses, and generally beautiful looking lives. I have dealt with mental illness my whole life and felt like I was always outside looking into a world I would never belong to. Recently I met a guy who I thought was someone who truly wanted to be around me but it turns out I was not good enough for him and now I feel like I will never have a nice life. I feel fated to a life of unstability and feeling alienated from everyone. I decided it was better to end my life here so that I don't have to suffer through any more of it.
