Those of us who contemplate suicide, are truly free!People who are troubled in life and fear death, are slaves of their fears!

We can have a peaceful life, knowing that we can end it as soon as we see fit! We are in control of our lives, We Are Free!

Understand that death is unavoidable natural fact, look at it as time to rest after a long and tiresome journey. You have the key out of this horror show that is life, so, bear it a little longer knowing that YOU ARE IN CONTROL.
