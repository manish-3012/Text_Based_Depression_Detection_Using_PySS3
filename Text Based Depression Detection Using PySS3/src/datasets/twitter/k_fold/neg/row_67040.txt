There isn't much time, and I need help.I'll make this as short as possible. I was brought up in a household of narcissists. Asian Chinese family with a mom as a teacher and dad as a pastor. I'm the second of three children. I'm 24 and moved out a couple of months ago due to the violence and toxicity in the house. Right now I'm doing my final year in degree and I am not in the right state of mind to continue. I'm financially crippled and my mental state is spiraling. My girlfriend just left me and my close friend insisted that I'm not dependent enough and I should learn to be alone. I got diagnosed with depression a month ago and the meds just makes me groggy. I've bought a bag of charcoal and taped my room's windows. I've been through so much and I'm honestly really tired and I don't know if there's any drive in me to continue living. Thanks for reading.
