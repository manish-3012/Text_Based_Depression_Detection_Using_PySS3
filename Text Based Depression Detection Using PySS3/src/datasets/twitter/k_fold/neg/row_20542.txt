The shittiest part about wanting to die are my reasons why.Iâ€™m too exhausted to explain it all, and I wouldnâ€™t know where to start, but so many of the traumatic experiences from my childhood are crushing me. I feel beyond help. Iâ€™m triggered constantly by the uneven shifts between myself and my half siblings, who were given everything they could ever have wanted or needed as children, while I had nothing.

I grew up in another (poor and abusive) household and was excluded from everything, because my stepmom hated me. She didnâ€™t want me around, and made it very clear. I wasnâ€™t on any Christmas cards, I never went on any of their vacations. They contributed absolutely nothing to my healthcare or overall wellness, and when I was suicidal as a young teen, my dad told me I was selfish. My sisters have beautiful smiles from braces, and the youngest is having her college paid for entirely. I didnâ€™t have any of that. And I hate how ugly it makes me feel. I hate that Iâ€™m so envious, and how I feel so left out. Mostly, I hate that my brainâ€™s immediate solution to these feelings is to say â€œYou should just kill yourself because the pain is never going away.â€ 

I have C-PTSD, depression, and a diagnosis of a general anxiety disorder. I think my mental illness is mostly caused by my past. I donâ€™t think my brain was ever truly wired to be this way. I think years of pain have beat me down to a point where I canâ€™t differentiate between then and now. I have bouts of uncontrollable anger, and crippling depression. I look at my smile and canâ€™t smile anymore. I donâ€™t want to live like this anymore.
