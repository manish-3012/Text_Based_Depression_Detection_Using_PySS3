I think I'm ready to die, I'm sorry.To my Dad, Mum, Lana and Michael, you all knew of my mental health problems. But I always found it hard to talk about it. These metal health problems, even though the Psych Doctor said we need to find the root of the problem, I think I already know it. I think it's a mix of genetics, what happened to me in Foster Care, upbringing and bullying. I'm tired, I'm never going to escape. It's a day-to-day battle, even with my meds.  
I won't be able to keep myself safe if I carry on, this is getting to the place I was before I went into Hospital.  
I'm sorry for being a burden, and none of this is anyones fault but my own. I should've jumped earlier.  
Those daily walks? Walks to the multi-storey carpark to see if I had the courage to jump off. And I finally do.  
Maybe I'll finally be able to escape. Thanks for trying to help but I just can't be helped.
