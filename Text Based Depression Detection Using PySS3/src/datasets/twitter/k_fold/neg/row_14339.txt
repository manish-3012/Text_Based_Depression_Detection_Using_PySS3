World doesn't need meI can't even figure out where to start. Back in my junior year if high school I was hospitalized for major depression after I attempted suicide. A number of factors happened that year that caused me to do so. During my senior year of high school I flunked a math class that is preventing me from getting into a university. I was unemployed for a year until I found a shitty part time job at a sandwich shop. My hours are getting cut because I suck at it. I overheard my boss calling me incompetent after a co worker was trying to help me cut bread which I suck at. I'm probably gonna ask for a 2 week notice tomorrow. On top of that I want to apply to a community college but I'm scared I'll fuck up like I did in high school. Most of my friends have left me except a few and I have zero chance with women. I promised myself I was going to buy a gun at 21 and conceal carry after my friend saw the knife attack at Ohio State. (I'm 20 now) If anything like that happens to me I won't hesitate to defend myself from a horrible death but I also think that's how I'll end it...
