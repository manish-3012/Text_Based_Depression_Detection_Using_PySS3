I don't want to... but I feel like it's the only way...Please help.. there's not one minute of every day that I don't think about everything I'd change about myself if given the chance.. my weight, my facial features, my height, etc.. I can't look at myself in the mirror anymore... I always hate what I see and just wish to go blind so I'd never have to look at myself again.... no ones ever going to want me... family-wise, friend-wise, and relationship-wise... People always look at me like I'm nothing, and that's if they even notice me at all... I change things about myself hoping that maybe Itll make people see me better and maybe people will talk to me... or at least acknowledge that I exist... nothing ever works... I don't have anyone I can talk to about this... at all... no one cares... I feel like the only way I'll ever have release from this agony is to end it all... I don't want to because I know that maybe one person might get hurt... but it's getting to the point where it's so hard to get out of bed every morning knowing what the day holds.... please... someone help...
