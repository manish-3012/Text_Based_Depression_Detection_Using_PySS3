Does anyone else feel like they use the promise or reassurance of suicide as a crutch to make questionable decisions? (In my case: gambling)I hate that I catch myself doing this. 

So what if I fuck things up badly for myself, I have a â€œget out of jail freeâ€ card 

So what if I spend Â£30/Â£50/Â£100 a day gambling, Iâ€™ll probably be dead soon.
