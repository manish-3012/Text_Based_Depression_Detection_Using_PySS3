I don't have wordsso yesterday I was doing some school work and my dad said come here so I did and he found a thing on my notes that said things about everyone hurting my leaving marks on me and he yelled at me and said this never happens. and I showed him a scar from him cutting me and he backed away like he was scared of me  then he reached out to grab my arm but I flinched and backed away did I do the right thing?
