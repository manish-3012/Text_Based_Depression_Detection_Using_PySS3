Suicial but strong will to live.I have been ok. When I was 11-14 I went through major depressive episodes and an attempted suicide. I still live with an abusive mother who caused it. Iâ€™m 17. It all stems from the absolute pain of being an loved/unwanted child. But I love alot of things and Iâ€™m talented in alot of things, yet I feel these are just an escape. Everything is just an escape. I feel as if I have to survive. I have to be anxious all the time to survive I have to like certain things to survive. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m ever going to be able to live a normal life, just loops and loops. Yet when I plan suicides itâ€™s always a specific train. I love trains and public transport, mainly systems. I sometimes will have suicidal periods as if my life or something is leading up to it and Iâ€™m just wasting time. My life right now is just me giving myself delusion. I came into this post wanting detail knowing what I wanted but am ending this with obscurity. My main question is why do I think about suicide, since 11, despite being relatively happy apposed to others. Iâ€™m not hard on myself and have spent my entire life adapting. I have had to learn things about myself. I guess no matter what I do the feelings of unwantedness will always lurk. Every time I think I want to kill myself no matter how hysterical I am there isnâ€™t the switch of the unconscious survival instinct that switches off like it did years ago. I want therapy and will have to wait til I am 18. I think my life will be better when I move out obviously. But these unwanted feelings and suicidal thoughts never will. Just an itch in the back. Something that will never allow me to be perfect or feel perfect or clean. Rant over. Another rant on the subreddit.
