.When I was in the mental hospital (suicide attempt in 2016) I had the most intense certainty that the world was ending outside of the hospital and we just didn't know because we were locked up and cut off from the outside world.

Another delusion I've had very strongly over the years is that I actually died before I ever managed to escape from my abuser in 2010 and this whole 10 years has just been some fleeting moment of death hallucination or that I'm a ghost or something trapped in this delusion playing out.

Idk. Random shit. I sometimes think I'm immortal. If it was possible for me to die how the fuck has it not happened yet. The secret to not dying is wanting to die so fucking bad your entire life. It's not fair. The ppl who wanna live die tragic early deaths and those of us who desperately want to escape are stuck here.
