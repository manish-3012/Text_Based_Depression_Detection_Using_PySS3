I think the worst thing you could do for someone if you find their body after committing suicide (specifically by hanging) is to try to save them.Theyâ€™re more than likely to have brain damage and disabilities (I actually donâ€™t know the statistics of how many failed hangings result in disability but I read it was most, someone please fact check!!) and they donâ€™t want to live anyway. They planned that out and it was there choice. Literally their dying wish and youâ€™re going to take that from them? Itâ€™s honestly selfish. I completely understand but thinking about it, itâ€™s the worst thing.
