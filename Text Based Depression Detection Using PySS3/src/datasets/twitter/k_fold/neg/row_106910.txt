I'm just so tired of existingI don't know how to fix myself. I'm a wife and mother to a toddler and I just don't want to do  anymore. I love my family but I go to bed every night praying I won't wake up in the morning. I walk through and hope I get hit in a freak accident.  I'm scared to kill myself but I don't want to live anymore either. I feel like I'm fake. I'm in a psych group and all we talk about is how a childs life at a young age effects how they will function as an adult so I try so hard to not fuck up my kid but I'm just so tired of trying. I'm just so so tired.
