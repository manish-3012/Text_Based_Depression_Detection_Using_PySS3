deservingfeel like i should die because therapist said i wasn't putting in the work to keep my life structured and better. i'm doing even worse than other clients she had that were younger. i don't deserve to live but i'm just so scared of jumping off the balcony. i wish i killed myself before when i had access to a gun.
