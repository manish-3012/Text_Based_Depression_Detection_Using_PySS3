[x-post] Iâ€™ve lost all my progressLast night I rushed off to the ER (unrelated to assault) and I had to do all sorts of examinations, including a pelvic exam. I told the nurse 3 times that the last time I had one was after a violent assault last year so I wasnâ€™t comfortable and I was disregaraded each time, until the doctor came in and I was sitting at the edge of the bed between the stirrups, bawling my eyes out. I was already on edge since he pulled my pants down to expose my mons pubis without warning an hour before. After all of that, I informed them that I just wanted to go home, but they continually insisted that I speak to the social worker about reporting and resources. I felt like control was completely out of my hands again and that if I just went through with what they wanted, I could leave faster. I told the social worker that I wanted to go home and being left in the room was terrifying for me, then she stayed until I agreed to the pelvic exam. They proceeded to just leave me in the gyno room for an hour where I broke down and eventually just disassociated. I donâ€™t remember the pelvic exam. The next thing I remember is waking up at home.

Now I havenâ€™t been able to leave my house all day, alternating between panic attacks and complete numbness. Iâ€™m back in the same spot despite all my hardwork. I feel the same disgust, shame and guilt with my own body. Everythingâ€™s come back and Iâ€™m terrified because I donâ€™t think I can work through it again. I havenâ€™t had such strong thoughts of self harm and suicide in a long, long time. Iâ€™m scared.
