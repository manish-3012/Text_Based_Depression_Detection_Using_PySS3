just sharing my thoughts with youAnd tbh now I feel much better. There are a few things I want to do before, but without this decision my feelings/brain would still be in hell. Now I can complete these things on my to do list at least with a little bit of peace, and then after its done (nothing bad to another person or something like that I dont want to cause any more suffering even tho the most damage I've done to myself ) I'm ending it. Already planned the method very well so nothing can go wrong and I die 100% and without any more pain. Right now I'm not feeling good, but not bad either.
