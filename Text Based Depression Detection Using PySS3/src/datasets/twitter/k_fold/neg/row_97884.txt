too depressedHi, 

I'm not sure why I'm here but I called a hotline a couple weeks ago too and that was weird too. I'm not an immediate danger to myself but when it comes down to it, I don't want to live. I really don't have the will to do anything. I present as okay even, somewhat, but I know that some people around me know that I'm struggling. But it's a weird kind of depersonalization. I'm worried that I'm going crazy.

I've always planned on just alienating everyone around me and dropping out of the system to the point that when I die no one will notice or care. I might have failed a class. I'm concerned because I don't even care. I'm concerned because I can't even be properly concerned. I'm worried because I can't go to anyone because the counselor I see would report it if he knew how depressed I am. I've fucked up my life anyway and can only think that I deserve to be miserable, even I know that's fucked up. I know that in stories sometimes things work out, but in real life we all go through the meat grinder of life anyway.

Don't worry everyone, I won't kill myself--I just would be happy if I died.
