i'm not worth iti honestly hate my life


outline:

- i don't have any irl friends. i never get invited out anymore. i got kicked out my fucking friendship group. why? no idea. all i know that this kid fucking hates me for some unknown reason. so, i sit alone. have done for over a year. not been invited out. still stays that way. 

- my father who left at the age of 3 came back a few years ago, and sure, we're rebuilding our relationship, but for what? my stepbrother (father's girlfriend's son) has the new consoles, ps4 and xb1, newest iphone xs, nice fat tv, nice fat double bed, nice fat room, private education. what do me and my sister have? single beds. tiny rooms. admittedly mine's decently sized, but my sister sleeps in an office room where her bed takes up over half the space, hell we can't open the door properly. i'm not in this spaceous house. i don't get rides around in a fat range rover. my dad? his new family? oh, THEYRE FINE. THEY'RE SORTED. after all, why give a shit about your kids when you have your own money? no point giving anything to them, right?


once the lockdown is over and once medical units aren't in high demand anymore, i am fucking doing it


fuck life
