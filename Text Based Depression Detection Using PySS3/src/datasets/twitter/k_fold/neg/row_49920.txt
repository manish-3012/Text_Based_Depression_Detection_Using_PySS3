My parents are talking shit about me. They know I can hear them.I feel so useless already and now I'm pretty sure I'm ready to do it. I just don't know how to say goodbye to my friends. I can't do it without saying a proper goodbye but I don't want them to get suspicious. I hate my parents and at this point it sounds like they want me to die. I just want my friends to be with me now but I'm probably never going to see them again. Please help
