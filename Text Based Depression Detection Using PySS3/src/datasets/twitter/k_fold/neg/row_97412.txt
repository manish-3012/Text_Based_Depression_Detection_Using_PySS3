The sun is blotted out. I can't live in total darkness.The only thing stopping me from hard resetting is that I have no access to a firearm. By far the most easy way to go. 

  I'm weak but that doesn't make my situation any less miserable. I live a wretched double life pretending to be someone I'm not. I'm victim to my own habits that are entrenched in 6 years of misery. And to top it all off I've been dumped presumably for being a jerk.

  My mind is stalling every few moments after racing through a million thoughts. I have utterly no motivation left and have ruined my life from terminal fear.

  Why isn't suicide socially acceptable? Why can't I just commit to entering the eternal sleep without fretting so much for what I will leave behind? 

  I hope my heart stops beating so I can be mourned briefly and forgotten about.
