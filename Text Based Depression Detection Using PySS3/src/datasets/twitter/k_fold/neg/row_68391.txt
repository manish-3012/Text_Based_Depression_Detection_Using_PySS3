I made a huge mistake and I don't know what to doI wanted to die so I drove as far as I could and then I couldn't do it. I sat in my truck for 18 hours with the noose right next to me. And, I couldn't move. I'm so confused. I don't know what to do. I have nothing. No gas, no money, and no one to call. How do I get out of here?
