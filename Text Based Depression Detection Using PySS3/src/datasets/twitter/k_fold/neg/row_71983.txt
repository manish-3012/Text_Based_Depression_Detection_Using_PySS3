How To Prepare Your Family/Friends?Many years ago I told myself that suicide would be an option if, by the age of 35, I were still struggling with the fallout from having Major Depression. I'm now 3 months shy of my birthday and as another year ends with mounting depression symptoms and disappointments, I feel like this may truly be the end for me on this planet. I am wondering what I can do to help prepare my friends and family for my death? I don't want my death to implode their lives. I also don't want to continue living my life in this way, just to limit their pain. For those of you who have experienced suicide in your family or in your circle of friends, is there anything they could have done to make it easier for you? Thank you.
