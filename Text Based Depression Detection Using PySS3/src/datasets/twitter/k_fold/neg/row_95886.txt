HeyHello Iâ€™m 17 and for like the past 5 years or so I have been really depressed I have been in a mental hospital like 4 times in my life time for just suicide thoughts like bad ones I never attempted but I really want to Iâ€™m not gonna like at all just because I donâ€™t see it getting any better like I donâ€™t have much friends at all like tbh really none at all since I have been feeling depressed I have gained to much weight and I have no motivation to lose it and thatâ€™s making me feel bad about myself itâ€™s made me feel like shy because I donâ€™t want to be judged because of my weight I havenâ€™t really been to school at all I just started independent studies so I donâ€™t have to really worry about going to school anymore
