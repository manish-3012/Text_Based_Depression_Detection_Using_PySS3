I now understandWhy people donâ€™t bother getting help. As long as suicide, anxiety and depression continue to be a stigma in this society, you can keep on expecting people to kill themselves again and again.

Once we start valuing humans more then money and get a better mental health system, you will see improvement in a lot of areas but until then, keep expecting this to keep on happening again and again.  And people living the entirety of their lives only looking at whatâ€™s in front of them are clueless on whatâ€™s really going on.

In Minnesota alone, we have over 600+ plus people kill themselves every year and yet we keep on doing the same thing again and again. Our suicide crisis hotline almost got shut down due to lack of â€œfundingâ€ like seriously?
