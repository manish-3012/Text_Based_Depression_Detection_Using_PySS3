wanting to get hurt?im suicidal but not in a place right now where that would even be an option. my roomie needs help to make rent, ya know? but its like my brain acknowledged this and said, "all right well if we cant do that we need the next best thing!" and now alongside death thoughts i just have an intense urge to get the absolute piss knocked out of me. like i sometimes go for walks at night hoping someone mugs me or stabs me or something. a while back we had a case in town where a man was randomly attacked and hospitalized by someone with a hammer. the dude was still at large and my first thought was, "oh well all right i should probably go for a jog tonight before they catch him huh?" and i did exactly that! it's fuckin bizzaro and i know it is but i cant stop thinking about things i can do to make this happen. i feel like its maybe my subconscious or some shit sayin like,"since people will be pissed if u off yerself then we'll do this and that way its not yer fault problem solved lol"

not entirely sure why i wanted 2 post this either i guess maybe putting it somewhere u kno ppl might see it is relieving? idk its like airing dirty laundry in public and bothers me but also its good to say out loud, so to speak.
