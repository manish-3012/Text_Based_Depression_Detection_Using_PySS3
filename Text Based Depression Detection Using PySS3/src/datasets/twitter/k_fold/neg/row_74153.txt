I've been reading a lot of /r/suicidebereavementIt's a really interesting subreddit to put things in perspective. I've been feeling incredibly down lately, and have had suicidal ideations all my life. There's always something that stops me, whether it's not wanting to hurt those who I love, worried about taking care of things first or whatever.

I've been reading about cognitive distortions and attachment styles recently. It's been helpful examining what I choose to believe without any supporting evidence and the outcomes that can bring. It also helped looking at why I act certain ways in relationship to people. Especially in terms of loss, heartbreak and dependency. We'll see if I can get through it. 

I wrote some letters today, mainly for one person. Probably won't end up using them. Just thought I'd share and throw this into the void. Will probably end up deleting this later.

Good luck everyone out there.
