I hope I'm not here when the new year begins.I can't take it. I just fucking can't. 

The anxiety has made my life a literal hell hole. I dread waking up every single day. I failed classes this semester. I am extremely agitated throughout the day and I can't sleep at night. Every single day I wish something disastrous strikes me dead and ends my misery. I have nothing to look forward to. Everything I actually want to do, I can't. I'm forced to fucking get this goddamn degree because of my family's financial situation. But I can't do this crap anymore, I hate my fucking course, I hate everything about my life. I'm convinced that everything bad that can happen to me will happen to me. I don't see anything positive to look forward to. I only see pain.
