I canâ€™t do it anymoreIm in a really dark place right now and i donâ€™t know how much longer I can take it. Iâ€™ve been struggling for the majority of my life with anxiety/depression/everything else thatâ€™s wrong with me. I just want to give up. Iâ€™m at work right now and Iâ€™m having a hard time. Iâ€™ve been crying to myself all day long, I couldnâ€™t stop the tears. Iâ€™m just glad no one saw me. Iâ€™m physically and mentally hurting so so so badly. 

Another thing thatâ€™s going on is Iâ€™m terrified that I have bed bugs or something. Iâ€™m so itchy, constantly feel like things are crawling on me, have tiny red marks. I canâ€™t sleep at night. Itâ€™s driving me crazy. I just canâ€™t take it anymore. 

Iâ€™m so mentally exhausted I just want to kill myself tonight after work. Just wreck my car and be done with it. 
 
Idc if anyone even replies to this I just needed to vent so badly.
