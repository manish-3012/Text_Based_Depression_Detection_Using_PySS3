I wish I could give you guys better advice.But I can't.  The **good** news is - if you are depressed and thinking about suicide *about something*, there's hope.  If you are hurt from a breakup, financial situation, marriage, trauma, or generally your Current State of Things...that's all it is.  Your current state.

As they say to teenagers now, "it gets better," and this is true for you.  Sometimes you just have to wait it out, and eventually you'll see how wrong you were.

But if, like me, you've been depressed for a very long time for no reason you can think of...I don't know what to tell you.  I could tell you to "man/woman up," to get help, do something about it, go outside, get more sun, exercise, eat better, make friends, party like it's your last day cause you think it is, or go on medication...and this would all be great advice.

Unfortunately I know how you think, because I am you.  You're not going to do any of that.  Or if you do, it will be in short, fleeting bursts of activity, and then you'll return to the cold and the dark.  Because it's all you know, it takes less energy, it's easier even if it hurts like hell.  Or maybe it doesn't hurt.  You just feel dead inside, all the time, and you don't go out or get a job or hang out with anyone or eat, because what's the point?  The only one that can fix you is you, right?  And you're just not up to it.

Defeating chronic depression requires eternal vigilance.  It requires dedication to believing your own worth, getting help in any form, being open, and **doing things.**  You have to take it step by step, inch by inch, and rebuild your habits from the ground-up.

I know this sounds impossible, but people have done it.  I think some of you can too.  It's not easy but I am a strange duck when it comes to depression.  I believe in you; I just don't believe in me.  I'm not bipolar, I don't lash out at people, my family has no history of depression.  I've just had this for over a decade, unable to shake it, despite leading a charmed life and watching it slowly crumble around me as I'm left to do "adult things" and instead do nothing.  So I think the world of people, even people like me, when they accomplish what to me seems impossible.

But there is that one bit of logical perfection.  "Only you can help yourself."  Oh you *will* need others help too, maybe medications or therapy, and you will have to accept this.  But it still has to be you, taking that first step, telling someone, and telling them over and over for the rest of your life.  Putting yourself out there.

I don't think I'll ever be able to kill myself.  That's also "doing something about it."  I'll just live like I'm Dead till nature does its thing.  No friends.  No lovers.  No outside.  Lower common denominator.  I don't recommend it.

So tell them.  For God's sake tell them.  Do whatever you have to to get there!  And then do whatever you have to to stay there, or keep climbing!  I want to see you reach for the sun whose warmth you didn't even think you could feel!

Because I can't do any of that.  And I want you to not be me so very much.
