I'm definitely ready to go &amp; I can't waitThe pain has outweighed the thought of hurting my loved ones. It's just too much to carry.

I won't detail what I've been through. It's laid out in detail in my post history. 

We had a very long conversation last night. She ended up sending an email &amp; I got it just as I was having a heavy bout of emotion. So I let the emotions run free. It went well for a bit but by the end she definitely doesn't want to be together, whether she has a boyfriend or not.

I've been struggling with intense feelings of inadequacy, shame, loss, &amp; guilt. I can't just "move on". I feel as though the reasons why she broke up with me were very fixable &amp; preventable. I was working towards it in the end but by then it was too late. She was already too far gone.

I've always struggled internally. She made me feel like I didn't have to anymore. But I got lazy &amp; lost her. She's with someone else now. And I found out by seeing a picture. It haunts me every single day.

I can't live with these thoughts anymore. I've had a very difficult past &amp; she was the light in my life. Tonight I'm going to take a bunch of sleeping pills just to knock myself out. But tomorrow is when I'll make the real go. And I'm happy about it &amp; looking forward to it. I need to let go. I can't be here anymore.
