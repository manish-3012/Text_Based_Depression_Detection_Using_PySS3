I'm holding on for my cousinsSo I'm in this program where I do my let two years of high school and my first two years of college at the same time.

I'm taking 4 AP classes, along with the college classes.

It is intensive. And I can't deal with the stress anymore. I don't know how I manage to make it through every day. 

I have a psychologist and a psychiatrist. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. I take a daily anti depressant. 

And yet, the only reason I'm alive is because of my little cousins.

They're both 6 years old, and I can't bear the thought of my family having to explain the concept of suicide to them. 

Thus, I'm still here.
