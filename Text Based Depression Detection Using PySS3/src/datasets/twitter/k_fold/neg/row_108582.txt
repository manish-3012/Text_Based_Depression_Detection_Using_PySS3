I know I'm inherently unlovable. I've tried to embrace that fact all my life but I can't.My life is already too painful, I've seen and felt too much. But the fact that I can't ever be loved only keeps worsening my misery.

I know I can't be loved, but is it wrong for me to even just *want* to be loved? It probably is somehow. But it's tearing me apart now. And I can't take it anymore. 

I've spent the last 10 years with suicidal feelings, but it never got as bad as the last 2 weeks. I've done everything I could to help myself over the years but nothing worked. I can't do it anymore.
