I tried...Ive been on this sub for awhile. Ive tried to help people. Ive tried to be there for strangers who were hurting. I think I helped a couple of them, at least thats what they said in their e mails to me.
Im tired now. Ive spent my entire life chasing things thatI guess the universe has deemed me unworthy for.  
Its been this way since I was a kid. ( Im an old man now ) 
Ive always felt unworthy and not good enough even tho I have tried so hard. 
Im tired of this life now. Always hoping for things to get better, always hoping for a bit of good news but I guess this world doesnt want that for me.
It seems as if Ive had a black cloud over me most of my life. Im tired now.
I have come to accept that nothing will be good in my life for very long. I am tired of the constant worry.  It seems to me that the universe has me destined for failure and ive come to believe that this world will be better off without me in it.
I am hoping that my bad luck or bad karma or whatever the fuck it is will not follow my kids. 
Ive two wonderful kids and they have a really good shot at maybe having a real good life if I am no longer around. ( I know its selfish to write that, but I cannot stomach the pain anymore )
I no longer love this place or my life or this world.
I have no interest in anything any longer. I am pretty much just going thru the motions at this point.
Each night hoping I have a heart attack in my sleep.
I have a plan now. So the universe or whomever is pulling the strings can fuck right off.
Anyhow, thanks for reading and to the one or two people ive been able to be there for I wish you continued success.
