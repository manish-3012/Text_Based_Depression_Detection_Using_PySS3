Lost my jobI posted not that long ago about this possibly happening. Well, it did happen, I got fired for what I would argue is total and complete BS. Pretty much all of my co-workers agree that what ever sparked the drama isn't a big deal. In short, it was over a 3 sentence email I sent that was deemed unprofessional.

I'm just pissed off. The job barely paid anything, but it's now leaving me now to kinda scramble to straighten out myself financially again. Money and stability are massive stressors for me. 

I just feel worthless and unteachable as a person. I just don't feel very motivated right now to make anything any better for myself. And that's a very harsh thing to admit to yourself: to not even actually wish for a better tomorrow.

As cliche and edgy as it seems, all I want to do is say fuck the system and everyone in it. I grow so evermore narcissistic and nihilistic when I come under times like these and it seems as if there isn't much promise in sight. I'm bitter, upset, and pissed off, as I should be. 

I just really don't think it's even possible for me to be at ease. I'm not interested in going out to face the world or tackle anything head on. The entire bullshit we endure with life is inflated with fake attitudes, fucked up egos, and false promises towards unhappy ends.

I'm losing my will to want to offer anything to the world. I've lost interest in simply wanting to be a human being and do human things. Fuck the world.

For those of you wondering, I'm not in immediate financial danger, and I do have a freelance way of making money to stay afloat. I'm by no means ending it out of total desperation.
