How can I help my cousin before it's too late?My cousin (24/M) has been having extreme cases of depression for the past 3 years, ever since I left to study abroad. He isolates himself from everyone, he won't even talk to me and we've been really good cousins from our childhood. His sister recently got engaged and he won't meet her fiancÃ© or attend the engagement/wedding.
I'm currently overseas studying but I'll be back home soon, I love him like a brother and want to do anything I can to help. I'm afraid that he might commit self harm or even worse suicide. What can I do?
