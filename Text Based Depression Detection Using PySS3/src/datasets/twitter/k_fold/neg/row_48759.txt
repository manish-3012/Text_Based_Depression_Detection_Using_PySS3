Started seeing a girl after my bout of depression, I don't want to hurt anymoreI started seeing a girl after my so many failed attempts of a relationship. Everything was going so well. we went on dates for 5 months. then this afternoon she told me she didn't have feelings for me and she was scared to tell me and that she's been feeling this way for a while. she became one of my closest friends and i began to fall in love with her. i dont know what to do and I'm hurting so much I just want to end it all. it wouldnt hurt so much if i didn't want to be her friend but i do. so i'm stuck whether to remain friends with her or remove her from my life all together because i will hurt even worse. i don't want to lose her, but i don't want to hurt anymore.
