Ex-wife talking about killing herself.My ex-wife is in a really bad situation. She's had very bad depression for years and she's taking meds and seeing a therapist. She doesn't have great coping mechanisms and sees everything as black or white. She had a baby a few months ago and there may be postpartum depression as well. 

The father of the baby is manipulative and a bit abusive, so any time she contacts him she breaks down and starts talking about suicide. She got into a car accident recently and started talking about suicide again. In the last week or two she's started saying things like, "I've made my decision. I'm not going to kill myself now, but once my affairs are in order I'm going to kill myself." or "I want to go down to where the father catches the train and jump in front of it to hurt him like he hurt me." She wanted to buy a Christmas tree and then when I went to help buy it told me that she'll probably kill herself before Christmas so maybe it isn't worth buying a tree. I get texts every day about not wanting to live.

I spoke to her therapist who recommended a more intensive day program. When I talk to my ex about it she said, "Well, I guess I'll go, but it doesn't matter, I'm just going to kill myself anyway." I brought up inpatient and she says she will never go back. Basically any time I mention anything better than suicide I'm told it's not possible, it's not worth it, she doesn't want to do it, etc.

What should I do? I'm answering any call or text and trying to figure out if it's at a crisis point to call 911. Otherwise I don't know what to do. Thanks everyone.
