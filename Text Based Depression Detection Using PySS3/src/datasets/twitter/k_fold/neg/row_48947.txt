A change in friendshipI recently moved out of an abusive household that was driving me to suicide into an apartment with my best friend. This friend has kept me alive since we met and we were inseparable. You would never get one without the other. But now that we have our own place, sheâ€™s just insults and belittles me. She blames me for her mental state worsening. And Iâ€™ve brought up my concerns to her and she more or less ignores them. And I canâ€™t take the sudden change in our friendship and promise of change that she gave me only for her to become no better then my family. I just want to let go and fade away. I didnâ€™t have anyone to vent to so I figured Iâ€™d come here but I donâ€™t know if this is the right place for this or not.
