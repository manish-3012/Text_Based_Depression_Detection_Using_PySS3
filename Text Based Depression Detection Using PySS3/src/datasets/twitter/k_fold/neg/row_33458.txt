Desensitized to Death?So Iâ€™m just making this post to vent essentially.

Iâ€™ve thought about death since I was very little. Ever since I would say about 6-7. Growing up I was also exposed to a lot of death. My Grandma died when I was little and my Uncle committed suicide and my parents didnâ€™t help the situation either. My stepdad and mom just told me what he did was selfish and if he was alive they wouldâ€™ve killed him themselves. So I had to face that from a very young age. When I was very little though I would stay up late at night about every other week because I would be scared I would die in my sleep or I would think about other things. The thing that usually kept me up however was the idea that I would die before everyone I knew and loved. And what also scared me about that was the idea that I would forget them eventually. That I would forget my moms voice and I would forget her face. That she would be lost to time. This scared me to no end as a child. And since I had pneumonia every summer as a kid too I would spend a lot of time in my room thinking to myself. I had a lot of time to think about death. And eventually I came to a conclusion that lifted some emotional trauma and regret from my stomach. I thought to myself that since (mind you I was also an agnostic/atheist) when I die I would just cease to exist. So I would not have to witness the guilt and emotional trauma I had carried. And this led me to another conclusion. That suicide would essentially prevent emotional trauma from occurring and that since I would not have to witness the pain and suffering it would cause others around me then the burden would essentially be void to me. It would still happen. But I wouldnâ€™t see it or even know if it since Iâ€™d be dead. This essentially desensitized me to death. And since I would not have to burden guilt that made me feel as if my actions held no weight. So I made unhealthy decisions. I did nothing but sleep, go to school, eat, sit around and then repeat for several years. Which leads me to today. Medical problems exist on my moms side. And while I look a lot like my dead I inherited defects from my moms side of the family. But my chest hurts and itâ€™s at times difficult to breathe. My thoughts are less coherent. My mind goes numb for minutes at a time and it feels like my death is approaching. I have to be honest Iâ€™m a bit scared. Iâ€™m mostly ashamed. That all the great people that held hope I would get better. That I failed them. I want to get better I do. But itâ€™s too hard. I can do it physically. I really could. Itâ€™s just mentally my mind is so desensitized that it wonâ€™t commit. I take responsibility for not bettering myself. But Iâ€™d be lying if I said I wasnâ€™t afraid. Itâ€™s a daunting idea that you know youâ€™re going to die and itâ€™s going to happen soon. Even if I did get better turned my life around Iâ€™d still delay the inevitable. I have to ask. Can anyone else relate. It feels so lonely  and depressing knowing my death is coming for me and Iâ€™m the only person I can blame. This very well could be the first and last post I make on this temporary account. If I get better Iâ€™ll make an update. But if that doesnâ€™t happen. I guess itâ€™s goodbye. Hasnâ€™t been a good one but I love my family at least. Hopefully they can say the same about me.
