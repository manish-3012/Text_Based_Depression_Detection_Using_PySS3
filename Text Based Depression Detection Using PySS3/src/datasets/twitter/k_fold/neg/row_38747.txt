Had Enough35 and wife cheated and left me 5 months ago and took my stepson (who also wants nothing to do with me). The woman literally saved my life when my heart disintegrated and now here I am in a room of a shared house, family/friends only care when they need something from me. 

Tried therapy, medication, meeting new people, etc and Iâ€™m just going through the motions. All week having been staring at the many meds I take to keep my partially artificial heart working and know that an OD of one in particular will be fatal. Stuff that I used to enjoy has no effect and just tired of waking up (on the rare occasion I do sleep) and not recognizing myself.

Tomorrow is the day
