So here i am i guessNever thought i'd make a thread on this depressing af forum but yeah, here i am.

21 years old, always in a shitty mood no matter what i do; unable to sleep properly; still a virgin, never in a relationship and i dont know why because i'm not fat or ugly and i'm not an asshole, at least that's what people tell me; 
i have a job that's decent but boring af and has a shit pay because i'm still an apprentice; i've never met a single person that gave me the feeling of being understood;
and tbh i can't really blame them because i can't even understand myself i feel like;

I'm a horrible person towards the few people i love although i don't want to.
 i can't see any future for me and honestly i think life doesn't have to offer anything anymore

I didn't even know what i should write because i can't get any clear thoughts anymore because i'm so sleep deprived

It's just a fucking drag to continue this shitty existence
