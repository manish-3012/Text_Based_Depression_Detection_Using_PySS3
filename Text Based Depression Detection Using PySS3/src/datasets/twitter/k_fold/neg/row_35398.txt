I hate how resolved on this I feel.It just feels like I've accepted my death and all I have to do is figure out the best way to plan it. Planning how to end my life is one of the most cathartic things I can do. 

I cry a lot, I've felt like this for years. I hate that I just get older and more disappointed with myself. I want to still be pretty when I die. 

I hate myself so much. The more I get to know myself, the more I hate that this is what I am, this is what I've been for over a decade and a half. I hate myself. I am 99% okay with dying, that 1% is for if I can manage to not be a fat selfish ugly and laughably stupid cow. But I try to not be that, and then I turn into that. I knew if I let my weight get this high again, I'd want to die. Last time I used to just punch myself in the stomach. 

I hate being depressed but I hate being fat and depressed even more. I wish I could stop eating. I think people look me up on Facebook and laugh at me for how stupid, immature, and fat I got. How far behind in life I really am. That I deserve my suffering because I'm horrible.
