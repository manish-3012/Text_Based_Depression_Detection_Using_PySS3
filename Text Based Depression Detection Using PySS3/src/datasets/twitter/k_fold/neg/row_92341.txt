Today while driving I couldnâ€™t believe how many people were driving to get no where. Existence is cruel.We are trapped in this weird fucking planet, and you can never shut it off. You either have a great life or a fucked up one. And when you have a fucked up one with mental illness you see how terrible the world really is. never ending cycle of  legit bullshit. we are gone forever and people act so important and better. All I want is a successful stable trustful group of friends, and possibly a partner (bc Iâ€™m lonely) people suck. and everyoneâ€™s rushing to get something or someone and it seems to me everyone is just so selfish and only cares for themselves. Itâ€™s literally a rat race bc we are all rats. Just stomping all over each other everyday to get things we think we that are better and are assholes along the way. I just HATE what existing is. Itâ€™s so boring and exhausting. knowing the real truth of your life is scary and it really makes you question what living is and why you keep going.
