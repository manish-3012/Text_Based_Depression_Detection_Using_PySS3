Donâ€™t know what to doSo, Iâ€™m new to this. First time posting on Reddit or anywhere. Iâ€™ve talked with people in the past, no real help. 

From anyoneâ€™s perspective, I have a good life. Wife, kids, good career, healthy family. Literally nothing to complain about. Most anyone would say Iâ€™m lucky, and I am for the most part. Iâ€™m an ass for complaining. 

Despite all that, I wish I was dead. Every day. All the time. I donâ€™t have the courage to kill myself. It would devastate so many people around me. The logical part of me knows it isnâ€™t true, but my gut tells me theyâ€™d all be better off without me here, even if they donâ€™t know it. I give no value to anything. Thereâ€™s nothing I really can contribute. 

Iâ€™m 38, and Iâ€™ve felt this way for as long as I can remember. I canâ€™t connect with people.  Not really. I donâ€™t have any legit friends, just people who kinda know me. Iâ€™m incapable of making emotional connections. 

I have nobody to talk with about this. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m trying to accomplish by posting this. Iâ€™m just lost and have nowhere to go. I just want to not be here anymore, for it all to just go away, like I never existed. This keeps getting worse, and I know nothing will fix who I am. Iâ€™m just desperate for something.
