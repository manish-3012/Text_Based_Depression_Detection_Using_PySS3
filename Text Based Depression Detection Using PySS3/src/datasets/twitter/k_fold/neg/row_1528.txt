I feel like an idiot even wirting this.I feel selfish wirting something like this. I for the most part have good life. I have people who care about me but I still want all of it to stop. Everyone has struggles in life just like me and a lot of people have it worse but they push on and knowing that makes me want to kill myself even more. I'm just know I'm wasting so much valuable time in my room unmotivated to get out of bed or enjoy anything and it makes me feel like a peice of total shit. I keep looping the same thought of me just being an ungrateful unproductive waste of space and the only motivation i get is to take action to make it stop. I just keep feeling worse and I don't want to do this anymore. Anything i do makes me feel selfish.
