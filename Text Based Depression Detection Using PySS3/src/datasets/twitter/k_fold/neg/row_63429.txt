Can't graduate college, plus I might have an incurable disease. I just want to die.I've had low grade depression for years now after a major depressive episode in 2011. I also have extreme anxiety. Now I've been getting some strange/severe stomach problems and will be seeing a doctor for it but I dread it being Crohn's disease or colitis. I can't live with that. I'm too skinny as it is and I will never ever take medicine for it if I find out I have one of the two. At that point I'm done. I'll let myself die. 

Let's say it's just IBS, I still am done, because I have a stupid math disability or something that I can't overcome. I'm a grade A student on everything but math. It won't stick. Tutors, repetition, etc, it will not stick. I can use a calculator to get by but this math 101 class won't even let you use it on some of the exams! To make matters worse I stupidly looked up "math disability in college" and these wonderful people are saying "you don't deserve a BA if you can't do math on your own" and "calculators are bad". Fuck them. We invented calculators for a reason, for dumbasses like me. That's unfair. I'm good at English and everything else but this stupid math is preventing me from even getting a damn associates degree. I'm not even going into STEM!

I've been wanting to die for a long while now, but I'm stopping myself because I don't want my mom and siblings to have to go though my death. They really do love me but I can do nothing in return for them. Everything stresses me out. I'm afraid that if I don't get a degree of some sort in the future I'll be stuck working at McDonalds. If I have a bowel disease I won't be able to work anyway. I'm a failure.
