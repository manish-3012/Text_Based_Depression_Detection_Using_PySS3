I haven't left my room or house in over a month. Want nothing more than to end my life.This isn't living. I feel like I barely exist. I barely eat anymore. My brother and dad and the rest of my family dont care. No one reaches out to me to see if im alright. I know I'm not and so do they. I have no friends anymore. My depression, anxiety and agoraphobia has ruled my life and now I just want to die. Ive turned into a spineless coward that is afraid of interacting with others and fears confrotation. The only thing i care about at this point is putting myself out of my misery. :(
