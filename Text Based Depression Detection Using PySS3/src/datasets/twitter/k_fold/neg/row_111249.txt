I feel utterly aloneI have nobody. I was living in a different state, had a good job with friends that I loved seeing everyday, for the first time in a long, long time things were looking up. I was managing my mental illness and I always had someone to talk to or hang out with. Then my house caught fire in January and I had to move across the country back in with my mom. Lost most of my clothes and possessions and now I have no friends and nobody to talk to.  At first everyone was sympathetic and hit me up to say they were sorry about what happened but then a little time went by and everyone forgot about me. I understand, life happens and people move on. I just hate being left in the dust to stagnate. I donâ€™t have a doctor here so I slowly ran out of my medications. First I ran out of my anxiety meds, I can barely leave my bedroom without wanting to die. Then I ran out of the meds that stop me from hearing voices, sometimes I hear them whispering to me in a language I donâ€™t know, other times they just just keep saying â€œdo itâ€ over and over. For a long time I wondered what it was they wanted me to do but I think Iâ€™m finally realizing what I need to do. Then I ran out of the anti depressants and everything seems so hopeless. I canâ€™t afford to go see a doctor and Iâ€™m not even sure I want to. Why should I live the rest of my life pumped full of pharmaceuticals that make me feel terrible? It would be easier for everyone if I just died. I donâ€™t have the energy to fight just to continue to exist and not really live. Iâ€™m only 21 but I feel like Iâ€™ve been suffering through two lifetimes. I donâ€™t even know why Iâ€™m posting here, Iâ€™ll probably be gone within a couple of days anyway. I think I really just want to be heard before I end it, I left my life and my friends behind and itâ€™s like I stopped existing when everybody forgot about me. Iâ€™m still here though, suffering in silence just like always but hopefully not for much longer. Sorry for the cry for attention, have a good day.
