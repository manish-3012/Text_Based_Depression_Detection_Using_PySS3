Suicidal day again...I felt ok for a few days but today its just all collapsed. I started panicking before classes and didnt show up. I feel like a failure

Im not sure if I love my partner, i feel sick when i say i love you because  it doesnt feel right. I once said i wasnt sure how i felt about him after a load of shit happened between us and he told me how cruel i am, why would i do this to him

Bow im terrified he'll lose his shit if i tell him how i feel. I dont even know how i feel 

Im starting to make friends in class but its only a matter of time before they hate me, i jake everyone hate me eventually and im so scared of when its going to happen or how 

I just want to isolate myself. Stay in my dorm room and slash my wrists
