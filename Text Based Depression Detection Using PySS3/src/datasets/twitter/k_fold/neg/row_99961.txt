Keep thinking about suicide and talking to myself about itI went through a crazy breakup with a love of my life. She is with another man now. We have business together and I cannot leave business (will ruin my family - parents etc.) but staying in it with her is a torture. I constantly talk to myself about suicide and think how I could impulsively shoot myself if i had a gun.

I don't know who to talk to. Her? My family (they will never see this coming ever).
