Few random thoughts...Watching Earthlings documentary two years ago I figured it out it's not pain that I fear the most (I have high tolerance and know ways how to kill painlessly). It's that I'm becoming an object. While I'm alive I know I'm not just pile of dust. But the moment I'm intensively thinking about raising hand on myself I'm terrified because it's accepting my true material nature: atoms, molecules, nothingness. The desk, or wall, and me - there is no any difference. I obviously can't deal with that fact on deeper level (I'm only aware of it).

Your thoughts?
