My 11 year old sister is the only thing keeping me here.4 months ago I got dumped by the girl of my dreams. We were together since we were 14/15 and now we are 20/21. 


She is with someone else now and she has been talking about breaking up with him and getting back together with me for a little over a month. 


Yesterday we met up to talk about it. She told me that she still wasn't sure what she wanted dispute practically promising me that she would dump him and come back to me. 


I told her I needed an answer before she left. 


She couldn't give me one. 


So I decided for her. And told her I won't wait anymore. That it's over. 


It was the hardest thing I've ever done.


Now I'm just dead inside. 


I've stopped crying. I'm just staring and not sleeping or eating. I want to die but I don't want to kill myself because back home I have an 11 year old sister who, due to family issues, I practically raised before I moved out. I couldn't do it to her. 


I have a stronger will to keep her happy than I do to live and I don't know how much longer that is going to be true.
