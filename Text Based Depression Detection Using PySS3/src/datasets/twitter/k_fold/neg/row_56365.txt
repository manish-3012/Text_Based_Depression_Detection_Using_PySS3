my abusers will always win anywaysto the gruesome twosome, J &amp; J, the redneck romeo and juliet:

you WIN. you FUCKING WIN. i am currently laying here hoping to have so thoroughly given up, that it results in my entire body and brain giving up. i tried so hard to fight for what was right. to fight for my safety. to fight to reclaim my life. but you two narcissist pieces of absolute human garbage have pushed me into such a state of dishabille that i canâ€™t fucking live like this anymore. congrats. you have taken an otherwise happy person and turned them into an empty shell with no will to live.
