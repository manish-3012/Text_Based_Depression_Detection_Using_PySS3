want to off myself but the only reason im not is because of my current girlfriend and my momi make them both happy and dont want them sad. girlfriend's best friend kill himself like 2 years back so i wouldnt do that to her. just got into college and im ready to blow my brains out already. ive been depressed most of my life and my situation each year since 2014 has gotten progressively worse. in the next few months, we will be evicted from the only home i ever knew because my father died 2 years ago and my grandma died last year, and my mom can't work because shes disabled after a car hit her. 

&amp;#x200B;

i dont want to be the last hope for us, because im just not strong enough to do anything.

ive tried multiple different antidepressants, ive tried smoking weed, ive tried therapy. probably going to just kill myself when the next tragedy happens. thats that, gn folks
