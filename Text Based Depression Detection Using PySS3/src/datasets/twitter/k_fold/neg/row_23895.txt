To memorialize being okay--Thank you Suicide WatchI've posted here a number of times, mostly when experiencing one of the worst darkest days of my life.

Don't get me wrong please, I spend most of my time being suicidal and philosophizing about suicide, purpose, and life itself. Most of the time, I want to drive over a cliff, jump in traffic or over a 250+ high bridge, find heroin and have a peaceful death....this is my norm.

But today, well today I woke up from a nightmare screaming. And yet I can say ATM im doing okay. I don't want to kill my self AT THE MOMENT. And this is a pleasant moment, one all suicidal people live for. I can play guitar and actually feel a tiny bit of pleasure, I can actually cognitively think before I talk and make jokes out of life situations. I can look at nature and see a true God if there ever were one/ I can imagine and believe in a world in which I CAN LIVE. This feeling 80% + of the population feel often, whee I feel rarely.

This will pass and I know that, darkness will come again. But I know there is light, there is purpose--when I have the right chemical composition and belief system. I have to remember this.

This is for myself, but also for anyone who thinks it won't get better. It will, it just might not be the 'better' that you want. But maybe we can pursue to grasp these moments and cherish them as if they were the only gift we were ever given.

I feel for you all. I will continue to come and post and to support those who need help. To share this moment of clarity in a world of consistent confusion and pain is I believe necessary. These moments will come, cherish them even knowing they will soon disappear.

I love you all and I'm so sorry that we have to be here supporting each other, but I'm glad we are despite that fact.
