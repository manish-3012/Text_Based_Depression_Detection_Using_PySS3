Is everyone really here for a reason?Because I honestly feel like they aren't. I believe I'm just here to react to all of the horrible shit happening around me. That's what I've been doing. I keep being told good things are going to happen and that I will find a reason to live and that it's amazing we are here but I honestly don't care. I just want to leave but I'm not being allowed. Is it really worth waiting it out and staying alive? What if this thing that's supposed to motivate me never happens?
