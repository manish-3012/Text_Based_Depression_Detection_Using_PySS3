If we all die anyway, suicide is just eliminating the middlemanYou're born. You suffer. You die. 

Everything in the middle is done to distract yourself from the suffering. You drink excessively to forget your pain, you consume every drug in existence to forget your pain, you fuck to forget your pain. You eat unhealthy foods, play video games, watch movies, pick up a hobby, socialize, all to distract from the pain.

If you're physically attractive enough, you might date and marry so you have someone to fuck whenever you want and hold whenever you want, convince yourself someone else cares. They're too consumed by their own pain to care. You have kids to give yourself purpose, but then they're in pain too and this time, the pain is your fault for forcing them into the prison called life. 

You're born. You suffer. You die. Only three steps to living. Every moment of life is suffering. Every last moment. 

Choose between the slow boil that is life or the quick relief that is suicide. The greatest invention in all of humanity. The only reason why I have any fondness for humanity at all. You're not going to amount to anything, I promise. Nobody truly cares about you, not because you're not worth caring about, but because it is impossible for a person to truly care in the midst of their own suffering. Any kindness done for another person is done to soothe your own guilt and convince yourself that you have meaning. 

On my 23rd birthday, February 25, 2018, almost one year from now, I will finally take the quick relief. I'll be happier for it. I will no longer subject myself to the slow boil. I will give myself the peace and relief and quiet and comfort I have earned through two decades of nonstop pain. You will not stop me. Nothing will keep me from my beautiful death. The only thing in the entire universe that is beautiful is death, the lack of life. I hate existence, I hate everything in it, and I hate myself most of all. 

In a year, I will be free at last.
