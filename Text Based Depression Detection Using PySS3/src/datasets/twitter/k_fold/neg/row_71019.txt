I turned 20 today (11/08). But I wonâ€™t be seeing 21.Iâ€™ve been going through the process of diagnosing early onset Parkinsonâ€™s. Been battling with insurance company about getting an MRI as they tried denying the order for it. 

So Iâ€™ve been waiting about 2 months finally got the MRI done about a week ago.

Turns out I have 7 tumors spread out across my brain and 2 on my brain stem. I was also diagnosed with early onset Parkinsonâ€™s today on my birthday too, icing on the cake I guess.

We didnâ€™t even discuss any operations, I said thank you and walked out of the doctors office.

A month ago my girlfriend of two years left me, took my apartment, my dogs, and kicked me out. So thereâ€™s that.

Iâ€™ve died due to an overdose in January, fortunately they brought me back but was in a coma for a few days. I just remember my eyes closing and then nothing. I just remember waking up like nothing happened.

Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t believe in a god but I prayed. Iâ€™m scared but I think my time here is over due.


If youâ€™re reading this, thereâ€™s always tomorrow. Thereâ€™s always help and people to talk to. Donâ€™t make a permanent decision for temporary pain. 

I know Iâ€™m being contradicting in a way but.

Thank you guys, Iâ€™ve been lurking for about a year now. But i donâ€™t have any immediate family so...

 I guess thatâ€™s it.
