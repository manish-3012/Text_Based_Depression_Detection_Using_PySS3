I wonâ€™t do it, but I have to share.I have to share my hurt and sorrow.  All I wanted was to have a family one day. Iâ€™m a decent person, but I got diagnosed with an eye disease that wonâ€™t allow me to drive anymore and to see properly. Iâ€™m only 28. Iâ€™ve been wanting to have a baby, but what kind of person would I be to give birth to a child knowing that I wonâ€™t be able to take care of him/her adequately. Itâ€™s tough to come to terms with this. Iâ€™m highly educated and I would have been a fantastic mother if it wasnâ€™t for my diagnosis. Iâ€™m dying on the insde. I wish that I can end my life.
