Seeking advice on how to help a potentially struggling friendHi everyone, I could really use some input/help here.

I became friends in the middle of this year with a great guy. Heâ€™s very bright, constantly busy and very reserved, in his early 30s, active Army whoâ€™s done multiple tours in Iraq and Afghanistan but is now studying.

We became very close very quickly. Occasionally heâ€™d make comments about not living to see 40 or talking about when he dies he wants this at his funeral, things like that. I didnâ€™t know how to react at those times so I always told him that heâ€™d live a really long time so we wouldnâ€™t have to think about that for awhile.

I became a source of emotional and intellectual support over the next few months, we talked all day. But he was still casually dating other people. At the end of September, I told him I couldnâ€™t just be friends anymore because I wanted a romantic relationship. He said he wasnâ€™t willing and able to give that. We havenâ€™t spoken in two months as I said that he was great but this was too difficult for me.

Anyways I saw him today in passing and I just felt something was off. I also recently heard heâ€™s planning to leave his part-time job, which I know he likes. Itâ€™s hard to explain but I just have a gut feeling like heâ€™s thinking about ending things. I care about him a lot and wondering whether to reach out somehow, but at the same time itâ€™s hard/sad for me to know he doesnâ€™t want to be a relationship with me,

Can you guys give me some input on what is the best thing that I can do in these circumstances? I do want him to be okay and happy, even if itâ€™s not with me.
