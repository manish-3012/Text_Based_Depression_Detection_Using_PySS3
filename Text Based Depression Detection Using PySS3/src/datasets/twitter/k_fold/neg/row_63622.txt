Not at the edge quite yetSo, I'd been having a good amount of suicidal thoughts earlier in the year, and things were looking way up since then, hardly ever even thinking about things being bad, let along suicidally bad.

I know that it's "not that bad" as a poster on here was saying the other day, but still... I met a girl for a third date, and things turned hot and heavy, making out half naked for nearly two hours and a half. And then when the pants came off, not only could I not really get it up more than halfway, but my balls ached really badly. Like the ache after a kick kind of badly. So that ended awkwardly, and talking to her today she says she'd still like to see me again, and things happen.

But that's never happened to me before. I was really into her, but... I just don't know why it happened. And as stupid as it sounds, I'm obsessing over this. I feel... inadequate, because I fucked up majorly, and I don't even know how or why. I've just been in a really weird mood since then, and the thoughts came back some.

I know that this seems stupid and trivial, but I just needed to tell someone, and I can't tell anyone I know AFK.
