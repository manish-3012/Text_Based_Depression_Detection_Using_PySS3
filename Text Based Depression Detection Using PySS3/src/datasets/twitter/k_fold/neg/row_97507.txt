Completely isolatedI moved to another country to study (this is definitively on the top 3 worst decisions of my life) about 1.5 months ago. I don't care about having friends because it's too much effort I can't put up with it. But I literally know 0 people. I have no classmates to rely on because I was put into classes that hadn't been full yet. Every class I watch with people from courses different than mine. So far I've interacted more with professors (which is rare considering I have a phobia of talking to authorities) than with any other student.       
I feel defective and unwelcome. I tried scheduling an appointment with a mental health professional at the university's health center but it's hopeless - no one picks up the phone, there's never anyone at the reception, no one answers my emails. I feel I have to compensate for my lack of social skills by excelling academically so I don't feel like a complete worthless piece of shit. Not a day goes by without me regretting ever coming here.
