Feeling really worthless right now!No one talks to me. I've been ignored my whole life and I'm so tired of it. People have told me that I'm a piece of shit and I'm starting to believe them. Every day I have to put so much effort into being okay and I'm so tired. The only person that I want to be with hates me and never wants to be with me again. I made a mistake that ruined my life and his. I feel like people like me deserve to die. I don't even know why I'm posting here. None of it matters anyways.
