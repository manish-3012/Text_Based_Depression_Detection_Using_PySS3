I'm scaredI'm scared of failing, I'm scared of not succeeding and not going to university which is extremely important to me because I'm scared of failing to use my potential. I'm scared that I will be no one and end up in a dead end job not ever getting anywhere in my life and I just want it all to stop. But I can't because I have someone who truly loves me but I feel like I can never give them the life they deserve and that they would be able to find someone better. This is all too much
