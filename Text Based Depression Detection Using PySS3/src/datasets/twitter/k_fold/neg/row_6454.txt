My company knows something is wrong with meI haven't been to work since August 21. They know something is wrong with me, and they probably suspect I'm suicidal but can't do anything about it due to lack of reasonable cause. Every day I get uplifting texts from my company's line. Every day they ask me to name a positive thing that happened that day. Today I asked if the administrative employees have better things to do than send me those texts. The boss says they care about me and that checking on me falls under the "better things to do" category. I kind of feel bad that I'm wasting company time but again I need it, otherwise I'd probably kill myself.
