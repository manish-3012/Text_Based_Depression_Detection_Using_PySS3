Have you want attempted suicide only so you won't do a test or some tests?I was feeling suicidal November 6, 2017 and November 26, 2017. I went with my ABA therapist to an emergency department of a hospital. I was waiting hours in the hospital. Then I went on an ambulance. then got taken to a psychiatric hospital. Then I got discharged. I returned home. I came back to school. "Where were you?" asked my Geometry teacher. I replied "hospitalized."
