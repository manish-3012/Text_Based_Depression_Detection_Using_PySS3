Guilt-induced insomnia.I'm so tired, my eyes hurt. But the idea of closing them makes me sick.
I know I'll see him.
I see his green "online" dot.
I think about talking to him.
But I know he's not here for me.
He's here for her.
I change my mind.
He wouldn't care if I was gone.
He wouldn't even notice.
