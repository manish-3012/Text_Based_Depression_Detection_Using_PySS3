I think I stabbed my depressionI was 3 days away from killing myself. Anti-depressants, benzos, anti-migrains, nothing was working.

For the last few days I've been researching a lot about DMT and psilocybin. Many say they can rewire or reset your brain. And I was able to put my hand on some psilocybin mushrooms. Ate them all.

It felt like taking a deep dive into my consciousness. I couldn't stop thinking. I was thinking so much I didn't know what to think of anymore. I started imagining myself flying around earth very fast to find a place where I could finally be happy again. I could not find any so I decided to fly away from everything, in that part of space there's only darkness. I was looking for the end of it. Then i think the effect started to fade away, and I was slowly going back to me lying on my bed.

When I opened my eyes, I realized I was starving to death (I didn't eat for days), and I was able to think of all the food I used to love, and I wanted it badly. I went to the supermarket, got it all, and when I started eating, it was like the very first time I ate these things. It was fucking delicious. It made me feel so good I even started to play some music, and here again, it felt like it was the first time I listened to it. Even touching my hair felt so good and soft. It was like I was born all over again.

One day later, here I am. I feel much less suicidal. I have hope. I started eating again, and I feel like traveling again. I don't know if the feeling will last, but at least it's giving me a huge boost to escape this hell.

There are tons of studies out there. So fucking pathetic governments are banning them...

tldr: try psilocybin.
