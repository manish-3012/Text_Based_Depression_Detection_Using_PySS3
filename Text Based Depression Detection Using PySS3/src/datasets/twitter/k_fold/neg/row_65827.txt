I hate that I already want to kill myself but Iâ€™m still barely starting life.Like Iâ€™m only 13 but Iâ€™ve experienced so much yet so little. I want experiences that people say â€œmake life worth itâ€ but when will I see itâ€™s worth it. I really want to live but not the way I am rn, dying seems much better then this.
