StuckIm not necessarily suicidal at this point, im just stuck in life at the moment. Life sucks at home because parents are becoming intolerable, no money to move out, cant find a better paying job. Just stuck. Like I said, not really suicidal but I wouldnt be mad if a truck t-boned my door on the way to work.
