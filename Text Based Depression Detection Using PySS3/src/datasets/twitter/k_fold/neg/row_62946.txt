How to live without my dog of 15 years who died 3 days ago- follow up from yesterdayâ€™s postThank you to everyone who commented on my post about my dog of 15 years who just passed.  I was in such anguish I couldnâ€™t see any way out except to end it for myself.  Everyone who commented made me feel better and realize he would want me to go on and be happy.  I live alone, no close friends or family and Iâ€™m really struggling with how Iâ€™m going to live on my own.  I always enjoyed relaxing at home with my dog.  This apartment is completely empty- I lived alone with my dog for 15 years, thereâ€™s never been anyone else.  Iâ€™m not the type who will now be better off trying to stay so busy that Iâ€™m never home.  Spending 3 hours at the gym, 2 at the grocery store, etc, is not going to help me.  I already had hobbies like running and hiking club.  Making up new activities just so I can spend as little as time at my apartment is not going to work.  Besides, the nights are the loneliest.  Iâ€™m in bed right now, alone as usual,  and I look down at an empty dog bed on the floor.  I never realized how comforting it was having a sleeping dog beside me.  When he was alive, sometimes I would wake up, he wouldnâ€™t be in his bed, he would have gone to the living room to his other bed, and I would cry out his name, and then find him in the living room, so relieved he hadnâ€™t left me.  I often had nightmares about losing my dog, as I couldnâ€™t imagine anything worse.  Now that heâ€™s gone, Im living in Hell.  How do I cope with this empty apartment?  Iâ€™m nowhere near ready to get another dog.  I truly donâ€™t know how to live like this.
