Iâ€™m insulted by the solutions to suicidal depression I was offered todayI was talking to my therapist today, who is aware of my current suicidal feelings. I told her how I feel like nothing will ever get better and how Iâ€™m having trouble performing basic tasks like taking care of the house. 

She countered that if I do these things, just push myself, I might feel better. 

Even when I could take care of myself, I felt this way. It got worse because none of these things helped. 

I feel like my thoughts are being dismissed and Iâ€™m just being told to be functional when I canâ€™t be. 

It hurts so much. Doing chores isnâ€™t going to make up for a lack of love in my life, or take away the financial pressure and lack of stability I have. 

I thought this therapist was different, but it turns out sheâ€™s like everyone else.
