Why Isn't Suicide the Answer?Why do people advise that suicide is an answer to an temporary problem? What if my life is miserable and pointless and won't ever change?

I live alone, work from home, have minimal social interaction. I have no significant other and never will, I have no family I'm leaving behind. I spend 65% of my day wishing I were dead and the other 35% not thinking at all in a somnolent state. I'm not delusional enough to think nobody would miss me, but such people would get over it quickly. I've been an insignificant particle in their lives.

I can't even begin to think about last time that I felt happy let alone joyful. I feel like I'm biding my time until I die of natural causes anyway, so why not expedite the process? Why isn't 25 years a long enough time period to live and say "hey, I tried my best but failed spectacularly. Time to throw in the towel?"

Thank you
