I'm one of the lucky ones, and I don't deserve it.I grew up in a broken home, with violence, drugs, and alcohol. I swore to do everything right and be the best person I can be.... and I failed.

Last year, I had allowed alcohol to take me over and it peaked. I was shit faced and was having sex with my wife when I blacked out. Next thing i remember my hands were around her thoat, then coming to again to her in the front room cowering and sobbing. I knew what I had done... and knew i didnt deserve to live. I calmed her down and layed her down promising i wouldnt ever touch her again. I then took all the alcohol and pills i had into the bathroom with me and locked the door. I did my best but i came to in a hospital bed with her by my side.

I told her to leave. I told her she didnt deserve anything that i had done to her and told her its ok and i dont want her there but she refused. Ive done my best to get better but it only got worse. Ive stopped drinking since that day and havent so much as raised my finger in her direction but its just gotten harder. Ive tried giving her an out but she doesnt want to. Idk anymore.
