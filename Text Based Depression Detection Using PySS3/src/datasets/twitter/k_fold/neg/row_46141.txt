give me a reason to live.I Can't take school anymore. I hate sex, i gave my virginity away for free and to a guy! I'm a lesbian and i wanted him to feel better about himself. Then i did that with every sad boy with a hard on for me. Now I make noises that are really just me crying and hopefully they won't look at my tear filled face. One of these boy's manipulated and sexually assaulted me and I haven't been the same since. Everyday is the same, i wake up, i go to school and i have to see my rapist everyday and I have an attack. school just doesn't seem worth it anymore. I'm not worth anything i have, i wanna give it all away to people more deserving.
