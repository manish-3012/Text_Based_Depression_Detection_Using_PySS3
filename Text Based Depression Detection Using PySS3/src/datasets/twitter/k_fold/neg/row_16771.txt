I'm done.I'm done with life. My mom hates me. I am lonely, but I have to much anxiety to go out and meet a girl. Anyways, who would *want* to date a 5'5" loser with no self esteem, who spends all of his time listening to music, and is ugly to begin with? I just want to end everything but I don't want to put my dad and sister through the pain.
