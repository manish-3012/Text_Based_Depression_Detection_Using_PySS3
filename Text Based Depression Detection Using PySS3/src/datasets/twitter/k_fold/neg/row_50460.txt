Unemployment limbo is hellI lost my job about three weeks ago. I have been looking every day since. I haven't been contacted by anyone I applied to except one company that I am reluctant to work for. Even with that company I am stuck in a part of the hiring process. I feel like I am doing all I can and nothing is happening. I feel like a complete loser and I'm constantly worried about money. I feel like this is going to be my life for the rest of my life. I'll be stuck in low paying jobs and susceptible to being laid off or fired on a whim and back in this position.

My life is already enough of a problem. No area of it is going well, but at least when I was working I could feel like I was somewhat productive and making progress as a person.

I feel like there's no point in living when all I have to do in life is pay bills and I am failing at the bare minimum of that.
