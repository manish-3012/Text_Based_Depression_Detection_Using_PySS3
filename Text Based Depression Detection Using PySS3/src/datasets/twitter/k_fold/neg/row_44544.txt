If anyone truly cared I wouldn't be thinking of suicide every single fucking dayThe people who I need to care about me don't. It's as simple as that. And if I killed myself, they would pretend they did care enough to say "*we would have gotten her help*". You know I'm shit at the moment, why don't you say anything? If any one of you mutters even just "*you could ask*", fuck you too. I've asked them while I was growing up. Several times. They always gave up on me immediately. I'm simply a lost cause and it won't be long before I'll try to kill myself for the third time. And this time I *won't* throw up the sleeping pills, medicines and the alcohol. Maybe I'll even buy a gun.

Even lucidly, I can't believe that people who need help have to suffer like this. I know I'm not the only one. I know some are even worse than me. But just by feeling disintegrated on the inside, corroding day after day, I'm done. So done. I may be a pussy that can't handle real life, but I don't give a shit. I know the fact that nobody I need to care about me really does, and if strangers say "*I care about you*" I know that they're just empty words of encouragement given so that the person might hold back from harming themselves in any way, giving false hope. That's how it is for me, anyway.

And because I can't afford therapy alone, because I have like three friends (even less probably?), because my family can NOT afford to have a mentally ill daughter since it's TOO MUCH FUCKING TROUBLE â€” I have to pretend I'm fine, I can't tell them about the times I tried to kill myself or they will call me a monster. Everyone will call me a monster. Every single one of them out there who knows me will think "*Oh, look at her, she killed herself and hurt everyone around her*". Fuck you. **Fuck you**. I've been almost raped once at fourteen and one this year, I've been bullied, neglected and mistreated by schoolmates, strangers and my family my whole life. I can't emotionally connect with anyone and I can't get close to people without hurting them or scaring them with my luggage. I've been disappointed, alone and miserable for twenty years. I have my faults too, but I cannot believe that no one â€” *not even in my family* â€” even **ACKNOWLEDGES** the abuse I've received my whole life, for one reason or another.

If I attempt suicide and I make it you fucking deserve your so-called "*guilt*", if you will have any. I don't give a shit about anyone anymore. If I die it's not your fault, but you have no fucking reason to judge me or feel sorry for me. Just shut the fuck up and go on with your fucking life.
