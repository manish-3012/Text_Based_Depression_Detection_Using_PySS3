i feel it's soontwo nights ago i sat at my desk and wrote out letters to family and friends telling them i love them, i'm sorry, i hope that one day they can understand and forgive me. the next day i was exhausted and didn't move from my bed. today was better. i didn't think of any of it until now when i'm alone in my room. all i can think about is going to the bridge down the street and jumping. when i close my eyes and imagine going over, the falling, makes me feel free, relieved. when i told the two closest people to me about it all i got was "your life isn't that bad" "i'm sorry honey". i can't expect an answer from anyone, but i just don't want to be here anymore.
