Nobody cares enough to even leave me on read. It's been almost two years since the last time a friend actually attempted to reach out to and talk to me, and even that was simply someone asking for a favour. 
 
 My calls and texts go completely unacknowledged, so much so that I don't see the point in even trying to have any sort of relationship anymore. Why bother putting any effort in when literally everyone else has showed that you don't matter to them? 
 
 I'm a waste of air and space, proven by peer review. If someone wanted me around, they'd talk to me.
