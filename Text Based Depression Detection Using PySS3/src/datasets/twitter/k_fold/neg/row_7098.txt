barely getting byi really need to get this off my chest, its late and im sleepy cus i stayed up for animal crossing 

TLDR; having a really difficult time moving on from my first long term relationship concurrent to the coronavirus shit happening and its wearing me down

-

late february my partner of 2yrs broke up w me (details on that is in my post history). he wants to still be friends so we've been not talking for a month or two and then we're gonna meet up and talk about how we feel about being friends

shortly after all the covid-19 stuff started blowing up very quickly

my friends have done soooo much for me to be here for me and support me thru all this, which has helped a lot. im also really into dance dance revolution, so going to the arcade and getting back into it helped a lot as well. but, as you know, the govt. started advocating self quarantine, as well as places this week have started closing - everything that was keeping me afloat (hanging out w friends &amp; going to the arcade) was quite literally taken away from me and ive been doing progressively worse this week

i cant even go to see my therapist bc they arent doing in office appointments. im gonna be doing my appointment thru call but still

i had my life laid out and planned out with him after i were to graduate community college later this year - something that we had talked about for a while...now, i have no idea what im doing with my life. ive been living day by day because im not mentally or emotionally capable of thinking past a few days from now, which i know is bad for the long run

also, miku expo, which rarely ever comes to my area when its in the USA, was postponed to september (originally was gonna happen in may) and i really cant see a future past that for myself. i dont have a plan of harming myself, but i just dont know what im living or doing anymore

people have been telling me i'll find another person who is "the one" / that if this wasnt meant to be, then it just means that something better is to come but everything was truly perfect; i really thought this was it. we've been through so much together and changed so much together and we were unstoppable and everything really feels like it's falling apart
