I'm just not able to cope with lifeI don't think I have any stressors in my life that are on their own too much to handle, but my ability to handle my problems are non-existent. I'm too depressed and anxious to keep on living and I drive everyone in my life a way. I don't know when I'll kill myself but eventually it will it's just something I've always known about myself.
