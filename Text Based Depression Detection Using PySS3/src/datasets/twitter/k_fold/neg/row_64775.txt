"Neither of us said anything after that"(Title is just a quote from the Front Bottoms song Tie Dye Dragon)
I went upstairs today to tell my mom how bad ive been feeling lately because fuck I have been feeling like shit. Ive been trying to work up the courage for a while but its hard for me. I woke up feeling extra bad today, extra extra bad. Because im a crazy teenager I at first tried to make my mom ask me if im alright by using sad body language and a weak, fragile voice. I really just wanted to see if she would notice because she never notices. She didnt notice. By the time i had finally worked up the courage to tell her myself she had started getting a short temper and scolding me for things i didnt know about, and nagging me over everything, and brushing off anything I tried to say to the side. That talked me out of talking to her and made me feel worse. Today is a bad day. Every day is a bad day. 
I spent yesterday gettin high. Huffed some shit because me and my friends were desperate, then we got our hands on some weed and found cold medicine in my house. Made some lean, smoked some weed, took some pills, killed some braincells. Night ended with my friend thinking she was gonna die because she took too much cold medicine. She was obviously fine she didnt even have that much. I still had fun last night though. I was too high to feel sad when i went to bed. 
UPDATE: mom came down and asked if im okay and i for some reason said yes. It wouldnt matter if i said no since shes basically out the door on her way to work. why would she even ask at this point? My answer wouldnt matter.
