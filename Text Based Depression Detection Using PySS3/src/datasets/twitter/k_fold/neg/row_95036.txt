It's kind of ridiculous that I'm hiding inside from this virus when I want to dieI guess it's because dying from Covid-19 is a pretty horrible way to go versus the usual methods.

But I still feel ridiculous sitting here washing my hands until they're raw, staying 6 feet from every person on the world at all times, and doing everything else we're supposed to do when I'm probably going to kill myself at the end of it anyway.  

I dunno, it feels hypocritical, like being suicidal and on a sinking ship and then getting into a lifeboat.
