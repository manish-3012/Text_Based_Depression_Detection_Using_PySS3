I'm just at wits endI've struggled with depression for such along time that I don't know what to do. I've been strong for such a long time but I feel like I'm treading water and I'm sinking fast and pretending I'm ok. I am in a failing emotionally abusive marriage that I don't know what to do. I can't bring myself to seek help because I feel like there's no hope. I caught myself staring at the rafters in my garage with an extension cord. I have two little boys from a previous marriage that I have full custody of and a 5 month old from this marriage and leaving them without their daddy is what is stopping me. I think my wife will soon ask for a divorce and I will not be able to provide for them if I lose everything. I'm just asking someone to tell me that everything will be ok and that I'll get through this. I'm tired of floating and faking it.
