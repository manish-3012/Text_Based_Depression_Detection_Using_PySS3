TiredIm exhausted, i hurt everyday. It seems like I canâ€™t stop these intrusive thoughts. Each day I feel like Iâ€™m closer and closer to ending my life. No one really knows. My boyfriend has some idea, but he thinks Iâ€™m just doing it because were upset. Now with this quarantine I feel really alone, I miss bullshit interactions with people cause at least I felt something. I feel pretty worthless and with issues Iâ€™ve been having with my bf, I feel itâ€™s caused him to lose patience. Now when we argue itâ€™s so easy for him to be condescending and mean and it only makes me feel worse about myself. I want so badly to be done with all this, but the thought of my parents having to deal with the loss doesnâ€™t let me. I just want some reassurance that everything will be okay, Ill probably end up deleting this like other posts, I just want to not wake up.
