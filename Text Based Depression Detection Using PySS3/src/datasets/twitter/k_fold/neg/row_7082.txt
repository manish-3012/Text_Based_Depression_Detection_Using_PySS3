I Don't want to live but afraid of mental and physical trauma accompanied before deathI just want to write this somewhere, I have no one to tell how I feel. I have failed in life miserably both in materialistic and spiritual life. I have no specific skill set no friends. I am a huge disappointment to my mother and my father . I keep wondering and questioning why was I even born. I remember my mother telling that when she was about to give me birth there was shortage of blood and I was dying before I could even open my eyes but my uncle came for blood donation. I often think if he was late I would not be here. Its true one have to struggle in life to achieve something I don't know if I tried enough or not probably I didn't but you see at this point of time I don't want to anything good I just want nothingness I feel all the struggle in this world pointless. I don't have will to be happy anymore. People usually say that there are people who are in worse conditions as me as in having disability or financially its true and that makes me feel that I am even more worthless. I cannot motivate myself
