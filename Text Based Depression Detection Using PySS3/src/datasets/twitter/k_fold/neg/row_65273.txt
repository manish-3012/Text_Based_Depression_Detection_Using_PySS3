I am ready to do it. I want to end it. I have the courage. But I don't have a method.The title basically explains it all. You can read my older posts to learn why I want to do this. If I find a firearm, I'm not hesitating. I'm going to search the house tomorrow, a low chance but maybe my dad has a pistol or whatever, who knows? I'm going to look for drugs too, but I searched them a little and there's nothing other than aspirin and ibuprofen, which won't kill me. I hope I can find a firearm.
