Gun in the house and I'm scared24yo Male here. My dad keeps a gun in the house, and he doesn't know that I know where the bullets are. I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I'm so scared and I want to die, and I don't know what to do anymore. 

I hate myself. I'm a complete and utter failure. I've had no friends for 6 years, never had a job, dropped out of college twice, no girl has ever expressed interest in me... All because of my fucking depression and social anxiety. I'm goddamn sick of living. "Therapy" and bullshit "medication" have done absolutely nothing for me. I can't get better, there is no other way out for me. I'm about to die alone right here because I can't figure out how to fucking live. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. I hate myself. 


No one gives a shit. They just tell you to man up and put yourself out there. I fucking wish one of those morons had to live with my disease for one goddamn day, then we can talk about manning up. No one understands that I'm better off dead. That the world and everyone in our would be better off without another useless waste of garbage sitting in his room all day too terrified of the outside world to contribute anything. 

What in the actual fuck do people expect me to do when I've exhausted myself and every option there is trying to get better. Always get back up on the horse they say, but after the fucking millionth time it bucks you off, and everyone else is doing just fine on theirs, when is enough enough? 

I'm sorry that I wasted your time with this. I'm scared and I don't know what to do anymore. I'm better off dead anything is better than this. I don't want to be like this anymore I'm so tired
