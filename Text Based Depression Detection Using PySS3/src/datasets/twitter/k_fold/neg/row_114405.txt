hi, another post because everyday it gets worse### hi, help

I just wanted to talk about the state of everything right now. Is it just me or is the world just really melancholic? I feel like I'm trapped everywhere I go and doing anything to express myself will just paint me as a bad person. I want to be heard and be treated as a person and not just a trust fund by a shitty parent or as someone that's supposed to make everyone happy. The funny thing is at the end of the day I just make it worse and nothing seems to matter at all... Everything, every try that I do is just thrown in the garbage. I've lost compassion for everything because I feel like I'm in a treadmill just looping over and over and over again. Giving my best is worthless and it being worthless is just being thrown directly to my face without the chance to state my case. This loss of compassion, in turn, makes it seem like I don't do anything for the better which forces me to act as if I'm fine when I'm not really fine. It's okay not to be okay but trying your best and making it seem like it's still not enough is really crushing me and this is where being trapped comes to play. If I still do my best it will just be an endless loop of nothingness but when I stop for myself it's me being an asshole. I'm sick of being treated a certain way and then when I do the same thing I am painted as a bad guy. Please if anyone is out there just listen to me. Help me. The world has rotted, at least for myself. It's driving me really mad rn
