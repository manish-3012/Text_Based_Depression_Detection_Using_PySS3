I donâ€™t want quarantine to endI can honestly say that during this isolation Iâ€™ve been the most at peace with the world then I have felt for far too long now. I hate people my age, everyone can be such a c_nt sometimes. I honestly donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll be able to manage going back to school and other things after this. Iâ€™m unsure what to do.
