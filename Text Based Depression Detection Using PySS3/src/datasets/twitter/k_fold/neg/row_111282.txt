The practical approachHi. IÂ´m having grim thoughts lately. IÂ´m a 27 y-o guy gratuate that hates his major (law, which I dont have the connections, looks or shrewdness to even get hired). 

I worked on call centers and now IÂ´m a secretary. I ended college five years ago. I live with my dad, and tonight he said heÂ´d be relieved without me on his house. 

Rent is high. Jobs are hard and low paid. People say IÂ´m smart, but IÂ´ve never clicked in an office. I thought it would be easier and cleaner for myself just to end the drama of earning a living. IÂ´m not for corporate jobs, not for field job (poor motor skills and I do like my technology). IÂ´m also gay, so no children to think of. And social stigma to pay. 

So what IÂ´m here for is: how do you keep on living if dying looks like the most practical option? No jobs, rent, stigma, rejection or else in the grave. 


Sorry to whine. I just need ideas.
