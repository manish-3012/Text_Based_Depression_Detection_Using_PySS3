There should be a name to "the feeling that you don't belong"I have this constant feeling that I dont belong to anywhere. Maybe in some alter-reality shit I am this successful guy, but in this world I'm basically no one important, no one at all actually. It's so fked up.

I keep imagining that I'm standing infront of me, and all I want to do is punch the out of him, I'll feel it too, but it's an awesome feeling.
