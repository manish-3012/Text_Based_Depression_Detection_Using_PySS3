Slowly DyingI have been depressed for sometime now. I used to go to a counselor every other week but then summer hit and I had an internship that made it really hard to make appointments. But a lot has happened since I have seen him and I feel like I am back to the start. Were I just want to die. The most ironic thing is that I always wanted to die in an accident or get a serious illness. Well about two months ago I started having liver problems and I found out a few weeks ago that I have an autoimmune disease that will eventually kill me. They say it will take probably 40 years for it to actually kill me since it is not a super serious disease. The funny thing is that I got what I wanted but I do not feel any better.
