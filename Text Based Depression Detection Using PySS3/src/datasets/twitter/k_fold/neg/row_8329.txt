Trigger warning I guessHonestly nothing soothes the mind like a dull blade. It just makes everything better. Its mine. Nobody can change it or tell me that itâ€™s not good enough. It is perfect and It will never stop. It isnâ€™t wrong or stupid or inherently a bad action. It is enough. It is beautiful and not a single fucking person will ever tell it that itâ€™s horrible ever again.
