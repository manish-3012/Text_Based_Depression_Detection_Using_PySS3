Feel like death is inevitable, description and need adviceThis used to be a long disgusting rant about how I get a lot of joy out of sabotaging myself, that this is an elaborate form of social anxiety/ fear of intimacy, that my parents controlled me to the point where I am 95% sure everyone in this college is trying to do the same, that my gpa is so low I can't go to a different school, this 5% of doubt is making it impossible to kill myself but if it disappears I will be consumed by paranoia of everyone around me and die. People have reached out but I'm too scared of them and their intentions to respond, withdrawing is my form of control, I dont even know if its hopelessness but every day seems to be driving towards suicide until it is inevitable, while people with less potential leave me in the dust with raw effort, i dont know what its like to feel like a real person with real needs that have to be expressed
