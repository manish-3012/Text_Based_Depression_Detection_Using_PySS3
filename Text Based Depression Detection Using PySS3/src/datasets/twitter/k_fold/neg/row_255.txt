The bare-minimum lifeDon't leave the house. Don't talk to anyone. Don't take care of yourself, or the place you live in (at least to an acceptable level). Cry at everything, or be unable to summon the tears when you need them. Spend all your time in escapism. Lose touch with reality. Forget how you used to be. Partake in all of the self-damaging behaviours. Quit them, just to swap to another and cycle back again in a few months. Your old friends hate you. Your family blames you for everything. Every single day seems wasted and is all too painful.

This is not a call out to anyone, or a guide or pity party, I am looking at my own dogshit life and crying. This is what I have reduced myself to, through my own faults and actions (or lack thereof), and my illnesses. 

The pain is so horrible that self-immolation seems like an okay option right now. 

But seriously, it does not seem like I can get off this ride anymore. It's full steam ahead to a bottomless pit of suffering unless I throw myself off. I'm at a loss and like many other people, I am lonely and alone. Honestly I don't know, or understand, who would choose life.
