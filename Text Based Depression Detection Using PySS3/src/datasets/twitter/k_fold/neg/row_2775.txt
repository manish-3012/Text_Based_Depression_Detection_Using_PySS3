I feel trapped by the growing pile of bull shut in this world.I'm not so sure where to start or if I'm even in the right place, but last night was the last straw for me to actually reach out and get help. I am struggling with bad anxiety, like it gets to the point that I feel I'm just going to explode out of my skin and my brain is going melt out of my ears. I have a lot good, positive things in my life (A beautiful loving wife, a healthy amazing two year old son, daughter on the way, etc.) But it seems like no matter how hard I try to hold onto the positive and good, I just get bombarded by the negative stuff, our financial struggles, my complete uncertainty about what I believe in/my identity, the state of the country, and how we are destroying our earth. You can see where this is headed, it is just this thought spiral that is going to be the end of me that I just can't seem to pull myself out of anymore. I used to be able to hold onto my family and be ok, but it's just not enough anymore. I don't know how to talk to my wife about it, (she and I are having communication/general relationship issues, shocking right.) I just feel like all things thaat motivated me to stay present in this existence just isn't enough anymore, and I want to find out if there is peace in death, but my doubt a and uncertainties make me terrified to die, it's like I told my wife last night, I'm too afraid to die but not brave enough to live. I hate it, so much. 

Sorry for the wall, I guess I just wanted to be as clear as I could. Any words will be a help.
