fuuuuuuuuck thisCan't do what I want to do, don't want to do what I'm expected to do. What the fuck is the point of life? Is there a universally agreeable reason as to why life is worth living, or why you shouldn't kill yourself?

Aside from the animalistic survival instinct, I place no value on my life and would certainly die if I were guaranteed a painless, clean, instant death that doesn't affect anyone around me physically or emotionally. The fact that this is impossible is literally the only thing that keeps me from offing myself. It's like people close to me are holding themselves hostages so that I'm forced to live.
