feeling like suicide not sure yet but im pretty damn close to itmy gf left me a week ago

i came home satuday after work to walk into an empty house with everything gone except my couch a few tables and clothes, i went out to go buy some supplies for the house once i finally pulled myself together, ive been mopping around all week at work so bad that my manager told me i might lose my job if my attitude doesnt change by monday,just got a text from her today saying she is the happiest she has ever been and now on top of all of that bills are due tuesday and i dont even have enough for rent, ive been binge drinking all this week sobbing my eyes out i havent ate but a few crackers ive been throwing up any food i try to each, i just dont know what to do anymore
