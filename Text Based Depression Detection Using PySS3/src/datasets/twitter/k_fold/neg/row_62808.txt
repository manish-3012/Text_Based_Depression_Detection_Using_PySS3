I'm just tired of everything. Either I'm gonna kill myself, slice my thighs open or cry myself to sleep.Know what I'm a little bitch. I'm just here because I need someone to talk to. I'm literally just posting for attention. Because in all honesty who's going to give a fuck if I'm out of this place. I just want to cry yet tears won't come. I can't cry my pain away it doesn't work anymore. I'm fucking 16 and I'm ready to leave this world. Two attempts and I'm still here, still sitting here dead inside. I just want to feel the sharpness slide against my skin and watch the blood pool at my feet. I want to feel the lightness in my head as my heart races and my breath quickens. I want to feel the sting afterwards. 

This post was supposed to help me. Instead its just made my urge grow.
