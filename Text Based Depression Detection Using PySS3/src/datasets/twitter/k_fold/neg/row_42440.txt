Help.All I want to do is stop breathing. It's simple enough. But at the same time I don't want to feel this way. I look at my boyfriend, and he's talking about how his day went and all I can think is, "I just want to slit my wrists," or, "I should go overdose on mom's medicine." There's a razor just a few feet away. I don't know what to do. I've felt this way ever since I was a child, and if something has caused it it must be repressed. Because the only thing I know is I want to die.
