I've been thinking about suicide foor 20 years. AMAI've been deleting everything I wanted to say and that doesn't work so I hope this is enough to get some sort of conversation going.

Edit: Sorry for my English, it's not my native language. 

Edit2: This is a throwaway account. And for some reason I feel obliged to warn you. I hope I wont change you in someone like me. (probably not my last edit)

Edit3: It might be useful to know a little more about me. I like extremes in every way. I even like (to some extend) the effect of my depressions because it makes the good times feel better. And even if it's hurtful for myself it gives me a different perspective on life.

Edit4: I hate it that I can't be as honest as I want to be IRL. I think that's one of the biggest problems in life. How am I able to change my mind and learn if I can't say what I really think. It has thought me a lesson: I have extreme thoughts so others have them to and they will be different from mine. So I have to accept them to give myself a chance of being accepted.

Edit5: I don't mind getting the downvotes, but at least give me a reason so I can see if I can change anything.
