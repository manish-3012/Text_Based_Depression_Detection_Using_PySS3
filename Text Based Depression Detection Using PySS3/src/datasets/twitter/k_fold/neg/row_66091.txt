This is sort of my note, last note.I'm leaving this as a suicide note maybe? I dunno. Why? Because I'm stupid probably. I have nothing to live for, no motivation for anything. I'm unattractive, stupid, and worthless more than you could imagine. I had nothing, but before at least I had a girlfriend, which seemed like an impossibility. But it was there. Now, she's gone. Left me like I always knew she would, probably for someone else. Now I have nothing. I don't see any reason to go on anymore. So tonight will be my last night alive. I'm killing myself tonight, and I hope it works. I don't want to live anymore. It's pointless now. So, goodbye world. Maybe I'll be more useful when I'm just a corpse, maybe then I won't be such a worthless prick.
