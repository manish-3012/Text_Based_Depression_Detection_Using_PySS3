This girl I know has already tried to kill herself and failed, now she wanta to try again in at least a yearSo I met her on reddit, and we're starting to work together to make a videogame. I don't know much about her, but she started talking to me about her depression. There are some good and bad news. She said she doesn't want to attempt suicide until we've finished the game, which wil tale at least a year, and probably more. But, when she discovered that I'm 14, she started closing off. She is addicted to valium, which she had prescribed because she broke her hand at 4 pills/day max, but now she's chugging up to 20 in a day (luckily it doesn't happen often). The game is about her, she's the designer and she had the idea, it's basically _her_ game, so i hope that will help. i tried explaining her my view of the world, that the main reason i go on is to leave something that at least one person in the future will find nice, to leave a positive mark in history, however small; she replied that there's no point, as the world is already doomed due to climate change so there wil not be any new generations. The main reason she wants to die is all the useless and undeserved hurt she sees around (teens raped by their fathers, women by their husbands, minorities oppressed, war, and the destruction of the planet), and it's just too much for her. I understand the feeling of everything being spoiled, but I can't quite comprehend how she can feel it so much (although I realise how privileged my point of view is, as a white, straight male, raised in the middle class with pretty good education). I really want to help her get away from suicidal thoughts, but I'm really clueless as to where to start, since it would also mean getting over an addiction. Anyone who can help, please do
