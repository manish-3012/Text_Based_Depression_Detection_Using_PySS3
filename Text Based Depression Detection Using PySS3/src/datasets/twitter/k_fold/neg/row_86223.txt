On antidepressants.I started Zoloft a few weeks ago and it's like I got a chemical lobotomy.  

I'm not suicidal anymore.  Not because I want to live, but because I feel like I don't really care one way or the other if I live or die.

I'm not feeling much of anything, really.    My already lower than normal empathy is almost non-existent now.   

I kinda like feeling this way, to be honest.  I feel like I'm not afraid of anything.

My emotions never got me anywhere anyway, so who needs them?
