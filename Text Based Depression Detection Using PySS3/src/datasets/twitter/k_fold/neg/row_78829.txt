Most of the time I wish I were dead.I have been depressed as long as I can remember.   The only times I am happy are when I am with my parents(who are getting older), with friends(who are all moving away) Camping, swimming, writing, or making things with my hands.  I hate how everyone is just on their phone, and I hate how everyone is just getting more hateful and cruel.      I feel like everyone just wants instant gratification, and there is no more time to just be human.    I really want to just go to college and get a job....but apparently there will be no jobs in the future.   I want to get married and have kids, but the news talks about how the world doesn't have much time left thanks to global warming.   I know this sounds emo, but I really wish I was never born. Or I wish that there were something after death.  I hate how meaningless and indifferent life is.
