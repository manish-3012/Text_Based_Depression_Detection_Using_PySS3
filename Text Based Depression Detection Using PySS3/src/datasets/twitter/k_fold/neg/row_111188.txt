I ruined my own lifeI'm in one of the best nursing programs in the world but haha I guess I got in by mistake because it's just been straight C's from the moment my first midterm rolled around. I'm pretty sure I'm gonna have to take this one course for the third time because I just keep failing!! And I didn't tell my mom I failed the first time cause I'm pretty sure she'd just tell me how I've ruined my own life (because I have!!). I'm not going to graduate in time, I'm not following the plan my mom has laid out for me, I can't fucking do anything right and I've already tried to kill myself 3 times in the past month lmao!! Why haven't I died yet? Is it because I'm not trying hard enough?? I've been cycling through ASA and aceteminiphine pills because the furthest I get is just holding the fucking pills in my mouth but then spitting them up because I'm an indecisive bitch.

I can't sleep at night because of my anxiety over the situation and I spend the majority of my time crying because I've basically ruined my chances of having a viable future for myself and my family.

I just don't want this shitty life anymore bye bye :)
