Got dumped contemplating how to hurt myself.Not really thinking about suicide at the moment, but i think me hurting myself might lead to that. As the title explains it all, I got dumped and it's stupid that I would let myself get affected. I just feel worthless.  Anybody know how to change your mindset that quickly to get over this?
