I just don't care.The only reason that I haven't killed myself is that it would make others sad. I did shitty in school because I don't care, I lack motivation, I'm lazy, and I want to drop out. I hate the city that I live in, but I'm to young to just leave. I'm too lazy to actually accomplish anything 
(I can't even motivate myself to write scripts or something like that, the only shit I care about.) I don't see many other options.
