How do I help my best friend?My best friend texted me last night saying she needed to talk to me about her recent "dark revelations". I asked her what she meant by that and she said "suicide". I was struck with anxiety and tried to calmly ask her what is going on and if she's ok and if I could see her. She told me she was with her SO and that she hasn't/won't do anything, but that she feels really unbalanced, in her head.

I really don't know how to feel about this, she's been the most stable person in my life until she told me this. I know I need to be there for her, and I would be there in a heartbeat. I can't really stop thinking about it and it hurts me a lot. 

One thing I know she's been depressed about is her boyfriend. They've been together for over a year and he's constantly putting her down, making her feel wrong/stupid, and gets drunk almost every night. He never wants to get married or have children. She's an amazing, talented, intelligent girl and I just hate that she feels this way.

So Reddit, what do I do? What can I do to help her? Is this a warning sign?
