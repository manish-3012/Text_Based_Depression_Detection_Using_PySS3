I have suicidal thoughts everydayNothing in life is enough, I don't find any valid reasons for being alive.

Alcohol isn't enough. 
Drugs aren't enough. 
Therapy isn't enough. 
Videogames aren't enough. 
Family isn't enough. 
Friends aren't enough. 
College isn't enough. 
Boxing isn't enough. 
Monster Energy isn't enough. 
AA isn't enough. 
Antidepressants aren't enough.
Prostitutes aren't enough. 
The chance of having a gf isn't enough. 
The chance of being succesfull in life isn't enough. 
Food isn't enough.

I survived a suicide attempt this September 4th, I really wish I didn't.

I am between hanging myself in the common roof garden of my appartement block or commiting suicide by carbon monoxide in my car. Which is less painful?
