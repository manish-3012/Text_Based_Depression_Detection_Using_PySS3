It's frustrating living like thisI have Body Dysmorphic Disorder, which has led to anxiety, depression, and an eating disorder. I have been waiting weeks for responses from my doctors.. it takes so long for them to process things.

The lack of treatment has gotten me down. My lack of friends adds to that. My mum doesn't seem to think physiological illnesses are so serious, but then again I just force a smile when I'm around people who I know wouldn't understand, so she just thinks I'm 'better'.

I can't go out without feeling absolutely shitty about myself. One look in a reflection is all it takes. I come home and just want to end it all because its so painfully frustrating that I can't live a normal life like (it seems) everyone else around me. Lots of friends, no major inhibitions. I'm only 21 years old.

Sometimes I feel fine, the next day, even hour I feel like shit. The other thoughts I have are of hard drug use to fix this awful feeling of depression, but it's mostly suicide.

What makes everything worse is the loneliness. I'm just sitting here starving myself making plans of suicide. I seem to have a very strong willpower, but It's getting weaker as the days without treatment pass. 

I really need someone to talk to. Anyone else have anything similar?
