I'm going to kill myselfI don't have any future. The world is also fucked and probably heading towards an era of incredible disaster and violence. 

I am unemployed, don't have family, my friends are far away and I don't have a partner. And it seems that nothing is going to change that. 

I have already seen my best times. They were really, really good. At one point, it was great to be alive. But not anymore. I don't see point in why I should go on. I rather quit while things aren't completely awful. I have lived about 30 years and that seems to enough. 

I also have regrets that can't be fixed. I don't want to live with them anymore. 

So, this time next week, I will be dead.
