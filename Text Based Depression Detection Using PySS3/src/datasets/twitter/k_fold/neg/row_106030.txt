My brother just tried to commit suicide.First off and foremost, this is a throwaway account. And I figured you guys would be better to talk to about this than askreddit, for this is what you guys deal with everyday.

I just got off the phone with my sister, and she informed me that my brother is in the hospital. His wife found him unconscious in his house, and called 911. He took a lot of alcohol with a lot of different anti-depressant pills. He's been going through depression recently due to a lack of job, no place hiring him, and the loss of our dad. He's 5 hours away and I can't take off work, so I can't see him.

I don't know what to do. I've lost 5 close people in the past 6 months. I don't think I can lose another. Dear God... I would go completely numb (I'm already there). This would devastate my mom, she would take it harder than any of us. She always told all of us that she couldn't live with herself if she lost a kid before she died.

I just... I don't know what to do reddit. I have a bad feeling...

If you need anymore info, just ask away. I'll be here pretty much all night.
