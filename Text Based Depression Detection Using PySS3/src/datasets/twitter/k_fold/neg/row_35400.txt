Deteriorating neuro condition. Thinking about making my exit while I still can.I have a mystery neurological condition that is progressing. It may be metabolic starting from birth and causing all my problems throughout my younger years. I'm still young I'm 23. Its effecting every facet of my functioning. I'm losing motor control all over my body, recently started to severely effect my speech and dominant hand. My world has gotten progressively simpler and smaller, my mind is a receding ghost. Without extreme effort most all I can do at this point is watch tv. Simple daily living activities are getting to be extremely difficult. I don't think I can relate to anyone on here much other than I keep thinking I've had enough and that I should take control of things while I still can. Don't take it the wrong way, but I envy your miserable, lucid struggles. I used to be able to imagine how things used to be but now I can't.
