I want to do it so badOne of my closest friends who I was in love with was killed in a car accident last week. Iâ€™ve been crying my fucking eyes out every day. It is too much to bear. It was really gruesome the way she died and I close my eyes and lose my mind thinking of the way she died. I canâ€™t believe I can never see or talk to her again. I think about it and my heart stops and I want to scream and rip my heart out so I can stop feeling the pain. I just want to be with her. She had kids and a husband. She was 32 years old. I have nothing but consistent suicidal ideation and a death wish. It should have been me. Why am I still here to suffer every day when I fucking HATE it here?! Last week when I found out I took a klonopin and cried hysterically in the shower. I wished so desperately that I had a razor blade because in that exact moment I felt confident that I could open my wrists in the bathtub and go through with it. I wish I could do it in a less painful way but I donâ€™t really see any other way. I donâ€™t have a gun and I wonâ€™t do an overdose because I donâ€™t want to vomit. I also want to watch the blood come out as my life Disappears and I am free. I am scared of the pain but I think if I write a note, take a klonopin, fill a hot bath and think of all the pain in my life I could do it. The pain is enough to make me want to die. I donâ€™t want to live to watch anyone else in my life die. I donâ€™t want another day of pain. I want to be with her. I want to stop breathing. I just hope itâ€™s not too painful. Please donâ€™t tell me not to do it. No one knows the pain Iâ€™m going through and if they did they would understand that death is just easier. Iâ€™m not made for this world. I just want to know Iâ€™ll die. Thanks for listening.
