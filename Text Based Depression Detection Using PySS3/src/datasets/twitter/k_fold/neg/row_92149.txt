I am not well. I am not living. I am rotting. I think I finally gathered the courage.I am not well. I feel worthless because people make me feel that way by mistreating and abusing me. They always abuse my love. And they abandon me. I've been in outpatient therapy for almost 2 months and I'm on meds, but it doesn't matter. I've tried therapy for the past 15 years of my life. I've tried many other things. I honestly don't see any future for me. I simply can't take the pain anymore. That girl did a number on me and I'm never gonna recover from it. She blatantly told me I wasn't good enough and that she was unhappy with me even though I only showed her love. My former friends also have abandoned me and the few acquaintances I have left ignore me. There comes a point where the rejections and abandonments are just enough and the cup is full. I started cleaning up my stuff which I had been postponing. I wrote my letter and refined it several times. It's never gonna be a perfect letter so im ok with how it is now. I know how I'm gonna do it. I know when I'm gonna do it. I look forward to the end of all this pain. I gave it my best. I'm not even sorry anymore. I know my family will be relieved and ultimately better off without me. I loved that girl with all my heart. It wasn't enough. I loved people. It wasn't enough. I know you're religious but I'm not. The term that comes the closest to explaining what I am would be agnostic, which means that i simply know that we don't know. We can only believe in stories, create our own or we can use our senses and the rules we discover by observing and interacting with reality. I don't and can't know for sure what awaits me, but I believe I'm either gonna see my brother again or I just won't be conscious, both of which are better than a life of pain. I have lived enough and I don't have any potential left to live more or change my circumstances. Pain is part of life but when it becomes the only thing in life, then it's not life anymore.
