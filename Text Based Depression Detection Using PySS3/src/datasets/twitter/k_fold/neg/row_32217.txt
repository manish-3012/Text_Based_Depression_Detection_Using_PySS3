The pressure increased, and there's less timeSo awhile ago I got in a scuffle with my father, whom I've been living with for the past year. I've been forced to find housing, which I can't afford and have no time to look into. Not only all this, but I've had to leave my favorite job I've ever been in. My psychology service agent suggests I join a program that I wouldn't be able to get to easily that I'd have to attend 3 times a week at inconvenient hours, which is already a bad idea considering I have no idea where I'm going to live.

I should have just printed my kid's book out. I should have gotten that project done while I still could so I would have been able to slit my wrists and be done with it. Now I'm almost completely forced to call it quits early. I'll never be free of all these programs and applications, let alone be expected to live the same way I've been accustomed to for so long. Why does all of this have to happen so suddenly? Why can't I go back and ask for forgiveness from the people I've wronged all because of my inherited anger from my shitty father? I've tried to repent so often, I've done so much self abuse to atone, but nothing has changed. My whole life is full of misinterpretation and misunderstanding; I can't put into words how awful I feel or how I feel about myself in a way that people would get what I mean. There's no time and no place to go, no people I can talk to that will understand or give me the right advice instead of "cheer up" or "think positively." There's only this horrible semi-life that I've had to exist through and tolerate, and now I can't tolerate any more of it. Please, let me die, for god sake.
