boyfriend committed suicide in front of memy boyfriend shot himself two weeks ago in front of me and since then everybody is coming out of the woodwork. his ex girlfriend went and got a replica of the tattoo I get to commemorate him and in addition to that iâ€™ve had people tell me he was doing things off to the side while we were together.


I literally canâ€™t take this. I wake up every morning and hate that iâ€™m awake. All my dreams consist of are wanting to tell him we can talk and work this out. I feel like the inside of my body is cracked in half and i donâ€™t understand how people can be so awful. I dont want any of this. i donâ€™t want to be here, All I do is sit on my sofa and stare, sit on my bed and stare. Iâ€™m trying to keep active and keep a schedule, be out in the sun. but none of that makes any of this any better.
