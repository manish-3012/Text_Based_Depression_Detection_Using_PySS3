I have no other option but to kill my selfKilling myself is my only option at this point. Everyone hates me no matter what. My life has been ruined by everyone, including my family. No one cares at all, even if they say they do because they r liars. No one actually helps me, they just tell me lies and stuff that doesnâ€™t help me at all. All everyone has done to me in my life is yell at me, ignore me, avoid me, make fun of me, bully me, and put me down. Ive been bullied since I was 5 and it went on for another 13 years. My parents always yelled at me and never even prevented me from being bullied. They prevented me from having out with classmates and with others and even prevented me from being outside the house without them. They also never got me diagnosed with aspergers, even when my teachers saw that in me. Itâ€™s too late at this point to even get diagnosed for it. College hasnâ€™t been any better. No one ever wants anything to do with me. My parents keep asking me why I have no friends when they r the ones who put me down here to begin with. Everyone at college just avoids me and ignore me. Everyone else at my college has dates and friends and I have no one. Everyone that has graduated from my high school is having the time of their life with themselves and their dates and friends. Meanwhile those same people are the reason I am having these problems. No one even wants me on my college Esports team. They talk to everyone but me. My coach doesnâ€™t even help me when I ask for it and no one else higher up listens to me. Therapists and doctors who prescribe me medications for my mental issues donâ€™t help me at all. They just scam me. My life is just trash. There isnâ€™t anything I can do about it. Only thing is can do is kill myself to get rid of this pain and my problems. Even if I change, everyone still hates me. No one changes at all. No one ever understands me. Killing myself is my only option at this point. No one cares at all. Goodbye
