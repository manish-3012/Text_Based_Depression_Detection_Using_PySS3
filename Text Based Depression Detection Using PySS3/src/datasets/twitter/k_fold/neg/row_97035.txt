I want to die but I'm not so sureI think I've been depressed for about 3 1/2 months now. I succumbed to "pausing" my world and just lying in bed all day, skipping work, sleeping in and watching nonsense TV, and ordering fast food every day.

I think this started with a really really bad episode of loneliness. I'm gay and haven't had a relationship since birth. Both of my attempts in a relationship were botched and ever since the most recent one, I've been on a cycle of pampering myself with good food, booze, and boys in bed.

I guess, positive side of this "pause episode" of mine are (1) my eyes stopped twitching regularly, (2) my stomach and body aches were gone and (3) I was able to cut back smoking.

Now, I've been contemplating about ending my life for a few weeks now. With every passing day, I try to find and convince myself of why I should keep on waking up in the morning, but up until now (it's currently 6AM) I still haven't slept. I just received an email from work a week ago about my termination, and as much as I want to appeal it, I feel like there's no point in doing so. As if I don't have any sense of living anymore, hence my thoughts of suicide.

I know that pursuing such thought would put my family and friends in such a dark place. So I guess my question is, is it bad to frame my suicide as an accident? (i.e. getting hit by a car, being pushed onto the tracks in a busy train station, etc.)

OR

Should I just consider moving to Auroville or places as such and live my life in simplicity?
