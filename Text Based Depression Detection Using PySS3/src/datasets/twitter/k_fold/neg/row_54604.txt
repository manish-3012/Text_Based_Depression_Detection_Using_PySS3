Whatâ€™s the least painful way to die that wonâ€™t scar my family for life?I understand that suicide by gunshot would be the least painful for me, but I really donâ€™t want my family to find me with my brains scattered everywhere. Using my guns is out of the question. Iâ€™ve heard overdosing on various pills, but I heard most of them are extraordinarily painful. Iâ€™m thinking about jumping from a 10 story building in my city or overdosing on opioids. Are these options painless/instant? With opioid overdose, Iâ€™m afraid my family will be the ones to find me, so Iâ€™d probably just do it out in my car somewhere. I think jumping would be better, but my family wouldnâ€™t get to see me at my funeral. What are the best suicide options in your opinion? Whatâ€™s the best way to soften the blow for my gf and family?
