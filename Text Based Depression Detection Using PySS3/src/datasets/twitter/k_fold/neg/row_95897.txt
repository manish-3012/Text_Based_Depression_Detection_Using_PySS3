Break my bones but act like my Spine, I wonder who youll fuck when dieI really like that one lyric from lil peep, I never really had a s/o but i can feel the sadness in his voice and what It mean its to him.

This is all my fault i did this to myself. I'm not dying tonight but pretty soon, my life is just L after L. My friend's all left because of my toxic behavior its all my fault. I want to vent to someone so bad but its like everytime I want to my mind goes blank I just can't. I had trouble writing this everything feels corny. I wanna attempt venting to someone one more time
