I'm back, and I think the 27th of this month is a good time.I really, really hate my life. I've gotten more hopeless since I first posted here, my mental health's getting worse, and I'm probably developing an eating disorder.

I'm 15 and a complete failure. My boyfriend isn't even keeping me alive. I can't even go to school, I get panic attacks because I probably have a form of PTSD over abuse from teachers. My ex girlfriend, the person who I loved and cared about the most, has become completely numb to me killing myself. So I think Monday would be good. I go to school for once, then I die when I get home. Or if I have another damn panic attack, I die whenever my father leaves the house.

Nobody truly cares. I got 37 discord messages this morning after I left a server that made me feel horrible after saying I was going to kill myself. I feel as if they only do that because they feel guilty for not talking to me when I was there. 

But anyway, I don't want PMs for this. I just want to kill myself in peace and not worry about panicking when I get PMs. I hope I'll be happy in death.
