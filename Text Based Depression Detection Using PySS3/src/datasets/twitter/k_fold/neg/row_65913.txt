I'm a complete failureThis is probably the wrong place for this 
I hate myself I can't find much i like about myself I'm in my mid 20s have never even so much as kissed a girl because I'm ugly and have no redeemable qualities I don't have my license so I have to bum rides for everything I'm even more shy than I used to be even tho I've been trying to get better I party I go out and do stuff all the time I live with a parent because I'm jobless I've lost ever job I've had due to factors outside of my control I haven't been able to find a new job for almost a year so I'm stuck taking advantage of my dad lately I've been having thoughts of suicide probably the only reason I haven't is lack of opportunity I can't call the help line it's not an option I have no insurance and no money I don't know what to do at this point I know I need help but I also can't really justify it probably just subconscious attention seeking behavior
