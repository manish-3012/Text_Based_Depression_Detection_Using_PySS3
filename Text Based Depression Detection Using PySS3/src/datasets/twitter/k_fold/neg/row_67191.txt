too scared to kill myself, too empty to live.iâ€™m done. iâ€™ve had it. my life has been going downhill since i was six and i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll ever get better. my parents split up, my stepmom abuses my dad and my brother, my sister has been raped twice and tried to kill herself, my stepdad lost his job so now we can hardly pay mortgage, iâ€™ve been hospitalized three times due to various physical health issues, iâ€™m failing all my classes, i lost most of my friends, i had to fight off opioid addiction, and i have nothing left to live for. iâ€™m so sick of existing. no matter what i do, it never gets better. iâ€™m done. nothing makes me happy any more. i just want to lay down in the snow and wait for the cold to take me. iâ€™m ready to go. thereâ€™s nothing left here for me.
