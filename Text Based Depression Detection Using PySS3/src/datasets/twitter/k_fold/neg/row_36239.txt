Embarassing AttemptIt was a long time ago but I failed my first true suicide so terribly. I felt so ashamed when later I looked up what I used and saw that actually what I did was totally fine for me and wasn't going to kill me. I would say what it was but I might wait until some people say some stuff first. I feel stupid as hell, like I can'
t even kill myself right. 

Has anyone else attempted but fucked up majorly and felt ashamed?
