Thinking of suicide even though I am not depressedSo I was arrested for DUI back on labor day, the DA has yet to press charges, but if they do, I will probably get convicted. Anyway, the police officer had no probable cause, but she lied on her report and said all the magic words needed to expand the scope of the stop and establish probable cause. I don't want to bore you, but I know enough about the law to determine how screwed I am. I cannot fathom the thought of a conviction. My pride is huge, and I want to protect it, even if it means death. I am actually contemplating committing suicide, this way, the charges will be dismissed and I will win. I know this is extreme, but I just cannot come to terms with getting a conviction when it is obvious she is lying. I know for sure I am not depressed, I just want to protect my pride. Have any of you felt this way? Is it normal?
