Today is not the day but soonIronic throwaway name I know. 

So, I got in a situation where I moved to a new place. I don't have any family who cares about me. I am living with my now bf who spends more time talking to his ex then talking to me even though he is injured and I cook/clean/etc for him. 

I want to leave him but I have nowhere to go. I don't want to be homeless again. I am in a great deal of debt (student loans - never finished my degree). 

The only thing stopping me from doing it whenever I want is that he found his uncle (suicide) and his brother (natural causes) dead and it has somewhat traumatized him. Plus, since he is injured his mom comes over a lot and I definitely do not want her to find me.
