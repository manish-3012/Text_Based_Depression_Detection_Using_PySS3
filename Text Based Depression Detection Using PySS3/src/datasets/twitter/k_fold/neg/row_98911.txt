I'm so tiredI'm tired of struggling against my own brain. I'm tired of not being able to do anything except sit in bed and cry. I'm tired of being told about everything I'm doing wrong and how I'm not measuring up to what people expect. Hell, I'm not measuring up to what I expect. But I don't know what to do. I have lost all hope, and no one will help me find any again. I'm sick of everything about my life, and I want it all to just go away. I can't take it any more. I can't take another day like this. I don't want to cry anymore. I don't want to feel hopeless. I want to be all right again. Someone please help me.
