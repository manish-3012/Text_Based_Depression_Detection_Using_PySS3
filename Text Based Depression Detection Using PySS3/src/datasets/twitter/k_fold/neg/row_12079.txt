My new friend dumped me I thinkMy new and only friend dumped me I think. We were both inpatient and then outpatient together and hung out together outside of the program a few times. She hasn't texted me in two weeks and I just texted her to say Happy Easter and ask if she wanted to hang out tomorrow and I got nothing. :'( Normally I'd give it more time but I just have a baaaaaaad gut feeling about this. Right now I just feel so hopeless and like I totally fucked up our possible friendship by seeming too pushy or by doing something wrong. I must have done something wrong. Why can't I just have a friend? Why? Why? Why? :'( I wish I was dead.
