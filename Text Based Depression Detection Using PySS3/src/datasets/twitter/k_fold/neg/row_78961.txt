Cry For ActionRegret. Guilt. Addiction. Isolation. Anxiety. Depression. Friends that we know too well.

How many hits have we endured? How many blood have we spilt? How much destruction have we cast upon ourselves?

We lack skills. We lack experience. We lack support. We lack will. We lack motives. We lack purpose. We lack joy.

We cannot hide from our minds. Not in a dense forest, in a remote island or deep in the mountains. Nowhere can we hide.

We are incompetent. Incompetent at living life. We do not belong here. We should have never been born. Our life, as we have experienced it, cannot be called life.

And yet... here we are.

It's time, brothers. It's time to awake. It's time to know who we really are, and what is our purpose.

We are warriors. Day after day we wake up in our bed and have to fight against our mind. Against every destructive thought and pattern. We may fall down a thousand times, but a thousand times we stand up. We return at night to our bed to sleep, no matter how strongly we want it all to end, we endure it, we survive. No matter how bad things look, we always make it to see one more time the sun rise. 

We will not let anything stay in our way. It doesn't matter how old we are. How many time we have wasted. How many opportunities we have let go. How many bad decisions we have taken. We will fight, now, and forever. To save ourselves. To find happiness. To find a life worth living. To be the change we want to see in this world. 

And we don't fight alone. We fight alongside our brothers in arms. What an honour. Let our suffering be the fuel we burn for our transformation. Life hits us hard, but we will come back harder. 

NO RETREAT. NO SURRENDER. WE WILL FIGHT UNTIL THE LAST BREATH.
