Just got a new diagnosisI was diagnosed with MDD when I was thirteen along with a couple other things, and just today, years later, I was diagnosed with Bipolar. 
Iâ€™ve become so comfortable with the concept of antidepressants and Iâ€™m knowledgeable about SSRIs and how they work, so today when I was prescribed a mood stabilizer, I was just kinda dumbfounded! Like, I have no concept of what it does chemically. (Iâ€™ve been looking it up so I kind of get it now, but still itâ€™s so new and unfamiliar itâ€™s just strange)
My point of the post was that Iâ€™ve been faring preeetty poorly recently (was hospitalized last week, have been considering suicide every day for the past couple months), but this new information is making me a little hopeful. Iâ€™ve been receiving the same type of treatment for years now and it hasnâ€™t helped much, so I am actually kind of eager to try something totally different. 
Just a sort of pleasant update, I guess? Maybe Iâ€™ll not want to kill myself soon? Thanks for reading
