I'm scared for my best friend and don't know what to do about it.I'm totally at a loss and don't know what to do. A short back story, So in my little trio of friends the other two we will call Don and Allie. Basically we've all been real good friends for the past 3-4 years and last year Don got a thing for Allie and they were dating for about 3 months when Allie broke things off because she didn't feel anything for Don and didn't want to waste his time.
Then they decided that they would take a month and figure it out on if Allie wanted to try again or not. role around to last week Allie said no, she didn't want to be with Don.
Now a bit further back I revealed to The both of them my notebook where I write down all my thoughts to get them out as a bit of therapy for myself and all that I'm dealing with. I learned then today that Don made his own notebook and gave it to Allie to try and communicate what he was going through. But Allie came up to me today and told me that He had written a whole bunch of stuff about how he loves her and all that and how pissed he would be if she said no because of another guy. but then she told me about a part where he wrote about wanting to commit suicide about "Just wanting to put a gun up to your temple and feel the bullet go through your skull and fade into the white." 
I've noticed also these past few days he hasn't been his normal self. And he texted me today telling me he wanted to talk face to face to me tomorrow without Allie around. I'm scared, I'm scared for him, I'm scared for what he might do.
I don't know what to do. He's my best friend and Allie already had one close friend commit suicide earlier this year. And if he dose I don't know what I would do. Basically I need help for tomorrow what can I tell him to make him not want to go. I don't care about grammar and proper structure in this post I just need help.
