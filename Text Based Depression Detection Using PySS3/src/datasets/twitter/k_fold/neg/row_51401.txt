I don't care anymore about others or myself. I just want to die.I'm fatigued by people who want to die for some bullshit passion reason. This isn't a movie. Life isn't a movie. I just want to die. I'm not cut out for life, that's that. I don't care about maintaining personal connections anymore. I just want to die.
