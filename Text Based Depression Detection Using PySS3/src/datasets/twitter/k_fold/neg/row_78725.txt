I donâ€™t want to be quarantinedIâ€™m starting to get suicidal thoughts again and self harming and I already am having spring break but our school will likely be online for about 2 weeks. My mom leaves at around 9:00am and gets home at 8:00pm, I know ways to commit and it kinda scares me. I would tell my mom about this but last time she yelled at me and which made me feel like a selfish piece of shit (sorry for language) I just donâ€™t want thoughts to get to much to handle.
