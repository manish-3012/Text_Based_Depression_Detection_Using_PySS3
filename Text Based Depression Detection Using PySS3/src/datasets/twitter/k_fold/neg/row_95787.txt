Why botherToday's my birthday I know many people none really care mom doesn't say anything to me until I called her out on it my dad doesn't say anything either I just got 3 happy birthday texts and even a girl that I am suppose to be dating sent me a happy bithday text but doesn't even want to talk to me right now. No matter what I do I'm the wrong one every year is the same I told the girl I'm suppose to be dating about everything and she doesn't even seem to care so I guess I'm done with living its always the same so there is no need for me to be here
