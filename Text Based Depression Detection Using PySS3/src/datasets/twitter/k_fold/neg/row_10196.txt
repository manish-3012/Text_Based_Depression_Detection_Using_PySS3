Why should I bother?I am a shy 62 year old man (weird) who was emotionally destroyed by psychologists nearly 40 years ago and find that every day is full of pain and suicidal thoughts. My thoughts are full of horror and ugly violence and I cannot talk to people very well at all, I do not have anything in common with them and am too bashful to approach them. As I am in the UK, talking to people is a waste of time anyway, The British are not friendly at all and will reject you, it is their default social setting. I just find getting through the day an enormous struggle and am getting very tired of just keeping on keeping on for no reason at all and do not know what I can do. I have been like this all my life and find people just do not care one little bit. I am scared of dying and pig sick of living, what can I do?
