Yet another Saturday that people I know are at partiesYep, Here it is again. Saturday, The best day of the week for most people! Not for me. Whilst everyone is out having a good time and going to parties (that I never get invited to), I'm sat at home with no one to talk to, I don't even have a brother or sister. The reason no one really likes me is probably the same reason that after having tinder for months not a single person was interested. I'm trying so hard right now not to end my life, and I just don't know I can handle it any more.

Tl;Dr I'm an ugly loser that came out of school with an amount of friends you could count on one hand. Half of the friends I had left dumped me after I opened up to them about my depression and how one of them ended up going out with the girl whom I introduced him to and also liked, supposedly he didn't realize this, despite me telling him multiple times.
