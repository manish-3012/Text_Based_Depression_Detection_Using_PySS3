What if help doesnâ€™t work?(30m) I had an amazing first 7 years or so. Then my family didnâ€™t have time for me and I slowly started dying instead. I would say I have been mostly dead since middle school. Around college I started getting help but I think it was too late. I kept trying for years because some part of me knew what is was like to be alive but now I am giving up. I really thought therapy would help but it just never did. I did so much of it. I am starting to wish I was actually dead. I am too dead inside. I am too dead to work, socialize, exercise. I donâ€™t enjoy watching tv. I live with my mom now and she loves me to death but I feel nothing. I honestly donâ€™t see a way out.
