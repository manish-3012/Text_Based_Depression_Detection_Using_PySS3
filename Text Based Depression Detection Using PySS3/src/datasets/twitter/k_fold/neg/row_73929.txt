Keep dreaming about my ex to the point I'll wake up crying and need help on how to make them stop.So I've been with a guy for a year and 3 months and we broke up because we fought way to much and he didn't know if he loved me and kept messing with me saying he wanted me one day then they next would say he hates me. It was very unstable and I do love him and I have never once had a relationship like the one me and him had. We've been apart for a few months now. But he did cheat on me with his so called "best friend" and when We broke up the one time he went back to her and I took him back after that which I feel was so stupid. I recently started dating a new guy who is beyond nice and I do like him but I never tell him about my dreams because my ex some how always appears in them and it's always him cheating on me with the girl or it would be with a complete other girl. I don't know why I have these dreams because we haven't talked and some times I just wake up crying and feeling so down because of the Dream and I'm not sure what to do because then I can't go back to bed and it really brings my day down. My new bf says to be open and tell him everything even including stuff about my ex but I feel that's just to weird to talk to my new bf about my ex. Please help and give me advice and tips.
