I made a promiseSo 2 weeks from now i was planning on oding on some medications but yesterday someone made a promise with me that they wouldn't kill themselves and I wouldn't kill myself. It's been two weeks or more since I last talked informally to someone so it just felt good to have someone who can relate to talk to. I hope we are able to keep in touch, people who understand the struggle and don't judge are so hard to find.
