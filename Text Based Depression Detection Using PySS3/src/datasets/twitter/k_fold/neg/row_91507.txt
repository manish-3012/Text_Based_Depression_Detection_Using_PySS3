wondering what people's experiences have been with crisis mental health resources? :/hi everyone! its 3am and im \[23,F\] feeling sad and suicidal yet again, but now im also filled with this primal rage to, like, completely dismantle our crumbling mental health system and rebuild it with my tiny little rat hands? 

on a previous post i made, it seems like a lot of people have had sort of bad experiences with crisis centers, whether it be suicide hotlines or psych hospitals or ERs or otherwise, and i was wondering if you feel comfortable if you could share your experiences here, great, good, meh, bad, awful, etc. for example, did you feel like the person you interacted cared about you? stuff like that.

(also im really sorry in advance if there have been like a million other posts like this, i literally joined reddit like 6 hours ago and am running off half a brain cell)
