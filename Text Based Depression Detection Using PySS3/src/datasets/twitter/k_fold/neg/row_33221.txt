Given a weapon for ChristmasI'm originally from the south, I've grown up shooting all my life.  But anyway, my dad still apparently refuses to accepts that I am depressed 5 years after I've told him, and gets me a handgun for Christmas for "defending my apartment" and "flexing my second amendment muscles".  It's like it's talking to me from my drawer in my room.

Tonight's been the worst night in quite a while, and definitely since I got it.  Think I'm going to sit here on my computer and distract myself until morning.  Need to take the damn thing to a pawn shop or some shit.
