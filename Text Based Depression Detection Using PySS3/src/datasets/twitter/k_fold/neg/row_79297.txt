My life is rotting away. I want to end it all. I guess these are my last cries for help.I have been suicidal before. Attempted it 3+ times. I thought I was out of it until recently. I feel worthless as always. I have 0, absolute ZERO friends or people to talk to up here at my university. I am just watching myself rot away as my academics keep degrading. I used to be so smart and have so much potential. Nothing is working. I have nothing left other than academics and not that is failing. I am a failure and want to end my life before I cause burdens for others. I have multiple methods ready to go ranging from hanging to helium/carbon monoxide asphyxiation devices to various drugs to overdose on This isn't some stupid throwaway account, this is the dark side of me the nobody ever sees. This is a cry for help. I am out of resources to cope and deal with this any longer. It is taking me over as I watch, powerless. I thought I was attractive and successful and appreciated, but nobody ever talks to me or likes me or enjoys my company. I have always been too nice of a person to get along with; I must come off as boring. Never had a girlfriend, never will be able to. I want to give up because there I have no purpose or passion/fire to do anything anymore. I am a failure. 
Here is my question. If I overdose on 50+ iron tablets, enter the hospital, ER unit, and tell them I am going to die, past the point of return, can they salvage my organs once I die? Doing this would make me somewhat better than the worthless piece of shit I am right now.
