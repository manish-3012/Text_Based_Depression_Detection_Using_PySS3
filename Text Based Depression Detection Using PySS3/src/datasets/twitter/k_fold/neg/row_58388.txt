Giving up on everythingI'm going to keep it short and simple because I need sleep. I have no outlet at this time so slowly I'm reaching a point where I just want to give up.

**Myself**

I just don't feel good enough.

**Her**

I've been seeing someone lately and I've become really attached to her. I've tried to have sex with her twice but I haven't been able to pull through because of events in the past. I wasn't able to have sex with a partner in the past because of a pill I was taking, and this created terrible social consequences for me so now that I'm in the situation again I feel performance anxiety.

We've also been seeing each other less and having less conversations which makes me sad. I don't want her to see any of this though. I want her to see that I'm fine. Friends are the place for confidants, not partner. If they see weakness, they will see you as less and become drawn to someone else stronger and I don't want that to happen with her.

I also feel really inadequate for barely having sex. I'll see over people I know in clubs scoring and that just makes me feel inadequate.

**Friends**

After my first year at college, I didn't make many friends. I'm back in my hometown for summer break (southern hemisphere) but I feel like everyone has forgotten about me. I'll still be invited to parties by my high school friends because I'm in their Facebook group, but I find it difficult to connect with people. I'll see people excited and enthusiastic to see each other, but an apathetic response towards me greeting them. It hurts.

**Parents**

I come from a household where I'm coddled and it has come to a point where it is just moronic. I'm 19 but can't drive or cook for myself. I need to find another way to learn life skills because my parents sure as hell hate me taking risks. I can't even communicate about it. My mother screamed at me and threatened to stop funding college because after seeing me upset, I told her I feel like I had to justify everything.

My mail gets opened without permission, my room is rearranged without any consent, if I disagree with anything I get screamed at.

**Career and education**

Again, with the coddled household, I was also a spoiled shit. I ended up hating my life and my situation to the point where I ended up applying to become an exchange student in the United States. I loved my life over there because my host family would find it ridiculous the things I'd ask permission for. I felt so free, but it has damaged me academically.

I'm in university doing a pre-degree course to get me into college. Living in a dorm is great, living in a foreign home is great, anything but my family is great because I have breathing space to be human and take risks.

---

I want to improve my situation. I have had points where I'm determined too but I often feel like it is futile and I'm just back in this mud pit of self-pity. It'd be much easier just to cut everything off.

I also frequently fantasise about committing harm towards others because of the media impact it could potentially have on me. If someone commits suicide, they are a lost soul and get people feel sorry for them. If someone harms others then commits suicide, they are an enigmatic genius and people will remember you for a longer time. I probably wouldn't harm someone else though. I don't have the balls.
