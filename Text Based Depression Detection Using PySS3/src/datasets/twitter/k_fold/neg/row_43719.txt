People Treat Me As Though I'm Not RealThe cruelty they use, it's as though I'm just not a person to them. I doubt they ever think back on what they did, and the only one who does calls me a crazy bitch and playing victim. They have no idea (or more likely they don't care) the trauma and despair they inflicted. 

If I'm not seen as a human by everyone else, why should I value my life.
