I'm running out of strengthI'm running out of strength. I don't have it in me to function. I can't eat, struggle to walk, hardly sleep. I feel like a lifeless doll. My head feels like it's been stuffed with bricks and every breath hurts.

I've been avoiding people a lot recently. I don't want to see them. Not even my friends, family or random passerbys in the street or at counters at supermarkets. I can't handle talking to people. I can't handle their cheerfulness or positivity knowing they expect those emotions from me. They're not in me. Don't even have the strength to pretend. And as I find no one can tolerate negative emotions, I feel like leaving them alone and isolating myself is the best thing to do.

I can't take bad things that happen. The smallest of things like knocking something over make me want to kill myself. I'm too fragile and I don't have too many coping techniques to process things healthily. I'm trying to be gentle with myself. I'm trying not to overthink about the present or work myself up with thinking about the future. I know the worst of these feelings will pass and I can go back to pretending. 

But I don't know how to actually deal with this situation. My head is spinning and my lungs and throat feel like they're on fire. I don't know how to persuade my mouth to open and eat and chew and swallow. I don't know how to deal with all the work I've got to do. I don't know how to stop losing friends because I ghost them. I don't know how to keep up the appearance to my family that everything is okay. And I don't know how to break myself out of this viscous cycle of excruciating pain. It's all far too much for me and I don't have the strength to deal with it all.
