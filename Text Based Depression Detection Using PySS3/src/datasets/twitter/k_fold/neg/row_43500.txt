Organisational help needed please.I've decided tonight is the night. That decision is made and done. But I want to leave as little mess behind as possible. My plan is to just disappear. I will let the unfortunates know of my plan so there are no wasted search parties/missing persons reports, but if everything goes accordingly my remains will never be found.

However, I am in need of some assistance when it comes to organising the end please.

I have already written out login info for our bank accounts + Internet provider, but am drawing a blank on any others. What am I missing?

Funeral costs are mute as long as I'm left where I lay.

He will probably have to sell the house.

I have no life insurance. 

What will happen to my debt if we're not married but are financially connected?
