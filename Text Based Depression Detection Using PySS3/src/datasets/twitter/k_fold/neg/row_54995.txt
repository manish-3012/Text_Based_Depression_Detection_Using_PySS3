Helplessness. All I have.Last week or two Iâ€™ve realised I really donâ€™t like who I am. I cant stsy happy for long and I donâ€™t feel like I belong anywhere. I just donâ€™t know what I want to do. I know people will miss me if I die and thatâ€™s what stops me but I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m meant to do with knowing that.

The only times recently Iâ€™ve felt close to happy is when Iâ€™m drinking and then the following day regardless of what happens I feel worse and the suicidal feelings get worse.
