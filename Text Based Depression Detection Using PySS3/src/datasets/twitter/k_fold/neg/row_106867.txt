Lacking support..On the 19th I made attempt to take my life. There are a lot of factors for times sake lets just say I am at rock bottom and suffer from pretty serious mental illness. I tried to communicate to friends my feelings and overall they've been brushed aside as manipulation or generally dismissed. Now that I made an attempt the two people I have told have chose to cease contact. The doctors biggest concern was lack of support which is where I am currently at. I don't know what to do. I am alone in this and it feels inevitable. How do I do this alone.
