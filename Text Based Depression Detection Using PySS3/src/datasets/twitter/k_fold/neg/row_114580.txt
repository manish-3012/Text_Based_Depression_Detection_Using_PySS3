If you want to know what a depressed person feels like well you're in luckI think of myself as a horrible person. I've tried to keep myself happy but it just makes me worse. For example. The /r/SCP community hates me now, they think of me as cancer, I tried to have a laugh at /r/roastme but I ended up looking like a fool. I don't even have friend and it's the worst time too. Everyone now knows me as a freak and I was even featured in a video which turned out to be chaos. The video was about roasting and featured a roast of me that said "if I do will you still let me on your Christian minecraft server?" And now everyone at my school makes fun of me. I'm even physically hurt however the school doesn't give a fuck. I have an unstable relationship with my brother and I keep aggravating my mother and step father. I'm also fat and unattractive. I'm thinking of ending myself because I only hinder the human race. Tune in next week to learn more.
