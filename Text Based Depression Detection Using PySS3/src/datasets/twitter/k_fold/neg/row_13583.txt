I'm quitting my job after COVID to travel and killing myself when I'm done.I can't do this 9 to 5 rat race. I'm in my first job after graduating in Dec 2019 and I am disappointed with how enslaved I feel. Reddit, google and every resource I look for does not help. I quit. Life is a scam and you do not get to be happy... you gotta live according to how the world forces you to.  


Im waiting after COVID so I can travel after quitting my job and in my last day of traveling I will end it in where ever I am. I will not be able to enjoy life because I will be enslaved until I retire at 60 years old. even if I attempted to rebuild my life after traveling I will come back to my country to unemployment so end it.
