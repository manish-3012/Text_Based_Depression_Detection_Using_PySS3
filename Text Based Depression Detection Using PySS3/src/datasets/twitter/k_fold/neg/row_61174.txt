I don't know if it's normal or should I see a doctorI've (23M) been kind of "sad" all my life, usually negativist sided mind but, nothing that could worry my family. 2 or 3 years ago had a mental break and needed medication for 6 months or so. Actually I'm in my "usual" state of mind but have been thinking about not wanting to exist anymore (how easy would be to stop all my problems) and I get like flashes of me doing things that could end bad (for example if I'm near to a big window in a building I get flashes of me jumping, however I really don't have the intention to do so)

I think I'm not that depressed, I can smile and enjoy life sometimes, but can't help those thoughts and flashes. I even try to distract myself in those moments

Apart of that I believe I just stoped caring enough about my life in the way I'm not afraid of those thoughts, but I ask you guys to see if that's something I should work on or just leave them be  thinking constantly that I don't want to do it

Enlgish not my first lenguage so yeah, forgive me
