Why should we just accept loss as part of life? Why not just end things.From everyone I hear things from they all just take loss as something you're supposed to just think of as a part of life. Like negativity is just something we just have to accept in life. But if you just can't accept things then why keep living? Are we supposed to just feel bad every now and then and keep going? Why do that? Why trap yourself into constant pain?

 Everything is temporary, especially friendships, But if everything just ends then why even try? Why make friends if you're just going to separate every single time. 
Why set myself up for failure? You keep living and you just trap yourself into constantly feeling horrible over and over again. Why would you ever want to live?

I always hear things like how its "the small moments that count", after a while the joyful things all stop. It doesn't matter if you feel good every now and then if 90% of the time everything is just terrible. There's no reason for me to keep living anymore, I'm just waiting for the very soon be day that I just finish myself off. I don't care anymore, I knew I should've just done things sooner.
