My Brother Threw Himself In Front of a TrainIt's been about 8 weeks and nothing has changed. On 1/27 my brother rested his neck on the tracks in Houston and let himself die. For my entire life he was my best friend. Now, I can hardly move. I've given up on my PhD. I have no source of income because I can't fucking stay awake for more than a few hours at a time. I just don't know what else to do other than follow his lead. I can't see myself recovering. Moreover, I don't want to. Is death by train a decent way to go out? Most of me just wants to find the courage to go to the place he ended his life and end mine there too. I want to experience his final moments despite the fact that it will be my last.
