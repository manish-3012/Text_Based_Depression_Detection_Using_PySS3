December 13th, 2019 - FridayIf my life doesnâ€™t turn up, the next Friday the 13th will be my last day on earth.  Is it strange that I feel comfort by having a deadline? I know how Iâ€™m going to do it. I know itâ€™ll work. Iâ€™ve read academic journals about it and have 100% confidence that itâ€™ll work. 

I wish I had a life worth living, but I donâ€™t. 

The universe has 39 days to prove to me otherwise. 

Until then, Iâ€™m trying to get everything in a row. Iâ€™ll be writing letters to my loved ones, give instructions for my funeral, and just cleaning up after myself. 

Iâ€™m looking into the possibility of buying a â€œhow to deal with the suicide of a loved oneâ€ book. If yâ€™all have any recommendations for one, then let me know.
