I'm in constant pain and always will be, so what's even the pointI've had chronic pain most of my life that's only gotten worse over the years. Doctors don't have an explanation for it and don't even try to give me real treatment for it. I've had 5 separate doctors insist that I'm just stressed so I just need to make myself be less stressed and I'll be cured. It's infuriating and agonizing to have to live like this. I can't work, I'm failing school, I can't go do things with friends, I'm just stuck inside all day and need to lay down every hour at least. This isn't living, it's existing, and it's pure torture.
