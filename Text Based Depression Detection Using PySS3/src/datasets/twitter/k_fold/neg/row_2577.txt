Ok no one responded to my post last nightSo anywho I am 32 as of next Saturday and my dad earlier this week decided to be a complete dick because he wants the ac to run hotter than I can physically handle. Seriously if the temperature is80 I start sweating just sitting at me computer. Then I get dizzy and feel like complete shit for a week straight. I am broke and unable to support myself. Also diabetic and had surgery 3 years ago to remove 2/3rds of my right lung. And a recovering alcoholic. I don't sleep well am alone and isolated due very much to social anxiety. I am constantly stressed out and ready to just kill myself before my NDad can do any more damage than he has already done to me I have nothing left to give. I can't fake this shit anymore. I'm done
