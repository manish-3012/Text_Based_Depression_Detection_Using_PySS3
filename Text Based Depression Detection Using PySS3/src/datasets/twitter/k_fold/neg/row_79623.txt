school stared and i dont know what to do with myselfbefore I begin I'd like to share my life story.
My parents didn't plan me in fact they didn't want to have any children any time soon
they weren't even in a relationship they just both worked behind a bar and one night they both got drunk and well I don't think I need to tell you what happened

my dad didn't give a shit 
didn't pay my mum or anything they had a rushed wedding and after a few years of living sepretly they just didn't have contact with eachother
though still being married 

I lived with my mum in Ireland for a while but since my mum was having some mental health issues it was hard 
From what I was told I would run away from home alot and go to a park that was fairly close by
but it was becoming so comman for police to bring me back home my mum was getting anxious
she told my grandmother and of course the only thing she thought of was to call my dad and tell him to just "do something" 

my dad flew to us and told my mum he wanted to start over and just by a family
my mum was very happy in that moment
after a few days my dad sent my mum out to buy some soap 
while he was gone he packed his bags and took me away to England

And when my mum was banging on his doors so that she could have her daughter back 
he called the police 
my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia and my dad got costody over me 

I lived with him untill I was 10 years old 
I was put into a mental hospital because I was self harming and being aggressive towards other kids 
but I wanted in there long 
after that he kicked me out and sent me to live with mum nan I Poland
I've been here 5 years now and have gotten diagnosed with bpd

alot of stuff happened I developed a smoking addition 
I've bet alot of bad people but some that I'll always keep close to my heart 

I thought I was getting better but now that I'm in a new boarding school
I feel like garage I haven't slept almost 3 days because of the anxiety 
people keep looking at me people point fingers at me and fucking laugh at me while whispering in the ear of someone else 
they don't even have the balls to just talk to me 
they just laugh in there groups staring me down 
I don't want to die anymore 
I have people that I want to live for but god I keep shaking 

I don't know what to even do with myself
