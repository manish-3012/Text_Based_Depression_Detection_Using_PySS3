Man look I'm writing shit. I don't even know. 
I breakdown for nothing, holding my emotions when family's around y'know
I fail everything, every sport, always shit, in school I get UNDER 8/20 (french grading system) in sport, I was so shit in my 1st high school year, I luckily passed in economics, failed almost all classes, under the avg in majority, so it's vacations finally, saying to myself ok I'll try finding some mates on Counter-Strike, practice against other teams and join online tournaments. You don't know but I like this shit, the communication, the trill, winning a round that seemedimpossible, yeah Then my mother goes saying after a few days I Can't play anymore for all time because "she doesn't want" soheluzhzyz stszdydjzJdbezosnd8#2892

I have nothing to do now, i'm a piece of shit at anything, tried to learn create a website, failed at THIS PHP PIECE OF SHIT PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. FUCK PHP. FUCK PHP.  
I am so overrated at video editing, actually I'm bad .

I don't wanna do anything. Fuck man I just wanna go and explore somewhere other than my town because my mom fucking locks me and cares too much, gives me 0 money, can't go anywhere, my town is SHIT for going out.

I just wanna go explore and get hit by a car on the speedway or find a cool bridge to scream my last words
