Honestly could be any day now.I know this is probably the worst fucking day  ever to come here and as a result nobody will care to  talk to me because you will all think i'm joking. everything just makes me so upset and angry, every last tick that people have, from breathing to tapping their pencil on a table it drives me fucking insane, making it impossible for me too focus in college. I am only in MAT 990 and i can barely figure this late chapter stuff out on top of that i've got two massive papers i have to somehow write and absolutely ZERO time to do any of it. i don't know how other people fucking do it. ill admit im smart and all but im not smart with anything that college can enhance. i don't fucking belong in college but i cant drop out because my parents would practically disown me if i did i have all of maybe three friends right now and i only talk to one of them. hes my boyfriend he's the reason it very difficult to just go jump off the library roof right now. i dont know what i should do. im far too embarrassed to talk to my parents about it because ive  hidden my depression from everybody for so long i feel like nobody would believe me if i told them
