Iâ€™m an angry bitch because Iâ€™m using it to push people away so I donâ€™t hurt them when I kill myself.Jesus Christ Iâ€™ve written this thing three times. I want to die because I feel hopeless and fucking trapped as a rat in a cage. My situation, my mentality, my life is so stupid and pointless. Iâ€™ve managed to cut myself off of any and everyone who has ever cared about me. My parents hate my guts because of how angry and delusional Iâ€™ve become. Iâ€™ll bite their heads off for even looking at me wrong. But I canâ€™t help it. Everything, every feeling, thought, word, minute, is fucking unbearable and I canâ€™t think straight. I canâ€™t cope anymore. 
I want to slice my arm up and down then crisscrossing like a checkerboard. I want to feel that final rush of adrenaline before I pass out from drinking a bottle of rum and lumbering to my closet to seal the goddamn deal. I need this to end. 
Iâ€™ve thought long and hard and this is the only conclusion Iâ€™ve come up with. Iâ€™ve tried two other times a couple months ago, but using a different method. Iâ€™m more confident in this method because Iâ€™m violently angry and hopeless and all those other adjectives that I canâ€™t fucking remember right now. 
I need this to be a bad joke. I need to wake up already. I need this to end. Fucking hell. Iâ€™m sorry
