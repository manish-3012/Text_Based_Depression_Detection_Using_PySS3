Fantasizing about a suicide methodA few days ago, I reached a point where I felt so awful about myself and my work that the only thing I could do was research ways to kill myself. This is far from the first time I've done this, but this time, I found a way that really felt right to me. It seemed so right that I fantasized about it the rest of the day, and at times in the days that followed.

My doctor told me to tell him if I ever started making a plan. I guess I haven't decided for sure that I want to die, but I've never been so attracted to a specific method before. As with every line I've crossed, admitting to him that I experience suicidal ideation, coming back after a few incidents of self-harm, and now this, I worry it'll be *the* thing that'll get me involuntarily committed.

The only things I'd need to kill myself are my car and the gumption to do it. It's scary to think that I could go through with it if I have a bad enough day.
