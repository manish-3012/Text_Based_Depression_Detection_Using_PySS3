I think it's time to move on to a better placeThere's just no reason to keep going with this miserable life. It feels like the world hates me, or I'm just incredibly unlucky. Every single time I feel like I'm enjoying life, everything turns around quickly. I fail at everything in life, even the smallest of things I fail at. Completely talentless, pathetic, stupid, waste of space garbage. Never had any friends, piece of shit family, no one to talk to. No one even knows I exist besides my family. Everytime I go out in public it feels like I'm invisible. The only reason I haven't ended myself yet is because of my love for video games. I dont care about anything else in this world. But even then, that's not enough. 

So please, why should I be forced to live for the next 50+ years knowing that I'll be miserable the entire time? Why not just end it? I much rather prefer the forever pitch black emptiness that is death over this miserable life that wont amount to anything. 

I really don't know why suicide is looked down upon. Maybe people just want to keep you trapped in this monotonous and miserable life, so they pretend to act all nice and supportive...? Idk man. I dont understand you people. It's not like I ever asked or wanted to be here, so why should I even bother if I don't like it? In reality, killing myself would only benefit the world. So I'm just confused as to why so many people are against suicide. Weird
