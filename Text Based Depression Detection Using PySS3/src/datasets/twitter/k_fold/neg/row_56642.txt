Visions of deathLately I keep seeing myself dead in my head. Iâ€™m just on the floor face down bleeding out. This is when Iâ€™m thinking about slitting my wrists. 

When I stand by the train station I probably look really creepy. But really I just stand there and picture myself getting hit by a train over and over. Wondering what the force would do to my body. 

Or when Iâ€™m thinking about swallowing all the pills I have. I see myself writhing in pain as I slip into darkness. My insides just bleeding and me on the floor clutching my stomach. 

Iâ€™m not really sure if Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Some days I feel more ready to do so than other days. The hopelessness is just so... present in my life. I feel like a parasite. And I donâ€™t really want to be alive. Besides being a burden aside.... Iâ€™m not even enjoying my life so what is the point..? 

Regardless though the visions are getting stronger and more frequent. So I guess at this point itâ€™s just a matter of time till Iâ€™m just done. 

For now tho I guess the visions will just keep replaying.
