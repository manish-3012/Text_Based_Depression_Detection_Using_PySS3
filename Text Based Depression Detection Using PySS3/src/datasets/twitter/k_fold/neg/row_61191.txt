I took 60 Advil and 20 adderall last night. Somehow still hereI spent thanksgiving alone. In the darkness I figured it was time to end it so I too the adderall and Advil since there were close. Counted and it seemed like enough so I took them and felt content for the first time in years. 

I woke up a few hours ago and now Iâ€™m empty. Not happy, not disappointed, just blank. No blood in urine so no kidney failure which is a side effect I was happy to avoid. Feels like nothing happened. Iâ€™m pathetic.
