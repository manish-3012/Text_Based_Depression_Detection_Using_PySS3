Iâ€™m doing itMy boyfriend just broke up with me. He was all that I had. 

Edit: Iâ€™m on mobile so Iâ€™m sorry about the format. I know my post was very vague but I was in a very emotional state and couldnâ€™t think clearly. I ended up taking way more than Im supposed to take daily of adderall, and I just got back from the hospital after 8 hours. I know no one will probably see this or care, but Iâ€™ve finally made the willing choice of seeing a therapist. Itâ€™s very hard for me to open up to people so therapy has never helped me, but I just want to be happy and love myself. My whole story is long and complicated but the point is if anyone is out there struggling with mental illness please seek help. Itâ€™s extremely difficult, I know, but sometimes even just venting to someone can feel better. Showing your weakness is the strongest thing you can do, and it took me years to learn this. Iâ€™m sorry for the rambling, Iâ€™m still not 100% myself but Iâ€™ll be okay. I just hope this helps someone. I mean Iâ€™m 18, so I havenâ€™t experienced a lot of life, but Iâ€™ve had my fair share of internal struggle. I didnâ€™t believe in therapy but I have hope now.
