Constant suicidal ideationSo this isn't a new problem, I've been like this for as long as I can remember. Every day I wake up and wish I had died in my sleep, sat at work ( like now ) I wish I could just go to sleep and never wake up, the same thoughts are there all day every day, driving to work or coming home, seeing my 'friends', doing fun stuff, etc.

It's just constant and never ending. I don't really have anything to be sad about or depressed about I just feel like I'm in mental pain all the bloody time.

A couple of years ago I was taken under the care of a mental health crisis team and finally got to see a psychiatrist, after a few assessments the conclusion was that I have a depressive personality disorder and that it's unlikely to respond to medication (of which I've tried a lot).

This has ultimately destroyed every aspect of my life. I lost the woman I love, the one person who somewhat soothed the pain, because I couldn't commit after 7 years together mostly because I felt like there was no point when I know I'm only going to kill myself. I really wanted to be with her, marry her and spend my life with her but this overwhelming desire to die to overroad everything else.

Despite all this I'm fairly successful in business, I'm what most people consider very well off, but really this just hides whats going on under the surface.

I do occasionally talk to people about how I'm feeling, but almost nobody actually understands what I'm saying because they've never felt what I feel. I can't really talk to my best friend/ex now because she's moved on to somebody new, he's a nice guy I think and I'm glad that she's with somebody who will look after her because obviously I never could in the long run.

I'm not really looking for help, I don't know what I'm looking for, I just spend so much time hiding how I feel I just wanted to put it out there. My head hurts and I just wish we had an off switch.
