Does this final note make sense?I tried writing this note many times but never found the right words to express how I felt, and I quickly realized that there are none. Ever since I matured around the age of 14 I felt out of place and belonging somewhere else, somewhere far away from here. I was depressed for 7 years since then because every ounce of my being rejected my existence in this world. I didn't know why I felt this way, but I did know that I kept longing for death and for what lied beyond, because everything in this life felt wrong. I didn't know if there was something inherently wrong with the world or if there was something wrong with me, either way I couldn't keep living like this. I spent many years with the same thoughts and feelings stuck on loop inside my head, and I knew that I would never escape this circle of self destruction unless I went through with this.

This conclusion was the result of many years of contemplation and careful examination of my mind and state of being, nothing could've convinced me to reach any other end. I've studied many philosophies and ways to live a fulfilling life, but nothing fit my frame of an ideal life where I could be content. I couldn't have friends because my eccentric nature and depressing ideologies deterred everyone, and it was much too exhausting to keep up a faÃ§ade. I always had to be someone else in order to keep up relationships with others because I myself was not good enough. 

I kept this short because my thoughts and feelings could only be understood through my own perspective, and I had no profound ways of explaining it all. I didn't want you to draw false conclusions regarding my reasoning and thought process, so it's best you don't try to understand, because you never will.
