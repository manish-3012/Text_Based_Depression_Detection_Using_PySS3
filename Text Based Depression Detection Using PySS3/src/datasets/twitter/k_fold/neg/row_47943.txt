I wish no one depended on me.I have wanted to commit suicide for at least a decade off and on.  Some days I'm fine and some days like today are awful.  I'm currently taking medication, and I've been on several other meds, but it feels like no matter what I'm on there is no "magic bullet." I just feel pathetic and worthless.  I hate myself, but I keep failing at self improvement.  I think I'm a burden on society at large, yet I can't end my life, because my brothers who idolize me and who both have mental health problems would be devastated and might follow suit.  Instead I'm stuck wishing that something kills me by accident.  I just feel trapped in an unending spiral of misery.
