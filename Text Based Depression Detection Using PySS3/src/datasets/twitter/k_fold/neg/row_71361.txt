Who needs friends anywayWell today I just lost all of my friends but one, because they're a bunch of circle-jerk  hypocrites. Shit went downhill after New Years Eve, two of my mates got drunk, one of which had alcohol poisoning. I helped one to his bed and checked on him frequently to make sure he didn't choke or anything, the other I helped for several hours making sure he didn't die or shit idk. First time this happened and I helped both of them.

From there on they hardly talked to me. No one ever asked how I was when I asked the question. Everyone stopped caring. A part of me wishes I never helped them and left them to fate.

One kept argoing me for no reason and the guy who constantly calls people a pussy or a cuck straight up tells me off for fuck all reason then blocks me. Dude contradicts himself all the time.
Second 'friend' just sucks his dick off and follows his lead without even asking me what happened.
Third kept sharing our dms with both of them.

The worst part about it was that we had this idea that we'd all live together in a big house with heaps of shit. Oh well, that's not happening any more.

I don't think I even have the capacity to have friends or make friends any more. It just keeps leading to heartache and bullshit. 
I'm not sure how to feel :|
