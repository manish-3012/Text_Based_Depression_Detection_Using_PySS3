Save me, please.I can't take the pain anymore.

I don't love or open up to people very often. But everyone I do open up to or love just... it just destroys me. They always find someone better. They always talk about how they say they don't want me to get hurt, but then turn around and become happy and rub it in my face, and forget about me.

I hate it. I hate myself. I hate myself for hating them. Why am I even alive. Why am I such a pathetic excuse for a human being. I just want to die. It's been six years since I was diagnosed, and I just want it to end.

My cut won't stop bleeding. Maybe this will be it. I just want someone to hold me, before this pain all ends.
