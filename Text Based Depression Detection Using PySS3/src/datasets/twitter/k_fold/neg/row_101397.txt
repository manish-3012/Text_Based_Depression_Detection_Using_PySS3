It'll happen eventually.For anyone looking to help an OP on the edge, please move on as I am not in immediate danger.

I've recently been officially diagnosed (finally) with depression. Like many others, I have good days, bad days and really bad days - sometimes for weeks at a time. I'm currently in a relatively good place, but something continues to cross my mind.

I think about suicide many times every day. I don't think about ending it within the next several days or weeks, but I see no future for myself.

To give some background on myself, I have a "near-genius" IQ, no social disorders, almost no anxiety and I would describe myself as lazy. I have plenty of friends, a loving girlfriend and supportive family members. I know I have plenty of advantages which can lead me to success, but I'm squandering them with lack of effort. I love to learn, but only about specific topics which interest me. I have had constant trouble in college with my courses because I have no interest in putting in the effort required. I'm confident that with minimal effort, I could achieve an above-average GPA, but I have no drive to do so.

Anyway, I have trouble seeing a future for myself. I genuinely believe that I will eventually commit suicide. I am not currently suicidal, but I can see plenty of ways where I could be pushed to that point.

Does anyone else feel this way? How long has it been like this? How do you cope?
