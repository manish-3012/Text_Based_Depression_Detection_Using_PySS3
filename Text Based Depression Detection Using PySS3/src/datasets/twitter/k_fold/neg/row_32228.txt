"Following the Crimson Stained Road"Well here I am again
Following the same dusty red road
A path that turns you up down and sideways
Every step I sink deeper 
Deeper into the thick red blood
My red blood
This path is special
It tells you dirty little lies until finally you start believing them
Lies about your fake smile you put on when someone asks what's wrong
This path doesn't let you sleep at night
It pulls you in deeper with every hour of sleep
Until you can't breathe
Step step step
With dark crimson lines on my wrists I can finally breathe again
These dark angry lines remind me of a certain crimson path
Hopefully I'll see it in person tonight
