i really dont want to kill myselfsociety is really unfair, only the rich have a choice. They can do whatever they want with their money. They can easily see a doctor, a therapist or can even buy expensive medicine. My point is even if I want to seek help, even when I want to improve my mental health, I dont have the money to do so. The world really revolves around money. Fck u if u dont agree. So yeah sometimes people dont really have a choice they either tolerate the suffering until they explode or choose to end their life sooner. I just find things really unfair. Maybe hell is really the earth
