Thereâ€™s not a second goes by where I donâ€™t question my existence or wanna die...My social and academic life are turning to shit by the second... this is great news because Iâ€™m slipping more and more which means Iâ€™m literally gonna die soon. Whether â€˜intentionallyâ€™ or not... I cannot take life anymore... iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™m depressed or sad anymore Iâ€™m too numb like i canâ€™t feel anything beyond my bodyâ€™s defensive mechanism or whatever ... i am too disconnected from the world... being me is wrong. I canâ€™t fake to be someone else because I already lost who i am... I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m alive till now why does no one hate me enough to kill me? I should probably do it myself but I donâ€™t trust myself to ensure that i die. Iâ€™m scared I might fail or live because of a â€˜miracleâ€™. I donâ€™t think life will let me go that easy yano...

Death for me. Can i get an amen? (Iâ€™m not religious btw)
