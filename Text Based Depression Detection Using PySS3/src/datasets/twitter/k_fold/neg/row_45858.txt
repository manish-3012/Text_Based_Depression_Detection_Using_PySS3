I've lost everything that's brought my life purpose and happinessMy romantic relationship is over. He'll be happy with someone else, I'll be missing him forever.

My parents have rejected me. I am not their son, just an abomination for being gay. They'll never accept me. Their words.

My God, I feel abandoned by him. My faith doesn't encourage me or bring me strength lately. I feel like I'm losing it.

My friends? What friends, rather.

Everything has slipped away from me and I wonder why life is still worth living. I want to end it all. Maybe tonight. Or tomorrow. Maybe when no one's home.
