chronicSorry if this is the wrong place for this kind of rant.For as long as 15 years I didn't want to live cause living means to be someone i simply am not.I tried to suffocate myself ,i know,pretty pathetic. Cause i am to afraid of the pain and unknown which dying is, i chose the next best thing: to isolate as much as possible and search online for soulmates.Turns out I am too incompatible with nearly anyone cause of awkwardness,social anxiety and overall low social energy due to ptsd and/or autism.In an attempt of hope to get help i tried to get diagnosed but i was send away with adresses for social therapy etc which i am unable to attain.Now my life just contains of forcing myself just to survive.I had a 'relationship' to a man, which i let go on for far to long,seeing now how emotional unavailable he is.Relationships are like drugs and i dont know how close or distant is good for me to feel to someone without getting obsessed or hurting them or me.Anyway now i don't have to worry about that anymore.Just have to stay away from people and find joy in myself and hobbies i guess.Occasionally there is still this longing for 'finding my people' but my attempts fail.It's like there is a wall between me and the world,which nobody can see.Constantly hitting this wall is so goddamn exhausting.I don't know, i just want to feel normal and save i guess but today,it seems extremly out of reach again.I want to learn to love this wall now.Maybe it is here to protect me.
