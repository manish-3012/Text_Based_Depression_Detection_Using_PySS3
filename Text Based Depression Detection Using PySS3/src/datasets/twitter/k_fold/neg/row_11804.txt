I am destroying myselfI am male and just turned 23, I have battled with eating disorders since my puberty, I went from being anorexic to being obese 170kg currently.

Because of my anxiety I self sabotaged my work life. My family is the source of all my problems and I have no friends, at school I was always the kid that everyone made fun of.

Had a very short relationship that went nowhere because when she was around her friends she would make fun of me so I broke it off.

I had one friend that I met when I went to the anorexia rehab center, she was the closest thing I had to a best friend, but she died because of complications of anorexia.

At the moment I am not suicidal, on the contrary I am terrified of death. But at the same time I am destroying myself with bad food and sleep deprivation.

And also the regret of having spent my best years jumping from doctors instead of enjoying life and making experiences.

I had to get this out, thanks for reading
