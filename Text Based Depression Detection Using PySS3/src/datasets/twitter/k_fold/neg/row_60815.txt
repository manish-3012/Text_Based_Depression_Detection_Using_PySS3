I failed to kill myself againI failed again. I feel worse about myself for being too much of a coward to do it. I get so close but can never get to that jump. My 18th birthday is tomorrow. I don't want to make it. I underlined this sentence in a book "he understood at last he was not supposed to survive. His job was to walk calmly into Death's welcoming arms." I've been suicidal since I was in elementary school. I even tried then. I wish I could finally get it done. But of course I fail once more.
