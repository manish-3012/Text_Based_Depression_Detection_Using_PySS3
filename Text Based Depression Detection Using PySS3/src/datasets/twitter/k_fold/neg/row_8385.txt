Learning to let go (not referring to killing myself!)Before I begin, I should further clarify: No, I am not asking for help to try and kill myself.

When I say letting go I mean letting go of the people that drain me and the parts of my life that are driving me to feel this way.

To begin, I put myself out for people too much. I know this is a problem, but I honestly feel like that's the only way I have worth in life. 
Recently- and in the past as well- I've felt completely drained. The people I give myself out to, namely my best friend have taken all I have and give back little to nothing. 

Last year I tried to kill myself. It had been the year from hell and I had started cutting. After getting fed up with cutting I decided to end it. What felt so eerie looking back at that day was how happy I was. Seriously, I was giggling and crying with joy. I'd finally get away from all my problems and I didn't give a rats-ass about how this was going to affect everyone else. I was actually at the bridge too, but I chickened out at the last second.

Fast forward to a year later. Things were getting better but now... now I'm at the end of my rope again.

I feel like I put out so much and I'm constantly getting brushed to the side. Worse still; my best friend, whom we share romantic interest with has started dating some dude who is wrong for her and kinda... forced himself on his ex-wife. 

I'm sorry, I'm babbling. What I need to know is how do I go about disconnecting myself from these people. I love my friend dearly, but I just don't think I can be around her anymore. Not like this.

Any help would be appreciated.

Also, does anyone know any good, distracting games I can play?
