Anyone had success getting through trauma/PTSD?I feel trapped in my depression because I havenâ€™t been able to sleep due to trauma related nightmares. It seems to be affecting every part of my life and I donâ€™t know how to overcome it. I donâ€™t want to die but itâ€™s hard to feel like my life is valuable when I struggle to do very basic human functions (sleeping, eating, driving, etc). My therapist recommended emdr and Iâ€™m really terrified to start it but at this point it seems like my only option. I donâ€™t have a stable living situation either so Iâ€™m not even sure Iâ€™ll be able to still see my therapist. I just really need to hear some relatively successful stories from people who have experienced abuse since early childhood to early adulthood that have gotten through something like this. Iâ€™ve been telling myself â€œitâ€™ll get betterâ€ since I was 12 and so far it seems to have only gotten worse. Iâ€™m hopeful (Iâ€™m only 20) but at the same time hopeless. Would honestly just like to be able to sleep at night and let my loved ones touch me without feeling unsafe. Any tips or support would be really appreciated right now. I was kicked out of my house (without any notice via text) and am currently staying with a supportive friend. Trying to stay positive but I keep getting intrusive thoughts to self harm that I havenâ€™t acted on yet but am worried I might. I donâ€™t want to put my siblings through a suicide, but I also donâ€™t feel like I have a future career wise. I had to take a leave for financial reasons and honestly am so afraid. (If you happen to know me irl and come across this post Iâ€™m safe right now just reaching out for support)

TLDR: I canâ€™t sleep, getting ptsd flashbacks/nightmares, no appetite, canâ€™t be close to people physically without feeling unsafe. Also donâ€™t know where Iâ€™ll live in the next month which is causing a lot of anxiety. Hoping for some encouragement that this isnâ€™t the end for me
