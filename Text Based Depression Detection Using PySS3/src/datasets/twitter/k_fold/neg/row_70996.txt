I hang myself as a method of self harm rather than for pleasure.Iâ€™ve struggled with feelings of depression and anxiety since I was a child. Even at 8 I would withhold myself from eating until I was so sick I would dry heave, despite my parents always providing meals or trying to force me to eat. By 10 years old I would intentionally start fights in order to beat other kids up, which was quickly put to a stop by my parents. With no one else to take my anger out on I graduated to cutting myself by 11 and breaking my own things by 14. I couldnâ€™t handle frustration and my thoughts of self hate would cause me to destroy items I loved whenever â€œtheyâ€ didnâ€™t work how I wanted them to at the moment. Iâ€™m incredibly sensitive, but keep most if not all of my feelings inside, so my friends and acquaintances have no idea about this violent side of me.

Now in my mid 20s Iâ€™ve learned not to destroy things but instead take out my frustration by hanging myself until everything goes white. I was so disconnected from this action that I didnâ€™t even realize the reason my neck would burn when I bathed was because of the bruises and irritation from the ropes. I viewed the hangings as myself attempting suicide but chickening out and have only recently realized itâ€™s a form of self harm.  I get no sexual gratification from it. In the past 3 years Iâ€™ve done this approximately 10 times. 

I know there are better ways to relieve stress, but none of them provide the instant numbness or â€œjob well doneâ€ feeling that these bad habits do.
