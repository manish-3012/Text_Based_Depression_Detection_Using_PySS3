Iâ€™m a failure, and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.Almost 2 weeks now of missed school. Iâ€™m a senior in high school, but I canâ€™t bring myself to go. I took medication months ago but it wasnâ€™t the right one, it didnâ€™t help much at all but it made living bearable. Now I canâ€™t get myself up in the morning and all I can do is sleep and think about ending it. I got my first job a month ago, which didnâ€™t go well, got a new one recently and god knows how long Iâ€™ll keep it.  Iâ€™m disappointing my parents. Iâ€™m considering getting back on medication, I really donâ€™t want to but Iâ€™m getting to that point again and Iâ€™m not sure what to do. I just need help.
