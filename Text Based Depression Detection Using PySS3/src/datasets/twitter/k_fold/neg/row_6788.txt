Why do i have to sufferI can remember thinking as a kid "I dont want this" . I never wanted my abusive alcoholic father, I never wanted to get bullied at school, i never wanted any of this suffering and i can clearly remember thinking that when i was around 7 years old. I never did anything to anyone :( and they put me through all that :( .  Now that im not running from my problems anymore, Im suffering constantly. My intentions have always been pure but i am so corrupted now that i feel like a monster. Not only do i have put all the work in a normal person puts in, but i have to get through my mental illness that was created from my fathers abuse. Ive been working ALL MY LIFE to get better and be the person i want to be. A good person. I just never get any of the love i put out into the world back......  It feels hopeless. Why if i never asked to be in this world, is it taboo if i want to die?
