Iâ€™m going to kill myself because of my financial issues I lost my company couple of months ago, used my savings to cover the money an employee stole from my company, made loans and even got money from friends and family to save my business. Now Iâ€™m dirt poor living on my parents house, that want to kick me out because I canâ€™t find work (iOS Engineer in a shit-hole country) because companies asked for me to travel for an interview and itâ€™s impossible because a flight ticket cost a lot and nobody is willing to help me pay to go to an interview. The bank said I have to come up with $7.740 to pay my debts by tomorrow, I have only $0.74 on all my bank accounts combined.

 I donâ€™t know what to do, Iâ€™m even receiving death threats from a friend of mine because I paid what Iâ€™ve owed him but didnâ€™t paid the fees yet.

Idk what to do, Iâ€™m doomed.
