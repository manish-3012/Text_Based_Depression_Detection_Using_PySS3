My girlfriend is suicidal and I made it worse and I'm afraid to lose her...My girlfriend and I both suffer with depression and suicidal thoughts. We've been together for almost two years and it has been a lot of downs and ups. Between physical fights and hurtful arguments, bumps and bruises, mental and psychological scarring, we managed to love each other And try to make the best of it.  
 
A month ago I started having panic/anxiety attacks because of all the things we've been through to the point of my mother coming to get me from her house. The moment she needed me the most I went home. The moment she needed me my mother told her that homosexuality is a sin which caused her to sink even deeper. (My family is Jamaican and deeply rooted in Christianity) 

My girlfriend suffers from PCOS, being hearing impaired (and her hearing is currently getting worse), scalp psoriasis and sebhorric dermatitis. She is the only androgynous, heavily tattooed, biracial (black and Filipino), hearing impaired lesbian in her family and her family ignores her and doesn't make her feel like she's there. On top of that she's an only child and her parents don't even really give much of a damn about her and I've seen it first hand. 

She feels so alone on a daily basis because everyone that has ever been in her life has done her wrong. People she's called best friends, cousins, girlfriends, have taken advantage of her and used her and dragged her name through the mud to the point of her isolation. The point of where she can't keep a steady job 

Her biggest fear is her being alone for the rest of her life. She feels like she doesn't have a place anywhere. She feels like this is the life she's destined to live and she's scared and she wants to end it all. I've had to monitor her when she takes pills because she's overdosed before. 

I slipped up by only thinking of myself and thinking that she didn't need me because of all the things we went through and how she made me feel. I didn't think she loved me that much. I ignored her crying for me before I left and the day I left. 

I feel like utter crap. We have been unemployed for months because of our mental states. We have bills that are so backed up that our car might get repossessed, we've just lost the car insurance and or phone bills are way behind. I'm swimming in medical bills and her entire life is on the line. 

I feel helpless and I've added on to her loneliness when all I wanted to do was be her all and to be her family. I've in turn made her feel like how everyone has made her feel.

 I don't know what to do, but I know I don't want to lose her...
