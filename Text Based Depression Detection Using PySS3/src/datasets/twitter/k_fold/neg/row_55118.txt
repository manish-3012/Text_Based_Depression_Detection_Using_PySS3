I cant do this anymoreMy mental state has been declining for as long as i can remember now and my girlfriend made it all go away while we were together until 4 days ago when she broke up with me. I am young but i really believed she was the one id grow old with because i let my guard down and i let myself love someone and got my heart broken which has just triggered all of my mental problems to come back. It was still an issue when we were together but i could always bounce back and get through it with her support but now that i dont have that anymore i feel myself slipping back and fuck man im just overwhelmed i havent slept for a minute in the four days since she finished me and i have barely eaten anything only lay in bed and played video games just to realise the distractions dont work anymore. I dont mean to make this sound like i depend on a relationship to be okay but it really did make everything go away and gave me a reason to get up in the morning and i dont have that anymore all i have are my darkest thoughts coming back and i just feel like im walking underwater and i just cant do this anymore nothing is worth it anymore as love is all i crave. I am preparing multiple suicide notes and i will leave the one i am most content with when i do end it. Ive heard xanax and alcohol is a nice and lethal combo so ill be sleeping eternally when i manage to get a hold of both of those. I hit rock bottom long ago  but my head has just been stomping me into the floor itself and i just cant take it any longer the pain is just immeasurable and i dont understand why i of all people had to be born i would never have come out if i knew all it would bring was hurt its just so pointless im just going to let this insomnia take over me until i cave in buy the stuff and finally fucking die and ill atleast find out if hell is for real but if anyone bothered to read this i dont know what im really supposed to say now but i hope things go better for you than they did for me

See you all on the other side if its real
