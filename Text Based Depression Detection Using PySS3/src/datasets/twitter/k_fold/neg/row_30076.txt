Another singer killed herself todayI got a news that another Kpop star killed herself today. She recently lost her friend(also Kpop star) and also suffered from severe hate comments. She suffered severe depression and she even tried to kill herself this May. But no one couldn't stop her taking her own life. It's extremely sad and devastating. I am also very suicidal, and it makes me feel that suffering would never stop if I don't kill myself like her. Idk if it's right to post this but I just want her rest in peace and such thing would never ever happen again. People are so fucked up and ruthlessly killed another singer like that. It is shame and it is wrong. I hope she rest in peace. RIP
