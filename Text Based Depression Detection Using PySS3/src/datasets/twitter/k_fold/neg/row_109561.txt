I almost jumped off a bridge tonightI don't even have the energy to get into what drove me to do it but I'm trying to get better. I just don't know how to see the future when I'm stuck in an awful place. It makes it seem like this is how I'll always be. How do I know it will get better and I'll love me in the near future?
