Suicide thoughts every few hours, no energy, can't sleep. I'm giving up...So I think I am ready to just give up and just forget about getting better. I'm only one fucking year away from graduating college with my bachelor's and I don't even care anymore.

I want to simply just die. To die in a way that no one knows about what I am dealing with. Maybe, die in a way that is viewed as an accident so the few people I know can move on and stop thinking about me.

I fucking have no energy left, no joy, no passion, I fucking have no friends and just simply no fucking person in my life.

I went from that hard working kid who was always told he wasn't good enough to excelling and doing very well until major depression ruined my life. Ever since depression hit me I've lost all the confidence in the world. I became distant, I became ugly, I became worthless and I have just changed a lot.

Everything is so meaningless to me now I really don't care anymore. I thought about my future and all I ever wanted was a family of my own, a good wife, a nice little house and a little car to take them on trips, but now just forget about that I am a fucking worthless piece of shit.


What is even the reason to keep going... :'(.
