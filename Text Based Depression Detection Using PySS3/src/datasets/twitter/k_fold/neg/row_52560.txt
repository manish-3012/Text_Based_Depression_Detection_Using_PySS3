The ungrateful have everything and moreWhy is it that theres so many ungrateful people with families who love them, and all my life I've just been aiming to create a family who will love me back.

There's girls with amazing hard working boyfriends and I can't even get someone to commit to me after two years

Everyone lies to me. Everyone doesn't think I'm enough for them.

I don't get why I'm here. People just use and hurt me. I don't want to feel this pain anymore.

Everyone scares me. I have no trust in anyone no matter what. And my intuition is always right.

I want to die so badly. And I have been wanting to for so long. I just want the courage to do it for once. I need to get it over with so this pain will go away. People have hurt me for too long and all I want is just for one person to love me. And no matter how hard I try, I can't even get that.

It comes so simply to others but for some reason im unlovable. Why? I'm a good person. I go so far out of my way just to make sure I don't give someone the false intention that I don't care about their feelings. Yet people continue to use and lie to me. And take advantage of me and use me up until they've had their fun.

I just want to die.
I have nothing to live for.
Probably going to cut myself as soon as I can find my scissors. That's the only thing that calms me down. My life is pathetic. I'm pathetic. I'm a loser. A failure. An idiot. I'm ugly, stupid, worthless. He was right. There's no use for me being on this earth. I pray I'll be able to get it over with soon. I'm tired of life. I'm tired of pain. I just want someone to hug me and help me. That's all. Why can't I have that. That's all I ask for.
