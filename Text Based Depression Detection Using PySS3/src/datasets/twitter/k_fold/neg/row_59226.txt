So Sick Of My Life.I know I don't have a bad life but I am sick of it.  I feel like I am going nowhere and doing nothing.  I refuse to get help though partly because I find it really embarrassing.

I literally googled I want to kill myself.

My mom is going to a play tonight and I plan on cutting for the first time in my life.

I am seriously a pathetic loser.
