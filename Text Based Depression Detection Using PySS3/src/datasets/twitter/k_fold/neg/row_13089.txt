Please, someone talk me down. I've been having fantasies and I'm having a dark moment.For the past few weeks I got through the same motions of waking up, panicking over the day, crying, and just laying in bed, calming myself by thinking about how nice it'd be to just not have to worry about anything anymore. Imagining how people wouldn't be surprised, wouldn't care.

I had been missing my (not so great) ex recently, disregarding the bad and remembering the good. Of COURSE I message him out of weakness, and the first thing he brings up is a bad memory, a reminder of how he hurt me. I've been fucking destroyed by him, and he goes on living. And he casually brings up shit that tears my heart out again. And I just want to fucking die.

Help me. Please.
