Second post here..And I have no idea what to do anymore. 

I tried getting help. But it's not helping... I have no friends who actually give a shit about anything related to me... My ex is tearing down my life like you'd have no idea, but we have a daughter together so I can't just flush her out of existence..

I care too much about people who don't actually give a shit about me or just enjoy fucking around.

I don't even know what to do anymore... I don't have the willpower to help myself, I don't even want to get better. I just need to disappear. But I don't know how... I tried about a month and a half ago... But I failed miserably, this time. I don't want to miss.. But I can't figure out how...
