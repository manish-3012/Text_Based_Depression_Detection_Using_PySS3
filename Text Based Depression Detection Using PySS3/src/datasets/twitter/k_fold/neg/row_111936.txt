Whatâ€™s the point anymoreI want to kill myself but I canâ€™t. There are two reason why I canâ€™t: 1. Because I donâ€™t want my little brother to be the kid whose sister killed herself and, 2. Because Iâ€™m afraid I wont be successful and end up in a psych ward. I want to off myself so badly. Like, whatâ€™s the point to everything? I donâ€™t believe in after life so everything that is happening is pointless... Tonight might be the night I finally decide to die. Or not. Probably not since my brother is in the next room. Whatever.
