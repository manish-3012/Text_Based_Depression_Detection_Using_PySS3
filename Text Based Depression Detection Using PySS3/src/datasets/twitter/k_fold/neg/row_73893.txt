I've already done everything I could doIf my life is going to be non stop worry and anxiety and wondering when the house will be lost, what's the point? I did everything I was suppose to to try and help out. Went to school, got whatever job I could land, and it's still not even close to making ends meet. I even got to the point where I've sold my body just so the mortgage gets paid. I don't know how much longer I'm supposed to endure this. 

I come from a drug use and self harm background and I cut that out to try and support my family but what for? It's not enough. At least if I could back to doing those, I'd at least feel some joy and relief even if it's temporary. 

Anything is better than living like this and still not being enough.
