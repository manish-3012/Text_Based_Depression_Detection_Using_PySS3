I don't knowI keep praying for the strength to end it but so far I haven't got it. I think about all the ways I could stop living and it's the only thing that keeps me smiling. The only happiness I get I thinking about how I'm going to die. I thought SSRI's would help, they didn't. Then the doctors thought I may have a heart condition that could be fatal and finding out I don't have it was the most disappointing day of my life.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I think I might find the strength tonight.
