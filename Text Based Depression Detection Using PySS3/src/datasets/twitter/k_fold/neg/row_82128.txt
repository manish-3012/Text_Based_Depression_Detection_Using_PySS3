I'm just a lost case. I'll start preparing.Why does everything have to be so depressing or stressful.
Note I don't want to explain everything so read my previous posts.
Every day it gets even worse.
Online school is killing me.
I have no hope and no way out of this.
My parents don't care enough to help me.
I don't have any friends.
Probably because of my social anxiety.
I think teachers are not helpful in the slightest.
I'm just done.
I don't have any future it won't get better.
I'm starting to fail my grade miserably.
I just want to end it all.
My dreams won't come true even the smallest ones.
I'll just try to focus on how can I easily kill myself.
Just I've had enough of this god forsaken world.
I hope I die soon.
