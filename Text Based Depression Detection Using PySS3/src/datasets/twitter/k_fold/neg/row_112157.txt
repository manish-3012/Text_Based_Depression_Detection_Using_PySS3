WellI've been in a major depressive fit for well over a week now. I can't really deal with this anymore. It's like long periods of being suicidally depressed and short, happy bits of my life where everything seems okay and I don't think about how easy it would be to drive my car off a cliff.

I've officially decided to myself that I'm probably never going to pass as female, which frankly is all I really want, and I've also decided that the other thing that would genuinely keep my life from falling to pieces, that being a person who will hold me close and tell me everything is okay, is never going to happen.

And so I'm kind of stuck at this point where I lack motivation to even eat, and am literally spending days without food. Fortunately, through reddit, I have support, but I fear this will not be enough to save me from the ever-growing problem that is myself, and the constant one that is my family.

I live a pointless existence and I will never get the two things I want out of it. So what, really, is left for me to do?
