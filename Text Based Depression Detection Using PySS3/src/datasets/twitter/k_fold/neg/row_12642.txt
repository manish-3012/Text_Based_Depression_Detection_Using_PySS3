Tomorrow's the dayThat title probably sounds really bad but it's not meant to be. Tomorrow is the day I'm getting therapy for the first time and I'm a nervous/anxious wreck about it. I don't know whether to disclose my suicidal thoughts or how it will go or what they'll ask or anything. I'm going nuts.

Any stories of how therapy went for you or how it helped? Like maybe what they asked about or talked about? I'm really nervous about what to expect.
