I did not kill myself tonight - I don't want to die.. sometimes I crave a pause buttonEverything was overwhelming me.. it was coming at me from all sources.. some form of stress.. even the people I usually went to .. they were contributing, without knowing.. all they want to do is help.  

A six hour panic attack.. which is worse than anxiety.. because it is so random.  I know if I can say "I can't breathe", I am not dying.. so I was just mad that my chest felt so tight.. it felt as if I was not breathing.. it was just my damn brain fucking with me.. 

I spoke to someone on here who used to live in my town.. I have been up for almost 24 hours.. today is going to be me smiling.. and not burdening anyone with my crap.
