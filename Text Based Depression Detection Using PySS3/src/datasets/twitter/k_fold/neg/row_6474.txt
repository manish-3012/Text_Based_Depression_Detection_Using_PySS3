Nothing ever really gets betterI'm sorry that I'm boring everyone. 

I'll always be depressed. I will always be jealous of people with better lives than me. No one will ever really like me. No one will ever really understand me. I don't understand why I even try anymore. 

I'll always be alone. People that aren't will never understand what it's like. 

I'll always be ignored. And what is the point if existence if you don't make a difference? Or is it existance? 

I hate always coming here to see 0 replies to my posts. No one here can relate to me. My life is worthless.
