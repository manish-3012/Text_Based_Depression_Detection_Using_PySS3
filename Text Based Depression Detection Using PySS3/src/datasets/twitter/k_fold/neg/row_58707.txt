ready 2 goI can't believe what i've done. I ruined everyone in my life. I've ruined my own life and theirs along with me. The one person I had left is gone. He is the love of my life and yet again I've hurt him past the point of return. I'm all alone now. He says he doesn't care if I kill myself and I hope its true. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore.
