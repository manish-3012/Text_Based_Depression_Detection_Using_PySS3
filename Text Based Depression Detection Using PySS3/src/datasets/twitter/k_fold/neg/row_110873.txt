A detailed plan makes this so much easierHaving a detailed plan, a date of execution and a gun to do it either makes this a lot easier to cope with. After removing everyone from my life, all Iâ€™ve got to think about and ponder on is the anticipation of this actually happening. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m excited about causing my own death this month. Day to day management is a lot easier to deal with, but itâ€™s taking everything in me not to verge from the plan and take myself out earlier than I planned on.
