Is it normal to think about death all the time?I think about death all the time. I think about how, after my mom passes, Iâ€™ll die. I think about sending my boyfriend and the dog away to visit his family, and then finding new homes for my cats, and then just ending it. I know there are people other than my mom who love me, who would be sad if I died, but theyâ€™d move on eventually. They have other friends and family. They donâ€™t -need- me.

I tried to tell a friend recently how Iâ€™ve been feeling, and she told me that she needed me, her best friend, to live for her. Which is a lie. She has a loving fiancÃ© and tons of other friends. She would be sad, but ultimately my death would mean nothing, even to her, after some time. She doesnâ€™t need me.

My boyfriend, he might need me, but I donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m good for him. Not when I spend nearly every waking moment wishing for my own death. How can I support him when I canâ€™t even support myself? He moved very far  away from home to be with me, but he is probably better off back home with his family, in an environment where he is actually comfortable. He might need me, but that doesnâ€™t mean Iâ€™m good for him.

I donâ€™t want anyone to need me either. I want it to be okay to die after my mom passes. I donâ€™t want to spend another 30+ years struggling on this earth. I never even imagined Iâ€™d make it into my 30s. To make into my 60s? Impossible. Whatâ€™s the point?

Life just feels so meaningless. Even when I try to find meaning, I always hit roadblock after roadblock. Depression and anxiety always hold me back. Iâ€™m so tired of trying, of fighting, of being. I feel like Iâ€™m just waddling through life, surviving via distraction, waiting for death.
