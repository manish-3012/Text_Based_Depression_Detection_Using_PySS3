I lost the love of my lifeMy husband of 3 years (been together for 8). Just texted me and told me he finished the paperwork to divorce me. I don't know what to do. I love him more than anything in this whole world. I have spent the last two years trying so hard to give our relationship another chance to give me another chance. I don't know what to do anymore. I moved to America from Europe to be with him. I left my whole life there, family and friends to be with him. Many times I feel like I don't have anything more in life, I'm not afraid of dying, I look forward to it just because then I don't have to feel this pain anymore.  I don't know why I still love him so much, but I do. I just feel like when I lost him, I lost so much else too. I lost all my dreams in life. Many times I feel like I don't want to be where I am, but at the same time there is no other place in the world that I want to be. It's really sad, I'm 26, most of my twenties have been such a disappointment.
