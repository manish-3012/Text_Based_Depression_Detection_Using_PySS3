Honestly, it seems like a decent option at this point.I am absolutely unhappy, and have been for most of my life. I honestly can't remember a time I have been legitimately happy. I have a small group of friends, but the sparse time I do get to spend with them is far too short and far too in between. 

I have made nothing but the wrong choices in my life. I failed out of college at 18, I broke up with someone who motivated me every day. I was lazy and listless and had no reason to be better. I've been nigh homeless my entire life. 

Just recently there was a light at the end of the tunnel. I got a job, found a girl who really liked me, fell in love. Got an apartment together, made plans for marriage. Then, she started seeing another man while I worked night shift at my job. One thing led to another, and now they live in that apartment. I had to move to HER mothers house for 200 dollars a month. I am humiliated, ashamed, and I feel worthless. My job sucks, I'm reminded of her every day, and I have nowhere to go or turn. At this point....just ending it seems so much better.

I want to be motivated. I want to go to school and get out of this. I just don't see it being possible. I can't find the motivation to stop being useless anywhere. I don't know what to do anymore.
