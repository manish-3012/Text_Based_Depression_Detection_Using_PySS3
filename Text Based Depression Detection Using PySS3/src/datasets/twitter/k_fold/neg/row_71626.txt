Itâ€™s been my whole life, the pain is who I am and it wonâ€™t ever go away.Iâ€™ve wasted my whole life so far to the constant pain I feel. Even as a child I was ill.
I canâ€™t deal with the constant general and social anxiety I feel anymore or the existential panic and depression and trauma that lives inside me. Itâ€™s held me back from everything I have ever wanted to do. Iâ€™m constantly at war with my mental illnesses which Iâ€™ve discovered are who I am. I was never anything else.

Over the years came more difficulties and with the difficulties my mental state has worsened to an obvious degree. No one acknowledges it. I was off work for almost a year because I tried to kill myself and no one even asks if Iâ€™m ok. 

My parents express their disappointment in me for being gay, being weird, dropping out of uni and not working full time and as a result turn my family against  me, they refuse to acknowledge the physical and emotional abuse they put me through as a child and as a young LGBT person; my partner has lost interest in me and calls me a burden and says she canâ€™t take any more of me and is now openly sleeping with someone else; all my friends have dropped contact with me since lockdown etc. I lost my grandad a couple of months ago and I still canâ€™t process it. And the state of the world and how it only seems to be getting worse and worse is making me sure that I will have to take matters into my own hands when it comes to my life. 

Even if things were to get better, Iâ€™d be trapped in an unforgiving world with people who would rather show performative cruelty than genuine kindness, in a world where you have to sell your body and mind 5 days out of 7 to a faceless monolith just to be able to live a basic life. In a world where, when you finally find the positives, they leave or die or disappear, making it all worse. 

Everyone says life is hard, life is cruel, etc. but I always, despite all my issues, stupidly had hope that it didnâ€™t have to be. This past while Iâ€™ve lost the hope I had for 23 years. The light has gone out and now itâ€™s time for the rest of me to follow.
