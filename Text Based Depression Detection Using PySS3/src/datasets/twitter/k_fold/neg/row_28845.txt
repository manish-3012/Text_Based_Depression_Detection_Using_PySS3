I wish. . .I wish that when I wake up my family will love me. 
I wish that they would offer me help and support  so that I have a better chance rather than struggling every day to be just "Okay". 

I wonder what it feels like to have people who care about you. 
I wonder what it would feel like to have a partner who lifts you up, who tries to understand, who loves, who cares, who appreciates you. 

No one is going to make the effort to help me. 
No one thinks twice about me.

I don't cry anymore. 
I wish I could. 
I'm tired of trying alone. 

Do you know how hard it is to take the first step? 
I keep messing up at every turn, and nothing is going well for me.
