I want to die so fucking bad I don't want to live anymore. I can't stand the thought of pushing through my horrible, mundane, teenaged life just to end up in a dead-end job, which is what's going to happen because I'm a worthless loser and I don't have the motivation to catch up on any of my classes after I've been absent for 6 weeks getting treatment for my anorexia. I have to gain 4 kilos and I can't stand the though, and everyone is telling me what to do, what medications I can take and so on. I use codeine recreationally all the time and now everyone's telling me I can't even have 60mg. What kind of bullshit is that?
 And everyone at school thinks I'm a scumbag because I told a girl I would cut myself if she did something I didn't want her to, and she thought I was threatening her and told everyone I'd held a razor blade to her throat.
 I've been obsessed with a girl who hates me for the past year and every time I think I'm getting over her I end up being absolutely in love with her all over again. I went weeks without thinking about her, then saw her name somewhere, and was completely taken by her yet again. I just can't stand the thought of living my life to become a homeless addict, which is probably how I'll end up
