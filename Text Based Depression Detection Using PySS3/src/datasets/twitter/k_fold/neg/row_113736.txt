Help, I guess?I don't want to get into long-winded details, but I kind of want to kill myself. 
But also, at the same time, I don't. You know?
I don't know. I guess I'm just teetering on the edge and I'm really sick of it. Life's been fucking rancid lately and I'm losing my patience. Things aren't getting better, they just keep getting worse and worse and worse. 
I know it's partially my fault because I try not to say anything to anyone and that's like unhealthy or something, but I'm hitting my breaking point and I'm kind of terrified. 
I guess I'm posting here because I want a sign? I want a reason not to aside from the typical "you are loved and this will pass" like yeah yeah, I get it, shut up. I'm sorry, this is probably kind of dumb. But whatever. 
I'm just on the verge and I really want to but I really don't. Help?
