Please please let me finally sleepI'm so so so so done. Successful by many metrics but am abhorred by praise and disgusts by myself. I am a year away from my PhD but I am worthless and don't deserve to live. I have my razors and knives here and I'm ready. I hurt so deeply. Please just make the pain stop... I can't ever sleep so my final option is here. Finally excited for something for the first time in years. Just needed to share.thankful for this sub xoxoo
