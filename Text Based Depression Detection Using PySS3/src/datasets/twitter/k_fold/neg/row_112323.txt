Is it ok to ring Samaritans this time of year?I really want to speak to someone in person. Iâ€™ve had people from here reach out which I greatly appreciate but I hope itâ€™s not ungrateful to say itâ€™s not the same as actually talking to someone. I want to be able to say what I need to say and hear what they have to say back if anything, which seems unlikely.

But Iâ€™m worried about ringing this time of year, it seems really inconsiderate. I had a really bad time on Christmas, I was down by the river bawling for hours and seriously debated jumping in, and I wanted to talk to someone then but I was able to stop myself because like, taking up someoneâ€™s Christmas is definitely too far. But itâ€™s not technically a holiday today, but it is between two, so Iâ€™m not sure if calling for help would still be taking up time someone could be using in better ways.

Also this is my third post on here in like a week, Iâ€™m sorry. ðŸ˜…
