I feel like iâ€™m not supposed to be here anymoreSo, I made a throwaway account because I donâ€™t want anybody to know that Iâ€™m feeling like this. 

Every day I look around and watch life happening around me. I constantly wonder why I donâ€™t feel excited, scared, motivated, and especially happy. I feel like Iâ€™m just floating through each day trying to find some reason to hang on, and Iâ€™m all out of reasons. Iâ€™m such a fucking loser. I work minimal hours in a restaurant because I canâ€™t find the effort to find a better job, I donâ€™t care about myself anymore. I smoke weed way too much because it numbs some of the pain for a little while. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because Iâ€™ve got a sister whoâ€™s in middle school. I donâ€™t want to make her sad or fuck up her 8th grade year. Sheâ€™s a great girl and she deserves to have a sibling that can function and live a normal life. I canâ€™t give that to her. But hereâ€™s the thing; I feel like her, my family, my friends, would be so much better off without me. I feel like such a waste of resources, time, money, and life. Iâ€™m not good at anything. I donâ€™t want a career. I donâ€™t want to eat the foods O used to love. I donâ€™t want to go anywhere. I donâ€™t want to get out of bed. I donâ€™t want to fall in love. I donâ€™t want to do anything except finally be done. Being dead sounds like a breath of fresh air, right now I feel like Iâ€™m drowning. I donâ€™t even want to help myself anymore, I donâ€™t think that Iâ€™m worth it. Iâ€™ve never wanted anything more in my life than to just kill myself and I feel that it is my fate, no matter how hard i work. Iâ€™m going to die soon and Iâ€™m finally okay with it. I feel very detached from the world and I feel like I have never and will never belong anywhere. I was a mistake and I am so sorry to everybody who has had to interact with my disgusting, worthless piece of shit self. I just canâ€™t do it anymore, every day hurts and every day I despise myself more and more. I canâ€™t anymore. I donâ€™t see any other option at this point. I really need to do this.
