If there is a moment in your life you could go back to, which one will it be?In life, we change over the course of time and the environment around us. Sometimes, they're horrible, but in times they're good, But if only we could go back and experience a certain feeling and experience...which one will it be?

For me, i think i would go back to my childhood during the age 3 to 5 when I am more satiated living in a foreign country rather than where i was born. A different culture, a wonderful family and a fulfilling life of a child.

Now, I cant even do anything without a surge of suicidal thoughts or the urge to cut myself even if I attempted not to. Sadly one or two months, I gave in. Every work is a burden, every thought is a constant reminder, every moment in life is harder to appreciate and I'm worried that it could mean that I am selfish nowadays.

Only time will tell if I recover or not, same goes to all of you in this subreddit.
