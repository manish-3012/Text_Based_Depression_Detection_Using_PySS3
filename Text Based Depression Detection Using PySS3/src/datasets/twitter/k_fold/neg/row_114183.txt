Please help me.Like the title says, please help me. My boyfriend has made me feel like it was my fault. He would rather sleep in his car than be near me. I have said I apologize.  I have said sorry. I have called the hotline and they said it was for emergencies only. I don't want to be an emergency.  I have no family. Please someone talk to me. I'm alone. Please help me.
