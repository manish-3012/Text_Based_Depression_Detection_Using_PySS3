Self harmed for the first time in 7+ years.I like to think I can put up with alot. My mother and best friend dying, Living with an emotionally and verbally abusive psychotic and semi demenia'd drunk. (Cliche speak and all, treats me like shit then says they cant live without me.)
Taking care of an entire family of grown ass adults while doing everything I'm told. Confined to poverty and scrimping to get by while I'm berated constantly being told everything I do is wrong, I'm never doing enough. Always my fault.

I haven't cut since I think high school, I forgot, my memories honestly getting worse. Except today.

Today was the last straw. I get everyone's tensions are high and stressed but today I was blamed for our entire financial situation...because I'm chronically Ill and on disability. That I wouldn't take a job that would most likely make me lose my health insurance that I NEED for medication to literally live.
Nevermind that the accuser wastes every cent at the bar and on scratch tickets I seen the bank statements to prove it.
I forfiet every. dime. I. have. except for maybe 20 dollars a month. 

I put 900 dollars towards all the bills, almost every cent I have, I cook for everyone, clean for them, take care of their appointments, make sure they are taking their medications, being fed, laundry is done. Dog is taken care of.
Basically am the new mother of the family.

I was at my limit. Burns like hell, here's to hoping I don't scar any more than I already am.
