I thought I was getting better?Hi Suicide Watch. I'd just like to make the disclaimer that at this exact moment I am not suicidal. I have been before, fortunately (I think) I made it through, and I am trying to prevent myself from getting back to that point. Throwaway because I don't want to be reminded of this if/when I make it through. 

I have been living with depression for the past 2-3 years and just this past summer I got the help I needed from the proper professionals. I was getting better with the help of meds and changes in lifestyle. Unfortunately that was a short lived and  in March of this year I attempted to end my life. I made it through and about the time I did, I met my most recent significant other. from the beginning she helped me. She knew that I had issues and problems and helped me all that she could. She was exactly what I needed at the exact time I needed it. She may very well have saved my life. On Monday out of the blue she ended things with me and I can feel myself slipping back to the state that I was in before meeting her. It's since come to light that she left me for a man 10 years younger than her.  I feel like I've failed her and myself. I can't blame her. She said that my mental health as well as the long distance relationship we were in was too hard. I know that in this case I was far too dependant on someone else for my happiness but at the time, I felt like that was my only option. I'm lost and scared and I don't want to ever go back to that because I know next time I might not be as lucky. 

I'm not interested in making amends with her or getting back together with her. If she thinks so little of me to just throw everything away like that, I know the breakup is a good thing. I just want to not feel like I felt before. 

Thank you.
