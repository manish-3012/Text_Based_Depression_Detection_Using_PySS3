When do you cross the line from fantasizing to actually formulating?I've had major depressive disorder (and a host of anxiety problems) for going on 6 years now, but it's been worse these past 2 years. I think about killing myself at least once a day (more-so on days I have to go to my shitty barely above minimum wage job). 

I've looked at price of tanks of a certain inert gas(not like the price matters if I'm going to be dead anyway) but I still can't be bothered to clean my room and wipe my history and make the plans. 

I don't think I really want to die, I want to be happy instead, it's just that dying is a much easier way out.
