I should be happy. Why can I not be happy?I don't know why I am laying in bed but can 't sleep. I am trying to go to bed when i am dead tired but when I have to wake up early I can't . When i lay in Bed i think about all the mistakes i made trough my life. I am actually worthless. I don't know how i got this. If i had any balls i would be long gone, but here i am crying to strangers. My life is not bad in any means. Probably a life a lot of people would be jelous of. But I just can't seem to be happy. Why is it so hard to be happy.
