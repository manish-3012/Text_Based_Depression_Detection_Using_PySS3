My life is shit. I'm so exhausted. Please share stories of making it through depression.Every aspect of my life is a disaster. Everything has fallen apart. My job is shit, I'm in an emotionally abusive relationship, I'm overweight, lack ambition, have no prospect of postgraduate education, no career goals, and have no energy to fight for myself in any of these realms. My "boyfriend" has withdrawn from me completely, barely sees me or contacts me, and will only talk to me if he's drunk so my self-esteem is obliterated yet I stay because I still want him, miss him and am miserably lonely. 

Please, please, please show me there's a way out. If you're on your way up, if you've made any progress, please share a bit of your story. Any advice or motivation helps.
