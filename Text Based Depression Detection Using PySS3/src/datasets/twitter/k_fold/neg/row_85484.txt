I'm just not sure anymoreFirst and foremost: I'm from Brazil, so don't judge me. 
Second of all: I never went to a doctor to see if I really have some form of depression (I think I do, but... Whatever) so I'm not sure but... I just don't care anymore, you know? I have this thing that somedays, the only thing that makes me avoid suicide is fear for whats coming next (Thank you anxiety, very cool) and that scares me. Recently I started some "studies" (I just started reading random shit) on Nihilism and I definily agree with the argument that life has no meaning. I feel like that since I was 10. I'm 17 now and sometimes is so fucking hard just to cope with people around me. I have to constantly hide what I really feel, sometimes using the "dark thoughs" in my mind to make jokes, since people just don't believe me. I think that they will believe when I die.
It's 3 AM here and I can't sleep.
This will be the worst year in my life and I honestly don't know if I'll make it.
P.S: Don't talk about my family, I hate them and they do not care. I'm just the guy they are taking care of, so they can put all of the unfinished dreams they have on me and use me as a trophy. I hate both of my parentes almost as I hate myself.
