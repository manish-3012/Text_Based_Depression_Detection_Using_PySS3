I was almost at the edge again.I don't even have much to say, just that I was almost crying my eyes out again and thinking about ending everything. This sucks so much. I don't even know the solution anymore. 

I want to end everything, I want to die, but I am young and I also fear death. What's my problem? Death would take all my pain away!

 I wouldn't have to care about being this trash that I am. I wouldn't care about being disliked and not having a SO. I wouldn't be hurt again! Fuck me.
