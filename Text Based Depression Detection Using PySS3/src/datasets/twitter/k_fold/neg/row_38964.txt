Thank you.Iâ€™m 21, and I feel suicidal since when Iâ€™m 14 years old. In the last period everything became more difficult in my head. Nothing serious has happened in my life and Iâ€™m really happy about it. Sometimes reading what you write here.. Iâ€™m ashamed to be depressed for no good reason. But.. Iâ€™m here. And I wanted to tell all of you that I come here every day, and I read what you write and itâ€™s beautiful to see that we help each other. Itâ€™s nice to see how some of us write things that they actually know are for themselves. That touches me more than I can say.

I just wanted to say Thank You. Knowing that there are people like me doesnâ€™t make me feel alone. I donâ€™t know who you are, I donâ€™t know what you did but I love you. 
Suicide is never the right decision, even when there seems to be no alternative. 

Sorry if I wrote something wrong, but itâ€™s not my main language.

With love
A friend
