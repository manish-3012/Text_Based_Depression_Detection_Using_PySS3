i have no idea what the fuck im doing anymoreive been trying to get help for my mental health because I can't work like this. my manager said if I come back before im better it'll be seen as behavioural and I'll lose my job. I was made to take time off because I freaked the fuck out thinking he was listening into everything I was thinking and saying 

I had a homelessness scare at the beginning of march and have been w my new flatmates a few weeks since then

Because I've moved im now out with the constituency for the doctor I'm registered at. the new doctors will take a few weeks to sort admin (I called up earlier) before they have all my records and I feel like my brain is dissolving into mush I need help but I don't know what to do I'm afraid of outdoors I'm afraid of myself and I just don't fucking know anymore
