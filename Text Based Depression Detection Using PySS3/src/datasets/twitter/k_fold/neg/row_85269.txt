I got drunk alone last night and tried to kill myselflast night i drank so much and ended up leaving college residence, getting on the train, and getting lost in some random neighborhood. i broke down crying and i was laying in a snowbank for 3 hours and almost froze to death. the cops found me somehow and i luckily was only ticketed for intoxication

it could have gone way worse and i'm actually lucky to be here right now. i dont know why i did that and it scares me to think that i even have the potential to do this kind of thing. i have never tried anything like this before.

im never drinking again and i have never been so ashamed and embarrassed. i have been dreading over last night ever since i got up this morning and i feel like shit. i feel scared and numb and i dont know what to do.

thanks for listening guys
