â€œYou are not Alone...â€Thatâ€™s what all the mental health stickers, social media posts, and posters say about suicidal thoughts and yet everyday I walk into my apartment alone. i struggle to clean, shower, and eat. And I do it alone. 

I went to my doctorâ€™s appointments and mental health hospitals alone too.

I am in a much better place but i did it all by myself. Ngl, comments and messages here on reddit have made me less alone than everything else in my life.

I guess what Iâ€™m trying to say is that life isnâ€™t a
movie. No secret best friend will come and help you. If you are drowning in your own depressive mess, no one is really going to reach out to make sure youâ€™re ok and can stay ok. Heck, even your doctor and therapist donâ€™t really care. No one will even give you a hug.

Iâ€™m not suicidal anymore but Iâ€™m posting this to say that I did it all by myself. I was alone and I am still alone but s*it even I barely give a crap. Iâ€™m the one who exhausted every resource trying to get better. No one stayed with me to make sure I didnâ€™t cut my wrists. I had to use duck tapes and arm bands. No one helped me with my panic attacks...i just had to hold ice in my shower. And I even learned to meditate b/c talking to myself was the only way to get through it.

I will probably relapse and I will probably feel suicidal again. If not today, it will be next week, next month, next year. Either way, this is a solitary experience and the â€œyou are not alone...â€ line...its just a lie. But still, you can survive &lt;3
