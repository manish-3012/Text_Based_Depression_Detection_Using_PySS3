Why can't I just die?Seems like I fuck everything up, I can't even die right. I have nothing to look forward to in life, no one who cares about me, no one who loves me, or will ever love me. Pretty much my whole family hates me just because of who I am, and my parents want to treat me like shit just because they can. I talk to friends about how I feel, constantly, and I end up pushing them away with how annoying I am, and the friends who haven't been pushed away will never see me the same way again. I just want release, and I can't even get that. I hope it works this time, and I can finally rest. Third time's the charm, right?
