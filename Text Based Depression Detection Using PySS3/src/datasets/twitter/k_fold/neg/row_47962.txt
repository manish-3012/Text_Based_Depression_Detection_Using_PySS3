i dont plan on waking up in the morningi just cant go on anymore, i just relapsed (cutting) again. im fucking useless. i find ways to fuck up everything in my life. i wish i could be normal. i wish i could be loved and accepted as me and who i am. why am i so hated. i have taken easily over 3 times the safe dosage of morphine/sleepingpills and drunk a hit flask of whiskey. im goingto sleep.

ifi wake up great. if i dont even better.

i needed to let someone know. so luck reddit gets the privilege,
