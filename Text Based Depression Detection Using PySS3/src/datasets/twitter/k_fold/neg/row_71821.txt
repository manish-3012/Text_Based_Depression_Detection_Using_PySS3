Been on my mind all dayNothing is different about today. It's a normal Saturday. I got high to escape these feelings. They are so intrusive. I just punched the shit out of my door. It didnt help and now my hands hurt and are cut. I was thinking about writing a note earlier. Then I decided I wouldn't. I was gonna go to the movies with some friends. They canceled on me, and will probably do something without me tonight. I dont blame them. I'm a burden. Maybe I will write the note. Maybe I won't. I just want my mind to stop. Its torturing me :(. I have the means to kill myself. I just cant make up my mind. I'm sorry for being so weak.
