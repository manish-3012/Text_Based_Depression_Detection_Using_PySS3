I'm thinking about it more and moreI've been depressed for the past year almost, but I've never seriously thought about hurting myself. This month, I've been having these thought more often tho and I'm thinking that it's my brain trying to say that it doesn't see any other way to solve my depression. I'm just afraid I might do something, even though I kinda want to end my suffering.
