Worst day
Woke up this morning and learned my grandma had a stroke shes still unconscious...... followed by another surprise uni didnt accept me... and now 1 hour ago I lost my full time job haha. 
Wtf is going on with me i dont even know why im on reddit...guess i want someone to tell me im not a worthless shit but does it even matter at this point ? This is the lowest point of my life, how do I go forward.... I feel like i cant. No job, no school, my parents think im doing great but I know the truth im worthless, depressed and suicidal thoughts keeps poppin inside my head
