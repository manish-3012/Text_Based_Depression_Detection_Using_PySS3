I feel like a terrible human being and now I'm scaredI'm gay and I've been with my boyfriend for 7 years now. I love him to death and I can't imagine my life without him. I was planning on proposing to him this year. Because I couldn't control my urges,  I slipped up and had one sexual encounter with someone else. I was the top,he said he didn't have any STDs, the condom broke during the last two minutes of sex. I asked him multiple times if he had anything, got annoyed with me bc he visits his doctor every month for diabetes, and blocked me. 

4 weeks later, for 2 day, I started feeling really nauseous, weak, aches, and tired (also upped my dosage of Lexapro that day). 

6 weeks later today, my arms are feeling sore when I workout and I think I have shin splints. 

I'm going to get tested and I know that's the only way I'll find out but I somehow convinced myself that I have HIV. 

I know HIV isn't what it used to be but that's not why I'm scared. I'm scared to have to tell my boyfriend that I have HIV (if I have it). I know I have to tell him so he can get tested. I'm scared that if I tell him, he's going to leave me. I'm scared that my life will be flipped upside down. I'm scared that I'll do something like commit suicide because I fucked up everything and that I'm a terrible human being.
