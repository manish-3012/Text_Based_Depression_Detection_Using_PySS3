How to survive making horrible mistakes that ruin my most beloved?I have done something truly vile. So deep into my depression over the years that I have made so many horrible mistakes. It's like a fog was over my thoughts, and now it has finally lifted. I have seen my horrible selfish choices and I have planned my suicide. It's a good plan. I am a truly horrible person, maybe even so toxic that I become a menace to the well being of everyone around me. I am not sure why I write this. Nothing will change what I have done, and the pain makes me a coward, choosing death over survival. I can't say it's been a good run at all. It's been painful, lonely, insane and traumatic. I hate that I am this fucked up. I hate myself.
