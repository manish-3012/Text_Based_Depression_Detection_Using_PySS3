รยก i feel like shit ! help meI'm an awful human being and I don't deserve to live. I get mad over my things, my life. I throw and hit things when I'm mad. I release my frustrations through that until I get what I want. I feel like a brat but i was never spoiled.

I don't want to be this kind of person. I have a lot of things on my mind that come every now and then for years that make me, i wouldn't say depressed since i have not been diagnosed, sad.

I just want to hit myself, kill myself, but i can't seem to do it. It's always me looking for ways and not actually going through with it.

My friends don't know these things about me. I don't want to be this kind of person. I want to change. I want help. But life sucks.

I can't afford therapy and I don't want my parents finding out even if i could.

Idk maybe i'm acting out again because the holidays are near? Don't get me wrong, I don't hate the holidays but the worst things have happened during. I just want to get it over with i guess.

Anyway, if you've made it this far reading this, thank you. Sometimes, i just want to be heard. Feel free to comment and drag me.
