R/suicidology banned!Suicidal ideations can often be coping mechanisms, one might not be intent to committing suicide but just the thought of knowing that the option is there mitigates the suffering of life. 
The reality is that people kill themselves everyday and have been doing so for hundreds of thousands of years, you canâ€™t stop it happening because itâ€™s a rational response to the bleak nature of life. 

I despise reddit for banning suicidology it was somewhere I could discuss my feelings and thoughts without stigma or people saying â€œ donâ€™t do itâ€  â€œlife gets betterâ€ type of rubbish. Free speech is a delusion, reddit has banned dozens of suicide-sympathetic subreddits. Fuck reddit
