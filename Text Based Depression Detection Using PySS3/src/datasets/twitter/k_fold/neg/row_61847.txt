Overdosing on lexaproHi all... Usually I guess when people feel like they're about to give up, some corner of their mind is scared maybe? 

I just feel monotonous towards everything. I feel like I can take all the 350 mg of lexapro I have in one go tonight without any fear or hesitation. Is this what being numb feels like? 

My boyfriend wanted to break up with me today. I don't blame him. Ignoring his calls all the time, I'm the one at fault. I hope he finds happiness. I don't feel anything about this either. I just thought, huh, okay, sure. 

I've been with him for 6 years now. 4 months ago, I had a random thought that if we ever break up, I would be absolutely devastated. Feeling the way I feel now is really surprising.
