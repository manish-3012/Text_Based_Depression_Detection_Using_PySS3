Please let me sleepI wish I could commit suicide. 

Perhaps it's just because I'm sleepy, or because I've just finished my seventh psych ward trip. 

I have the needed implements in my Amazon shopping cart, and am not sure what's stopping me from ordering. I am so tired of feeling numb. I am so tired of the psychiatrist-therapist routine. No matter how many times friends beg me to come to them, I still feel terrible annoying them with my pain.
