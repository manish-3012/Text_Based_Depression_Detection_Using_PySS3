I'm terrified of telling anyone that I think I want to dieI've had horrible past experiences of telling someone. The last time I truly told someone, the person ended up taking advantage of the situation for herself, and another person used my words to try to get revenge on me for something. It ended with my dad briefly kicking me out because he was so pissed off.

Second I think I just sound pitiful as hell, and it would just push someone away even further. It would sound like I'm just complaining or bitching about things. Plus I know it makes people extremely uncomfortable, another reason it would push them away. 

It's too hard and too scary to tell someone.
