Having gender dysphoria, genetic depression, and a shitty life.Iâ€™m trans I have horrible dysphoria which makes me want to rip out my fucking eyes so I canâ€™t see myself having this incorrect body.  This body is completely horrible and my brain constantly tells me thereâ€™s something wrong with me because Iâ€™m not a real girl. My entire family has horrible depression. Itâ€™s very genetic. Added on to all of that is the fact that Iâ€™m so alone every second of the day. I canâ€™t get in a relationship no matter how hard I try. Friends have completely drifted away and my parents are always talking about how much they hate having me around. I canâ€™t escape feeling horrible. I donâ€™t see a point in living anymore. Please help. I already have planned the suicide and I wrote the note. I need help so I donâ€™t end up dead. (Please none of that religious bullshit indoctrination doesnâ€™t work on me and it just bugs me if youâ€™re going to spread your cult instead of helping me)
