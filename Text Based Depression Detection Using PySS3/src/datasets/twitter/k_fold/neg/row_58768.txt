I donâ€™t want to kill myself, I want to kill my life.I hate this life. I work full time at some shitty retail guest service job as well as go to college full time. Itâ€™s an endless cycle of despair just for those moments of fun with friends. I just want a life where I could do more fun than work. If I kill myself I wouldnâ€™t have to go to work or school so what would be the difference if I just faked my death and spent my days enjoying life to the fullest. Iâ€™m just speaking hypothetically but my point is that I want to enjoy my life rather than do all that excruciating work till death for no reason. I just donâ€™t see that ever ending till retirement which at that point Iâ€™ll be unable to do anything fun again cuz Iâ€™ll be old. I hope some can relate.
