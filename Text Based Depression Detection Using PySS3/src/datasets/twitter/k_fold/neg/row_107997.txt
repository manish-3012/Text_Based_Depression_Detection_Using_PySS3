I wish for the end.I am unable to not think of suicide. I can't remember the last time I was happy or had any positive feelings at all. I'm hurt. I feel sad. I feel caged. My inner child is caged. It screams. It screams day and night. 

But when someone asks: I'm fine. Because I don't trust you. I only still alive because... I don't know, why I can't finish what someone else started. It was not my choice to be alive. Why do I have to stay? Why can't I leave? 

I have not motivation or energy left. I just want it to end. However, the self restraints I trained since I was just in kindergarden stand in my way. I am not allowed to. I am forbidden. I have never done what I wanted. 

I was always told that are bad career choices, this is not good enough. I can't even please you with success because all you want is more and more and more. 

I can't remember sincerely laughing. I can't remember sincerely smiling. I can't remember how it is to live.

I want it to end.

I wish for it to end.
