My brain is fucked upAfter years of abuse from others, loneliness, and rejection, my brain is only capable of processing one tought, that of suicide. I just got a job, and I hoped this toughts would be gone for some time, but no. I can't stop thinking about it. Everyday I practice with a rope, standing just moments before going unconscious. I somehow became good at it. I fear someday I will just say fuck it, and not stand. Maybe for the better
