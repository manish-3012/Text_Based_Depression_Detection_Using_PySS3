I don't have a reason to be alive anymore.* My boyfriend/best friend broke up with me 2 months ago and I can't let him go.
* I have hardly any friends.
* I have BPD which makes these issues way worse than they need to be.
* Today I got turned down from the programme I wanted to do because I applied too late (thanks depression for letting me put that one off).
* My parents are disappointed in me for that.
* I'm a financial burden on my family.
* I finished my degree in November but it took me two months to find a job (in hospitality, not in my field).
* I didn't even get the job I applied for because I wasn't good enough for it, but they gave me something else instead.

Everything is just mundane or worse and I'm going to die eventually so why not now?

Edit: I'm not going to do it tonight or anything. I don't really have the means to do it right now and I don't want to fail again. I've just always known this is how I'm going to die and it doesn't seem worth holding on.
