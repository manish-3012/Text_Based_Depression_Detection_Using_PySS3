last ditch efforti've been suicidal since i was about 12.. after making an attempt and living past it i thought at one point that i was grateful that i didn't die that day.. but after living through worse i wish it would have been successful so i could have avoided everything ive been through since then. the truth is i don't want to live anymore but not only that.. i just can't. i don't have it in me like i thought i did. last night the person that i'm in love with ended things and i just feel like that's a sign that i need to end things too. him giving up on me makes me want to give up on myself. i had a panic attack last night about the loss.. i felt like i was losing control of everything and it just made me realize i never had it.. not over anything.. but my life is the one thing i can control.. my friends and family are begging me to admit myself in the psych ward.. they're threatening to do it to me too.. but i don't see the point. it won't change anything. i'll go in there and feel even more alone. it's either keep living a miserable life using drugs to cope or granting myself an escape and one sounds a lot more human than the other.
