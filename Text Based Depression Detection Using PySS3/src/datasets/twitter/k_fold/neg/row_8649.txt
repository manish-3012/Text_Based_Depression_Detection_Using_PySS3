No one can help meI tried talking to my doctor and she won't prescribe me antidepressants because I'll overdose on them, my injection of antipsychotics doesn't work but she won't up the dose or switch it to something else. My counselor will only talk to me every two weeks and it's not helpful. My psychiatrist didn't diagnose me with anything just said I might have one of two things then discharged me. No one is helpful no one cares about me no one can help me.
