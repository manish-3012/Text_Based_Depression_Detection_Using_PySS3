I just got paid and I have $300 in my bank. Iâ€™m going to the gun shop tomorrow before work and asking for their cheapest gun if itâ€™s below $300 Iâ€™m buying it and doing it.I want out. Please take me. Iâ€™m sick of being treated as unworthy. Iâ€™m sick of this life. I canâ€™t do this anymore. I want out.
