i dont want to diei just dont want to live this life. i want to be happy. i want to forget all of the things ive been through just for a while. i want to stop hating myself. i want the intrusive thoughts to stop. what did i do to deserve being abandoned and abused like that. i just want to be loved. i want someone to tell me that he was wrong, that i didnt deserve it.

im so dead inside and everyone can see it. even strangers notice. they say "you look like youve seen some shit", but thats just my face now. im like a stray dog thats been kicked a lot. i can barely speak unless its to my girlfriend and even then the words dont come out right. i dont know what she sees in me. i cant hurt myself anymore or itll upset her and that makes me kind of bitter. i just want this pain to end.
