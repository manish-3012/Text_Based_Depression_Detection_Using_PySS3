the pain is so deepit cuts so deep.

iâ€™m so good at pretending iâ€™m ok, but as the weeks and years go by i get worse and worse.

iâ€™m a character to everyone. 

i give them everything they want to see, but iâ€™m always dragging around these chains and the links keep adding up.

i swing between euphoria and blade to my wrist, but the latter dominates.

no, i donâ€™t cut. i rip the skin off my lips until they drip blood. i donâ€™t normally realize iâ€™m doing it until my nails are already digging through and peeling the last layer back.

thatâ€™s the only way they might be able to tell. my dry, scabbed lips that i lather in vaseline in a meager attempt to repair the damage that iâ€™ve done.

iâ€™m a burden to my surroundings and the people in it.

my character is slowly fading away.

i get high earlier and earlier in the day just to spare myself a few hours of pain.

i want to get help but i feel like i donâ€™t know what to do anymore.

i donâ€™t want to ask the people i love because iâ€™ve exhausted their shoulders that iâ€™ve cried on. i donâ€™t want to lose them because iâ€™m sad.

i canâ€™t stop crying and my chest hurts.
