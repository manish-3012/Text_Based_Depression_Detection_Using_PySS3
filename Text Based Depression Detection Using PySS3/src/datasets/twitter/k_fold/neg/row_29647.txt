I have no outletI tried to kill myself by overdose and I cut myself so deep it needed staples but every time I call the crisis line after I do something they are so mean to me. They came and saw my cuts and said "oh so your a cutter?" And they tell me I don't look like a girl (19 trans) and I'm like okay thanks I just tried to kill myself but you know thanks or telling me that. So the next time I try to kill myself I won't call the line. The next one will be it. I don't know when it will be but I'm on the edge now
