i canâ€™t even cry anymorei canâ€™t cry anymore about coming this close to suicide, iâ€™ve been here so often that i canâ€™t do anything to help myself, my eyes just hurt, my parents hate me, in a failure and no one loves me, no one cares how i feel or how shot goes down for me, everyone thinks im happy, iâ€™m not, itâ€™s just all bullshit. and iâ€™m sorry if none of this makes sence, i canâ€™t concentrate.
