I deserve nothingI've fucked up my life so badly that I've ended up getting rid of the only people who love me, because they keep encouraging me to go out and make my life better when i just want to crawl into a ball and die. Now that i realise that they just want to help me but i don't know if i can ask them to support me again after all I've been through and ignored them becauseI've also taken up drinking vast amounts of alcohol with the one friend that I've always been able to turn to but i think he's getting sick of me wasting the little money that i do have as I'm 17 and have no job. My gf just broke up with me yesterday and its just made me want to end my life as she was the one ray of sunshine in my life and I've gone and fucked it up. I have an exam tomorrow and i don't think i have the strength to sit it.
