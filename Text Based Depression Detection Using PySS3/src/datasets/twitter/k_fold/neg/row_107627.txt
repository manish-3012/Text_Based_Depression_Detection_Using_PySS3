Im just a lazyfucker who doesnt care. 1.
Sorry for the long rant, just need  to get it out.So yeah... Im a 16 y/o boy, i come from sweden. Wont give up more details but. 

Basically it all started when my mom and dad broke up, It wasnt violent i had a great time getting raised, lots of friends, loving parents just about everything a kid could wish for. Decent amount of money, but when i was in first grade we moved. And i was beta as fuck, just about to get my first girlfriend in 1st grade and she made the moves ( pretty much the only one i have ever known ). We had to move and so we did to a little more expensive house out in the open, i started in a new school and got some friends, found a love intrest called "ebba" typical swedish name. I had a crush on her from 1st to 7th grade but i was just to beta to do anything, she even texted heats and kisses back but urgh, i dunno im just shy as fuck. anyways i had a great time in that school. the best time ever from 1Â½ grade to 6th. it was awesome, great friends awesome teachers great grades, but then when we moved again around 3rd grade into a expensive house from our old farm house, because the water was horrible and barely any internet capacity, so we had to move, and the new house was GREAT, it was closer to town and friends, a little swimming pool, big garden great interior and such, so we got a dog on my moms birthday when i was in the start of 6th grade, we named him balder after the scandinavian god. and we loved him. Then when the start of 7th grade there was a new school, my parents broke up. still friendly and loved eachother but just couldnt stand living togheter, I still wanted to live in the town with my dad and we planned it. next part soon.
