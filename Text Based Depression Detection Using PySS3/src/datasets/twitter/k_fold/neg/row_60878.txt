I keep waiting for certain landmarks in lifeIn elementary school I told myself middle school would be better and I wouldnâ€™t be sad, in middle school I told myself high school would be better and I wouldnâ€™t  feel suicidal.

now Iâ€™m telling myself Iâ€™m just about done high school then I can move away and hopefully stop idealizing suicide or at least stop attempting it.

I just know that itâ€™s not true and I feel like I should just stop progressing in life because no matter whatâ€™s going on externally I feel like complete shit internally.
