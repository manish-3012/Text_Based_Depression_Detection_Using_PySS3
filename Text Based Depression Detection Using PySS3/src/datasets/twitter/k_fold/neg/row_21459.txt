I think my boyfriend (m26) is suicidal. What do I do?We were drinking, having a heart to heart about life. On the outside he seems very put together; smiling and laughing often, successful in his career, loving parents, friends who care about him (though he doesnâ€™t get to see them much), and our relationship which I think is going great (and so does he). In the last two years of dating him Iâ€™ve noticed he can get very anxious, especially if things donâ€™t go exactly as heâ€™s planned them in his head. Heâ€™s a huge perfectionist and little things going wrong can derail him. I love him for that, but I know he really struggles with it. He always feels like heâ€™s on the cusp of messing something up (even though he rarely ever does). He has quite a bit of social anxiety too but has become pretty good at hiding it from what I can tell.


At one point he started talking about his anxiety and how awful it makes him feel every day. How it takes so much extra energy to hide it. How heâ€™s afraid of the future and the possibility of something going terribly wrong. In one moment he said â€œI have no idea what Iâ€™d do if things got really bad. Especially if several things started overlapping too. It could get bad, like suicide bad.â€


I got really worried here. I tried to get him to elaborate on the suicide thing he had just mentioned. I told him Iâ€™d help him through whatever. Even though he was a little teary eyed in the moment he said he didnâ€™t actually mean it. I donâ€™t really believe that. Thinking back over the last year I remember him making jokes about jumping off a building or running out in front of a bus. We didnâ€™t dwell on these moments because they just seemed like jokes. Now Iâ€™m not so sure. 


What do I do??

Tl;dr: Boyfriend said something that indicates he may be suicidal. Iâ€™m worried and unsure of what to do?
