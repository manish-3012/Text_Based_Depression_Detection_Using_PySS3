Family member came out and said he tried committing suicide twice.. Help?So a family member of mine has been depressed for sometime over marital issues for about two years, he came out a couple days ago and said he tried over dosing on medication. What made him stop the first time, was the birth of his niece. The second time, I was there and didn't even realize it, I thought he was being stupid. He took a pain killer and drank a lot of alcohol, in which I forced him to go vomit for 4 hours and if he didn't feel better  I would call the cops. He told me he felt better. But that was an attempt in front of my eyes I didn't even know.

These all happened two years ago, however he is still depressed and is living on his own. I am scared he is going to hurt himself living by himself. I don't know what to do, I told him what anyone would tell him to please take care of himself and that we all love him, and don't do anything rash. He says he gets voices in his head lately before he goes to sleep.
