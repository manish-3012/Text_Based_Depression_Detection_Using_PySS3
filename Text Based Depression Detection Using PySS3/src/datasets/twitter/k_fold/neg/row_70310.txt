Tinnitus makes me want to kill myselfIâ€™ve been struggling with suicidal thoughts for years now, but it was always triggered by something that could be helped. Sometimes it was loneliness, extreme stress, feelings of inadequacy, but now it feels different. This time itâ€™s something that canâ€™t be fixed. Iâ€™ve been dealing with my tinnitus for a month now, and I know many people say theyâ€™ve learned to live with it eventually, but I really canâ€™t see myself continuing on with this constant loud ringing in my ear. I canâ€™t focus on anything unless I mask it with a loud fan, and even then sometimes itâ€™s hard to ignore. Iâ€™m sure people have worse problems than I do, people tell me that a lot. But this is me, I canâ€™t deal with it. It doesnâ€™t matter if others can. Iâ€™m honestly not sure why Iâ€™m here talking about this. Maybe I just wanted someplace to vent my thoughts. For a long time now Iâ€™ve thought that I donâ€™t really mind dying, even if it wasnâ€™t during times where I actively wanted to die. The only reason Iâ€™m still here now is because Iâ€™m scared of surviving the attempt, or what may come afterwards (if there is an afterlife). Iâ€™m also scared it will hurt a lot. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
