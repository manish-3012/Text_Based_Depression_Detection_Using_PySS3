Selfish?Am I selfish for wanting to end it all? Does it make me even more of a horrible person that I feel like as everyday goes on It just gets harder and harder to hold on and fight these urges?    I just want all the pain and sadness to end I'm so tired of being afraid of my own anger  being afraid of letting others down  I'm so tired of always feeling like no matter where I go I just don't belong there
