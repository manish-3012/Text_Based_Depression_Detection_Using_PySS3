Any suggestions?I know this is a bad place to post and maybe I will be banned but I was wondering if anyone would have any resources for me to connect with people who understand me and will be willing to help me. Most tell me the usual crap but I believe in free choice. Any forums for people to end together or anywhere to find helpers for the journey? If you know what I mean?
