Tried it before?So I have struggled with depression and suicidal ideation since I was a kid. A family member has recently informed me that I tried to kill myself when I was younger. But guess what?  I literally don't remember doing this. Still it seems that every other day I am struggling inwardly not to end my life. I wish there was euthanasia for people suffering with long-term mental illness and agony.
