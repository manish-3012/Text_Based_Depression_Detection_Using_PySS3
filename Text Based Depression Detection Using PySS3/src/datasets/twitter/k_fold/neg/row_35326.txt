Feeling completely depressed and helpless.I'm 20/F. I don't know how to put this really, I'm a very bad writer. I can't remember the last time I felt completely happy. Yet, it's almost like I have no reason to be. I have a fairly good life. I'm working a good job, have very nice people around me, I'm not unattractive, I'm not stupid. I recognise that I'm 'fortunate' but I can't bring myself to feel that way. I always feel upset, I always feel inadequate and useless and that shows in the way I tend to treat people around me at times. Sometimes I'm happy, but that doesn't last long enough to count. Sometimes I feel confident but it's like a temporary delusion. I remember when I was younger and I quite frankly thought I was amazing. I want that back. And I don't feel like I can ever get it. And no matter how much better things around me get I know I can never feel good about it. I'm in tears as I type this and I'm just sick of it all. I'm sick of not being happy ever even though I have the resources that would 'contribute' to happiness. I want to stop holding myself to unrealistic standards and love myself.

When I had these bouts of insecurities as a younger teenager, I would try to learn something. Or read. Or figure out how to make myself more beautiful. But now, it's like I've lost all interest in doing that. And that's so much worse. I had such passion for learning and for knowledge and all that is gone now. And it's such a shame because I'm not even motivated any more. I'm lost. And I'm a useless person, I can't imagine what purpose I'd serve.

I have had suicidal thoughts pretty often but I've never really had it in me to act on them. I wish I could, but I'm a coward and I fear ending my life ONLY because it might involve pain and humiliation for the people around me. I would gladly die in an accident right now. I hope that happens.
