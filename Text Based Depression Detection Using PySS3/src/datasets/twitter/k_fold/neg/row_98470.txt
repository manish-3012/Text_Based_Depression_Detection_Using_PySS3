Here because I can't see a counsellor - adult bullyingI am in a horrible and complicated situation right now. I am here because I don't have any options at the moment other than the crisis county hotline and I didn't find it helpful. 

TL;DR I am in my late twenties and dealing with bullying after high school/college. 

I'm being bullied almost regularly by a young guy next door at my parents house, as well as a couple about my age at the apartment where I only stay for for three days a week for my job. Can't stay there because neighbours are abusive toward me, shout insults, follow me around (upstairs) stomping and throwing things. They leave bags of garbage outside the door, and husband has threatened me by staring at me while punching their front door repeatedly, going out and punching my garbage can under the window of my unit, and threatening me with his fucking huge truck while I was crossing the street â€“ He had plenty of leeway when I started crossing, sped up and leaned on his horn. Left me shaken.

Here's where it gets really weird. The wife of this couple was in my grade 12 math class. They look old now and it makes me wonder if she was one of those people who stayed back an extra year. We hardly spoke to each other but she seemed alright, didn't ever pick on me back then. She remembered me before I remembered her. Now she and him are my neighbours. 

I am on disability for mental illness - agoraphobia, social anxiety, depression and panic attacks. A lot of it is a result of trauma from school bullying I experienced for several years. They know this because they've seen my mail. 

They say horrible things to me like after I use the bathroom they say I'm fucking dirty. I turn on the sink to block them out even though I know that is bad too, wasting water. I don't have a sound machine but plan to get one. If I am in the kitchen they get furious and start stomping and swearing sometimes, tell me to stfu. If they hear me eating they call me a pig or something along that line even though I'm thin. I basically tiptoe around the unit because I don't want to draw their attention. 

Stuff from landlord as well - I have given up texting him about their garbage because he lies that he took care of it when it's sitting there in front of my door. There was also a really bizarre incident in the summer where I think he used and destroyed the toilet while I was away and it had to be replaced. I believe it was him because he said he had to fix the roof and asked if I would be away and I said yes. He's the only other person with a key. It is deeply fucked up. 

Now this guy at my parent's house is giving me a hard time, getting worse every year with insults. His bedroom window is always open because he's a hockey player and he shouts insults at me like "Go fuck your mother" because as a result of my handicap I can't drive and I often get rides from my mom. He says sexual slurs like the c word and stuff like that. It's great. He is younger than me and would say mean things to me sometimes like call me a psycho when we were kids but thought he would grow out of it. Nope, he shaved his head, got fit and now is an even bigger bully. 

I am at a loss of how to deal with this. So that's why I'm here. I feel like I've gotten paranoid as a result of the constant abuse from these people. I have zero self esteem, just feel like garbage about myself like I went to college and it was amazing, am an off-and-on freelance artist now but am terrible at staying consistent with producing art and staying in touch with the local art store. I have sold stuff at local art shows and it was great but I didn't go to any of them this year because I've been struggling. An old client I did illustrations for said hurtful stuff when I cancelled going to one of them because she was also going to be there, said "You only had a year to prepare." She has no idea.
