I'm so lonely, it hurts (mentally and physically).I'm so done with everyone and everything. I'm just so lonely, I don't know what to do. I have friends and family, but I still feel lonely and I don't know why. I've been getting help, but things are looking more and more hopeless every day. I wish everything would just stop because I get so lonely it hurts physically. I don't think I've ever not felt a bit lonely, it's just gotten worse over the last few years. Why can't I just be happy? I don't want to do this anymore, I wish I'd never been born.
