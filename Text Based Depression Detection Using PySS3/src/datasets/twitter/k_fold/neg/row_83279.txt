I don't think I'm a real personI don't know how to explain it, but I don't think I'm "real" in the same sense as everyone else. Like I'm just a simulation of a person without a soul. Sometimes I think I have real emotions and convictions, but upon closer examination I realize it was just a momentary fantasy. Like my mind got so bored that it role-played as a real person to entertain itself. I don't have any true sense of self at all. My very existence feels insincere. I just wish the charade could end.
