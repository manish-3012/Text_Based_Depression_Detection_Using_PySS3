Depressed, but I want to talk to people and become friends I am a woman, 27 years old, in a heavy depression right now, but I want to stop the dark thoughts, and going out of my depression. So I try to talk to people first when I feel bad. It would be nice if I could talk to someone who had something in common with me, and who likes music for example: like Nirvana, or Joy Division, or the Clash, Amy Winehouse,

 or to share music with.

Maybe that would help, for me and others.

 So if you like to talk to me about music/depression/or other things and want to becoming friends.

Let me know, maybe it will makes us feel a little better.

Maybe I am depressed, but I don't give up that easy.

I wish to move forward
