I don't how much longer I can take thisEvery waking moment I'm anxious, I can't fully relax. This is going to he the rest of my life and I can't deal with that. I'm so alone which makes the anxiety much worse, always having to deal with it alone. I have just over a week of winter break left before I go back to school. I need to do it before I go back. I won't be able to handle school.
