I'm really freaking the fuck out over money.I hate money, I hate this capitalist bullshit. I hate being in debt, I hate scraping by, what's the fucking point except to keep my family out of debt? I wish I could just stop this now but I can't.   


I don't know what to do, there are no institutions that can help people in a state of emergency like this. I need money, whoever thought to attach money to food? Gross, I would grow my own but you can't just farm anywhere.   


You gotta own land right? How? With money. Money is inescapable. I want to fucking die, I'm tired of being around this stupid stressful bullshit. I'm just tired of myself because I can't hack it in this type of world.   


I'm sure I would have been a barbarian in my past, just taking whatever I needed from others. I'm sure because now my rage is impotent because there is no physical recourse I can take to obtain the things I need to survive so I turn it on myself.   


That's a sad fucked up reality. I am everything that is wrong with the world and I deserve to die and yet I can't because even in death I would hurt my family. Nothing I can do, even becoming dead, can absolve me of the pain I have caused.   


I'm locked into it. I hope I have a stroke, if it's an accident I can't be blamed even if it hurts people. All I can do is hope to die.
