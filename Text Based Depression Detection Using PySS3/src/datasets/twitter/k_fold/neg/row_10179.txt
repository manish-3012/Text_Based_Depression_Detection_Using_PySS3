ReliefAfter too many years suffering, it's finally going to be over tomorrow night, and I cannot wait.

It's genuinely too much physical and emotional pain to deal with day after day. I've become SO GOOD at masking my true emotions but I can't do it anymore. I'm seeing my therapist one last time tomorrow without mentioning this. She has helped me more than anyone ever could, but even the best help out there can't stop the pain. I'm on a high dose of anti depressants as well as a moderate dose of anti psychotics, so why don't they work? I put the effort in too. I eat healthy, I exercise, I do things that make me happy, or at least should make me happy, but I suffer. It's so selfish I know. But at least it will be over after tomorrow.

It gets better to a point, but it's not consistently better to make it through one more day.
