I feel like my life is a movie and it's coming to an end.I felt like this as far as i can remember. Nothing feels real. I always thought my life would end when I turn 18. I felt it. I don't know how to describe it. It's just all gonna end. But it didn't. I'm still here. It's like an error. Why am i still here. I tried killing myself couple of times but it didn't work. Now im scared of doing it again because I'm scared of that feeling. That feeling where you can't breathe. Slowly choking. I don't wanna go through that again. My life is not real. I'm never gonna be happy. I'm never gonna be successful. Yeah I've been to therapy. Yeah I've been taking meds. But they didnt work. It never works. My life is ruined. I dont know what to do. I cant push forward. But I'm scared of trying to kill myself again. So many thoughts I cant concentrate. I feel like I'm loosing myself. Im just damaged goods. Nothing more.
