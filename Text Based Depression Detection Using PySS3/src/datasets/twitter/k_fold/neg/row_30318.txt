[Update] What am I supposed to do now?About a month ago, I posted on here about wanting to commit suicide. And, well, I did. I drank a bottle of peroxide, threw up a bunch, and went to the ER.

I'm a college student, and I missed half the semester. I came back, and then proceeded to skip about two weeks worth of classes because I was too depressed to face the world.

Now, I'll probably fail out, I'm still beyond depressed but medicated at least, and I hide at home every other day. I can't do my homework, I can't focus on anything except Silent Hill (which I have beaten about three times at this point) and I cannot connect with people, my family, or anyone really.

I think about suicide almost daily, and some days are better than others. I had a horrible experience in the hospital, and I don't want to go back- I'm terrified of dying, know that I would mess up offing myself, but I just don't see how to work with my depression enough to get to that place where I am okay.
