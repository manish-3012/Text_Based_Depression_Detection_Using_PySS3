So which one is it?Keeping all the feelings in is too big of a burden, i don't have the strenght to pretend like i'm okay. My mental illnesses are anyway the first, and only thing that people notice in me, but i'm too tired to care about that. I was never worthy, or loved anyway, so might as well be the asshole i truly am. 

Then again, if i tell how tired i am, people either act like i said nothing at all, are bothered and carry the guilt and the helplessness, or attack and blame me for my feelings. So whatever i do, i somehow end up causing problems. What the fuck i'm supposed to do then? I don't even know what i'm expecting from people, i don't necessarily want help, just someone to be there for me, no matter how things turns out.

I don't know what was the point of this post, just some self-loathing i guess, as it seems to be the only thing i'm capable of doing.
