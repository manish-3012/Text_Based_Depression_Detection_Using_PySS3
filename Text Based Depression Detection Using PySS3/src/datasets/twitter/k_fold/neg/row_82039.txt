I hate my parents for creating meIâ€™m still here. Iâ€™m such a coward. Before I wanted to wait to kill myself until after the holidays but I cannot bare to live another fucking second. I have nothing to live for. Not a goddam thing. All of my hopes and dreams will never happen. No one will ever love me. I donâ€™t deserve any of that stuff anyways. Now I am laying in bed praying to God that I never wake up again. It has yet to work. If there is a God, can you please end my suffering? I donâ€™t care if I go to hell. That I probably deserve. All I think about is killing myself. All I research is how to commit suicide successfully. If I fail, I will kill myself in whatever gruesome way that gets the job done. Iâ€™m going to start writing the letter I plan on leaving behind for my family. I truly cannot imagine moving past this day. I truly cannot fathom making it past Christmas. My death will ruin everything for my family. Iâ€™m just so fucking good at doing that. At least I will only disappoint them this one last time. I resent my parents for subjecting me to be apart of this world. I blame myself for a lot but I especially blame them for that. I want to die successfully because I donâ€™t want to go to any hospitals. I donâ€™t want professional or medical help. I do not want to get better. I do not want comfort. I do not want to heal. I want to die. I want absolute silence and a permanent end.
