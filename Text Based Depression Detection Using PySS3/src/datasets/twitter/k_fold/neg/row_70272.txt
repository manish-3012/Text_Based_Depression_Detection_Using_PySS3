Found the courage.I've finally spoken out about how I truly feel to my mum - via a breakdown, of course. I know it's supposed to be a step in the right direction, but if in being completely honest here, I don't think it'll help me at all. I'm posting here because I want to be heard but I don't want to burden my friends, and Reddit is usually a nice place, so thank **you** for listening.  

Also ~~fuck~~ frick having a throwaway account, because who cares anyway?
