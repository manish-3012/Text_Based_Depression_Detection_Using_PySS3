When do you stop telling your friends your feelingsFor the past 7 months or so Iâ€™ve been depressed. I was pretty much in denial if I was or not but then I got diagnosed by a therapist/psychologist. Anyway, itâ€™s been getting really bad lately and I feel the need to tell my friends what Iâ€™m going through. But the thing is they think Iâ€™m getting better.

Iâ€™ve lied to them about pretty much everything because I feel like they shouldnâ€™t be burdened by my own problems when Iâ€™m sure they have issues in their personal lives as well. One friend in particular knows about everything Iâ€™ve gone through but again, Iâ€™ve lied to him saying Iâ€™m making progress. And Iâ€™m certain he believes me. 

This whole â€œfaking me being okâ€ thing was been going on for about 3 months now. Part of me feels guilty because I know they care about me and if I was in their shoes I would want my friends to tell me. But another part of me understands that they arenâ€™t my therapist and I shouldnâ€™t be relying on them to check up on me and see if Iâ€™m ok, because itâ€™s not their responsibility. Itâ€™s my own. 

I guess I just want someone to blatantly ask to my face if Iâ€™m ok just so I can have an excuse to open up and be honest. Ugh this sucks ðŸ˜” I just want a hug or something, I donâ€™t even know what I want or need at this point. But Iâ€™ll end it here because this has gotten long enough and Iâ€™m rating.
