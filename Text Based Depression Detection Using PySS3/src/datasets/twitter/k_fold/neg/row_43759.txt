I didn't choose to live so why can't I choose when I die.I didn't fucking choose to be here and go through all this shit so why can't I kill myself legally. I can't get away from my problems I can't try something new and make them go away or move somewhere else. It won't work so why can't I choose to kill myself. If I didn't choose to be here why the fuck am I or anyone else who wants to leave forced to stay. I fucking hate it, I would kill myself if I could but I don't want to fuck it up or jump in front of a train because that would effect others. I just want to slip away quietly and be forgotten...
Sorry if this is disorganized, I'm just feeling really bad abut the present and the future and I just want out
