the only reason people will try to stop you is because of stupid and selfish instinctsyou, someone whoâ€™s NEVER seen me, donâ€™t know me, know literally nothing about me or my past or anything but the fact that i want to die REALLY care and want me to stay? no. you have an instinct to make sure our species donâ€™t die out. just like how you most probably want kids. youâ€™ll connect all these meanings to your kids too, youâ€™ll think you love them. no, itâ€™s not that, we are wired in such a way that makes us do things that when looked at 100% objectively are so fucking dumb and selfish just because we have a deep, deep-rooted set of instincts one of which is to, like i said, not let humans die out. i fucking hate all of this ðŸ˜‚ðŸ‘Œ people will think theyâ€™re done a good deed by not letting someone who wants to die do it. do they even stop to fucking think about that? what are you achieving? if they have made their choice then thatâ€™s their choice. sure things could get better but they wonâ€™t be hurt about that if theyâ€™re dead. and sure their loved ones will grieve but that is their choice, they arenâ€™t responsible for that because they didnâ€™t choose to be here. basically no Jim you arenâ€™t doing a kind thing by saying hereâ€™s the suicide prevention hotline, your brain just feels as though a human dying would be a bad thing and you canâ€™t help but be a slave to that because your brain is you.
