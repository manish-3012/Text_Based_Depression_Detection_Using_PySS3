Depression harming my physical healthHey I was wondering if anyone else has had their physical health take a nose dive like me. Over the last few weeks itâ€™s been really fuckin bad

Iâ€™ve been getting about 3-4 hours of sleep per night for maybe 2 weeks now

I have been a hard time eating and am getting like 1,000 calories a day. I havenâ€™t checked my weight but I can tell Iâ€™ve lost a fair bit and i was already a skinny guy. For some reason I have no motivation to go out and eat and Iâ€™m losing my appetite in general.

It feels like my anti-depressants arenâ€™t working as well and Iâ€™m worried that itâ€™s going to harm my grades; well it already has. But I still care about school so Iâ€™m not completely off the deep end yet.

If anyone has anything like this some advice would be much appreciated.

Thanks
