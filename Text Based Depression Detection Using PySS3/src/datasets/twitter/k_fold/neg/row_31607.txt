High hopes, sad realityI will start this by saying my English is not very good.

4 months ago my father (I haveâ€™t spoken to him in 22 years) has contacted me on Facebook after 22 years.

He lives in a different country with his new wife and 2 girls (2 girls = his new wife children, made with a different man), my mom (his ex wife) died 13 years ago.

One of those 2 girls fell in love with me, and I fell in love with her. Me and her and my father spoke online for 1-2 months. After, I agreed to come to their country for a visit. For my father, for the girl.

I donâ€™t like talking about this... I just need help, please. I want to kill myself tonight. I donâ€™t know what to do
