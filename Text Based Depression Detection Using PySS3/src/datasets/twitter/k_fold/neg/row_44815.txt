Do I have to beat this with working out?I'm doing so much to try and overcome my need to die by picking up healthier hobbies. For instance I'm reading in well lit open window rooms instead of playing video games in dark man caves. But my parents get angry at me cause I'm not outside. I'm just not crazy about the outside I feel uncomfortable especially if there's people around and it's not cold enough yet where I am. They say I am gonna be stuck where I am unless I start working out/ start being physically active. Is that true?
