AloneI have a good life. I have a family, a few friends I can lean on, and a lot of other shit I constantly take for granted. Yet, I want to end my life. Everyday. It has become a constant thought over the years. I've tried it once and ended up being hospitalized, my parents never brought me to therapy. I lost all of my friends that I thought would be there for me for a long time. I moved schools, too. I was the odd one out. 
Recently, my parents just got divorced. Out of nowhere, it wasn't expected. My backbone was my boyfriend, who just broke up with me too. 9 months down the drain. I feel like I have absolutely no one anymore, though I have a few friends who say they're here for me they always complain about killing themselves too. I am so alone, sure I go to school and talk to people but the moment I walk through the door at either my mom's or dad's I am alone. Constantly, I have nightmares..i'm slowly moving towards drugs and drinking as a safe haven for me. I miss my boyfriend but yesterday he called me a problem. I go to a therapist and she said she's putting me on antidepressants but my parents are refusing to bring me to the doctor to prescribe them to me officially. i'm emotionally and physically drained and the last thing i want to do right now is live.
