I'm just a failure6:05 AM. I woke up about half an hour ago from what now seems like my monthly nightmare about college. They're all very similar, usually me wandering around some school with borrowed traits of ones I've been to before, feeling panicked because I have a final starting soon that I'm not prepared for. 

It makes sense, because that has happened to me. Calc 3, 4 years ago. I of course failed that final. Though at the time it didn't panic me, I knew I wasn't prepared and accepted my fate. I had a "whatever happens, happens" mentality with it. It was the first class I didn't get at least a B in. It was the semester where my life started to fall apart because of my worsening depression. I remember starting off strong that semester, even having the highest score on one of the 4 exams in that class. I also  remember the week when the wheels came off. It started with a few insignificant troubles that then snowballed into what my life is today. I wish I could go back and slap myself to keep me on track.

I can't afford to go back to school. Even if I could, I worry that I would just fail again, or at least relive all the negative emotions associated with it. Feeling inferior to all the other students based on how they dress, their general demeanor during lecture. I remember well how intimidating it felt, a trash kid like me sitting among a crowd of kids with upper-middle class parents, with tons of friends and more life experience than me. I remember not feeling like I belonged. If I went back, I wonder how much worse the feelings of inferiority would be, given that I'm a few years older.

I'm just a straight up failure. I had a great opportunity to go through college with a lot of financial assistance, and I blew it. After that I tried becoming a LoL pro, and failed at that. Then I settled for trying to become a streamer, and failed at that as well. Always close, but failing in the end. All I've done the last 3 years is work shitty 9-10 dollar per hour jobs and not advice myself, because I can't. I was born trash and can't escape it.

There honestly is no point to me being alive anymore, all I can picture for my future is being a minimum wage worker for the rest of my life. There's not anything wrong with that, but that lifestyle isn't for me. I need to be something. I need to be successful by traditional standards, i.e. having a good degree and a job of equal quality. But I can't. I know I can't. I've been a tremendous fucking failure all my life. I'm just going to be poor all of my life and never get to experience the few things that I want to.

My heart has been racing the last 30 minutes and I can't go back to sleep. I can only obsess on my failures. I've made plans to kill myself in July, but I don't know if I can wait. Perhaps the worst part of all of this is knowing that there isn't help for me. The only clinic I can afford within 20 miles of me (I don't have a car to look elsewhere) has a 4 month waiting list, or something absurd like that. Every time I called the suicide hotline they ask my location so they can refer me to the same 3 clinics around me. It feels super shitty, like I'm talking to robots who don't care about me. Just thinking about it makes me angry. Not really the hotline people so much as the fact that the government doesn't help low-income people seek psychiatric attention. But yeah the hotline people are kind of frustrating too. I've called several times at this point and they say almost exactly the same things every time, which makes the whole thing feel scripted and insincere. 

I've calmed down a little bit, during my rambling. I can wait for July. But I still feel slightly impatient. I just wish I could get it over with. I hate being alive. No matter what anyone tells me, I'm a piece of shit. I need to die.
