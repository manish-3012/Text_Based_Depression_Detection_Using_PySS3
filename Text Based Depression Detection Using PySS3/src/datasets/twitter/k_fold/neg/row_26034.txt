Attempted suicide once and I want to try again.I tried to overdose on sleeping pills when I was 17 during my high school exams, and as a result, I didn't do well and I couldn't go to university. I'm scared to work (I've had to quit my last three jobs). I've been staying at home since high school ended - I'm 20 now. I don't think I have a future. I'm so so afraid and feel so so alone.
