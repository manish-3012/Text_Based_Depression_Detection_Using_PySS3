I'm not strong enough to kill myselfI think about suicide almost every minute of every day. I think about how I don't belong in this world and how I don't deserve to be here. I have even gotten to the point of developing a plan and seeking out methods multiple times. So frequently, in fact, that I just got out of the hospital for suicidal thoughts.  
  
The problem is, I don't think I'll ever be able to do it... I'm just too scared. Too weak. I can't even fucking kill myself to end this pathetic excuse for a life I have. I'm too tired and weak to do anything. I can't get my life back on course either.  
  
I wish I had the strength to kill myself, I really do. But for now I am going on. I really, desperately hope that something pushes me over the edge one day, something gives me that urge to finally end it all. But that day is not here yet so I am stuck here.  
  
I don't want to be here. I wouldn't mind dying if it took me by surprise. I would let an attacker with a gun shoot me without putting up a fight. But I just... can't, I'm too weak...  
  
I wish euthanasia for depression was a thing. I know that sounds incredibly macabre and I'm not sure how I feel about it ethically except that I know I would definitely want in. I'm a lost cause at this point. Been to therapy for years. Seen dozens of different doctors. Been hospitalized and partially hospitalized half a dozen times. Even tried ECT.  
  
Nothing helps, and if something does help, it's not enough to make a difference. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. I don't want to be here anymore.  I am tired of being a burden. I don't belong here. I don't matter to anyone.  
  
I'm just a very weak person in general. I can't change anything about my life. I'm stuck until something outside of my control changes for the better or for the worse. I'm waiting for a miracle or a catastrophe, but every day that passes it seems less and less likely either will ever happen. I'm just... stuck.
