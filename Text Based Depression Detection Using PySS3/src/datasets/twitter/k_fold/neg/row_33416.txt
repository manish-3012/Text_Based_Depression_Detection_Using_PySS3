I write suicide notes in my head in bedThen I wonder who the hell I think cares about me enough to bother writing a suicide not to them. It has been since January since I saw a friend to do something social, and not for lack of trying, but nobody likes me. I try to sleep, but I find myself writing more suicide notes to nobody. It's not that I'm depressed, it's that I am a failure as a person. Nobody likes me, nobody would even care. Except maybe my dog.
