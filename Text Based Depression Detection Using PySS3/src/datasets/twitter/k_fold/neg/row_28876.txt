A wish to be forgottenI don't get what the big deal is with living. People hold on to hope to keep them going but why? What's the point if life is always just going to shit on you. You have temporary happiness followed by the agonizing pain that you've felt for the majority of your life. When does it get better? Does it ever get better? I'm not sure but I'm truly glad it's me that's constantly in pain. I feel like maybe I deserve all this pain for being so fucking useless. It's funny how I thought someone like her could ever truly love me, when I know better than anyone how fucking worthless I really am. I brought nothing to the relationship when it mattered. I brought nothing positive to this fucking world in general. So please everyone forget about me because someone like me does not deserve to be remembered.
