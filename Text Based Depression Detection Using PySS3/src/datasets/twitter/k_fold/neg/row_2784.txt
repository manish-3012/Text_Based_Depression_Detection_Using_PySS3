December 12Thatâ€™s the day Iâ€™m going to try to do it, I have pills that lower your heart rate and blood pressure and I have a ton of them so Iâ€™m going to go like that. I want to do it tonight but I want to finish the semester out before I off myself. None of my friends care, every one will get over it eventually. I feel like Iâ€™ve tried everything. I go to therapy, I take my meds, I tried eating right but it just seems nothing works. Maybe this life just wasnâ€™t meant for me.
