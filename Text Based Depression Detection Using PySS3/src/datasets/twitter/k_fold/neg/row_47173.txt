I feel its inevitableHey, I'm an 18 year old from canada, I've had a history of depression and countless suicide attemps, and after a period of a fairly stable life, it seems everything is rushing back.

For a little info, I've had type 1 diabetes for about 7 years, ive always had good control over my blood sugar level, but the second 5 years passed, I began to run into complications, the three being damaged kidneys, periods of no feeling in my limbs, and my penis getting smaller, and obviously the latter isn't really all that bad but of course it was a huge kick in ny confidence.

Now past bullying from both classmates and father aside (me being fat and nerdy as a kid) i have a really good life, I've slimmed down heavily to try to combat the diabetes, and I now have a great group of friends and a wonderful girlfriend. But even with all this I just live with a feeling of impending doom. I just feel like I'm gonna die, and if this thing is gonna take my limbs and eyesight and health with it, then what's the point of trying to stay afloat, and work to pay for college, I don't want to have those things taken away from me, I just wish I was normal.
