How do I keep going if I have no one?I've posted here a couple times (and taken to commenting a lot lately). A couple months ago my best friends in the world just stopped talking to me. Two of them live in the UK right now, but the other two (and myself) still live in the US. The two in the UK will be back sometime in December for the holidays, but I'm not sure when. I want to wait to see if they talk to me again once they're back in town, and if they don't I want to ask them why they've stopped talking to me, if they still want to be friends.

What do I do if they say no? That they want nothing to do with me? I've had friends ghost out on me before or just straight up tell me they don't want to be around me. These last couple years my depression has been really bad, and my friends don't know how bad it's been. I can barely function at my job, and I won't be able to keep it after December for other reasons. I'm really slipping in my coursework for school as well, though I'm only taking two classes.

I'm seriously thinking that if my friends are done with me, then I'm done with me, too. Until a few months ago I thought I'd be able to make it a couple more years, but I can't even see myself living to next summer at this point.
