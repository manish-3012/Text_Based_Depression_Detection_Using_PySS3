I do not have the reasons to live anymore :(I have had the suicidal thoughts for my whole life - it was a normal reaction to any bigger problem I had. "Why should I try to resolve when I could just end my life and the problem will resolve itself" - i am pretty sure that you guys know such way of thinking very well.

I fough these thoughts very hard, I haven't had them since the last year (for about 7-8 months) but now they are back. I do no even know why to be honest. But I just feel that I do not have any reasons to live any more - I'm stuck at a dead-end job, I work three shifts and don't even have time to meet my friends :/ I am 25 years old, male, never had a girlfriend and I do not think it will change - all my friends are getting married or are at least in the relationships. 

The only reason I did not commit a suicide was my parents - I knew that they could not handle the pain. 

I'm pretty sure that I will not do it in the forseable future, but the pain is large, and I know that you know how it is to live with these suicidal-thoughts :(

Thanks.
