I'm lost.I don't know how to start this post and sorry if my English is bad.  I got addicted to gambling a few years ago and now lost half of my savings. I don't have any real friends. My mother changed after her new husband and son lived with us. I REALLY LOVE MY MOTHER MORE THAN ANYTHING IN THE WORLD AND IT REALLY HURTS ME TO SEE THAT SHES HAPPY WITH SOMEONE I'M NOT. I'm always depressed and always having panic attacks. I don't know but i hate socializing with others. The only thing that keeps me on living is playing video games as my escapism from my reality. I really want to die right now but im afraid of the pain. I know its the permanent solution to my problems. I also understands that everyone has a problem and no one gives a shit if i die.Maybe this is the end of my story, sorry for wasting my life on something i love. Tomorrow i want to kill myself. I will drive at full speed like Michael Schumacher and never be seen again.

Edit: Thanks for the response guys. I'm literally crying right now.
