Suicidal ideation and plans.On and off for years I've thought obsessively about suicide. I would suffer from bouts of depression on and off and attempted suicide once while drunk about 3 years ago. For context purposes, I'm a 19-year-old female. Lately I've been obsessing about suicide even though right now I don't feel as though I'm depressed, numb rather. I've tried to write out a plan but there's no method that I'm willing to try. Maybe I just want the attention or maybe I want to prove to everyone that I'm as sick as I feel. Yes, I go to counseling, however, I don't feel that I actually want to get better. I have self destructive tendencies including self-harm tendencies. I'm so fragile right now that if I heard just one person tell me to kill myself, I'd do it.
