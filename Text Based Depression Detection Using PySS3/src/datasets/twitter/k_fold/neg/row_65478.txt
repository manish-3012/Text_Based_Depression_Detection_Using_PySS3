The world would be much better if I left it.I want to do it. I want to kill myself so badly. I have to. There is no way that I will be able to bring anything to this world without taking away from it more. I am a net negative financially, emotionally, I take away from people's time, money, life. I am worse than nothing.

I want to do it now, but I'm thinking to do it in January so it doesn't get in the way of the university exam season or my parents' cookie company (peak times are during the Christmas season). I want to do it with the least potential impact so I don't cause any more pain than I have to. I want to go to the local shooting range a few times so I become more familiar, and then shoot myself in the head, so nobody can be blamed except me. I need it. I almost crave it, like I'm hungry. I can't go on like this anymore.
