I need a yes or no answer, not a â€œsorta, sorta notâ€Iâ€™m still a kid, turning 13 this August. Iâ€™ve popped pills, cut, attempted suicide twice, been addicted to porn, I canâ€™t feel excited about anything anymore. All my grandparents are dead and I have high chances for borderline, generalized anxiety disorder, and a chance for schizophrenia. I havenâ€™t been officially been diagnosed but i plan to go to a therapist soon to get a official statement. Long story short is the kinda shit Iâ€™m going through at my age common? Or am I in the boat alone?
