18 y/o and donei never really had a relationship, id close it off before it could get started, i was too scared, absolutely terrified my heart would break, see i'm not strong emotionally, so i kept out of harms way. 

i never cried either though, like, ever, after the age of 12 i just stopped, my uncle died, i was upset, so god damn upset, but i didn't cry. 

last year, my friend introduced me to a friend, by god she is magnificent, hilariously funny, sweet, beautiful, and a wonderful friend, and as time went on we got closer and closer until she couldn't get out of my head, and then i asked her... 

and she said yes! i was so freaking happy you wouldn't believe, i finally let my guard down and asked a girl out, and my heart wasn't shattered! it was good, for a few weeks, then she realised she was going to uni soon, and didn't want to lose me as a friend, and we "agreed" to call it off, i fought, dont get me wrong, but her heart was set, and then my heart shattered, i let my guard down once and thats it, im done, i cant think, i barely eat, and i actually cried, and now i cant stop, and its just all on top of me! 

last night i went drinking with a few friends up her house, she didnt drink because she was gonna drive later, i came so close to telling her how i felt, but i couldnt, and now shes not replying to my texts, and when she does its short, and shes not talking to me, and i just feel like the one good thing in my life, her friendhsip is ruined! i fucked up sp bad, and quite frankly, im done! im posting this because i need someone to know, i turn to her in times of hurt, but she is the hurt, who can i turn to know? theyd all rat me out to her, and it really would be over. 

i dont know what to do 

ive got no one
