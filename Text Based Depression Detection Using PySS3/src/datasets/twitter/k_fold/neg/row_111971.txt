It's been a hard year.Last summer I entered into the worst relationship of my life. We were both drinking heavily, lying to each other about various things. I was suicidal towards the end if the relationship, and she called the police on me because of some vocalized suicidal ideation. I in return threatened to tlll the cops that she sold drugs from her house. The relationship ended with me catching a six-month restraining order, and attempting to kill myself in order to not have to deal with the shame and regret of that. I have very few friends and the one of the few i have was uncharacteristically unsupportive of mw during this time. Recently, the order was dropped. I went to the courthouse to defend myself and my ex just didn't show up, so the judge dropped it. Later that day I receive a Facebook message from her, apologizing that shed had no way to tell me she wasn't going to show. We talk a little bit and it turns into a conversation about what happened. It turns out her "boss" in their drug dealing operation had pushed her into getting the order against me to protect them against me possibly calling the police. I feel betrayed at this, but I am able to make myself get past it because I feel maybe being friends with her is a pathway to healing. We have hung out a few times this week, until today when it came out that almost as soon as the restraining order was in place, she went and fucked the guy who I thought was my best friend. And she flew halfway across the country to do it. I called them both out on it, I'm out two if the three people in the world who were still 'friends' with me, and I'm feeling like I can't trust anyone. I had been making good progress in therapy, I'm sober now, bit this has caused such a big hit to my mental state that I'm just at a loss of what to do. I'm not sure if I want to attempt again or not, bit I'm thinking about it.
