I can never sleepWhen I try to sleep, I get flooded with thoughts and memories from the past. I have PTSD from sexual trauma and it seems to be the last thing I think of at night and the first thing I think of in the morning. I really don't want to live like this anymore. I haven't had a good nights rest in months. Right now I feel like hurting myself really badly and I don't know how to turn those thoughts off. Usually talking to friends helps but everyone close to me is asleep. I just need help I guess.
