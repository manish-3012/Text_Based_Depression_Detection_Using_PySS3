Starvation and dehydrationI feel stupid after months thinking about a way to die finally realizing that I kept myself alive everyday by simply eating and drinking...
Started today (about 24 hours now) to stop both food and water and this seems so far like a good way to go.
There is a lot of stuff online about this, seems ok, ends in about 10 days... Just worried that in a few days I could be taken to a hospital and forcibly fed. 

It sucks feeling thirsty, specially because its so hot here. I want to go on, I want to end this badly. But I would love a cold water lol

It just sucks the lengths we have to go through to end it.
