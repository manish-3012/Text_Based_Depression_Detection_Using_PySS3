It's like i pick up where I left off every timeI cam't fix it. I keep trying, I keep thinking I did it this time. But when I catually have to deal witht things, I realize everything's the same. I'm still useless. Still, no one likes me at all. Still, I don't like myse;f. At this point I've over thpught things. I've convinced myself NO ONE on this planet has a purpose and that the search for truth and a better world is a falsehood that makes everyone sane feel better. I'VE OVERTHOUGHT THIS. The "truth is that if you're living life at all "right" you shouldn't be having a motherfucking existential crises on the fucking daily. Distractions have become my reality. I live for the next fucking superhero movie, the next time my discover weekly updates. But with summer classes starting again, I rememner how fucking useless I am, my how much I rely on substance to cope. I really really don;t want to do thus anymore. I've tried opening up to others. Some tolerated me, some made me feel worse. I've tried medicine and nootropics. I always go back to the ones that just made me escape. I've tried changing my diet and exercise and everything and I just realy don;t know how much longer I can stay alive for others. I've done my research, they'll be distraught for a year, max. Probably less considering I'm not even the favorite child. What about the 8 years of depression, addiction, fucking misery I've had to go through. I can't ignore the thoughts and the feelings and everythin. I definitely want to die. I wanna do it right now. When I start feeling like this it only goes deeper and I only ull myself out with alcohol. I'm drhk. I'm already drunk. And over the semester it'll only get worse. I'm slowly, secretly failing out of college. I won't graduate for six years at this point. 

These legal, sage nootropics were the last thing in my arsenal and they're not worling. World, just know I tried, I realy tried. Every. Fucking thing. This just sunk in. I skipped class AGAIN. There's no way I'll catch up with the material. Tonight, I'll cry myself to slleep. Tomorrow, I'll drink, buy the call of duty dlc, and slice my arms open.
