Exactly one week ago from now I came out of hospital for alcohol poisoning and possible organ failure, and it made me realize I fully expect to die before I'm 25.It took them 40 minutes just to find a vein that hadn't collapsed. The doctor thought I was going to die. I came out of hospital that night telling myself that I would be sober from that point on. Exactly one week later all I want is some weed and a glass of whiskey. No matter what happens to me I always go back to my old ways and I now realize that theres no way I'm going to make it to 25 at all.
