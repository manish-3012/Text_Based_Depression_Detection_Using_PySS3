I am a burdenI weight down everyone around me, I only think of myself. I am a narcissist, and I dont even understand the intent of my own words. I can never tell if I am being genuine or not. I hate myself so much. Even writing this I feel as if I'm just doing it for "attention" or something. I'm in a constant struggle with myself. I want to die so badly.
