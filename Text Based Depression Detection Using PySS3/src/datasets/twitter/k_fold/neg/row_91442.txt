What's the use?I came so close to attempting two days ago. At least I'm pretty sure it was two days ago, the days have all been running together lately. Of course I didn't do it, and I feel like a coward for that.

These feelings seem to come in waves. First when I was 12, then 15, and the last time I was about 19. This time around is different. When I was younger they mostly centered around my self loathing, now it's complete hopelessness and is somehow more painful. 

I've lost hope in so many things. In my family accepting me for who I am, or even having the courage to tell them (hint: it starts with an L and ends in a GBT). In living the life I want to live. In spending that life with the person I love. In overcoming this crippling anxiety so I really can live it. Or just in being happy at all.

My family might as well own me, but that might be the misfortune of being born as a girl into a hyper conservative southern family. They say they want me to be happy and maybe they do. But they only want me to be happy on their terms. Nothing I do fits into their ideas of what a woman, or anyone for that matter, should do.

Nothing I've ever had any passion for can get me anywhere in life. It's not as if I have much interest in any of it right now anyway. I know my family thinks my interests and college major are useless, and other people are always skeptical about whether I can be "successful" with it. But I'm so sick of the constant barrage of comments about what I should do with my life and how I'm a failure for not listening to them. 

It's clear I'll never be free. I'm sick of crying every night. I'm sick of being a failure. So I say what's the use in sticking around?
