If I kill myself I wonâ€™t be depressed anymore...I know I have severe depression, but I canâ€™t do anything about it. I want to talk about it but I fear someoneâ€™s going to give me some pills or throw me in some mental institution like Iâ€™m some sort of freak. Iâ€™m a guy and I cry, I get that itâ€™s not â€œmanlyâ€ but I stopped caring. I donâ€™t care what society thinks. Sometimes I donâ€™t even care what I think. Iâ€™m a fucking failure. 

I stopped eating as much as I used to, I just want to sleep all the time, I canâ€™t think straight sometimes, I donâ€™t find my hobbies as fun as they used to. I donâ€™t know what I want and thatâ€™s whatâ€™s wrong with me. Im better off doing nothing than doing anything.  I donâ€™t even care if anyone sees this post, but I felt like I needed to get it out there before I end it.
