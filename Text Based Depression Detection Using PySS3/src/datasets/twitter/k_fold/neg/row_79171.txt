They always say life gets better but my life keeps getting worse.Hi Iâ€™m me I donâ€™t wanna say my name but I am me, I am a 15 year old girl, yes I know every fucking teenager suicidal 15 year old girl stereotype whatever. I just feel that life wasnâ€™t meant for me idk what it is. Maybe my soul wasnâ€™t suppose to be here and it was an accident and itâ€™s not even in a sad way Iâ€™m not suppose to fucking be here and thatâ€™s just that. From childhood up until now Iâ€™ve had such a fucking bad life I donâ€™t wanna toot my own horn but I shouldâ€™ve killed myself a long long fucking time ago most people if they lived my life from childhood until now probably wouldâ€™ve done it by now. Iâ€™m getting fed up I was waiting for some magical reason why Iâ€™m suppose to be here like an Epiphany of some sort. I told myself two years ago the same exact sympathetic bullshit some day blah blah Iâ€™ll be living my dream life Iâ€™ll be happy in a year or so, weâ€™ll that shit never happened and now Iâ€™m at my rock bottom I guess maybe Iâ€™m writing this for some subconscious reason to find a reason why I should fucking stay when I know I shouldnâ€™t. Everything happens for a reason, Iâ€™m just one of those people that should kill themselves. Iâ€™m a background character that kills themself and then the people I know in my life have that pivotal, â€œ Oh I know my purpose in life like I wonâ€™t take people and life for granted anymore because this girl in my life killed herself,â€ bullshit I have fucking no clue what Iâ€™m saying Iâ€™m rambling. Iâ€™ve attempted suicide many times never successfully because Iâ€™m a little bitch, the first time I was 11 I wish I wouldâ€™ve committed that time I guess something inside of me wants to stay for whatever reason and I donâ€™t fucking understand why though, I donâ€™t fucking get it. Therapy doesnâ€™t work for me and my mom didnâ€™t want me to get on anti depressant meds because â€œ theyâ€™ll change me,â€ or some anti Pharma bull shit like that. Iâ€™ve went to multiple therapist but the First Lady i went too was a bitch but she said I had severe depression and anxiety but I needed to keep making appointments with her to truly get meds or tips but I hate therapy too much too. I was in two car crashes while my mom was pregnant with me and they told her both times that she should be expecting a miscarriage but I didnâ€™t die and I fucking stayed in their my full nine months and came out healthy except mentally. I wish I had died in her body before she got attached to me, before she saw my personality and saw me happy in some parts of my childhood. Now she sees me deteriorating day by day and has no idea what to do about it because she reminisces of the memories she has of me as a little happy girl. Idek what to do now I guess this is my last chance for fucking someone to say something to change my mind the last straw before I really make up my mind idk. Iâ€™m not a danger to myself rn because if I were to ever kill myself Iâ€™d  never do it in my house where someone has to find my dead body thatâ€™s fucked and gross I wouldnâ€™t wanna do that too anyone and since weâ€™re quarantined you know and I canâ€™t leave and Iâ€™d have no reason too, Iâ€™m am a child so. Idfk this is stupid but Iâ€™m just confused for now why my brain wants to live and die at the same time so bad.
