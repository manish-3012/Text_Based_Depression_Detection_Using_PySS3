Ive never wanted to die as much as i do tonightIm not going to explain what went on in my life for me to feel this way as that would take far too long but basically my mental health has been going downhill for the past year and it seems to just get worse and worse. tonight is the first time ive seriously considered suicide, how i would do it, what my note would say (as cliche as it is yes id want to write a note, my parents at least need closure) and how the world would be if i was gone. ive pushed away every last person in my life who cared so theres really no choice left than to just end it. im not going to do anything tonight, i cant. but i dont know what the future holds. im just unbelievably numb and cant take my life anymore.
