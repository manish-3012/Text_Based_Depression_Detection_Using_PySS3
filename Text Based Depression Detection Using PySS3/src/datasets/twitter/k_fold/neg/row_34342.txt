I Could Really Use Some SupportI wish I didnâ€™t feel this way but here we are again. I feel powerless to stop it. I donâ€™t really have anyone around that can help or someone to even offer support. After my last attempt Iâ€™m in therapy and it helps some but idk I guess Iâ€™m just broken. 

I want someone to say that itâ€™s ok, that itâ€™s not my fault (even tho it is). Iâ€™m so weak and stupid I just want to stop existing so bad.
