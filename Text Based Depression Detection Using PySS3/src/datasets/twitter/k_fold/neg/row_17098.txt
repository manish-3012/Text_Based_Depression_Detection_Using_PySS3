Don't know what to doI don't even know why I'm writing this now.

I have a lovely wife, two very young, beautiful kids, a professional well-paying job (that I hate) and think about killing myself at least every other minute. My depression has basically ruined my marriage, and I fear that it ruin my relationship with my children as they grow up. I can't get any work done and will probably be fired soon. I honestly just want to go to sleep forever, anything to stop the pain. I don't know how much longer I can take it.
