Rainbow BridgeOne of my beloved pets died today. I swear if Rainbow Bridge was a real place I wouldn't hesitate in joining my animals. Usually I can fight the urge to even think about it all but when I go there, I feel like there is no hesitancy. Like one day I will just do it unthinkingly. Not today though.

People on my socials post about mental health and how their door is always open. But I wonder how many people would respond if I said hey guys, I want to walk out in front of a truck and some days it is literally all I can think about. And a couple times I have pulled over and watched them go by and been real close. 

I don't believe in an afterlife. I don't believe I will see my animals again. I don't think there is anything but this. But why does this have to be so fucking hard. Where did the joy go.
