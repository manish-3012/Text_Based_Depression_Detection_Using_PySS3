I just want to die...Ever since my ex broke up with me after we had a committed life together, all I've been able to think about is killing myself.

I don't want to exist. Nothing seems worth it anymore. I can't shake the depression and I'm not even sure that I want to.

People say it gets better or that there's something worth living for... However, I don't have anything that I have to look forward to in the future.

I'm moving out of my exes and my house this coming Saturday but all I want to do it kill myself before then so I don't have to go through it.
