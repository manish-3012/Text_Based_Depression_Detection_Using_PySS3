Poem a Day pt 3Untitled

im in love with dangerous bitches
unhealthy attraction breeds unholy love
i fall in love when it puts me in stitches
masochistic melancholy falls down above

now suddenly my words can hurt
now my words mean everything
they still mean nothing in my defense

now suddenly the bird is the worm
and the song in my head is sung but not heard
and silence is loud and the stones are unturned
and its blood unto blood and its dirt unto dirt

Cry myself to sleep again but no tears fall
A special kind of lonely that feels so crowded
Living asleep and frozen in suspense

cry myself to sleep again and let the tears burn
cling to the hope that only seems to hurt
and silence is loud and the stones are unturned
and its blood unto blood and its dirt unto dirt
