I have depression, my girlfriend cheated on me, nobody remembered my birthday, and when I came out of the closet I lost most people in my life. Iâ€™m tired of life.23F. I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore.
Everything is falling apart and Iâ€™m done.
Iâ€™m NOT looking for advice. I have nobody to talk to in real life about this so I just want to vent.

Coming out feels like a heavy burden has just been lifted off my shoulders but I just lost almost everyone in my life. I live in a very conservative place and most of my â€œfriendsâ€ are hardcore religious people. As a result, they want no part of me anymore and the Church condemns me for being a lesbian.

Iâ€™m sick of life already and I want to end it. Iâ€™m sick of being myself. I wish I wasnâ€™t gay.

Sorry for making anyone read through this I just want to vent. Iâ€™m not looking for advice or anything else.
