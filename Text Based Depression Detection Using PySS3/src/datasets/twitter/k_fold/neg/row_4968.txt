WhyI always hated myself from the way I look to just never being good enough for anyone, even with my childhood best friend of 10 years whom I talk to almost everyday, I still feel at arm's distance. Nothing good ever came from my life. Good grades not good enough to get into college. Good man not good enough skin color for the girl I love's parents. I was on the brink of just disappearing then I got into an accident where my face got extremely scarred. The confidence that used to be the only thing I had in my corner is gone. I'm just a burden that incurs bills and problems to those around me.
