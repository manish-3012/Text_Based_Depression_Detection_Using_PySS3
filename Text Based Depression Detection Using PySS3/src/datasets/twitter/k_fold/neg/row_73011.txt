I want to dieTitle says it all. I wish I was dead and am so tempted to just jump in front of the next train that goes by our house. We can generally hear them coming so it shouldn't be too hard...

Basically, if I told you my story, everyone would just feel sorry for me. boohoo, poor me. Well, that doesn't really help me at all or change what I want to do to myself. Long story short, my older brother was messing with me for a couple years. I didn't want to but he practically forced me. When he left for college I told my mom about some of what he made me do and she slapped me in the face. Told me not to lie. She always liked him way more than me, so I am not surprised. 

That was like 5 years ago. Brother dropped out of college and joined military. Only came back home for major holidays sometimes. Now he's getting out of the army and coming back home for good and worse off he's coming back to live here. He's a fuckin adult, why is he coming back to live at home?

On top of it all, school was awful for me last year and summer break is turning out to be even more awful since I have no friends. Nobody loves me, and I mean that truly, nobody fuckin cares about me. 

Despite my life being a complete shithole since I could remember, I have only started wanting to die recently and I just so desire a release from this life. God made a mistake with me, hopefully he can try again and put me in a different life.

But I'd be happy succumbing to an endless pit of nothingness just the same.
