Hey, guys. Itâ€™s me again.Contrary to my own wishes to commit suicide and just get shit over with, Iâ€™m a pussy and canâ€™t seem to go through with it. However, Iâ€™ve always loved helping people through difficult times. And so, I was wondering if you guys could give me any advice on what to say and how to try and help someone who is struggling with thoughts of suicide. A lot of times, I donâ€™t know what to say and if what I do say hurts the person even more. Hell, I just want to be able to comfort someone correctly in their final hours even. Can anyone help me
