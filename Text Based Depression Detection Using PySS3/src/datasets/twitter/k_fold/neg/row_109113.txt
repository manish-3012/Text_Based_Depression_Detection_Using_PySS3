I tried calling back many times but no answer. Long story short, i wake up this morning to a text  from her that says she drank hydrogen peroxide last night and she refuses to go to the hospital. Even if she survives this, i cant see any point of me continuing to live. Making her happy was the only accomplishment i had and now i dont see how i will ever stop hating myself. I dont have many friends and im very awkward and weird. My parents are going to a divorce and i just feel alone. One of these days maybe i'll find the strength to just end it.
