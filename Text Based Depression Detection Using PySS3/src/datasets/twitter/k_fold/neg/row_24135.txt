I'm doneI keep thinking that it's getting better, but I'm always wrong. I bury myself in more and more debt, I don't have energy to do the stuff I once found fun. I don't feel like doing the things I want to do.  feel so alone. I miss my old life, but I can't go back in time.

I failed the things that was most important in my life. I failed my studies and I lost my relationship. It's a couple of years ago now but it just doesn't get betteri hear people having fun outside and I break down.

I had some good years. And I'm thankful for that
