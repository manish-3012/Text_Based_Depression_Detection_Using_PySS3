Advice from a manic depressive.As a Bipolar person. 'in curciles'. My Brother also. He goes up when he spirals, I go way way way..... way down. I feel guilt and manic depression. Luckily I have a strong willpower and (tricky myself into believing which is why the post) a strong moral compass.
So what I've learned is, basically if you really, not only want attention but truly just want to give up because you don't see the shamrock on the horizon, your body just starts to shut down. Any form of manic depression leads to a shut down of who we are. 
I get hives on my hands from stress or whatever and my organs (when I try to feel'em) are just giving up. 
SO take it or leave it, but...
The thing to do here is do all the stupid shit they told you!
Go out in nature and feel your poorly evolved (nature fucked up okay? it's not your fault) and try to get some sense of how your emotions and depression is leading to a shut down!
Grab a stick pull it apart, do some insane summer salts to get well.
Floss, even tho everyone as miserable as me just wants a bottle of whiskey and a kind person to take their hand and place an opium pipe....
Feel your body giving up. If you don't understand then you just need to tell your momma you love her and ask her to make 'er a sandwich.
If your truly manicly depressed like me then just give "deep breathing" a try.
It sounds like hopeful counselor office posters of advice stollen all the way from china and reformated but it's actually what you gotta do.
if it's the gears of capitalist society that's crushing you... get some SSI checks. They're present for a reason. 
You may be looking at a sharp metal today and wish nothing
but tomorrow you may be laughing.
