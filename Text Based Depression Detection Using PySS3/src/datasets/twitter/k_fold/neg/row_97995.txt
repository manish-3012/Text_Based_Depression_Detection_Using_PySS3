My family tries to hurt meSo basically, strap in for a story, so my family since I was born hasnâ€™t been perfect, none are. But mine is a bit different. Iâ€™m not trying to look perfect here, I have a mental illness that no one knows anything about, I get really pissed at the slightest things for no reason, and then Iâ€™m right back to being nice in 3 minutes. My family doesnâ€™t even try to help me not be that way. They make me mad, and then leave me alone. I donâ€™t understand anything anymore. One of my choices is suicide, The thing stuck in my head right now is â€œDarkness, imprisoning meâ€ I canâ€™t get it out. Example: my sister hit me after telling her â€œexcuse meâ€ so me with my great fucking illness, accidentally drops a 5 pound carton on my foot, making me scream, and I get yelled at for reacting. Meanwhile my sister is comforted. Iâ€™m 13 and my sister is 13. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I saw a bottle of bleach in my house, and got so fucking tempted. Can anyone please help me?
