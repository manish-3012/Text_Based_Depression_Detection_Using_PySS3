I'm to tired to keep going.I don't really want to keep going. I'm tired of dealing with everything. everyone I love has left me alone. I just hurt. nobody talks to me anymore. I don't even know why I have a phone anymore. I am just to tired to try anymore. I gave up a long time ago so a round of applause to everyone who said I would never make it...you were right.
