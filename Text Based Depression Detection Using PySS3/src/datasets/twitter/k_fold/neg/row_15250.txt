How can I leave a positive impact before ending my life?All I want to do in life is make others happy. I really hate myself though, and simply can't put up with living with myself. It's just not possible. I'm thinking of ending my life really soon. About to get what I need for it. Thing is that I'm probably just gonna spontaneously disappear from every community I'm in, and want everyone's last memory of me to be a positive one. How can I make sure that the last thing people hear of me is something good, and that if they think back of me they'll be happy that I was there, and not sad that I'm gone?
