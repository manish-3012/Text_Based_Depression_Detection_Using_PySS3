What do you say when everything's been said?He stopped believing in me. He then stopped believing me. I'm not hurt, I understand. I've been where he is, but I tried. For his sake. I tried my best to pull myself half-assed out of my depression and suicidal thoughts for months, and I kept him afloat too. It worked, for the most part, because I wanted out of it. I started thinking better, doing things I enjoy. I wanted it. I'm still suffering, but not as much.

Now, he's hit rock bottom, and after all the hours I spent typing out these messages, helping him, there's nothing I can say to help him anymore. I know what to say and what not to. I keep neutral, leaning towards positivity. He doesn't need that, he needs the cold, hard truth. That may kill him. I don't know what to do. He's in pain, and I can't help. He's seriously considering suicide and I don't know what else to say to stop him this time. I'm here for him, he can tell me anything, he knows that, but he doesn't want to listen or hear me any more. I don't know what to do. 

What do you say when you've already said everything?
