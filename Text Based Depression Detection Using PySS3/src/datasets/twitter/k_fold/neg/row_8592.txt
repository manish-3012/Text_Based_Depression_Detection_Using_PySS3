I've been suicidal for seven years, I'm sixteen.I never seriously thought about it, until now. My junior year has been one of the worst years of my relatively short life. I lost my girlfriend of 18 months, lost countless friends, all because of my dumb actions. My one friend I lost bullies me daily, and frankly I knew I deserved some of it, but not even close to all of it. I wrote a poem about my rocky breakup, and I got two reactions: overwhelming support from family and close friends, and looks of disgust due to thinking it was self-pity. I got a like on it from my ex, but it was deleted about a week after. I know what I've done to earn lost relationships, but I never learn from my lesson, which is why I'm contemplating ending it all. As the title states I've been suicidal for nearly half of my life. Most of the time I never took any actions to self harm, as I have no cut wounds, no damaged intestines. I feel that if I were to self harm, I would finish the job. I almost succeeded once when I was eleven, but my mom walked in on me attempting. I need help, but I don't know where to begin.
