Work is making me suicidalI have really big problems with anxiety and am miserable 24/7 due to work anxiety. I would rather kill myself than go to work another day. In fact I think about suicide every minute of every day. This morning I almost ran my car into a wall at 60 miles per hour to avoid going in today. It's getting harder to fight suicide at this point. I need the money for rent however and to pay other bills. I also don't want to hurt my wife since my death would devisate her. I don't really know what to do because everything in my life is dependent on me having a job but my life is at risk from the job. Even if I could fight the anxiety long enough to get a new job it wouldn't help, i would  hate that job because of anxiety too. I really don't know what to do and med and doctors have been no help. I really don't think a doctor or medicine changes would help me fast enough at this point. I need advice. Anything.
