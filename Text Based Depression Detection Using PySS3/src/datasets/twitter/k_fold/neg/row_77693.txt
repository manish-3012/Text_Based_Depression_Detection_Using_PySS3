Bye I guessThis is a throwaway account. 

I finally decided I have had enough. my life isn't going to get any better. My grades in uni are disgusting, I'm failing. My depression, anxiety and eating disorder are out of hand. I don't have any friends. My parents are constantly fighting and they never tried to understand what I was going through. I guess this is the end. I'll have to carry on for one more month because I don't have the pills at home. Just one more month and then it'll all be finally over. I don't have will to live anymore too. I'm not happy most of the times too and will be really really happy if I'm finally gone.
