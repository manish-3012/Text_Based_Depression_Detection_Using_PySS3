My parents make me suicidal every day and I canâ€™t leave their houseI feel suicidal every day because of my momâ€™s bitching and my dad being an misogynistic, abusive, and manipulative fuck. He stopped me from buying alcohol because Iâ€™m a â€œChristianâ€ when Iâ€™m not. I canâ€™t leave their house for financial and health reasons yet. Corona is also making it difficult for me to transfer schools without it being online. I got a dog the other day after weeks of trying. I thought I would be happy but I just felt so-so. My parents made me take him back though because he bit both of my parents. Of course, nothing good lasts forever especially for me. Iâ€™ve had shit luck my entire life, from being bullied as a kid to being assaulted and abused by terrible people as an adult. I lied to my therapist that I didnâ€™t have plans of killing myself because I know what the hospitalâ€™s like. And I cut off contact from her. I still have my high school friends but seeing how well theyâ€™re doing and seeing how theyâ€™re friends with the people who bullied me, makes me want to cut them off too. My aunt and grandma and cousin gave me more shit for telling them I was suicidal. And keep telling me that I need to pray more and more bullshit blah blah I donâ€™t have it as bad as them blah blah blah Iâ€™ve been told Iâ€™ve been selfish for being suicidal. Iâ€™ve been thinking of ways to commit suicide lately. I want to go to the ocean and drown. But I read shooting yourself in the head is the most effective and painless way. I am seriously considering buying a gun but Iâ€™m also a coward so. People admit that Iâ€™m fucked and ghost me after I tell them my situation. I hate people who fake sympathize. No one wants to deal with a suicidal person. People donâ€™t owe me shit but they also caused me too much pain. I wish I could be euthanized or something would fall from the sky and kill me.
