I feel like I am doneI must do it becauseI am too lazy for this shitshow called life. I feel exhausted all the time even after doing nothing at all. And by this attitude I am sure I won't be able to reach what I dream for. Even people around me tell me to just do it or stop complaining. Believe me I want it more than anything. God I wish euthanasia was legal in my country so that at least I could die and do one thing in my life peacefully and easily. I am tired being sad and miserable.
