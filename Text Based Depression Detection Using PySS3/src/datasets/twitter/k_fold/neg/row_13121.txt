This is itNo one would care if I killed myself. Truly. I know people have seen the changes in me and my personality. People like to think they know the warning signs of a suicidal person but when they see it they just brush it off. Everyone brushes it off. Everyone brushes me off. And I guess that's fine because I truly just want to kill myself. None of you care. None of you know and I'm positive if you did you wouldn't even like me. I don't like me. I just wasn't meant to live so I guess.. that's it bye
