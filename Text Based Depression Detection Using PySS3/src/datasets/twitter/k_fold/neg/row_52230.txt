"Everyone has suicidal thoughts"My mum confronted me this evening because she noticed I'm going through a bad depressive episode. She seemed hurt that I don't talk to her enough, but equally instead of empathising, which I think is what I need right now, it was "you need to make the changes" (which I know is true), "you can't just lay around all day", and finally "everyone has suicidal thoughts, you gotta get rid of them".

It just all made me feel worse. I came close to ending it all last night and when I told her she didn't even seem that bothered, as if she doesn't actually believe me. Feel so alone in all this and like I have nothing to live for. Am I being overly sensitive? :(
