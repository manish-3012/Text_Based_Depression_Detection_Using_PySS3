My boyfriend died in a crash a month ago, and I want to be reunited with him.     I'm 16 (F) and my BF had just turned 18 before he passed away. This was at the beginning of March, when school was still in session... everything happened so quickly. One hour we were discussing our plans for a future together, telling eachother how much we loved eachother, the next he was missing for a whole night, then in the hospital, then... dead.

     After he died, I was immediately surrounded by family and my BF's friends. I consider myself an introvert, and don't have very many tight friends, or people I'd be willing to spend time with outside of school. During the first two weeks of BF's death, his friends were there for me. to talk, get out of the house, smoke a joint, whatever. but during those first two weeks, it didn't really hit me that he was actually dead. it just felt like (and still does to an extent) he was away on vacation or something, and that he was going to return soon. 

     After those first two weeks, the first quarantine orders for COVID-19 were placed where I live. getting ahold of friends and family became increasingly difficult. people who said that they'd be there for me never responded to my texts. nobody could hang out; everyone was getting quarantined by their parents. I started getting really lonely, wondering in the back of my mind why there wasn't a good morning text from my boyfriend in a while- we always made sure to tell eachother good morning and goodnight. 

     I found myself getting really depressed. every night, I got really panicky because night just didn't feel *right* anymore. before his death, me and my BF would hop on a Discord call almost every night and just talk until we fell asleep...now, silence. it's honestly really scary. 

     Any time I have tried to express my feelings to a friend, they don't know how to be there for me. and that's totally understandable! nobody my age has had their fucking boyfriend die. it's just not something anyone expects to happen, especially not in high school! so, nobody knows what to say to me when I try to pour my feelings out, just to be heard. and that's perfectly okay! I've tried to convey that to my buddies, that it's okay to not understand, and that I just wanted a listening ear. but they felt awkward and distanced themselves from me. just... trying to vent to my friends has not been pleasant. God, I even had one of them say 'I hope this never happens to me'. How insensitive can you get?! 

     Anyways. After attempts to try to share my thoughts, I felt like if I opened up to people more about how I really feel more people would just stop talking to me, and that really hurt. Eventually, i didn't feel safe to go to anybody to talk to. I felt like even  bringing up anything that me and my boyfriend used to like or do together was being an inconvenience for the people around me and I started to feel guilty for being reminded of him where ever I went. 

     Now, all of the people I surrounded myself with before quarantine are busy, or I am afraid to reach out to because I don't want to bother them with how I feel. 

     I feel so alone now. The person that I loved most in the world, the person who loved me the most in the world, is gone. I couldn't talk to anyone else like I could talk to him. we just clicked, and we were perfect for eachother. whenever something happened to either of us, we were each other's support. we always knew how to make eachother happy again. He was my boyfriend, but he was also my best friend. I love him so much. 

     The days don't feel real anymore. I've given up on doing online school at this point. I just want to see him again, to talk to him again, to be held in his arms and loved on again. I've been trying to keep myself busy but the thought "your boyfriend is DEAD" keeps entering my head at the worst times. 

     Everything is so different now. I hate it so much. I want him back. I'd trade the world to be with him again, and I think that one day soon, I WILL go see him. This man gave me so much love and showed me incredible kindness and patience. I just don't believe I'll ever find a love like his in my life again. I'd just end up always comparing future partners to him, because I believe him to be the best for me. and I figure, if there's nobody who will love me as much as he did, then what's the point in staying in this world? I just want him. and I believe that death here would take me back to him... 

if you read through all of this mess, thank you. it's late here so it's all probably pretty jumbled... I don't know whether this was just a vent, or a cry for help, or what. I just wanted someone to hear about what I'm going through, I'm sorry if it's not very articulate. but thank you for reading through this anyways. it means more to me than you know.
