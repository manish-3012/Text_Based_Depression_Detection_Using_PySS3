screw lifeDISCLAIMER - BEFORE YOU WASTE YOUR TIME READING THIS, REALIZE THAT THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE ON THIS SUBREDDIT WHO HAVE MORE URGENT SITUATIONS (ABUSE, PHYSICAL DANGER, PHYSICAL NEGLECT, ETC. I DO NOT FACE ANY OF THESE). HELP/CONSOLE/TALK TO THEM FIRST.

YOU MIGHT WANT TO SKIP TO THE TL;DR SECTION, THE BELOW IS JUST INCOHERENT, PETTY STUFF. THIS WHOLE POST IS PETTY

Anyways, this is going to be very short - if I use any websites like reddit, my parents are going to literally kill me - every extra minute I spend here is more risk to their monitoring stuff... Anyways, the biggest problem is this realization: My life is completely pointless in any "grand scheme", including the current generation. In all of human history, I'm absolutely useless and pointless, and even the human race might not be important, in the end. And there's nothing I can do to change that. So why try anyways? What's the point in life? (yeah this is existential nihilism, but kind of independently "discovered" by me) Secondly, this happens to concide with a few sh!!t\* moments in my life - just completely screwed up the only friendship I had, and my parents are putting \*\*a lot\*\* of paid, enteprise grade monitoring on my computer. Sounds all right, right (for the second part)? Especially given my interests, which most asian parents would approve of - programming, higher mathematics, machine learning, and engineering. However, two things - first of all, my dad's super egotistical and won't accept my ability to learn by myself. Second of all, I'm actually embarrassed to tell them about what I've been doing/reading/practicing.... what if I'm found to be incompetent in those things? what if my egotistical dad does something? etc. So guess what? Now I can't even do "education" things on my computer. I'm not allowed to talk to any other children IRL (asian parents), and there basically are no interesting books in our house. So nothing to do. Great. And this monitoring thing has poisoned the already - distant relationship between my father and I (it used to be just "I don't mind you, and you don't mind me". Now it's almost like hatred. Not to say I'm not thankful of them - they provide for me and all. But the fact that they're constantly stalking me and controlling me makes me \*\*almost\*\* hate them. Or it could just be paranoia at work) Strangely enough, the only time I don't alternate between loneliness &amp; boredom and paranoia (from extreme, beyond stalker level monitoring of everything I do) is at school, which makes sense - everyone complains that the school is stalking you - they're not. Not even close. You have much more freedom, much more social interaction, etc.

Tl;Dr

My life is completely pointless, and I'm just a waste of resources - and will never become useful. Why not just end it?

Yeah I'm anonymous. Obviously.
