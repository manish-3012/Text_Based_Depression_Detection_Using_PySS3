missing assignmentsI have two big projects coming up which I haven't even come close to completing. I've thought about telling my teachers how I can't focus and how depressed I've been over the semester, but what if they don't care? Then again, why should I get an excuse not to do work just because I'm too lazy to get off my ass and do it? Why should I be given a pass?
