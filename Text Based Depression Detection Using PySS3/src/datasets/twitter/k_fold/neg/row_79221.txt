Probably going to kill myself soonRight now I failed to balance a full-time school program and full-time work that would have gaurenteed me a career. So my career is over because I have to move back in with my parents in the Bay where everyone has a college degree and many years of work experience. Meanwhile no one in my field will hire me because they have better candidates. I'm either going to be stuck working 80 hour work weeks, working nights, or having no jobs. Not to also mention all my friends back home moved away. And sadly it doesn't look like there's much in the bay for college students. So really life just isn't worth living anymore
