I have a dilemma, advice?So I have a terrible relationship with my father. I am 21 and still living at home with my parents. I am very ashamed. I did move out last year for around 6 months but came back to study and learn to drive. These options have been thrown out of the window now. I cannot stand to be in this house any longer. I feel sick to my stomach. I don't think I can go another year living here until I finish university. What should I do? I want to leave and be able to relax and get on with my studies elsewhere. I'm losing my mind.
