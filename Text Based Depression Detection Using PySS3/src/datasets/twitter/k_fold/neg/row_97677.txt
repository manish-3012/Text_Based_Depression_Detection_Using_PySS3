i don't know what to dohey, im new as hell to reddit and this is literally just a throwaway acc, but i dont know where else to go and i wanted to just. put one last beg for a reason to stay afloat. 

I've struggled with intense childhood trauma my entire life, stretching up to my teenage years. i'm not really comfortable sharing it but its just. utterly plagued me. im struggling so badly with the hell they call online school rn that i cant even start an assignment without bursting into tears, and self harm and an eating disorder practically controls my life. I'm pretty young but I literally can't even begin to see a future for myself. I used to be a really good student and im not sure what happened, but that's been tossed out the window. all i can think about at this point is if i die i wont have to deal with any of this anymore, and it's just seeming like a pretty attractive option.  Sorry for just dumping a sob story here, i hope someone else finds solace in maybe struggling with the same things i am.
