Drinking Makes me Want to Kill MyselfI often times find myself at home alone while my wife is at work in the evening, sometimes when this happens I will go out to dinner with other friends or family and inevitably have a few drinks.  This is all fine and well when I am around them, but as soon as I am home alone while drunk my thoughts will inevitably, as they are at this moment, turn to the idea of how I can quickly and painlessly kill myself.

I love my wife and my family, but I get so depressed that all I can think about sometimes, especially while drunk, is how the fuck I can end it all with the minimum of pain and suffering so I can just die and not worry about how it may end up feeling painful.

This scare and concerns me, I love my wife and family and don't want to be without them, but I also just want the depression and sadness to be over so I don't have to sit and cry about stuff.
