I feel like I don't deserve to hold onI messed up a while back. I learned my lesson and I have been trying to be a better person and I think I am now. I feel like i've been living for the sole purpose of serving other people, trying to make up for it. Is there anyone here that is also struggling from a mistake they can't forget? I feel very alone and it's getting worse as time passes.
