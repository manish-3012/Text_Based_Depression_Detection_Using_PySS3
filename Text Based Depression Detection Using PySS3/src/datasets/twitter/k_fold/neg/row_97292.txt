I just honestly don't know what to do... I'm so alone, My only friend left my life, and idk how much longer I can hold on. please help if you can...Well guys, this is my second time being on this page. First was a few months ago and was roughly about the same issue. Having a falling out with my best and only friend Jasmine... I tried to kill myself then. It didn't work out to well and I ended up in the mental hospital for about 2 weeks. Honestly, that did help me a lot but idk why but lately everything has just been hitting harder. For awhile I thought I was doing better. I wasn't thinking about her or missing her or anything. But I don't know why but within the past like 2 weeks I can't take my mind off of missing her. I still don't really have any friends. I also work alone. While I have a family they don't much like me so I stay in my room when I am home. This friend I had really was my everything. We talked everyday and hang out normally at least 2 times a week but some weeks we hang out as much as 5 or 6 days. I can honestly say I loved her both as a person but also in the romantic way. but being honest I know I relied on her too much for happiness. For 2 years we were best friends. However, I started to get jealous and needy because she started to ignore me and stuff. I know that was wrong. I wasn't dating her or anything. Even if i was she can talk to whoever she wants. but anyway, on august 4th she couldn't take it anymore and told me basically she didn't want to be friends with me anymore. Because she was my ONLY friend it hit hard. and roughly a week after I tried to kill myself. After I got out of the hospital I honestly, I was still obsessed with her. Because at the time I wasn't just losing a best friend who had told me she'd always be there for me I was losing ALL of my social contact. To be honest, I went a little crazy. I ended up making a fake account to talk to her. While talking to her I asked about myself to see her feelings about me. I did for about two weeks until the guilt got to me and I tried to end the talking to her. I went about it wrong and she found out it was me. Trust me, Looking back I understand why it was weird, creepy, and just plain fucked up. I really cared about this person. I just couldn't let go. I've been going to therapy and it's helped a lot. But that brings me to now. Sadly, I still really care about her. She's said some AWFUL things to me. She's told me she hopes I die, that she hopes I go to jail and get raped, etc. Just stuff I could never wish on another person. She HATES me. I know we will never talk again even if a dumb part at the back of my mind says "well maybe you will one day". I know it's not true. But I still care about her and want the best for her. The last time she messaged me (to try and make me feel bad for what I had done to her) she told me how her life was falling apart. How she was cutting, drinking, doing bad in college, her relationship was doing bad etc. That was like a month ago and I still think about it and worry about her. I have no way to contact her to see if she's okay. She's blocked me on everything. I wish I could just forget about her and move past it. What makes it so hard is not only do I miss her as a person but I miss having a friend. Right now I have no one. I work alone, might as well live alone, and thanks to covid couldn't even go to socialize if I wanted to. I go days without hearing another person. It's all just getting to be so much. I've never felt more alone. I realized in therapy that for awhile I've been pushing people away who care about me. It's part of what makes me even more sad. At the end of the day while our friendship wasn't perfect and she did do some not amazing things I honestly know my actions were the main reason our friendship ended and I even understand why she hates me. I hurt her, I tricked her into talking to me, I basically tried to manipulate her. She has every reason not to talk to me. I just... I just don't know what to do from here on. I'm thinking about her a lot, just wishing I knew how she was. I told her before we stopped talking if she ever really needed someone to talk to i'd be here for her but she told me to go fuck myself. So I can't get her off my mind, I miss her, I really truly still care for her and wish her the best, but i'm so fucking alone and depressed. I'd give anything just to go back and be a better person. I know she deserved it but now I gotta live witht he fact one of the nicest, kindest people I've ever met who for most of our friendship really cared about me, she even said she loved me hates me so much now.... I just don't know how long I can keep going on like this but I know I won't be able to last much longer.
