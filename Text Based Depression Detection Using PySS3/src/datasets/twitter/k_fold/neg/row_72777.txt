I've been thinking it over. there is really no sensible alternative to suicide for me.I don't like working. I don't like having to interact with others. I don't even like being near another human. I don't like having to do physical stuff. I don't like myself. I have no worthwhile capacities. And am outdone by nearly anyone in any field.

 In fact it would probably be faster to list things that I like about the world other than things that I dislike. There really is nothing. Come to think of it.

There is no way for me to function whatsoever on this planet. That's why I was bullied endlessly for nearly a decade, but whatever, I deserved it. Most people who get bullied do.

I've considered the prospect of things improving over the course of time. But the truth is. That isn't even close to enough to make me stay. It's a fucking delusion, is what it is. It isn't going to improve if I don't put work into it. And I honestly don't give a shit. So it's just going to get worse. Because there are thousands of ways something can go wrong. And exactly only one way it can go right. Out of sheer luck. So. Statistics aren't on my side. And I'm not even talking about my own personal life. As I have basically none. I'm talking about professional stuff. I have no interest in working. So I can put food on my plate so I can work some more. My major was stupidly chosen and has no interesting outcomes. 

This isn't some sort of "on the whim" decision. It has been in the making for years. I have kept it to myself. Ensuring that no one has the slightest chance to stop me. Because that would be moronic.

I'll be better off without the Earth and vice versa. So. Unless I've missed a crucial point. Which is why I'm posting here. The decision is already made. At any rate it wasn't a pleasure knowing you.
