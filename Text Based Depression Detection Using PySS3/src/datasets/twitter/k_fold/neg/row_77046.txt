I don't think I would write a note.I would probably just leave and disappear.  The human language is so broken and any attempt at logically presenting how I feel is impossible to someone who hasn't been there, and those who have would understand.  What I would like to do is write a book, I have several stories I;ve always wanted to write.  So that I can really delve deep in to my depression nearly to the point of psychosis, reveal it from the inside and all the thoughts that modern man is too afraid to really believe about themselves and society, a beautifully depressing novel about myself through the interpretation of characters I have spent years creating.  But I don't have the energy to write that book... These characters will die with me.
