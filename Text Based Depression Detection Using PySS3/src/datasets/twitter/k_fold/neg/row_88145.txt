Crisis Lines experiencesHi, Iâ€™ve always had terrible experiences with hotlines, ours is awful, and Iâ€™ve been talking to my therapist about the possibility of starting our own local one. I wonder if itâ€™s okay to post a Google Forms survey about peopleâ€™s past experiences with hotlines here, with totally anonymous answers so we can see whatâ€™s most important for callers. I know what matters to *me* but I canâ€™t base a whole idea of my sole feelings. Thanks.
