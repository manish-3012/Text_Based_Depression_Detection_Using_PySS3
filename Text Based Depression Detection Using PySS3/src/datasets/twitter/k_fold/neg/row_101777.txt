cant go back to school again i failed (college) multiple courses (4/6) and i just cant but im getting preasure to go, i just wanna die, i cant deal with it, im so alone i look horrible (quar's fault tho) and:i bully myself all the time and all i can do is just play games or whatever to avoid it. i know i deserve better but i always tell myself i deserve worse, i tell myself im completely worthless and im just less, im constantly working against myself, trying to push myself into dying and it comes so close to working only for me to get scared and stop myself. i m starting to reverse everything, rather than, whether i wanted to or not, knowing i needed to get better, i now "know" i need to just rip off the bandaid and die.
