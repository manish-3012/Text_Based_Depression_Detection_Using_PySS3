I used to consider myself patient..I'm 20 years old and already at my wit's end, I'm contemplating suicide every couple of minutes,and every time I try to wriggle out of that mindset I get thrown back into it because of how limited my options are,I have no options.

I've been anti-social my entire life, my mother was trying to change that when she was alive but she was taken away by illness when I was 13, ever since then my life has been gradually falling apart, I did nothing but stay at home and play games, I didn't even play games for the enjoyment, just for killing time, my school performance was going down hill, I flunked two years of highschool, I made it afterwards by entering private school, which in my country is paying money for a free graduation.

but then two friends who've been stalking me managed to dig me out of my misery, they stayed by me until they rubbed off on me in a positive way, I don't have either of them now,and it's devastating, I get flashbacks of all the good times we used to have and I feel so bitter about it all.

my family hates me  to, every one makes me feel like I'm the scum of the earth and even through I try to change that, I can't seem to satisfy anyone.

I talk to myself a lot because that's all I have, I mumble at times, sometimes even do it in public, I can't control it, I have to talk to myself or I become really anxious.

I used to boast about how strong willed I was between myself and I, now I'm so impatient and unsteady, I have no reason to live,
I had planned to kill myself via medication overdose in an old abandoned construction site, but my emotions got the better of me, I couldn't do it, and I feel even more miserable and useless now.
