Is it okay if someone will talk to me? (Trigger warning)Please, i just want someone to hear me. Im hurting so badly and i cant see any other way out. I have anxiety PTSD and severe depression (all clinically diagnosed). I dont see the point of living anymore. I hate myself. I hate how i look. I hate who i am. I want to rip myself to shreds. Im sorry if this sounds weird ive been crying for a while and dont know what im saying really. I just really want someone to talk to and i didnt know where else to go. Im sorry everyone. I hope the rest of you are okay
