Guys I need your help, I'm about to end my life...I can't live anymore...

I'm 17 years old, and I live with my parents because I'm a minor, but when it comes to my dad he's just such an evil guy, I can't say all the bad things that he has done to me, but one of the worst things he did to me, was when i got into a little fight with him, and I wasn't even trying to harm him but he was so angry and mad that he suddenly grabbed a knife and stabbed me in my thigh, but it doesn't stop there he let me bleed and didn't help me at all he didn't call the ambulance either I was the one who did, it was like he didn't care at all.

And he's been bullying me since the day i was born (Physically and mentally)

So please I need an advice... before I end my fucking life...

I'm really sick of this shit
