I'm begging. Please help me I have nothing to live for.The only person I have a solid connection with was my boyfriend and he's just hurt me so badly tonight I see no other path. I just want to die. I'm hurting so badly it's crippling. I can't even see properly it's just tears streaming down my face. I just want to jump in front of traffic. I want to die or fall asleep and just never wake up.
