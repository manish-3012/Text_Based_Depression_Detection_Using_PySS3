BlehI don't have worth, I don't have a purpose, I deserve to be taken, maimed, abused verbally, mentally and physically and to have my corpse left mangled in a shallow grave where noone finds me. Noone should have a funeral for me. Taking me out of society would be doing the world a favor and I don't deserve people feeling sad or feeling pity for me. I'd rather them think I'm elsewhere in the world doing something to fulfill my dreams than them just weep over some rotten corpse. Nothing I do matters and I do nothing for society. I deserve to go out slowly and painfully.
