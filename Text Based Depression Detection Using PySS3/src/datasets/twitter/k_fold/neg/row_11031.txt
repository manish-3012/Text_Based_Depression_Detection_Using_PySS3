Suicidal, but too scared to actually do itI have been depressed for the past year or so and it sometimes gets better but when it gets bad it gets really bad and gets me thinking about my suicide. I'm a coward otherwise i would've done it a while ago. I am a disappointed to my family and it keeps getting worse and i'm trying my best to live with it
