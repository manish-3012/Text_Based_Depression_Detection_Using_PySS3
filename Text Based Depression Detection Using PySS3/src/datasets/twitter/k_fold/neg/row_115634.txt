I had a suicide plan and I need help in a new oneSo I had a suicide plan, I had money saved for a roadtrip and then I'd suicide far away from home because I didn't want to fuck up my brother if he is the one to find me dead. Not a lot of money because I am an artist, so it was just sufficient to die in style (yeah Im this stupid and that's why I wanna die in the first place).

Anyway, I spent all my money moving from my hometown, trying a last time for a new job and life. I got this amazing experience, but I guess it is going to nowhere. Also I am so pathetic, I fell in love with my boss (stupid af but not surprised because I am pathetic) - it never happened before,  I already have a long-term relationship but I am super duper faithful and will never cheat on my bf, even if we are fighting and stuff since october. To be fair my bf started being impotent, and lost interest in me.. And even if he denies it, I am pretty sure his problems only exists because of me, but he is so accommodated with his whole life (he makes a lot of money still live with his parents) that he doesn't want to think about it, about our problems. Every time we talk feels like I'm wasting his time with my boredomness (which may be true I guess).. 

Anyway I am so so soo needy that I felt in love with my boss because he was trully interested in me (but not in a lover way, only professionally).

I am only explaining this because I am like this, but I was a suicidal before, I tried with 15, and now 11 years later my life is not solved. I'm not planning on suicide because my BF or my boss, it is because I can't take more shit from life. I would accept marrying my bf who clearly doesn't love me anymore just not to be alone, but that changes everything and also he doesn't deserve this. I don't wanna fuck up more people.

As I said, I had all this thing planned before leaving to the new job, and things are getting more and more complicated, and I am really tired of living.

My family also never cares for what I'm doing or wanting to do, they just call me to talk about their own problems. It is not like they care if I die or not. My dad passed away in my birthday long time ago, and I am sure they can deal with my death. My mom only worries about money and she is helping me right now. So.

Anyway, I just want an opinion. I will wait till my next birthday (I'm kind of a romantic, so I want it to end the day it began). I'm so tired to hear about god, god never made anything for me.

I was always a fucking nerd and aside for the time I was bullied in school, I loved and lived to learn. I'm super responsible and have no debts and nothing to care about. The bank keep offering money to me, and as I am kind of needy now, I'm thinking to accept, make my roadtrip and die in style. But my morals are screaming inside me, I really don't want to leave debts to my family. I wanna die as if I was a bad dream inside everyone's head, because that's what I feel I am from the very last day I was born. Do you have any tips for dying without pain? I don't have a car, a gun or an oven. I can get methane, it is pretty easy here where I live. Pills are off topic because I'm not the one people would say is a suicidal, I'm also a hell of an actor, so I'm looking forward to die in cheap and painless ways. If I can't achieve it, I will sure go for the loan in the bank and then will be my family's problem to pay for it.. 

Disclaimer: The funny thing is, nobody have a clue that I'm dying inside, because I'm usually that funny friend. So if you really like this person of your group, pay attention. 
Also I don't want help and anything.. I can't take it anymore, and I also can't talk to anyone, everybody seem so tired of my fucking drama (even me ahaha). 
Btw I can keep chatting to you because I'm really talkative, not that will change my plans.. (Even because my birthday is only in a few months).
