I don't want to die but I'm too tired to keep strugglingThe title says it all. All my life, i've been struggling to make ends meet. I'm from a poor family in a certain third-world country. Since I was little, I knew that I need to break away from the poverty, that I need to make my parents proud of me despite the circumstances I was born into. Fast forward 24 years later, I'm now studying in a local university. I'm now/was a rock that supports my friends, helping them any way I can, caring for them. I have/had a loving girlfriend. Everyone believes that I can persevere. I never had many friends, I never used any social apps.  Then, one month before,I had an argument with my girlfriend. Little did I know, it would come and bite me in the rear later than sooner. Three days ago, I was having my final exam for the semester when the combinations of loneliness due to her absence in my life, the fatigue from boxing, the stress from the papers yet to come and the anger and dissatisfaction from seeing all my friends, the ones that came to depend on me when things get rough, playing games and generally being rowdy, hit me in the face. Overcame by those feelings, I retreated into solitary. At first, my friends came to check on me but as time passed by and my reluctance to say anything in fear of them ridiculing me for thinking about those feelings, they started to isolate me in turn. Even not talking to me the day they went back to their respective hometowns. At first, I blamed them for abandoning me but as the smoke cleared out, I realized that I brought all of these to myself. I blame myself and it feels right. The only reasons I'm still struggling and haven't commit suicide are the thoughts of disappointing my parents and my passion for boxing. Sorry for the long post/rant. I just needed to vent everything out of me.

Tldr: I want to live but I'm slowly losing all the reasons to.
