I'm just waiting for a good time at this point I guessI just turned 20 recently, I always thought I'd have ended my life before seeing 20. I've had a suicide plan for the past 3 years and I have been ready. Theres nothing in my life that's really motivating to continue living with the pain that comes in waves along with the constant numbness. I'm not here for any kind of purpose, I'm just alive. The only thing from keeping me from ending my pain is the thought of putting it onto the ones who have grown close to me. I sometimes wish I hadn't built any kind of relationship with anyone for the purpose of killing myself without anybody being hurt. I wish they would know that this is what I truly want. I want to be nonexistent and erase myself from the world.
