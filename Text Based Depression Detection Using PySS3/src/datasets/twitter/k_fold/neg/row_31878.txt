I canâ€™t even escape this world successfully, Iâ€™m just stuck here until Iâ€™m oldThis is hell. I canâ€™t leave this world. Itâ€™s never going to get better. Iâ€™m never going to be normal. My whole life I have been different and odd. I hate it. Iâ€™m always the odd one out. I just want to be like everyone else. I just want to be able to talk to people normally, and not break down every time I go outside. WHY WAS I BORN THIS FUCKING WAY. I hate myself so much. Why wasnâ€™t I born normal.
