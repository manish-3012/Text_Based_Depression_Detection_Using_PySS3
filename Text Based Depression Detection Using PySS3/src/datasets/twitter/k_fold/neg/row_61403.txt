I missed an event that I was looking forward to for years and am contemplating suicideSo this event was happening today in NYC that I've wanted to go to for years.  It happens every year but I've been living abroad so I couldn't go.  I was really so excited to go this year but somehow I got the weekends mixed up and I just found out that it was today and I missed it.  I've been contemplating killing myself for the past two hours after finding out.  One of the reasons I moved to NYC was because I wanted to go to this event. I just moved here I feel like a failure for missing it and I'm really ashamed to admit to my friend that I missed it even thought they reminded me to go three weeks ago.

I've been trying to find a therapist in NYC and if anyone has any recommendations on how to go about it please tell me. I live in Brooklyn. And I can't contact my PCP because I don't have one.

Also I know I need a therapist but every time I feel fine I convince myself that I don't or that I'm overreacting or that I will waste the therapists time.  I was in therapy three years ago and I felt like I was wasting her time.
