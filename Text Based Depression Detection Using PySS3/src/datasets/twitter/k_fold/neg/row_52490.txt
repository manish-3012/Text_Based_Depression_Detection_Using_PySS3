Iâ€™m very scared of dying, but I know my fictional desired life will never be real.I donâ€™t want to die, I have to die. Iâ€™m running out of savings, my grandma is dying and sheâ€™s the only family I love, Iâ€™m gay and my parents are gonna disown me, I canâ€™t find a job despite a 4.0 College gpa, it has been a year. Whenever I attempt suicide I always say â€œI donâ€™t wanna die, I wanna try again,â€ but then I try again and my life still sucks and my family still sucks and itâ€™s all fiction. The things I dream aboutâ€” my career, having a gfâ€” will never exist. They wonâ€™t. Everyone hates me. I have no option except to kill myself but I donâ€™t want to. But I am not about to be homeless so I have to. If I donâ€™t get the job I interviewed for next week I will jump off a bridge near my apartment. I donâ€™t care who has to clean it out. Iâ€™m tired, and Iâ€™m sick of living to entertain others.
