Never felt more close to suicide in my life.I have bipolar, and about a week ago I lost everything I had going for me after a manic bender gone south. 

I should have had control. I should have taken my medication correctly. I shouldâ€™ve taken it consistently. 

The fact is that Iâ€™ve done what Iâ€™ve done and now Iâ€™ve lost any friends, my boyfriend, and basically my home. 

My stepdad died last December, and all I want is for him to hug me and tell me Iâ€™ll be okay but heâ€™s not here and Iâ€™ve had an anxiety attack every day for a week because Iâ€™m so close to killing myself. The Xanax helps for maybe a few hours, but I donâ€™t want to take it because it feels like I deserve this pain. 

And itâ€™s fucked up because Iâ€™m so depressed specifically at my mom and sister because theyâ€™re why I canâ€™t kill myself, I could never do that to them when weâ€™ve already lost one member of the family. 

I just want to disappear. Iâ€™ve never been more low.
