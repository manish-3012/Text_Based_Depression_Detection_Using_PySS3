Update for all, the owner of this account has passed on.I'm his co-worker. The police called me this morning and told me to come over to his apartment. I guess he left a note with my name and number on it for them. I'm really sorry if anyone on here was close with him. The police checked through his messages and such, he removed the lock on his phone, I think he intended them to check. They didn't find anything but support messages, so I want to thank you all for trying to help. He was a good man, and I'll miss him a lot. Out of respect for him, I think im going to just leave his account alone.
