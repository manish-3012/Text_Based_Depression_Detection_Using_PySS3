I fucked up again and now I want to die.I had a second chance with the person I love more than anything. But I couldnâ€™t trust her and let my pettiness and anger take hold of me. I canâ€™t believe what I done to hurt her. I want nothing in the world but to make it up to her. Iâ€™d give the fucking world to her. I know I can be a bigger person, but I canâ€™t live with the nasty, horrible things I said. Iâ€™m so attached to this person. Every time I lose her I just die. I am empty and nothing without her.
