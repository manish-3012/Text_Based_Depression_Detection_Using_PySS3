Read this :)Hey. I'm Rusty, I just wanted to stop by and tell you guys that it got better for me. I struggled alot but in the end I decided to just push myself as hard as I could and it worked for me. I'm not here to tell you that's what's gonna improve your situation. I'm just here to say anything is possible. Whether it happens randomly or whether you took a chance.

I just wanna say that you guys can do it. Take it a day at a time. I know some of you lie in bed for hours and struggle with just getting up. It's okay, just try to eat and drink water. Take care of yourself and your family. I know sometimes family isn't the best but just do what you'd want others to do to you. 

Love you guys, I know this maybe isn't the best way to convey what I really want to say but hopefully I at least distracted you for a second or two. Life changes. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I hope you stay with us and I hope everything improves for you.
