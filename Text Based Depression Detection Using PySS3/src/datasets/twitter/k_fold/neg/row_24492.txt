I feel so ungrateful for wanting to die even though im not considered in a lower position than othersYo reddit ive been lurking on this sub for awhile now and i decided to post today randomly

Basically I'm 13 now and Ive had suicidal thoughts for a 2-3 years now and i attempted suicide on 27 october.

There are a bunch of reasons why I want to die with some of them being obvious and some them being really weird and hard to explain but I honestly feel that yall make feel like im ungrateful since ive not experience anything that yall would consider super traumatic, plus i have a semi loving family, a healthy body and a couple of close friends in school

i hate that even though ive not had any particular stressors in my life other than a somewhat verbally abusive mother and a pretty lonely childhood and i hate that even though i know people care for me and want me to live i dont understand why? like why they would even care for a piece of shit like me and everytime i face a mildly hard issue i just instantly consider suicide 

its disgusting how simultaneously care about people but at them same time hate them too its very confusing and stressful and i feel that suicide is just a fast way to end my suffering and everything and rest forever

ok thank you for coming to my ted talk
