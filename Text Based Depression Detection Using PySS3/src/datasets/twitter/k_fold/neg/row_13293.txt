I Never Knew Loneliness Could Become So SevereEven when I'm surrounded by others, I feel this intense sadness. I feel like it's my destiny to kill myself. Wow. It's actually palpable, the feeling, when I think this. It feels right. Huh. I know, objectively, it's probably something wrong, I do have dysthymia after all, but it just feels correct, when I think it. Like a poignant little thing. I feel like I am a burden on my family and my school. I know my family loves me, but I can't feel their love. It's like a fog, a barrier. I sometimes think they are lying, which is awful. I'm terrified.
