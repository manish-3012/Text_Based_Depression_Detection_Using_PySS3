I was 5150'd against my willI called the crisis line regularly after I discovered it. I have a lot of issues and I haven't had consistent therapy in like 10 years. It was a sort of stop gap for my issues. A lot of the time, I just need to talk to someone to get some feelings out.

About three years ago, I called the crisis line to ask for help. I was having a really rough bout of depression, and it was apparently so bad that they called the cops on me. I tried to refuse, but they declared me a danger to myself and took me away. 

My experience wasn't close to the worst, but it was awkward and awful in its own way. The EMTs were really nice, but it was clear that the nurse thought I was wasting her time. She left a HUGE bruise on the blood draw.

Anyway, the point is, I can't call the crisis line anymore. Every time I try, I start panicking. Now I am stuck. Whenever I am deeply depressed and just want to talk, there is no one to. I have no support in my friends or family.

I am not denying the threat that suicidal ideation is, I just want to be able to talk to someone who won't throw me in the ER against my will. There is no way to tell them, "Yes, I'm suicidal, but don't commit me, please."

I can't afford to go to the ER, either monetarily or time wise, but I need to talk. Advice?
