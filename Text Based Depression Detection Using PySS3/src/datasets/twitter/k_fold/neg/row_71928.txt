its not worth the suffering anymoreeveryone tells me to look at the beautiful things around me and see that I am loved and have a good life. I am able to see all that is good and it just makes me feel fucking guilty for truly believing that all I am suffering through just isn't worth it. I have been carrying my suicide note around in my purse because I haven't known for sure when it would happen. it's any time now. I don't even want to try holding on anymore. no amount of talk down or reasoning is going to talk me out of it this time. my mind is made up I just need to grow a pair of balls
