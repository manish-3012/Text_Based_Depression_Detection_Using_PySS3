I will be ending my life this winter.I've thought about it long and hard. I've thought about it during my deepest, darkest times, and the times that others would call me normal. It's my best option.

Everything I am is a mistake. I could never be anything anyone else wants me to be, and I've never wanted anything for myself. I've just tried to stay out of the way and pretend to be whatever anyone wanted me to be. Anything I could ever want is forever beyond my reach, and so now I want the only thing I can have: death.

I choose winter because I like the snow and cold. After we get a good layer of snow, I'll wander off in the woods with a knife and do it.
