I just don't know what to do anymore.I just have no idea what should I do anymore, my life sucks, and as time goes by, it just getting worse and worse.
My parents are basically encountered in my life compared to my friends', but in my culture it is taboo to talk about "these thing" (depression, suicidal thoughts, etc). I don't have anyone to talk to anymore.

Everything I did this year seems to be failed and wrong. I felt that I'm now just a piece of worthless shit that anyone won't to take care of. And the most frustrating and depressing thing for me is poverty, I live in a poor family, and I can't do shit to fix it. I'm jealous to my friends who have good stuff that I wouldn't have in my entire life. And school and environment, I'm forced to be someone who I'm not, I'm forced to learn something that I have no passion of (religion subject). I'm planning to tell my parents about this, but I just can't.

I used to had someone I could to talk to; my girlfriend, but she just left me like four months ago, because I was too "over-possessive". I had a bad habit, when I'm frustrated or depressed, I just randomly throw off my stuff and punching wall. Playing games that should "refreshes" me from my real life condition doesn't work, they just made it worse. Problems and troubles keep passing by, and I'm tired of it, I really am, I just wish to end this misery. I'm trying to be a "normal" teenager in my age, but I couldn't stop thinking about my life, and it sucks, I keep asking my self, "they (normal teenagers) don't give a fuck about their life and just enjoy it, why I can't?". I don't know, it seems life always punch me in the face for no reason.

Few months ago until now, I had thought about killing myself, but I just don't have balls for it, BUT someday if I had reached my limit, I'll just do it. I'm an agnostic, but everyday I just pray to God to take my life or put me in a scene where I'm actually dead.

PS: sorry for my terrible grammar and English.
