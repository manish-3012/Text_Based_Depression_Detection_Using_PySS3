I don't know what's wrong with me...Hey everyone, I think I should type this out, but I don't want to waste anyone's time. So you don't have to read this... 

Well, like the title says, I don't know what's wrong with me. I'm going downhill, and I'm not improving, but I guess it doesn't matter anymore. I'm a disappointment to my family and friends, I'm not myself and I'm a burden to my family. 

Also, no matter what, I still do stupid mistakes which could have been a disaster. I want to improve and be a better person, but maybe I just don't care anymore or myself. 

I don't look after myself either and I don't know why. 

I've been through a lot, and I should have died many times, but I survived. 

Thanks for reading, and I appreciate that. 

Goodbye
