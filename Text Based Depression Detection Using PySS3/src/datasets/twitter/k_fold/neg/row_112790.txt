A goodbyeTell me if you think this is true this is how I fee,l I feel that no one in the world is truly suicidal what suicidal people want is all their problems gone and and we can't see any way to fix those problems so killing ourselves is the next best option after having all of our problems fixed.

myself personally I've always felt that I could never fix my problems because my problems don't like such an ingrained parts of who I am that it's just impossible for me to change that and I truly feel like I'm just a lazy person I don't have it in me to put in the effort required to fix some of these things, you always hear people saying all you have to do is work hard or try hard focus hard to fix this problem but I mean if some people can focus hard and try hard some people can't right it's just the way the world works I believe I'm one of those people that cant

I am in a really weird spot right now because I just got a job as an apprentice plumber which is what I was looking for it's about as good as I can ever hope to do my problem is to ever make anything of that I have to go back to school and I just don't feel capable of performing in school I can't study I can't pass test and if it just results in another failure that will just bring me closer to suicide is every failure brings me closer as I feel like I've only had failures and not successes.

On top of that I discovered that I have a lump under my ear and I've gone through stages I have an ear infection so I thought that it was just part of that and then four months later it's still not gone so I went to the hospital for it the doctor seemed very concerned did a bunch of tests and is now referring to a specialist which which I have to wait a month to see and all my life it seems like any time anything goes right I e me getting this job something goes wrong it's just that always happens there's no such thing as good without bad to balance it out it's just I know it sounds like nonsense and it probably is but it just that's the way my life has worked since the start So

I've always felt like suicide is my one option that keeps me happy because I know no matter how bad everything gets I can just go to into nothingness and then nothing is there's no happy there's no sad there's no bad of any kind there's just nothing for eternity and when everything is bad isn't nothing better than bad for me it seems like it is
