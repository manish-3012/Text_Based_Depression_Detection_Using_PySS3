Thailand Suicide Holiday Update - Back in EnglandWell what can I say, I was in Thailand for almost 2 months, and to be honest I was having too much of a good time to want to die, my life in Thailand is fine, my life in England sucks. When Iâ€™m in Thailand I want to live, when Iâ€™m in England I want to die. In Thailand Iâ€™m somebody, in England Iâ€™m a nobody.

Anyway, I somehow ended up losing my wallet, which contained my bank card and money, I had to block my debit card, and the bank couldnâ€™t send me a new card.

Long story short, I contacted my mother and she booked a flight to England for me. Now Iâ€™m here and it sucks, Iâ€™m back to being a nobody and Iâ€™m unemployed, 27 and living at the parents. I also told her about my suicidal thoughts. She will talk with me tonight.

I will have my new bank card in 5 days and I still have about 1000 in the bank.
Iâ€™m slightly tempted to go back to Thailand and really try and end my life there, they have a gun shooting range, I could just shoot myself, no guns in England. 
Or I can look for a job and try and give life one last chance, Iâ€™ve already applied for a job online, I do miss working in the kitchen and being busy and having a income, I deeply regret quitting my job to run away and die. I let my emotions control me.  

If I canâ€™t get a decent paid kitchen job soon Iâ€™ll just get more and more low and suicidal. I hate living with family, I like to be alone and take care of myself. Will update you all on my life in the near future.
