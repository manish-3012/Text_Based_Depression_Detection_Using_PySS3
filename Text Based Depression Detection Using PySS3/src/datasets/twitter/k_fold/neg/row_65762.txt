last shotMy boss today told me he was limited in what he could do with my salary.  Though, I got a rave performance review.  It's all a ruse.  I'm $20k/yr underpaid at this point and lost 5/12 days of vacation last year.  I have strict restrictions on my travel, so now that my last friend screwed me over on my planned vacation last week, I'm basically unable to take time off. 

I'm going to tell them tomorrow that my salary is ridiculous.

I'm going to go I my doctors and tell them that it's ridiculous that they still can't tell me what's causing my double vision after four years.  

I expect them to continue being unhelpful.  After that I am done.  I've been dragging this on for too long.  Everyone here is working against me.
