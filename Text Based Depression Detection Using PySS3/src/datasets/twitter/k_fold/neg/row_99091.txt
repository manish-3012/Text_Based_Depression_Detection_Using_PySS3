I'm shaking..The urge to purchase a fire arm is very intense right now. I'm having trouble staying focused on anything else. I want so badly to end myself. I don't care if potentially some day, things may get better.
.. I've been told that for years.. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of how cruel and unfair this place can be. 
My dreams are not worth waking up for, anymore.
