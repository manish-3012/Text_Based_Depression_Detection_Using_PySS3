Not sure when but i know i will have tooI have been up and down about following throught with my "Plans" to leave this burning pile of garbage we call earth for the past few years now. I have way to much baggage to drag out on this form so keep i will it short and sweet  I am a divorcee at the age of 26 was just finalized this past March the 11th to be exact upon receiving my divorce papers my recently discovered lesbian ex-wife got everything she wanted in the divorce and buried me in the debt from the court fees and cost her lawyer fees, my lawyer fees amongst many other things on top of all that I no longer have any rights to my children unless I go through her. I do mean it to the T when i say i have to go through her because the courts allowed her to write her own "Parenting Plan" so now the only time i can call my kids via cell phone is during the times they are at school or when they are in bed for the night. I now know that she just used me to have kids and hide behind me while she was to afraid to come out of the closet, so for the ten years we were together (on again, off again) i was nothing more than a fool trying to figure out why i couldn't get our "Love" to align the right way. I have not seen my kids in months now, i left a well paying job (which required travel that i loved) because she constantly bashed me "for never being home" and always throwing the kids in my face and now i have been unemployed and looking for work since Nov 21st 2018 and since have lost my license do the back child support and now I'm pretty sure my child support debt is costing me job opportunities because I've been applying to jobs that I know I'm more than qualified for and I never hear anything back. I have found a girl in this time frame that i know does love me but i can't support her financially and she has so much going for her in her life that i am nothing more than a burden on her life, career and financials. Oh and i did get one of the cars in the divorce but while we were still married (but separated and going through the divorce) she took out a title loan, never paid it and now it is at a balance of $1,100 that i cannot pay and now has expired tags that i cannot renew. 

So please someone show me where i am going to see this supposed better part of life because i am only seeing the U.S. government is allowing this dyke to fuck me anyway she wants while taking 50% of my paycheck and now i only have one option.
