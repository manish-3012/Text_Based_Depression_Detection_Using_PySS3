I hope youâ€™re all happyAny time I need any sort of emotional support, people just shove me off to someone else. Nobody wants to deal with me or actually help me, even the fucking suicide hotline people. Itâ€™s always â€œgo see a therapist and get on medicationâ€ which yes that can help, but whatever happened to showing a little actual compassion? Nobody ever fucking listened to when I called out for help or showed the slightest bit of care, and now Iâ€™m going to fucking kill myself because itâ€™s very clear that Iâ€™m not worth it. Bye yâ€™all, I hope youâ€™ll all be finally happy once Iâ€™m gone or good.
