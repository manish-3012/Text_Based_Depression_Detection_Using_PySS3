Please helpThis is my first time ever posting anywhere.... I literally don't know what else to do.... I lived in a caribbean island, had a good job, an apartment, a nice vehicle, i left that and came to the United states to get married, and that was the worst decision I've ever made in my life...I literally feel like I've married the devil, 24 hr arguing, constant disrespect and degrading and criticism, she bought me some clothes and she took it back and threw them on the ground then made an argument because i was supposed to take them back up and wear them. I am depressed, i went to a psychologist and they said I was severely depressed and recommended a whole host of drugs, i haven't had sex in 3 months because I've lost all interest in it.... I can't even get an erection anymore... I've never been depressed before and i feel like committing suicide all the time. I overstayed on my time and once i leave i probably won't be able to return to the US, she keeps delaying sending in the papers and i had my mother send $2500 and she's holding on to it and not sending in the papers , I made my mother waste money and now i owe her, i am stuck with an extremely crappy wife, if i go back home i have to start from 0 because i dont have nowhere to live, neither a car or a job so i feel stuck here but the time i was given to stay here 6 months to stay here has expired and if i leave i know i won't be able to come back... Inam being controlled and taken advantage of and put down all the time.... I've never felt like suicide before now, ive called the suicide hotline and they weren't much help, i considered going to a gun range and use the gun to kill myself, I've took some pills and it didn't do anything... I don't know what to do, i have now overstayed, no money, no job, awful wife and nothing to go home to... I don't know what to do, someone please help with some advice.... I'll follow thru soon with the suicide.... I just feel like shit
