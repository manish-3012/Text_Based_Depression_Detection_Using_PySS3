Set the day for friday.Well,I'm not sure what to say. This is goodbye. I've used reddit for years now,with different usernames but nonetheless I've gotten lots of support from you all and is like to thank every one of you for not just trying to help me,but others that are struggling as well. You're all great people and I wish you all good luck. 

I'll be committing suicide via partial suspension hanging on friday,most likely 11 or midnight.
