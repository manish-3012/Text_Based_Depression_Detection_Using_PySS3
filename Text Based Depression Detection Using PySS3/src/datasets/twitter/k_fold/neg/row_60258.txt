I really need help, but my mother isn't in a mental state to deal with itI'm a 24 yr old male, fucky mental health since age 13. The last few nights I've thought to myself that I should really go to the ER. I've spent every night for a while now crying and desperately restraining myself from self harm or suicide. However, I feel like if I were to seek help right now, my mom would crumble.

Tomorrow is my mom's best friend's 7 year old daughter's funeral. She died a week ago. My mom has damn near planned the whole funeral and it's breaking her. I feel like if she had to deal with her son's treatment on top of that that it would absolutely destroy her.

I've managed to only do light self harm in the last several months. However, I can't deal and keep everything internalized anymore. I need professional help. I want to die so badly. I'm sick of irrational despair and epileptic seizures. But I can't die because it would hurt tons of people. I'm trying to wait several days until after the funeral so my mom will be emotionally equipped to handle me admitting I'm suicidal, but i'm not sure I can hold out till then.

Thanks for reading, much love.
