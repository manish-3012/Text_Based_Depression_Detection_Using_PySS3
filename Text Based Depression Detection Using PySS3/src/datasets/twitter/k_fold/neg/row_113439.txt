Feeling unwelcome in this worldI broke up with my ex about 2 months ago, and everyday can more or less be a struggle of some kind. Due to circumstances I really can't control right now, I still live with him, much to his displeasure. He resents me a lot on some days. I feel like I can never do anything right anymore with him, even when I try. **Everything I do is wrong.** I feel wrong to even be existing. I feel like no one wants me here. When I wake up in the mornings, I don't even want to be awake. I feel like I barely have anyone who cares for me in this world, and perhaps the people who may care, I push away. I'm really struggling and I have no one to talk to.
