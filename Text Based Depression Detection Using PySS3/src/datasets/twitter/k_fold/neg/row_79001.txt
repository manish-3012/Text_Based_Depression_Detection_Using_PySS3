How I feel...I regret everything I have ever done. I regret not talking to the girl I liked in 5th grade. I regret being a lazy fuck. I regret never being skinny. I regret never being smart. I regret stuttering. I regret being made fun of. I regret not calling my friends. I regret staying home. I regret saying no. I regret acting like myself. I regret quitting my job. I regret my shitty self esteem. I regret being me.

I hate myself but I can't change. Why can't I change? I have always stuttered, always fucked up, always been alone. What is the point of living when I have no memories I cherish and nothing to look forward to? If go on I am just going to end up working at a supermarket the rest of my life.

I would do anything to push the reset button. What if when we die we just go back to the start and get to live them over again? What if I can't change? What if I am like this forever?

I've never loved anything. The world is a cold uncaring place and it doesn't care about me.
