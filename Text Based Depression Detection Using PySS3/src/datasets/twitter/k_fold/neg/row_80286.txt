This is the end. Finally.Please forgive me for not being strong enough. For not  being good enough. I am a failure. A nothing. I'm sorry. I can no longer handle this pain. They say things like these feelings and problems are temporary, but for the past 7 years I have felt severe depression. I don't remember what it feels like to be truly happy. I wish i could be happy. But it seems to never be there. So many people have contributed to this feeling. And they don't care. How can somebody be so okay with that? How can they live with themselves knowing they made someone so sad he can hardly function? Maybe they will understand when I'm gone. When they realize they were the reason a young adult took his life. This is my fate. And it exists only because I let it. But this time, I'm taking control and stopping it. No longer will I feel this sadness. It will not control me. The bullet that passes through my brain will be the release. Will be my high. I need to end my own life before I end someone else's. My mind is telling me end my own and others. Different voices. Different tones. It's getting hard to drain out. I hope they feel my pain. Goodbye.
