Sick of everyone. Sick of life. Sick of nobody giving two damns about me.I have no one. None of my friends care about me. I thought I had a few I could depend on. I guess not. None of them have spoken to me in two months. As soon as I start feeling down, they ignore me. What the hell did I ever do to deserve the crap I get dished out when all I've ever done was be a supportive friend? 

All I want is a friend who cares about me. Screw life. It's not worth it if I have to go through every day alone. I don't expect any responses. I've never gotten any in two months from the people I thought cared about me. Why would complete strangers give a crap about a loser like me?

I can't breathe anymore. My anxiety is crushing me.
