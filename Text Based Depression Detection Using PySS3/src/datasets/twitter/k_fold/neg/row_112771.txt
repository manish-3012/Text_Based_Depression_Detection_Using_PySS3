Need Help - worried for my brother!My older brother has tried to fatally cut himself twice in the last 2 months, I'm (25) supposed to be keeping an eye on him while my mum (who he moved back in with) is away. He wants me to keep our dog over Easter bank holiday weekend, which I agreed to initially (I was so busy and have category 5 man flu, so didn't even think about the implications of leaving him alone after drinking heavily). But I dont' know if I should say I can't. He's been doing better, I think, according to my mum, but shes really not the best person to be living with either, shes a mess with the whole trauma of an unexpected divorce after 30+ years.  


A little backstory, I don't like my brother at all. But I absolutely want to do the right thing, his life is far more important than me disliking him.   


Am I crazy to be so nervous for him I'm worried that he is just trying to be alone to do it again? I know he's an adult and I shouldn't baby him, that would be totally worse - I know that! But drinking + not having any responsibility to care for the dog. I dunno. I wont be able to relax all weekend. He was very vague when I asked if he was going on a hot date (he's been doing the tinder thing - which i totally disagree with) to try and get an idea of what he's up to. I'm just worried.  


I'm very emotionally drained because I had been the punching bag and emotional pawn for my parents divorce which is still ongoing after nearly 2 years and I've just lost my job (actively and frantically looking for a new one, possibly retraining as a doctor, taking online classes to get up to speed) and my body is completely rebelling against me, dry and painful skin all over (been to the doc already). I have no idea what to do - should I say I can't have the dog. It wouldn't really be lying, I have a party to go to Friday night (I don't drink but I'm the designated driver).   


I don't know. Advice would be really helpful!
