Iâ€™m really feeling at the end of my ropesFrankly only am posting here cause I need to tell someone. None of my friends care, no one texts me back within 24 hours, if I ever say anything about my depression it gets ignored or brushed aside, yet Iâ€™m fucking ALWAYS there for them when they have fucking girl issues or something, itâ€™s infuriating. Maybe I sound selfish but I just feel so brushed aside at this point and feel beyond worthless. Like really, does anyone care about me? Anytime I have a big appointment Iâ€™m nervous for, no encouragement or anything. I. Am. Nobody.
