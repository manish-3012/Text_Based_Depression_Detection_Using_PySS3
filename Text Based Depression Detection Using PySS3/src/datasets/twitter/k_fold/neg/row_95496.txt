Iâ€™m trying I really am.Might delete this, might not. Iâ€™m really trying to feel okay. God I really am trying.

All day Iâ€™ve been in a mood, and I finally got over the initial shock and had a good cry. Still feeling like shit. I need to do my college assignments but I canâ€™t stop thinking about her.

God I hate myself. Iâ€™m a dumbass who falls in love so fucking easy and then gets hurt, like I didnâ€™t already subconsciously expect it to happen. The same shit happened several months ago at the beginning of quarantine with someone else entirely.

Why canâ€™t I just fucking Stop. I can hardly breathe when i remember her. 

Iâ€™m way too fucking sensitive. I have so many other things to be grateful for, so why the fuck am I still depressed. I wish I appreciated my life more than I do rn.

Iâ€™m not cut out for life to be honest. I think Iâ€™m still alive out of spite. And for my dog. But even then, heâ€™ll have someone to take care of him. 

Actually Iâ€™m still alive because Iâ€™m a fucking coward. I self harm but I donâ€™t have the balls to cut deeper. Lmfao. 

Gonna sleep this one off. Or not. I donâ€™t know.

This too will pass, I think. I donâ€™t know either.
