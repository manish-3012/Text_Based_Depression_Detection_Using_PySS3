recovery or death?hey all. i posted on here before (you can see it on my profile) and wanted to share that i'm probably going to start on antidepressants in like october which is stil very far away. i hope it helps but i have this double feeling and dont get me wrong i'm glad i have the opportunity to get antidepressants but i also have a double feeling cause as much as i want to be &amp; get better i still have these suicide thoughts everyday and cant stop thinking about wanting to kill myself which makes it so weird thinking about getting better and being happy again. because i want to die and i want to kill myself but i also want to get better but when i think of getting better it feels so weird like i haven't been happy or felt happiness in such a long time and it feels so weird like what if i'm not depressed anymore? then what? i feel like i'll just fall back into depression again:/
