I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meThis whole day has been a disaster and I feel like nothing matters, I go to a Christian school and I honestly feel like God has metaphorically left me on read, like he doesnâ€™t love me as much as others and I am not predestined, my whole life is useless. I never will amount to anything, I hate myself so much. My medicine isnâ€™t doing enough, I just want to die. Nothing matters in the end, we have no true freedom I have been set up to fail the day I was born.  Why does God not love me, maybe there is no God? Does it make a difference? Nihilism might be right... nothing matters with or without me my friends will be fine, Iâ€™m only there to make them laugh, They donâ€™t need me. I am useless and nothing matters. Why have you forsaken me.
