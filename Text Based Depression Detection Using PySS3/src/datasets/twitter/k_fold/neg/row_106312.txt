I just want to be happy again...All I want is a night of tranquility, a moment of joy without a big problem outweighing it, an accomplishment without the "NO. INVALID BECAUSE OF THIS DETAIL, YOU ARE TRASH".

Why can't I actually be worthy of anything? Why can't I be happy with what i am? At this point, all I want is to see a sea of blood, my own blood, if I don't deserve success, why would I deserve life? I lived my best already, I should have died in a car accident a few years back, my life was good before that, now I have nothing but a pile of wasted, problematic time. Never found love, never found an accomplishment and nothing makes me think I will find those things. 

Family looks at me, they think I am supposed to be the best, "Was such an intelligent child, what did I do wrong for it to turn out this way?" -Says my mother in sheer disappointment.- The only sentiment in my heart when thinking about her is debt, she did all she did, just for the "worst" outcome. 

With all those things roaming around my mind, my resolve comes undone, the one objective to keep me going is melting, "to survive." morphs into "run away from everything, abandon it all, including yourself."
