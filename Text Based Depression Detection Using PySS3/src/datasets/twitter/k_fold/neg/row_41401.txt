Need honest answers is this fucked up?So the other night I was drinking with some friends.... Then one of are good friends got really really drunk. He started talking about killing him self and how his parents dont love him etc. After 2-4 hours of talking to him (was a small getty and we are close friends like 6 of us) we all talked to him and no matter what we said he just kept saying he was gonna kill him self this that blah blah blah. The question is so a couple of us thought the best thing to solve this problem was to get him to go to sleep. In a are intoxicated thoughts we thought maybe someone could just knock him out.... So after few minutes of asking are selves do we really want to do this to are friend we came to the conclusion of choking him till he falls asleep. Nothing Serious just so that he could pass out and sleep it off. Mind you hes being wild he keeps getting up and heading the lake (going to drown himself). So in the end we told him look we are gonna choke you till you pass out. Which he agreed yea sure okay. half way of doing so one of are other friends ran over and was like wtf this isnt the right way to handle this. I'm just curious am I a bad friend or was that a bad idea to do something like this? My mind set behind it was if he's let alone he might try to off himself and if i knock him out he would sleep of the drunk and we could talk to him in the morning. Please let me know your honest thoughts and opinions. I just want everyone to know that he's okay and after choking a little the Adrenalin sobered up his body and he was doing alot better and was being to snap back into reality. He's fine and told us "I know i said alot of crazy shit last night but i was just really really drunk, I'm not gonna kill myself idk why I was saying that shit im fine and if i need anything ill come to you guys".

Please leave your honest thoughts and opinions please no trolls im really tryna figure out if im the fucked up one for thinking the way i did.
