I just want to check out.I have no poetic way to say this:  I don't really see the point in living anymore.

I have nothing.  I'm unemployed, I'm in debt, and I've run out of money.  I have no food left, and I can't even feed my pets.  Since I lost my job in July, I also have no health insurance, and so no access to my meds.

The only job I have any chance of getting is yet another minimum-wage waitressing job, and I honestly can't be bothered to deal with this shit anymore.  Anytime it gets better, it's just temporary.  I've spent so many weeks of my life at home in bed, and I'm sick of it.

I don't even feel like I'm sick this time.  I honestly think the best solution would be to just check-out.
