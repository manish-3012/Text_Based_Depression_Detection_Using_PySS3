I think I'm going to try it tomorrowBackground: this isn't my first rodeo. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and 14 years later they're coming up again, louder than ever.

When I heard about Chester Bennington and his history of abuse I learned that we were victimized at the same ages. His music was life support when I was young, and I can't shake the idea that this is just what happens when your life was too hard to deal with as a kid. I have 3 degrees in psychology but still can't get this to stop. And really that's all I want at this point, not to be stuck in this body and mind anymore.

I lost my job due to depression, lost my partner for similar reasons, survived a car crash but it fucked with my brain, and that's just the past 2 years. I haven't been able to pick myself up and find a life worth living. Instead I keep treading water. No matter how many job apps I put out or plans I make for the future, it doesn't pan out. It feels like the end of the road, and all I want is an end to the suffering.

Tomorrow I'm going to a show to see one of my favorite bands. I've been using this show as a reason to hang on for the past couple months -  it's silly, but it's been working. But when it's over, there's not a whole lot else to keep me here and I figure if I'm still unhappy at the end of the night then what the hell is the point of holding on.

If it comes to that tomorrow night, I'm going to try hanging myself with a bedsheet slip knotted to the doorknob, thrown over top and slip knotted again around the neck. I've gotten into the set-up before just to see if it would hold and it does. I worry about my cat since it's just me and her and I don't want to cause her pain not having her owner around (she's very attached). But in the end it's either going to be her or me who goes first...it's inevitable. 

I don't know why I'm telling you any of this. I'm just so alone and it would be good to feel heard, I guess.
