I want to die but I can't right now.I just want this all to be over. I am numb and done with everything in my life. I am a talentless, useless and ridiculously stupid. 

But no. 
I need to help my mom with cooking after her long days at the factory.
I need to listen to my boyfriend vent when he's had a rough day handling mean clients.
I need to help K with school so she doesn't drop out before she accomplishes her dreams. 
I need to de-stress C with her crippling anxiety.
I need to make sure M knows there is someone who will listen to her talk about her deep passion for video games. 
I need to make sure to be there if A feels suicidal again. 

I want to leave. My body is so full of scars I am almost halfway legally dead. Everything is headed that way. But I can't. Not before I know those problems are dealt and done with. Until I know for sure they all are okay, I have to stay here. This is so stupid. But I guess it goes to show you don't need the most honorable reasons to stay.  Idk.
