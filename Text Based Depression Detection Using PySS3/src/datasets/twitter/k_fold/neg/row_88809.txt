I want to die so badly!!!!I've become lost in this world that I'm living in, nothing seems right anymore, everything's wrong and it driving me to the point of where ill go to the top of my apartment building and stand on the edge and I want to jump so fucking badly but I just can't do it and it's so hard not being able to have anyone to talk to. I can't even talk to my gf and that's the worst part about cuz she knows what's wrong with me and she's tried getting help for me but it never seems to help and I just can't take it anymore and so I plan on going out and buying a gun and ending it today.
