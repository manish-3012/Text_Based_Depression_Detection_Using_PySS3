I secretly hope someone shoots me in publicAlways. Whenever I'm outside or maybe even in my home, I always hope someone props up with a sniper outside and takes me out, fast and painless. Like in the movies. But the movies aren't real, and that doesn't happen. I just suffer with these thoughts every second before the day I'll eventually be put down for good. And it can't come fast enough.
