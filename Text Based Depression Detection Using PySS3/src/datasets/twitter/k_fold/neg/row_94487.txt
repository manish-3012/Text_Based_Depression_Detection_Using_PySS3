How do you live with yourself when you know you deserve to die?Throwaway for obvious reasons. Iâ€™m not expecting much from this, but I honestly just need someone to talk to about everything thatâ€™s been going on in my life and this is the only safe place to do it. I donâ€™t even know where to begin, but here we go. 

Iâ€™m a terrible person. Iâ€™m kind of only realizing this recently, and itâ€™s making me incredibly suicidal. I canâ€™t stop thinking about the awful things Iâ€™ve done, and the awful ways Iâ€™ve treated people. I honestly think that Iâ€™m a waste of a person. 

Iâ€™m with a guy, and heâ€™s so perfect. The nicest person you could possibly ever find, so kind to me and to everyone around him. He has the purest heart in the world. I love him so much I fucking cry thinking about him. But I cheated on him, not just once but several times with several different guys. 

He knows almost all of what happened, but not the extent. He forgives me. Itâ€™s been a while since Iâ€™ve cheated, but I canâ€™t move on. One of the people I cheated with is one of our mutual best friends, and the other is my coworker. 

Some people at my work know I cheated on him and everything feels fake. I know they lost all respect for me and think horrible things about me. It doesnâ€™t even feel like I deserve a relationship with love in it because I feel like Iâ€™ve ruined everything I love in this life. I love my friend group and I ruined it, I love my job and I destroyed that, and more than anything I love my boyfriend. But I ruined that too. 

I canâ€™t stop using people to validate my self image issues and fucked up view of myself. I know what the problem is and I canâ€™t stop. I hate myself every day for what I did and I feel like I canâ€™t even live my life because Iâ€™m a fraud with no morals and no true relationships that I havenâ€™t completely sabotaged. The fact that Iâ€™ve been directly responsible for the most important person in my lifeâ€™s hurt kills me and eats me inside all the time. 

I donâ€™t even know how to keep living with myself. I look in the mirror and I want to gouge my eyes out. I need serious help. Iâ€™ll take any advice on how to stop feeling this way. Iâ€™m sure many people will agree that I should just kill myself but if I donâ€™t do that how do I keep living?
