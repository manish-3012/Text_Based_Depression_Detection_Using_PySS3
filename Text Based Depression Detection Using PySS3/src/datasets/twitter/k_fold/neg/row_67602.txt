Building up the courageItâ€™s obvious why Iâ€™m here I want to die, at first I thought just abuse my body and do endless drugs till I give out but thatâ€™s taking too long. Iâ€™m about to fail my 3rd year in a row of university I donâ€™t want that shame but I just canâ€™t do it . I spend 99% of my day in bed because Iâ€™ve no motivation. 

Im going to order a rope... just 2 thoughts wonâ€™t stop bugging me first being my mother we donâ€™t have the best relationship but this is another level.

Second thought of my niece asking what happened, sheâ€™s just turned 6 and surprisingly checks on me the most on face calls. 

But this life isnâ€™t for me I donâ€™t fit in. Iâ€™m going no where. Iâ€™ve been a waste my whole life. I canâ€™t wait for the peace of mind moments before I go...
