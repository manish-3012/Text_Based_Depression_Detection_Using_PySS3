Nothing matters.I feel like I have just reached the end of everything.  I've just turned 26, and I feel like it's all been a waste.  I just feel like I have lost control.  I've been suicidal on and off for a year since my friend died, and I was like that even before then.  I've gotten rid of everyone after I was called an emotional vampire.  There's no joy left in my life, anything I liked to do just feels empty.  I'm alone, but I accept it, I'm way too damaged to be with anyone.  Even in groups, I feel like an outsider.  And it's just gotten to a point where I can't feel anything.  I take meds and take counseling, but it's not enough.  I can't cry, scream, yell or even react to my situation, I'm just a shell, waiting to die.  I don't even feel right being in public, I feel like everyone could turn on me at any moment.  Anyone I do know, I don't trust them when they say everything is fine between us.  And there's nothing I would love more than to believe that, but I have been burned so many times, it just shook me up.  I have no faith in anything I do.  Everything is just hollow.
