I want to kill myself but I'm scaredIt is probably an overused reason, but I broke up with my sweetheart lately. I still love him but he says he has no feelings for me anymore but still cares. He goes on this dating app where we met for the first time and he does things on there that is sick. I have made fake accounts to stalk him and talk to him in a different voice. And finds out about these things that he does there. 

He says he is going thru depression too. I know I am guilty of it because of what I have done to him even before the break up. I feel so helpless because I did so many mistakes. I want him back but I'm not even close to being sane enough to do so. I love him so much. But he is also so far away in the UK. I cannot fly there immediately. 

I want him to realize how much he means to me before I lose myself completely. I want to prove to him that I will be better. 

But during times like these I have so many thoughts, I cry alone to myself. I hate the word alone. No one is here for me not even him. I review all our conversations before and I miss him so much. 

Sometimes I think if I die I can return and return to those moments and feel happy. 

I have tried to overdose myself, i keep a knife, i try to cross the road when there are incoming trucks, and last night i wanted to jump off our balcony. 

I want to return to myself. I was not this. I am not this. But what is this eating me.
