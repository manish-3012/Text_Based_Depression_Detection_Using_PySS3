Insurmountable ChallengeI'm a recent college graduate who received their B. Sc. and I'm not sure how to keep going right now. I used to have very bad issues with suicidal ideation in high school and my freshman year, but it got better as school went on. However, throughout school I planned on pursuing a professional program after undergrad, however, I'm terrified that my GPA will prevent me from pursuing it. I struggled especially during my sophomore year which took a toll on my average. I'm taking some time off before applying to help bolster my application, but deep down I can't convince myself that I'll succeed, I just feel like I'm lying to myself, I know I won't succeed. Tonight my suicidal thoughts are coming back. If I don't get into a program I'm not sure that I really want to keep on living.

All this work over 4 whole years... wasted
All the money my parents helped me out with... wasted

Right now all I see myself as is a failure

I know my problem is the epitome of not-a-real-problem, I'm lucky that I got to go to college, get a degree, and even have to worry about this in the first place. However, I still will never be able to forgive myself if I fail. My main goal in life for the past 8 or so years unobtainable...

Idk why I'm posting here, I've never been one to really seek out help, especially from strangers, but it seemed more anonymous than a suicide hotline
