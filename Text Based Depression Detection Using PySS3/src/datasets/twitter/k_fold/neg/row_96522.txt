I feel like I'm out of optionsI'm 24 and a senior in college. Last semester I had a break down and ended up doing a medical drop of everything. I wanted to do better this semester. I wanted to pass everything this semester and try to fix my GPA by getting good grades. But I failed. Again.

People openly make fun of me and how long it's taking me to graduate. From my family to strangers. I hate myself already guys, I get it. I'm a piece of shit who sucks up money and never makes any progress. My family 100% told my extended family that I did a medical withdrawn from classes last semester. Nobody has mentioned it but everyone looks at me and doesn't know what to say. They don't joke around me like they used to. They just look at me like I'm a black sheep who's using my parents money and making excuses to not move on. I'm sorry. I really am.

I had an appointment with my psychiatrist today and I was honest with them about what was going on. My psychiatrist got mad at me. I know I fucked up again, I'm not proud of it. I explained how bad a situation I'm in and their solution was to talk to my professors. That's it. I need to beg my professors not to flunk me and to work with me to get passing grades this semester. If even one of them doesn'help me I flunk out of college and the last five years of my life verify I'm a complete waste of space.

I would rather kill myself. Literally I'm here contemplating who what stuff should go to. How to get carbon monoxide to build up around me or if drinking bleach would actually kill me. I have no friends to go to. It's mostly just nice items in a video game I want to go to someone who will appreciate them. How do I give them to someone without raising any flags or get them to accept them?

My psychiatrist said she wants to hear from me by Friday at a certain time to know I've talked to my professors. So I guess that's when I need to be dead by. I can't take it anymore. I can't stand fucking up. I know I need to face up and accept reality but I can't. I tried every day, for years, to get somewhere. I got so close. 138 credit hours. That's how far I came. I just want to drive somewhere secluded, walk into the woods and jam a knife into my neck.

I'm sorry everyone for wasting your time for so long. I tried. I really tried to fight for so long, but I think it's time for me to accept that I'm beyond help and that I need to be dead. I can't deal with whats around me anymore. It constantly feels like I'm going to throw up from being anxious around anyone and everyone. I'm nauseous because I know I need to do things and I just can't. I just feel more and more sick. More and more guilty. I have panic attacks while driving now. I'm sorry. I have nothing else left. I really wish you all more success in your fight than me, but I think this is probably going to be my last post. I just need to get this off my chest. I love you all, thank you for the support over the time I've posted here it means a lot to me.
