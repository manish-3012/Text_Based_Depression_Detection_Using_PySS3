I'm going to be homeless tomorrowWhat the hell am I supposed to do? I've joined the army but it's going to be the middle of next year until I start basic training and I'm going to be homeless that whole time, got no friends because I invested too much into my relationship (that just ended) and I got no family because they are the worst people alive, it's just six months man, it's just six months.
Hell I might not even pass the psyche exam.
