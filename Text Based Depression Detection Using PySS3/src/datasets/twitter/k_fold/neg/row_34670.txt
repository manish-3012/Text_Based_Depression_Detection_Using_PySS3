The only source of confort is my mom and now our relationship is forever tainted and now shes mad at me and im going crazy and i cant do this anymore ive already scratched my arms im having a panic attack i have no one and i want to kill myself . The only person who i trusted now put me in the worst panic of my life . I dont know what to do im crying and i dont have a national crisis line so this is the only way in which i can talk about what im feeling
