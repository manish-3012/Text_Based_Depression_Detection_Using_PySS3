hiYou might sometimes look around you and feel like we live in a world of hate, pain, and emptiness. A world of disappointment and exhaustion and despair. Nothing is okay. Things can never be right. 

But what is right? How do you know that this is what's right? Would there be a right if there was no wrong? Would you feel hate if you knew nothing of love? 

If you were never shown any love, then hate would be the default and you wouldn't even know it. There would be nothing unusual or disturbing about it if it's all you've ever know. If you haven't known love, you wouldn't feel hate. 

So there is love, you just need to have it to be able to see it. There is happiness, if you just really believe in it to feel it. There is peace and there is comfort. It's a beautiful world. Because life is beautiful. It's beautiful when the clouds move across the sun and you see the sun rays come and go back again. It's beautiful when the summer smell comes and you feel it when you have just woken up. It's beautiful when you step over uncut ice when the snow has unexpectedly fallen. Life is beautiful, and hope lives in all existence no matter how many people are blind to it, no matter how many people deny it or even hate it. Even if you've spent years hating it, it's still there. Hope lives unconditionally in all existence. There will be true companionship and lovely laughter. There will be fresh excitement and peaceful content. And it's all beautiful. And it's all worth it. It will come, so don't run, don't be scared and don't reject it.
