I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreIâ€™ve been struggling with an eating disorder for nearly two decades. Always bulimia. Now anorexia. I keep telling myself I weigh too much to die, but I canâ€™t get the thoughts to stop. A few weeks ago I was drunk and had my ex/friend (We dated for a couple of months in 2012 and have just been friends since) pick me up and apparently I took a bunch of pills; he nearly called rescue but carried me inside my house instead. Before I blacked out completely, I begged him not to call because I figured theyâ€™d transfer me to an ER where I used to work. 
Iâ€™m engaged and canâ€™t get excited about the wedding. Canâ€™t get excited about anything. I love my fiancÃ©, I KNOW that I do, but I canâ€™t feel it. I canâ€™t feel anything. 
I work in mental health myself, substance abuse specifically. I feel like thereâ€™s nothing I can do without running into clients anywhere I may even want to go. Iâ€™m not sure I want to go anywhere. Iâ€™ve been on meds for bipolar II since 2014 that have been immensely helpful. What would a hospital even do for me anyway? Been there, done that, didnâ€™t quite help. 
Itâ€™s physically hard, if not impossible, to cry. Iâ€™ve started and re-started a note several times. Iâ€™m terrified of death, it causes panic attacks, but somehow Iâ€™m in this incredibly dark and hopeless place. 
And I donâ€™t know what to do. 
I just needed to get that out, I guess.
