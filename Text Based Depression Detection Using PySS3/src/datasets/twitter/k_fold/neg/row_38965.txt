My therapy dog just diedItâ€™s been tough since my big sis lost her battle with mental illness in 2015 and I was doing so much clean up and setup of her services I never really dealt with it in myself. On Sunday my best friend and therapy dog passed away from a 9 year battle with Addisonâ€™s. In between all this my first son was born with a rare and catastrophic form of epilepsy requiring 24 hours of care with a prognosis of 2-3 years. Meanwhile my marriage is falling apart and after 4 months straight in the hospital my career and job are in jeopardy. 

My wife wants me out as I contracted Norwegian scabies which Iâ€™ve been fighting for over 5 months. I canâ€™t get my son this as he could die from infection caused by this. 

I want to just move all my belongings out, set them up with my stuff, and join my dog and my sister in the big divide. Iâ€™m so close to just giving up. I canâ€™t even eat together with her cause some bullshit will hit the table at some point during our meal. She was/is my everything. 

All I wanted was a healthy son and a healthy marriage and just before we do my sis hangs herself and this slippery slope begins. Only thing keeping me here is my son and the ton of debt we created living out of a hospital over 4 months. 

My dad suffered from depression and suicide 4 attempts and as I said my big sis was successful a few years ago. Iâ€™m afraid Iâ€™m just not well for this world. 

I try to make a positive impact on most peopleâ€™s lives. On the train I have helped 6 people make the retirement step. One was 70 afraid to make the change. Heâ€™s sleeping in and playing golf regularly. Iâ€™m proud of that one. But alas I focus on others to avoid my own self. And now after seeing my dog pass in my living room surrounded by his family Iâ€™m afraid my net of caring is gone. My dad is 90 and close too and Iâ€™m afraid once that happens Iâ€™m done.
