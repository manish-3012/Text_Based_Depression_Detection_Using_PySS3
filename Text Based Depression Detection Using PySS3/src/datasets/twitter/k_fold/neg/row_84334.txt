This week I shall be mainly hiding in bedAnother sheaf of Job rejection slips this week, I got one interview and lost it again with an ill advised mail. Extreme low BUT hiding under the bedcovers is helping smooth things out. I am warm, the terrors are all outside. I should be thankful that even in middle age, occasionally simple fire breaks still work.


There is also something incredibly naughty about laying in bed all day, unwashed, unshaven and ignoring all the stuff I am supposed to be doing.
