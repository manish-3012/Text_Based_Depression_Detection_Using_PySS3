I'm not sure how long I can keep going.I have very little social life. I've tried talking to people before and I'll always get turned down.

My dad was wondering why and he suggested I had asperger's syndrome and he was right as I got diagnosed. Asperger's syndrome is where the individual misses "social cues" and doesn't naturally understand facial expressions or body language which is how humans mainly communicate.

Luckily enough, I have a new job where the health insurance will kick in soon and wondering if social therapy will help?

I need to do something because if I don't, I'm going to kill myself plain and simple. My family isn't much help either besides my dad. 95% percent of my family are broken criminals out in New York. The other 5% (including me,) are in different states.
