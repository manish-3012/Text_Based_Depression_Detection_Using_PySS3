What do you do in the modern era if no one likes you and there's no room left to be a hermit?I annoy everyone. Maybe not at first, maybe not for a while. I have no old friends. I have friends, but they are very new. I cannot keep friends, in fact I have driven them all away eventually and will statistically continue to do so. 

When I was young, my biggest fear was not shots or big dogs heights or similar things. I was terrified to my core of becoming the "lowest common denominator", and in my fear and my absolute uncontrollable spasms of emotion and desperations throughout middle-school the skills in math and science that would have had the capability of bringing me up out the mire merely passed in one ear and out the other. Years later I find that anything beyond the most absolute basic concepts I Fail to comprehend or make use of. I wasted my formative years so frozen in fear of failure that I failed to ever act; I would freeze up on anything and constantly fail to complete work, whereupon I was told I was just lazy and oafish. 

I work in a fucking grocery store. It's looking like it's going to be my career. Have you ever heard "Anthony's Song"? 

A bullet seems rather preferable than life at the bottom of the pyramid.
