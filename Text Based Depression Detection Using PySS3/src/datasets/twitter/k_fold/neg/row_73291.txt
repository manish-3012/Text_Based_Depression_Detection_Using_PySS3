WhyTell me there is still hope.
I hate myself and everyday I feel my soul and sanity slipping away like the tide tears away at the cliff it's only a matter of time before I collapse and when I do I dont know where I will fall. The hardest part is the self loathing torment that I can't turn off. I try to hide it but I'm afraid it's so clear.. the nihilist walking corpse I've become is taking over. I'm seeing things that need to be done. An end to a means. An answer, finally. I need help but I know if I see a psych I'll lose what have I left. I'm so sorry.
