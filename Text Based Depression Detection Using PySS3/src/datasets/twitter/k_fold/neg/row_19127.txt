nothing is worth it if we're all just gonna die eventuallyI'd rather be dead sooner than later. it just makes sense. I've been on a downward spiral for over a year and no matter how I try to get out I keep going further down. and almost every single good thing that happens goes to shit eventually. the only thing that hasn't is a few of my friendships and I'm grateful for having those people in my life but they can't fix everything. my life's just a cycle of false hope then a painful snap back to reality over and over again. everything that seems like it could save me just ends up as another source of pain. there's no point in living like this longer than I have to. the only thing stopping me from suicide is that my friends would be sad to see me go, especially in that way. but maybe they would understand that im better off not feeling anything at all than i am in this life. 

im planning to start antidepressant soon but that can't make everything stop going wrong. 

I AM NOT encouraging suicide for other people bc maybe not everyone's life is this way but it just makes sense for my life.
