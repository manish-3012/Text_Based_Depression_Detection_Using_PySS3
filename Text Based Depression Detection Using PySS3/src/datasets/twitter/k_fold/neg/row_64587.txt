I'm insaneEverything I look at just is shit to me now. Nothing in life is enjoyable anymore. Not even weed, it bores me. Everything is just so boring and I feel like 90% of life is just bullshit and I don't see a point anymore, I don't want to do this anymore. I just want to die, just so all of the shit goes away. People call me crazy, I don't care. I don't even know what reality is anymore, I just keep questioning the point if life and how humans work and perspective and it's all just bullshit. I want to die.
