Liar. I am a liar. So fucking fake. I hate myself.People keep coming to visit me in the psych ward that care about me and suddenly I turn into a different person. Itâ€™s like an instant reaction, Iâ€™m smiling and joking around and making plans for the future. 

Iâ€™m lying. I just want a little more time with them, I am so selfish. I canâ€™t tell them though, they will just try and stop me. They donâ€™t understand what goes on inside my head, even if I tell them. 

After seeing them I feel even worse that Iâ€™m giving them false hope, hopefully their memories of me will be pleasant though I guess.
