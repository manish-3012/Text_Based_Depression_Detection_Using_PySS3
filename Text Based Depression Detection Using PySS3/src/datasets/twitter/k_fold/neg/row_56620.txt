Are there any great ways to try and get over my heartbreak?Suicide is not an option here so I just would like to know if you anyway for me to get a release from my pain. I have been jogging and gyming but now I can't, drinking and smokinh are out of the question becaue I quit 3 months ago, I tried smoking but it is not the same because it really hurts. I wanna sleep forever but I can't what can I do now? I want to be better but my heart breaks
