now that iâ€™ve attempted suicide and am seriously considering it, iâ€™m scared that there may actually be an afterlife.iâ€™m an atheist so i donâ€™t believe in an afterlife, but having discussed opinions with others before, i donâ€™t deny that there are events that cannot be explained. 

as said in the title, iâ€™m afraid that there is an afterlife, â€˜cause i donâ€™t wanna die just to plunge into even greater suffering down in hell when i could have delayed it for a few more decades.
