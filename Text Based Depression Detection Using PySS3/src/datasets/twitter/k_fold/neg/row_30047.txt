The more I try to better myself, the shittier life gets.My friends probably don't give a shit about my well being and I am the most unimportant person to all of my friends. They wouldn't even notice if I'm dead, let alone bother. 

There are problems at family levels too.

I had to undergo surgery which got postponed because i tested positive for covid. The more the surgery gets delayed, the more pain I am in.

Online examinations are a cluster fuck. I'm doing a computer science engineering degree. I know people who don't know shit about the subject acing in online exams because they are shamelessly cheating and the college doesn't want to adopt an open-book format for online exams. I can assure I have a good base of knowledge in these subjects but lagging behind in marks because I cheat less, like people are copying others' sheets word to word and the examiner who corrects the paper doesn't even notice. 

I was talking to a close friend that it sucks so much because i feel lonely and have struggled in making friends because of my sheltered upbringing and culture shock.

That guy who is ina great relationship, tons of friends who look out for him, tells me, "Bro you should learn tk be happy alone". Not that this is wrong but after a point of being alone, a person like me who isn't an introvert starts losing his sanity.

I paid for online counseling but that wasn't much help. Some say life is unfair and difficult. It has been unfair for me from the start but since my parents were well-off, these are not "real" problems according to some. 

I've already considered suicide 2-3 times over the past few months, the latest being moments ago where I have decided upon a plan which I'll proceed with if something doesn't make me genuinely happy in coming months.

 
If life is always meant to be shitty and unfair, I'll end it and I would do it right now if I could. There is nothing selfish about taking one's own life if i can spend a lot of time thinking rationally about it.
