[17 f] - Is anyone out there?Hi,

I've never posted on here before, and now that I'm at my wit's end, I figured I'd give it a shot. However, I don't mean to come off as self-piteous or anything, and if I do, then I sincerely apologize. I understand that depression is an illness that affects many people, and that I am not special. But I need someone to listen; I need someone to care. 

I'm a dejected 17-year-old, who was once aimlessly searching for a way out of this perpetual funk. Having said that, I have come to realize that this unyielding sorrow will never fade, and because of this- I will be ending my life tonight. 

Like many of the broken souls on this subreddit, I suffer from a crippling depression that has profoundly overtaken my life- as well as my will to live. I have become so enveloped in my depression that I have not gone to school in 2 weeks. I cannot find the will to get out of bed, and face my peers and teachers. When I am at school, all I can think about is going home and killing myself. I spend most of my school time hiding in the back of classrooms or sobbing behind the door of a lonely bathroom stall. It never used to be like this; I never used to feel this way. My home life isn't much better. I often come home from school greeted by my mother hooked to a machine that administers chemotherapy treatment that is killing her. I lock myself in my bedroom so that she won't see me cry. When confronted by my ailing mother, I feel as though I am staring at the face of death. I love my mother dearly, however, I cannot bare to watch her suffer and eventually die before my very eyes. I have inevitably lost my will keep living. My days are now consumed by mindless internet browsing, self harm, pornography and dreary music. I wish I could just get away. I wish I could start a band and play music for the rest of my days, or make films about butterflies and rocket ships and share them with the entire world. But alas, I cannot. For this is my life, and I must accept it. Nonetheless I am weak, frail and tired. I refuse to trudge on in this life of infinite melancholy when it is much easier to pull the trigger of the gun. 

Thanks for reading.
