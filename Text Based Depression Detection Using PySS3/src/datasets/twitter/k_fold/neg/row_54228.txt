I've realized there's no hope for me. I was born into terrible circumstances. I worked hard to overcome them. But I see now that this pain is my destiny. I'm 30 and completely alone.If someone asked me to rate life, I'd give it zero stars. All I've ever known is sadness and disappointment. I've either been hurt or hurt others. There was never happiness, peace, or fulfillment. 
 
 
I tried. I really did. Hindsight is always 20/20. I know now how I could have avoid some of the the mistakes I made or fought harder against my circumstances. It's too late now though. And would it have mattered? Somehow, I think this was always my fate. 

 
 
I don't think anyone will remember me when I go. In fact, I know they won't. Even the few people who know my name won't remember *me* because they never really knew me. They didn't even try. 
 
 
I see it what it is now. It's overwhelming and peaceful at the same time to realize that nothing really matters and life will go on after I end the same as it went on before I began.
