I hate that I don't get betterI feel like every recovery is a scam to keep my friends and family happy. I keep cycling in and out of wellness and severe low mood and paranoia. I keep hurting myself. I keep skipping my medication. I keep punishing myself. 

I only keep going for other people and that is wearing thin. I want to die, I have a plan. If it weren't for my boyfriend's recent loss (his mother passed) I'd do it. That sounds really fucking selfish but I can't tell anyone else so venting it here. 

I want to be there for other people, but I hate myself so much and I get closer and closer each time. Each self harm relapse is worse than before. Each binge drink is worse than before.

I keep hurting and hurting and not getting better in any real sense. I'm only posting cause I don't want to hurt other people. If there is help I will honestly try. Just can't promise it'll last.
