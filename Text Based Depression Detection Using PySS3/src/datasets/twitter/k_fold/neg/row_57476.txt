I am with my family during this quarantine, unfortunately.I would rather be in a prison then with my family. 

Even though my dad is gone my mom and brother are still there.

And my mom can't get the idea that I don't like being around her to fit in her goddamn skull.

And if I don't like being around her it's my fault.
