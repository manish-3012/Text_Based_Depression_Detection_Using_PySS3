Nothing makes me happy anymoreThe TV shows I enjoyed nolonger seem funny

The Video Games I play seem boring

The music I listen to sounds depressing

The porn nolonger gives me an erection 

I nolonger believe that god cares about me

This is the worst period of my life, I to be able to enjoy life, I want a woman to hug me, I want a good nights sleep.

Edit - this has been about 1 or 2 weeks I think
