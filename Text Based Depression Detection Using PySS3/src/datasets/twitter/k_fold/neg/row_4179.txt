I just cannot find reasons to be aliveLiterally anything could trigger me into the suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™m a grown ass adult, who will turn 23 in 10 days and I think Iâ€™m still in my teens. Am I just thinking so fucking much?? Iâ€™m trying to figure out the reasons why should I keep on living but Iâ€™m again facing the cul-de-sec. Yesterday I felt kind of inspired and passionate about my life but today, I am sitting in the bathroom, crying again. Constant thoughts of meaninglessness and hollowness are killing me every day.

I tried so much. I started taking antidepressants and I started doing something Iâ€™m not comfortable with but at the end of the day, it always scares me that my future is doomed and there is literally no fucking point of living. Do everybody else bothered by these thoughts and Iâ€™m just being dramatic?? I donâ€™t know why am I feeling this way. There is actually nothing I can complain about. Itâ€™s all on me. And Iâ€™m scared of getting older and older with the same mindset stopped at the age of 17.
