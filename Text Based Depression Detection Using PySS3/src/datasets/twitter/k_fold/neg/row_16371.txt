WhateverI guess I'm finally at the point I'm going to do it soon. He's still not speaking to me although he promised to meet with me repeatedly over the last year and I can't stand it anymore. So after my friends wedding, unless he speaks to me or even agrees to speak with me again somehow, before the wedding day comes, I'm done. The pain is too unbearable.
