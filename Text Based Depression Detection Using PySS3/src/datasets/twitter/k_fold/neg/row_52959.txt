anyone else not feel comforted when someone says youre not alone?obviously im not in a good spot, i just made a reddit account and this is my very first post. things are going great /s. anyways, whenever my friends, who do mean well, say im not alone that doesnt help me at all. like, why would i feel better that other people feel the same way? i honestly dont think im going to keep holding on much longer, so why would it be nice to know other people feel the same?
ive done everything i can to better myself. ive been going to therapy for over a decade, on medication for almost as long, i exercise, try and go outside, i have great friends and i do amazing at college, but none of its enough, and i feel so selfish but i just cant keep doing this anymore. i genuinely dont remember what my hobbies or likes are anymore because ive been depressed so long. i started seeing a psychiatrist and he was suprised that i fit all the depressive qualifications for bipolar depression, but none of the mania aspects, meaning im in a more severe depression than your standard depression, but the medication that would help a bipolar person wouldnt help me. even the best my therapist can do is to tell me to hang in there. im so tired and alone. i miss my ex like crazy and i hope one day soon i have the guts to finish what i tried years ago and succeed in killing myself. im a huge financial strain on my parents and an emotional burden on everyone else. i just cant keep going and im sorry.
