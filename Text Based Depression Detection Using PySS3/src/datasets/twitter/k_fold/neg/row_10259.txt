Not Entirely Sure What To Do....I really don't want to be a complainer or a whiner. But I've really had a hard time lately and I'm beginning to think I need help.

Growing up my whole life revolved around my mom. Not in a jealous or condescending way, but because she required special treatment for her colon cancer. Traveling from specialist to specialist, chemo treatment to chemo treatment, I got used to the hospital environment. 

Soon enough we settled in Fort Knox, KY, where in Louisville KY, she was getting the best treatment she could under some of the best professionals in the field. It went so well, she was approaching her last treatment, a surgery to remove the last of her cancer from around her colon that would free her from the battle she'd fought so many years. Long story short, the last surgery she had didn't go the way doctors had planned. A short stem of cancer thought to be disconnected from her body, was in fact, connected to her heart. And a slight tug had resulted in catastrophe.  

As an 11 year old child, it's hard to believe the news. In fact, for the next year, rounding the corner, a hope of her standing there on the porch still lingers. It was a joke, a cruel, sick joke. But only until that corners been rounded close to 100 times does it finally set in: reality. 

I think that's where my depression began. I recovered some time after that. But in my senior year of college I tried taking my own life. Due to a rusty knife and some self actualization, I survived. But to this day I'm still struggling pretty poorly with my depression. Some days it's good, some days its debilitating.

 I can't admit it to my family, they've suffered enough. But I REALLY REALLY want to get better. 

I'm not sure what to do. I'm afraid to go to a psychiatrist or therapist, but I'm really feeling it creep back. Does anyone have advice on what they've done to improve?
