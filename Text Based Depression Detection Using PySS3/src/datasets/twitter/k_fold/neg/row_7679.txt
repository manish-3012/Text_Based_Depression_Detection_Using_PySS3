StrangeHi, just a small yet obvious question-if thoughts create reality then why does thinking of killling yourself not create it so? I know there are many factors but if I think of it and then attempt it and survive then why, I often wonder is the torment a lesson of reminder toward failure. I just look at the life I have lived and it sickens me, changes have lead to the same outcome and attempts have only lead to hospitals and false lie to live. So I now ask myself, am I just killing my life(destroyed connections, have no intelligence or skills, basically another problem to society)itself versus the outcome I'd like, because I no I having nothing and therefore it's rather easy, yet I require assistance (subtances, etc an easy death). I am only here because I am am confused as to why I still live, for I've run out of lies to listen, and as a slave I wait for a new master, maybe that's why I needs things to push myself off the rift.
