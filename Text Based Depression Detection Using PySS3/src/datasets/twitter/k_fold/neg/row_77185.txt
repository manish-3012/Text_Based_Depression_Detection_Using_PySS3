I was doing ok for a bit (and I hadnâ€™t posted here in almost a month), but Iâ€™m backkkk(Please read this, but like, read it like you are singing because thatâ€™s how Iâ€™m typing it).

I have so much shit going on and I canâ€™t fucking do it anymore. I tried to haaang myself again two nights ago and I canâ€™t stop cryinggfff. My mum says my stretch marks are unattractive and that I donâ€™t exercise anymore. Ummm maybe itâ€™s cuz Iâ€™m depressed muuuum and even waking up is a chore. Except, I do exercise. I either play tennis, rollerblade, run, or walk every single dayyyyy. Itâ€™s my fucking stress eating and the fact that IM A TEENAGER AND IM STILL GROWING. But anywayyyyy, her words made me binge againnn fuck. She literally bought me scar cream. I used to suffer from restrictive bulimia so this makes me feel so fucking fat and worthless even though Iâ€™m at a normal weightttt hehe. 

Thanks for listening to my song. I am going to kill myself soon. And that is just one of the reasons why.
