I feel no need to be alive. I feel like, besides not wanting to, I don't have to.Why do I need to get up everyday and go work or study? To stay alive but I don't need to if I die. 

Why do I need to get up everyday and do chores or homework? To keep functioning but I don't need to, I'd rather die. 

Why do I need to stay alive for the people that I love/that love me? I don't need to, they can handle it if I die. 

I feel like a little kid that says "Why do I have to live? I didn't chose to live, my parents chose to have me, not me" but the thing is that it also feels like an adult(?) thing to think: "Why do I have to live? My parents chose to have me but I have the right to decide what to do with my life therefore I can chose to kill myself and it's ok if I do because people will be able to handle it and if someone argues they won't then why will I have to handle it when someone I love dies?" 

22 y/o college student, in case it matters. 

I would rather have a logical discussion about this rather than answering to your talking tips but it's your choice so fire away with whatever you have, I just want to get through this phase; even though it feels like a phase that I can't get through.
