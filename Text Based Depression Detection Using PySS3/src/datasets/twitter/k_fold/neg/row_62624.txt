I wish I was dead alreadyIâ€™m only still alive out of guilt. My mom only cares about my grades. Iâ€™m losing my friends. I made a promise to someone that Iâ€™d stay alive but I donâ€™t think I can do that much longer. Itâ€™s getting more difficult and I feel really alone.  The world wonâ€™t stop once Iâ€™m gone, anyway.
