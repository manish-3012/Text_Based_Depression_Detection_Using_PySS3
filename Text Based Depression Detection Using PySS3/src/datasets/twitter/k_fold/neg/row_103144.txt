Bored to death, life is over-rated, suicidalJust spent 4 agonizing and boring hours and I kept thinking how life was over-rated, how life sucks and is boring most of the time, and how the negative aspects of life outweighed the positives. I was very miserable the whole time I was at work, and if I had an "Easy Button" - a button that I could press which would kill me instantly and painlessly, I would have pressed it with no hesitation. It's not like I had nothing to do with work: I was actually working too slowly and the work was piling up.

Came home and saw my dog just sitting there on the couch, not moving at all, business as usual. I love my dog more than anything in the world. Seeing this just made me more depressed and reinforced my belief in life being over-rated.

I'm not so bored now (browsing the web), but I would still hit that Easy Button if I could. I'd say right now I'm slightly bored, I could play some video games to entertain me, but I've got other shit to take care of.

The only real obstacle to me committing suicide right now is that I don't have the means to. I have some kitchen knives that I can use to slit my carotid artery but I'm too afraid of pain. I heard having your heart stop beating is a nice way to die, you just lose consciousness and eventually you're gone. Sounds nice to me.
