Why does suicide just "feel" right?When I think rationally I can easily tell myself that this shit isn't worth killing myself over but no matter how many reasons not to do it I bring there is still that one part of my brain that just makes me feel like I should. This is not just with suicide but with other things aswell. Does anyone else have this? I just want to actually listen to my own rational advice.
