It's so much easier to just give upWow. I was really hoping I wouldn't be here again

But here I am.

Things got a little better after I last posted, but clearly it didn't stick. I just feel like it's finally my time to give up and off myself. Maybe then people wouldn't constantly have to clean up after my mistakes and take care of me
