every single night it comes back to thisi feel like someone who was never made for this world. it never gets better. i've been depressed for eight straight years. i love my partner so much, i love my family, i love my dog, but sometimes those connections aren't enough to make it worth it. i have nothing else - no education, no job right now, nothing. nothing i'm even remotely good at because i'm an anxious wreck who can't and won't take risks. i feel like i seem to lack the intuition, drive, and happiness that come easily to neurotypical people. i have sat awake every night for as long as i can remember wishing i was dead. i hate myself inside and out. i hate how pathetic i am, crying while i write this, never bringing it up out loud because i know it's a burden on everyone else.
