How to talk to a friend?I live in a city alone with 2 roommates. I'm not particularly close with one of my roommates. The other one is my best friend. I haven't told anyone about my depressive/suicidal thoughts, but I feel as though I can trust this friend with my thoughts. The hardest part is not knowing how to explain my situation, how I've been feeling consistently down, how I've been smoking up to forget about my bad thoughts, how I hate myself. I'm also very scared of alienating him or being a burden. How do I tell my friend about how I feel?
