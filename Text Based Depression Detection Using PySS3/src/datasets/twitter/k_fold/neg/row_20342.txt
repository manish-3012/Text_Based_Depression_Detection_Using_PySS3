ReliefI dont expect anyone too understand or even convince me otherwise im not operating on a level of emotion or understanding anymore, my reality is the only one i know and i cant change that, but i just wanted too tell the world in some small way that after years of turmoil its going too be my 21rst birthday soon, and all i feel is relief, not in any of the ways a younger me i thought it would matter, alcohol is the only real difference but not like ive had trouble getting that or anything else for that matter, and its completely bullshit that ill magically become n adult once i cross a line on a calender, ive always been older than my age conveys but for the most part i think no one grows up the kids just get better at being people their not, so anyways becoming 21 is just a number too me no different than the few before, BUT i feel relief     pure unrestrained relief the only true happiness ive known in a long time knowing that im a coward, that some part of me in a heart of hearts deep within something you might want too call a soul has thrown in the towel, i dont know why or maybe i do and i just dont want too devote the energy anymore but im not angry at myself i dont feel regret for the things ive done and too be honest i cant see how things could have been that much different even if i had lived with some purpose, i dont feel like there is anything in this world philosophy, religion, meaning, trade, craft or the like that is beyond my understanding, i appreciate the value of meditation and silent prayer and cant really tell the difference between, humans dont confuse me whether in the grand sense or the convoluted one, how people treat each other and how society is measured and what humanity regards as important in this life are perfectly obvious for anyone who is not blinded enough by their own perception(dream) too see, i dont think its a stretch that i could tell you how this world is screwing itself the answers that would solve those problems and the peace, love, and happiness that should happen instead of all those evil despicable things we regard as important more than people or life: money, status, control, power, the need that to be more right than anyone else,...i dont know really, whatever, like i said none of it matters enough to me to devote my mind's confusion to thinking about this anymore, this existence this life this universe the anything that is ever anything we exist in, from the moment we open our eyes too the day we close them, it is all given too us as; responsibility for being human in the first place you have a mind with free will destined whether you like it or not  too see what you dont want too know, 

i dont know im a coward like ive said but ive been brave way too long, reaching the end of this long journey realizing all my supposed truths but only after it would have done me good, leaves me with an eternal feeling of despair, i know that i can do anything i put my mind too, live any life i choose, love the way i choose too love, or even start any figurative metaphorical journey for anything and i know that it will all lead too brutally beautiful examples of the infinity, hope, and energy of life that makes it worth it in the first place,.... Im just not ready too do any of it again again again, after going through so much life and only feeling drained sucked dry by the leeches of existence, i feel i dont have the hope,will, or the love too be the person i know i am somewhere deep inside, too be be the reality of who i know i am instead of the fears,worries, and pain that has become my all, (god i wish i could write better i used too) but in the end i look in the mirror at this stranger and i cant remember when the last time i actually looked into my eyes and saw anything alive anything at all just nothing too be honest, in the end the despair at it all, the lack of me being an individual anymore at least an individual i will myself too be, all this bullshit and all the more than i could ever possibly convey has led too fulfill my final wish, ill die before im 21, and i cant BELIEVE THE HAPPINESS I FELT ONCE IT WAS ALL SAID AND DONE, I KNOW THERE IS MORE TOO BE LIVED BUT I LIVED MORE THAN ENOUGH IN MY 21 YEARS, SO MUCH SO I CANT LIVE ANOTHER DAY WITHOUT FEELING ANYTHING BUT THE DESPAIR IVE BEEN SHOVING AWAY FOR O SO LONG, SO STEREOTYPICAL BUT I CANT WAKE UP TOMORROW TO NOTHING BUT THIS DESPAIR I CANT BRUSH IT OFF OF IGNORE MY LIVING NIGHTMARE ANYMORE, CAUSE WHO DO I THINK IM FOOLING CERTAINLY NOT MYSELF ANYMORE, AND UNFORTUNATELY I WISH IT WASNT SO BUT LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING ON HOPE ALONE, HAVING NOTHING BUT HOPE WILL LEAVE YOU NOTHING BUT A BITTER TASTE AND A BURNT AND MOONSCAPED SOUL, JUST LEAVES YOU BITTER, SAD, THEIR IS NO RIGHT WORD DESPAIR THAT THAT BEAUTY THAT MAGNIFICENCE IS SO CLOSE BUT THE MORE YOU REACH THE FARTHER IT SEEMS TOO BE, CLOSE ENOUGH YOU CAN FEEL WITH YOU FINGERTIPS BUT NEVER SO THAT YOU HAVE A GRIP,


Anyway, i want too say i love anyone who was kind enough too read this i dont care if you agree or like it it just makes me feel better that their was someone that cared enough too take the time, i wish all users of reddit happinness and peace in this life, and please just be good too each other, care for what matters what really matters not the illusions we give ourselves too feel better, take care of this world and the beauty within the only things that mattered too me, that their is a responsibility as a human to protect, preserve, and value what we take for granted, never forget as a human, with our infinite minds and boundless ability to create, that you HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO CARE  FOR LIFE IN ALL FORMS all manifestations in all things, cause what else are we here for than too be the benefactors of life's creation. I didnt really say anything i meant too say in this post this is merely the crap that came out of me when i couldn't ignore the fact that i needed too say something this is the result, these are my final words as written and i feel happiness, i wish you all the same, 

Oh and if their is a girl named Arie out there who used to go by the street moniker Ember, im sorry for all i did too you didnt deserve that and you must have thought i was pretending too be someone else, but everything that happened between us was more real than truth itself, so much so i couldnt pretend to be that honest as a being even if i tried and believe me i tried, i could never be more real than i inescapably am

Goodbye: Thank You and find meaning it doesnt matter what is is
