Iâ€™m on the edge of finally doing itThis is my first post here and i donâ€™t really know how to word it so sorry if this ends up being a rant, but i need to get this off my chest. 

For the past three or four years of my life, iâ€™ve felt extremely depressed, iâ€™m about to be a senior in high school and so all of my friends that i talk to about this tell me that feeing this way is normal for this age. But i canâ€™t believe that, i refuse to believe everyone my age feels this way, and if they do, i donâ€™t want a life where being depressed is normal. It has felt like itâ€™s gotten so much worse the last few months for various reasons. I havenâ€™t been able to sleep for very long at all at night because iâ€™m up thinking if i should just kill myself, and i sleep through the entire day because iâ€™m too stressed to leave my bed. I havenâ€™t seen a doctor yet because i donâ€™t have the courage to tell my parents iâ€™m depressed and iâ€™ve attempted suicide 3 times this year alone. I donâ€™t know why i feel this way, iâ€™ve tried to talk to friends but it never works, The last few months iâ€™ve lost almost all of my friends because iâ€™m too fucking depressed to put in any effort, i have absolutely no hope for my future because i have no passions or hobbies, and iâ€™m thinking its time to just give up and end it all, i figure itâ€™s better for everyone that way anyways. Iâ€™m hoping i can finally get the courage to go through with it soon, and not pussy out like the last 3 times.
