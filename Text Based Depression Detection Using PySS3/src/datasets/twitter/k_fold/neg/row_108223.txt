Sister tells me to kmsMy sister has been telling me for years to kill myself, September of 2018 I tried. after she still tells me to. She says things like "I hope you starve yourself to death" or "hope we find you body in a ditch" and other unkind things. I'm too depressed to deal with this anymore.
