Suicidal for Traditional and Nontraditional ReasonsI'm not a very eloquent writer so I'll put this in list form. I apologize if my points are unclear...

**Nontraditional**
--Humans are greedy, selfish bastards that will do anything to get ahead
--No one can truly seek happiness because of the corruption of government and corporations
-- Social progress is at a stand still and will not move forward anytime soon
-- I'm curious as to what is on the other side. Whether it be darkness or another life of some sort. (I'm an athiest) But whatever it is, is better than what I have now. I also desire to know answers to questions that are impossible to answer here on earth.


**Traditional**
--Depressed, self loathing, worthless jackass.
--No hope of moving forward in my own life. I have no means of going to a decent college. Parents went bankrupt, no credit, no consigner, no chance of getting a job. The only way to afford college would be by joining the military, but my parents will have none of that. 
--I am an athiest and my entire family are very devout christians. I have to constantly hide who I am from them and nearly scream everytime they tell me to "pray to god for guidance"


There's just a few main points. The only reason I havn't ended it yet is because I don't want to have others go through the emotional pain I do on a daily basis. That is starting to not become enough. Each day is harder than the last. I've been struggling for the past 7 years. (I'm only 21) Everytime I mention wanting to get help, my parents give me "that look" like I'm insane and then ignore me for days because they think I'm acting strangely. I don't know what to do anymore. The only people who would miss me are my family members. So why must I suffer on their behalf?


Edit: Couldn't get bullet formatting to work, so  you have this... sorry
