I really feel like I am self sabotaging.My marriage, my job, my friendships. I feel like I  constantly end up hurting people I'm supposed to care about, that I do care about. I can't see the value in myself anymore, and I really think everyone would be better off without me. I have a good life insurance plan, my husband would be ok financially and really, the world doesnt need me in it. 

I feel like I get so close to being the correct, the happy version of me, and then.. it's just. Gone. And I'm crying and hurting the person I love when I just wanted to try to get my feelings into words so I didnt hurt him with silence. I just wish there was a version of me that could hold onto happiness.
