My Life Is Pointless and I'm Going to Kill Myself SoonI have about three days to live before I blast my face with a shotgun. Lose consciousness almost instantaneously, almost no chance of survival.

My life is completely pointless and I have no future.

I've tried using the suicide hotline, once it helped but it's a routine running out of steam. Therapy,  medication, none of that. I'm not saveable.

I need to tidy up some personal and financial affairs and then goodbye.
