I want to kill myself. I've wanted to kill myself for the past 5 yearsI'm turning 23  this year. For the past 5 or so years I've been telling myself that I will end it soon. In a day or two, next week, after XYZ happens I'll kill myself. I'll just watch this movie or listen to this album first. I've been doing this for fucking years now.

It's kinda bad cause I haven't really been able to get anywhere in life thinking I only have a week or a couple of days at most. Not that I want to cause I wanna kill myself but still. 

I hate it that I can't talk to people about this because everybody acts like suicide is bad. Like it's some flaw that needs to be corrected. Instead of seeing it for what it is: a choice and a direction that you can go with life. Maybe it's pointless but fuck it so is working 9-5 to put money in someone elses pocket while you get crumbs. 

It's all about money. My life isn't financially viable. If you could somehow see how many people want to kill themselves to be free from this hell you'd see it too. I wish I could see who else wanted to kill themselves then I could make friends and not have to go through with it alone. 

I'm thinking Tuesday. Hopefully the weather is nice. I'll probably cry a lot and it's probably gonna hurt like hell but it's going to be worth it. Better in the long run. I should've done it years ago. Thanks for reading this shit. Enjoy your weekend.
