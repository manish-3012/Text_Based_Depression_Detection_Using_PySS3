I think i have made too much misktakesLike, "what if i didnt do that?", i really wish to change the reality, im really sad and regretful, for doing the wrong things. 
First i ruined a good friendship with a girl, who i loved and now she hates me for being an asshole with her, its my fault i get it but i regret.
Then there is my mother who died a couple
Of years ago, and i was so angry and bad with her, i didnt call her even his last day or week or even month, i wish i could talk with her, make things right.
Then grandpa died last year, it was also my fault if i were there for him when hes having a stroke, but i was so angry with him and my family for making me take care of grandpa, and i was wasting my time with games, parties, and friends.
I also regret to take care of grandma last month, who is having bad times, and nearly to her death, just for being annoyed.
I regret a bunch if things in my life and i wish to make things different, i wish talk to my old me and kickme, i wishi could done things diffrentley, i need to change, but im not strong enough. I need to love but im scared that im just an asshole. I wish i had parents. I wish i had brothers. I regret my life and nothing seems to change.
