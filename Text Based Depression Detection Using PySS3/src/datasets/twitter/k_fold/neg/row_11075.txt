It's all too much.I've been depressed for years among other things. I hold on hoping itll get better and it never fucking does. I'm sick of being strong. I have a 6 month old son who is my pride and joy but I feel like I'm going to fuck him up like a fuck everything else up. If I wasnt here he would turn out better and my husband would be happier because I'm such a pain in the ass. I dont want to feel anymore.
