Update from the glass-smashing, hate-filled lunatic.Maybe this should go to r/depression or even r/relationshipadvice; but I've always wanted to hear follow-ups from other SW posters (Anyone care to start a new subReddit?) so I thought I'd set an example and tell the many people who responded how I'm doing.

What I wrote wont fit in a comment so I posted it [here](https://sites.google.com/site/confessionssite/ConfessionsofaLoser/confessions#today).
