It's not worth it in the endMaybe it's because i'm off my meds and my depression has come back, but i don't see the point in living. Why try so hard only to die in the end? Life is so insignificant. I don't care anymore. I took pills only to humor others. i'm just here to humor others. I don't know if my plan will be successful. I guess it would depend on how far out i can swim while heavily intoxicated.
