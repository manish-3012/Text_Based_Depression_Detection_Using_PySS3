My post.I don't know what else to do.

I was abused by my family my entire life, to the point I have PTSD. Nothing too extreme (i.e. raping, etc), but *every fucking day of my life* I was screamed at, choked, thrown around or slapped. I was mentally degraded every fuckig day with words such as "You're a piece of shit, fuck you." from my own father. I was torn away from my mother  at the age of 2 so I could be in the hands of a perverted maniac. Even though he didn't rape me, there were multiple times I was touched inappropriately. I then was kicked out (changed the locks and everything) at the age of 17. I didn't take legal action because I cared for my father more than he ever showed his caring side to me. Now I feel nothing for him.

Fast forward to now.. I have serious PTSD (such as: jumping at loud noises or having a manic episode due to being in a big crowd). I have **extreme** anxiety and depression. I have been homeless since my dad left me on the streets at 17. He kicked me out beause I went to meet my mother for the first time in my life... how fucking horrible. Not that my mom is a saint, in fact I can't fucking stand her, but she is NOT abusive like my father. She is a normal fucking person in that sense. But, a good example of her is: While I'm homeless on the streets in the dead of winter and hungry, she doesn't help me. Instead she's paying some dude's morgage (they are not in a relationship) of $600/month. All I needed was a sixth of that in order to feed myself.. I'm currently broke amd would have *nothing* without my boyfriends help and this leaves me with so much guilt and anxiety every single day. Even with his help, I am homeless and hungry. It's not like he can support me. All I can see is how I am taking away from his resources... Besides, our anxieties and depression are unwillingly driving us apart. I will be alone without him.

Don't get me wrong, I have fucking TRIED and TRIED to work. Every job lasts up to only a month due to my anxiety and depression. I am always attacked at these jobs. Fucking always. I have been everyone's target since day 1 in my life. A short example is, while Im drying off a dog (dog groomer), my ex-coworker would turn her water towards me and soak the dog again. I was then harassed by the boss to cooperate with said coworker.. and fired a day later.. that job only last 2 weeks. This happens every fucking time I get a job. I am the one that gets harassed to the point of being fired. I am a HARD ASS WORKER and I am very friendly. I go out of my way to succeed in the work place, but I am **always** attacked. Not only am I attacked at work, but **every fucking where I go** I am also targeted. This is NOT a mere perspective. If you don't believe me then stop reading this now. I don't need even more doubt in my life.

Now, I've been on/off foodstamps for a couple years, and I'm very thankful for that.. but numerous times I have been treated poorly and denied help at the offices.. for no reason. Once it was because my last name was supposedly fraudulent (my dad illegal got custody of me, as well as illegally changed my name). Every other time they have told me I'm lying and couldn't possibly need help (a young, homeless adult doesn't 'deserve' food stamps??). Now I'm really, really, really wanting disability.. I can't work, I'm homeless and I am *suicidal as all fucking fuck*. They keep denying me. I have to watch my boyfriend's mom (who comes from a multi-million dollar family) get $2000 social security a month and is trying to SCAM the system for more. She already stole my boyfriend's disability for the first 7 years he had it (30,000 grand straight into her pocket). We told social security what happened and instead of giving two fucks about what she did, they tried to take his measly  $500/month disability.... Last year my aunt who is also from a multi-million dollar family came and swept my dead grandmother's bank account away (25,000) before I even got home from the hospital, where she died..

I am fucking LOSING IT over the injustice in this world. I am planning on killing myself this year. I cannot fucking continue to live like this. I deserve food stamps, at the least, but I believe I also deserve disability, which they refuse to even consider giving me. I have too much anxiety to even go to the doctors. The last time I was for an EXTREMELY bad constipation and menstrual problem, the doctor literally laughed at me and told me to change my diet, after pushing so hard on my stomach that I cried out in pain. I eat healthier than 99% of the people I meet... I do not eat processed foods or drink soda all day. I go out of my way and spend most of my money on taking care of my health, because its a necessity for me. This still does not help the health issues I have though.

Rambling...

I just can't do this life. I am always the target. I am always the black sheep. I am always left to rot by those who demand love from me (parents). I have tried and tried and tried to better my life, but here I am.. in the same position I always have been.

This is why I'm going to kill myself this year.

I have looked up more than my fair share of suicide stories this past year. I've considered the regret, I've considered a "crazy life change" (**everything goes to fucking hell when I try this**), I've considered regretfully living through an attempt, I've considered all I'm leaving behind..

I stopped smoking marijuana (it saved my life *numerous* times where I would have killed myself over my anxiety/depression). I realized it doesn't help my stomach problems, it makes my head and decisions foggy and it costs money. It was hard to quit because it was such a life saver, but I feel better without it.

I started eating healthy years ago. I knew the bullshit I was putting into my body was damaging my health. Now I eat as clean as possible. I started exercising as well. I lost about 10lbs (I was never over-weight, really) and it helped, but not enough. I still have poor bodily functions.

I quit smoking cigarettes almost 2 years ago and it has helped tremendously.

I stopped all contact with my father and 90% of it with my mother, which has kinda helped my mental state.. but it reminds you what it's like to be utterly alone.

I try and try and try to get jobs. I try so fucking hard. They either dont last, or I apply 50 places without a single call-back.

I have shitty health (it isn't HORRIBLE, but being constipated for months on end and bleeding all month long on top of anxiety/depression/homelessness does A LOT to your mental health and overall health).

I have consistent shitty luck (last month my phone service shut off LITERALLY THE SECOND I was getting a call-back from a job). I ended up losing my place (NOT due to my own doings, the landlord kicked me out to have family vacation in the studio I was renting..) soon after, so I would have lost the job anyways.

I can't keep doing this.

I have no friends, because people are generally awful or immature. I have no family other than my 2 parents. I am not good with social responsibility, either way. I lost my dog, my only friend, last year.

This is the year that I end this all.

I'm going to try again for disability... I have no way to get a lawyer to help me. I have too much anxiety and too little money to try to see a psychiatrist, which is a big step for getting disability. I am SICK of being doubted! Just because I look fine on the outside with no visual disabilities does NOT mean I am okay. I shove it all aside to look strong for other people sake. I dont LIKE feeling weak and helpless. It is not a choice to be so mentally scarred from my past.

But no one sees this.

I am so sad. I am so fucking god-awful sad. I don't know what else to do.
