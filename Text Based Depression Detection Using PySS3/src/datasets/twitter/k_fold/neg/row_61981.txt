separations, being alone and feeling suicidalHey everyoneee, so in the past ive struggled with breakups, fear of abandonment, &amp; suicide attempts. I'm currently in a relationship with someone who hasn't been treating me the way I deserve, but its been so hard to leave. I keep packing my things when I get triggered, but everytime I go to leave I can't do it. Like I can't face the pain and loneliness that I'd feel after the initial sting of breaking up. I feel like I NEED a strong connection with someone at all times otherwise I feel like its the end of the world and there is no goodness left in life. It's so hard to feel confident and content in moving on when that moment comes to leave and all i can feel and think is "i cant be without this person". 

I have been seeing a therapist consistently, but it seems like no matter how aware I can be of my thoughts &amp; feelings I cant stop myself from getting over wanting to kill myself when I dont have a secure connection to someone else.
