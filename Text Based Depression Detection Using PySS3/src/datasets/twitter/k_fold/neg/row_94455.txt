IdeationThe constant ideation is wearing me down.

I'm holding on by a thread, and every moment is a fight to keep going. I don't want to be like this anymore, and after reaching out for help my anxiety is even higher because I don't want to go inpatient.

I can't. I'm solo parenting two toddlers with a significant other overseas. They'll be home soon, but it's so hard trying to hold on for that. One they're home, stress will be even higher during the reintegration period.

I don't know what the point of this is, except to say I'm drowning in my own head.
