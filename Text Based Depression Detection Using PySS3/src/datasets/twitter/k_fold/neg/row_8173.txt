Debating on ending it..I don't even know where to begin... i turned 22 on aug 20th.. I have a wife and 2 boys under the age 2, I love them to death and i don't want them to not have a daddy but im so close. I own a glock 32 pistol and i'm planning on using it but my wife has it the glovebox of our car.. she will not let me have it until she knows i'm feeling better.. So i'm planning to fake feeling better soon just to get the pistol then go far away from my house.. I suffer everyday but i kinda wanna hang in for a little bit longer but i dont know if i can. I don't know if its my medicine making me feel like this or not.. my doc upped my dose of prozac from 10mg to 20mg and instantly i feel suicidal for the past 2 days... i feel emotional numbness like i can't feel happy or really sad i feel nothing and my head feels foggy i don't feel like im here. The only thing keeping me is my little boys faces everytime i see them i start to cry cause i think about leaving them here alone with just there mom. My wife told me to come off the anti-depressants but there lies another problem i started them cause i feel anxiety and panic alot! i dont know if i have a depression cause what im feeling right now is depression.. i'd like to go back to when i was just taking 10mg of prozac for 4 weeks i felt better then when my doctor upped my dose...  my brain went fucking haywire.  I'm not decreasing my dosage at all im quiting this shit im tired of it
