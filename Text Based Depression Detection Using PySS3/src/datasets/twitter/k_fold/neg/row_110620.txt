One day I will do itIt won't be today, tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or even next week. But one day after these thoughts that have been brewing for 15 years don't subside, it will be one of the most rational decisions I ever make. One day when I am thinking logically and not feeling emotionally, I will finally kill myself.
