I'm at my edge, starring into the abyss...I can't do this guys... I can't fucking do this.. I'm trying so hard... But i just can't... I'm lost.. Hollow, empty, worthless, disgusting, less than average... My life holds no value.. I was a fucking accident anyway... I wont do anything great with my life.. I'm not going to change the world... I'm not even going to change someones life... I'm lonely... So fucking lonely... I'm not particularly smart... I'm not even close to attractive... I'm stoic... I'm cold... I hear voices and see monsters... My health is already declining... I don't have a reason to live... But so many not to... So so many... It's already May... I knew i would break when May hit... I had hoped something might change before then... But i knew nothing would... Fuck, guys... Fuck... I can't keep going... I can't keep this facade up... I lived for her... I've kept living so she wouldn't feel like it was her fault... But my suffering is starting to out weigh my empathy... I'm so ready to die... Why keep it up? Why fight it? If not now i'll probably just do it four years down the road... What fucking reason is worth enduring this just to do it later? I'm not meant for this world... I'm just a drag on already rapidly depleting resources... I'm a fucking psycho... A hideous fucking psycho... Evolutionarily i don't deserve to live... I'm not fit to survive... Please let me take my self out of the equation... Please... I'm nothing special... Nothing worth saving...
