No one gives a shit about meI'm tired of living this stupid life. I have no friends and no one to talk to. I spend most of my days inside doing nothing while everyone else is outside with their friends. I got so upset with myself and felt so bad that I deleted all my social media that I shared with people from school and family. I couldn't face not getting any messages on facebook, instagram, and snapchat, it was like these apps were reminders of what I missed out on. All I see are people having fun but why does it seem like i'm the only one getting punished. I deleted all my contacts and only have accounts where I post about my thoughts and personal stuff that no one else follows. Throughout this whole summer, I have not got a single message from anyone. I feel like I'm paying for phone service for nothing. I think I'm gonna cut it or something. I want to die so bad. I think about it everyday. I cut my wrists, arms, shoulders, thighs, hips, basically anywhere especially if it is easier to hide and I hit myself with hard objects at home like hair brushes and blocks of wood or anything that is heavy. I think I'm gonna start getting syringes and poking my arm to drain my blood. I guess thats another way I can kill myself.
