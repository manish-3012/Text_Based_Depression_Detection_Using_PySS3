having really erratic behavior. Constantly thinking of suicide.some of this from alcohol but this is the problem.I really don't know what day it is. Friends won't talk to me anymore. REally having a hard time differentiating when I am asleep and when I am awake. 

I call crisis lines but they just tell me to go to the hospital.  I go to the hospital and they throw me in a psyche ward.  Then I get out then it all starts over again. 

found out they say I have borderline personality disorder. Knowing that seems to have made me even crazier. 

I just really feel like I am about to die suicide or not. no one left to call. I am not a little kid.  I am middle aged. And I am  scared. I am pretty sure I almost got committed last thursday. 

ONe minute I am laughing, next minute I am crying. 

This morning was so weird.  I kept getting out of bed and doing stuff but I wasn't out of bed.  I was asleep dreaming I was awake. It must have happened 10 times.   I mean you wake up get out of bed, cook some eggs and bacon.  Oh no you don't. You're still asleep. 

Feel like I am going crazy and no one will talk to me anymore. I really don't feel like I am control anymore.  I feel like I am just along for the ride and there is no telling what is going to happen.

so fuck me.  fuck. I wish I was dead.
