I'm just so messed up.I've felt this way for a very, very long time. My depression and anxiety have taken its toll on me. I didn't realize it until today, but I've slowly been pushing everyone that cares away. I'm so sorry to whoever I've hurt. And for the ones who, for whatever reason have stayed through all of my bullshit, thank you. For the ones who left, I don't blame you. I don't want to die, though. I think I'll admit myself tomorrow if this doesn't go away and see where it goes from there...
