Iâ€™m left with an even bigger mess because of my failed suicide attemptIt was a laughable attempt but the feelings were real.  Something thatâ€™s fucking me up even more was the fact I was supposed to work today. I promised Iâ€™d get the work done and myboss needed me and counted on me to get it done . I decided to take the pills instead. Iâ€™m emotionally exhausted and donâ€™t want to deal with anymore shit but she keeps texting me. I let her down and I feel awful about it. I donâ€™t know what to say to her. I wish I knew of a way to end everything right now. Seriously considering getting and consuming as many several boxes of gravol or whatever sleeping aids I can get. Of course Iâ€™d have to steal them because Iâ€™m a 30 year old fuck up with only $2 to my name. Maybe sheâ€™ll disappear by the time I wake up? Seeing as I have no other option but to wake up :(
