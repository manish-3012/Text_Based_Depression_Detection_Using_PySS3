My suicide noteContext: I wrote this about a week ago. I was very very close to ending it all. 




Dear everyone that has ever known me,

I'm sorry. That's all I can really say. I'm sorry for never being there. I'm sorry for being week. I'm sorry for never caring. I wanted to. I really did, but I couldn't. I felt like I'd get hurt again. I've been hurt so many times I don't want to feel it again. I feel as if everyone is better off without me in their lives anyway. Wether it was my constant need to talk 24/7 or if it was me just being a bother, you'd be better off and happier without me. 

P.S. **** I'm sorry but please don't give up like I did. Your so beautiful and strong so don't quit like me. Also please stop cutting. We both needed to stop and maybe you'll be able to without the stress of me in your life.

Sincerely, ****
