I feel like it's the only thing I deserveI am such a horrible horrible person. I've done so many things to so many different people and made life worse for nearly everyone I've ever met. Which sounds like an over exaggeration, but it's not. I don't even want to go into details about what I've done wrong because there's nobody on this world who could be THAT understanding. I have a few friends, but they'd never look at me the same way, and I'm not in the mood for being blamed or judged or whatever. But I feel like it's something I need to talk about, to tell somebody about but I just don't know anybody who wouldn't blame me for all of it or understand. The only person on the world who I'd have been able to talk to about this left me today. But I did ruin a lot of things for him, too. So I don't blame him. I honestly don't think I can recover from this. I don't want to die, but it feels like that is the only option to put a stop to everything. I'm always going to be a horrible person. I'm always going to carry the weight of every bad thing I've done to people on my shoulders. I can't get over anything I've done. I know I'm really young, that there would be more to life one day but right now my life is too much for me and I am not strong enough to get passed this. I really don't know what else to do.
