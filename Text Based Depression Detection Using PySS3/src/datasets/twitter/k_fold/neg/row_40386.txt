Advice: How to help a suicidal friendSo I spent most of today running around my city looking for a friend who tried to OD on Heroin. I had known she was depressed for a while but never suicidal. I found out of my friend who was also her dealer when he asked me if I had her number. Me, her boyfriend and two other friends spent nearly 4 hours looking for her only to find her strung out on a park bench. We took her home and had a sit down with her family who said they'd take her to the hospitals first thing tomorrow morning. Now I'm stuck her not knowing what else I and my friends can do to help her.
Is there any advice you could offer?

Sorry if this is just a mess of a post I'm still kind of in shock.
