beyond helpItâ€™s currently 6 am, still havenâ€™t slept, Iâ€™m exhausted yet restless, mostly numb.  Been living my life on autopilot for as long as I can remember now, most likely uncomfortably high.  Iâ€™m not sure what I want entirely or what to do, but the feeling of emptiness and loneliness wonâ€™t go away.  I feel so out of place just about everywhere, and everything makes my skin crawl.  I hate that I canâ€™t genuinely immerse myself in anyone or anything for too long, without feeling anxious and paranoid.  I have a bad habit of detaching and disappearing when I finally become a part of something that makes me happy, then watching myself destroy it and me.  Because of this I lost my best friends, hell my life support, which I didnâ€™t realize would hurt so damn much.  Theyâ€™d been nothing but supportive until Iâ€™ve slowly but completely detached myself, so only Iâ€™m to blame.  When I was a freshman, a senior raped me in my school.  He stole my virginity and I didnâ€™t do anything but bottle it up and push it to the back of my mind.  Then I dropped out with 2 credits left during the last semester of my senior year because I was too weak to handle the toxic environment and people. Being home wasnâ€™t any better, especially when my own sister would constantly remind me that Iâ€™m â€œa mentally ill, ghetto, lowlife who canâ€™t even finish high school.â€   All Iâ€™m doing is proving her right.  Iâ€™m Asian and my family, being traditional, didnâ€™t acknowledge my depression until I was in the ER.  Iâ€™m turning 19 this month, truthfully I didnâ€™t even expect to make it to 18.  Iâ€™m so lost and tired and tired of being tired.  I really really try to keep in mind to take it day by day, and that tomorrow will be another day, but it feels impossible.  I know what I need to do regarding â€œmy future and my careerâ€, but I hardly have the will to get out of bed and eat anything.  What fucking frustrates me the most is that prior to something, I managed to be top of my class, participate in sports, work 2 jobs, and keep a social life, so I KNOW Iâ€™m capable, I just canâ€™t give a shit.  Whatever that something is, I wish I knew.  Iâ€™m in a dumbass cycle where Iâ€™m trapped because Iâ€™m not trying my best, but Iâ€™m not trying my best because Iâ€™m trapped.  I want to care so badly, I know my mom is hurting when she thinks about me.  If it werenâ€™t for her and my boyfriend (and weed), I wouldnâ€™t be here to type this.  Iâ€™m glad to have found this sub because I donâ€™t know who I can talk to and I feel like Iâ€™m losing my mind, I definitely donâ€™t want to put this weight them.  But even when Iâ€™m with my bf, whom I love with my entire being, I still canâ€™t help but feel lonely, which makes me feel guilty and worse.  Not too recently Iâ€™ve been using more and more xans, percs, oxys, whatever downers, since it makes the â€œsame shit/different dayâ€ thing easier, unfortunately I ran out last night.  Iâ€™m so fucking worthless and useless, an absolute waste.  Every step forward I take ends up being 1000 steps back.  If one can go below rock bottom, youâ€™ll find me there.
