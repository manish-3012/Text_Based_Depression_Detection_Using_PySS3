How do you learn to continueI've posted her more times now than I want to admit. I've received helpful comments and don't want those who've helped me to feel like they didn't do good enough. Even still...

How do I continue to live? I've past a certain point where all I wanted was to kill myself. Now I'm still that point where I just want to die. I just...I don't know how to live. I don't think I can contribute anymore. In everyway possible I feel like that pathetic sack of shit that peaked in high school. Ever since my junior year I've lost motivation, friends, money, social skills...things I never had in abundance but now I don't have at all. I can't seem to keep a job, I can't seem to make real friends, and it's not of the fault of anyone but me. I spent time with my parents today and the entire time I felt pathetic and worthless. My other two siblings were at their jobs, one a fulfilling career and even still they're looking to move on, move out, and move forward. The other, younger than me, working nearly 30 hours a week while I'm their first year of college. And then there's me. The son they took on a trip out because they know he doesn't leave the house on his own, the one they knew was free because he does online school and is unemployed...I have nothing to give I felt so pathetic as they tried to take care of me and show affection. I'm just a pity project. I'm a grown man who can't suffice I...I just don't know what I need to do. The world rightfully looks down on me because I'm just a sorry excuse for a human. How am I supposed to keep living? At one point I balanced it all. Career, money, friends, school...now I can't even take care of myself. Why would I want to live when I know that the best is already behind me cause I'm such a failure that I've already had the most successful time so early? I'm over a quarter through my life and it's only going downhill...why would I want to live with nothing to look forward to?
