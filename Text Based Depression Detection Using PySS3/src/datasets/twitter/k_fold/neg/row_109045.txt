my friend wants to kill herself. please helpthis might not be the best place to post, but here i go.

i've known her since august of last year. she immediately liked me a lot and i felt like i liked her too, so we started dating. it was nice. but due to many things happening in my own life, i decided to end the relationship in march of this year. we ended things on pretty good terms and are still talking very regularly.

she has been struggling with suicidal thoughts for a very long time, but nowadays much more than usual. life has been very tough on her lately and her psychologist doesn't help her as much as she needs. i've been trying to support her as much as i can. but she just confessed to me that she wants to try to kill herself soon, maybe tonight. she told me that she's feeling especially lonely; her friends have been unresponsive when she tried to reach out to them. she told me that she feels like a burden, and that she deserves none of the good things she has. and our breakup is still hard to deal with for her because she still very much loves me.

please tell me how i can best support her.
