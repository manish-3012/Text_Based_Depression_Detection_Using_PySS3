I was supposed to kill myself today.I planned on killing myself today but I pussied out. I tied the rope and put it around my neck but I started hyperventilating and couldn't do it. I've always had fantasies of hanging myself and I'm disappointed I didn't do it. I'm a fucking failure and a lowlife degenerate and I don't deserve to live.  I wish I had a gun so I didn't have to think about it. Just get it over with.
