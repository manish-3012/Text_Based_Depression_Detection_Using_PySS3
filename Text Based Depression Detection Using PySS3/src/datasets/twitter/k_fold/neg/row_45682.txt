I start school tomorrowAnd I just want to die, school just makes me want to end my miserable life, I don't even know what it's supposed to do for me, cause all I want to do is be a musician, I wanna be a singer, and I'm likely to die by 25 anyway, but yet I'm put through all these bullshit classes, when they make me miserable.
