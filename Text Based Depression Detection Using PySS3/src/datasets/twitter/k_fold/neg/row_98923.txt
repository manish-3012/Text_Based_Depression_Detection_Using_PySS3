Haha...No thanks.(Please don't try to guilt trip me. PMs welcomed. )

I'm just done right now. I really can't go on like this anymore. 
My parents are fighting. My grades are dropping. I'm losing friends, I'm losing sleep. 
My family is agressive twoards me, I can't seem to do anything right with them anymore. 
I feel completely alone. I just want to die.

I'm sorry, lo siento.
