One person is my reason to liveShe is my only reason to keep living, said she loves me? I have no idea how or why Iâ€™ve been a fucking disgusting mess since we meet. Itâ€™s not fair to her for me to stick around and continue to be a piece of shit, I try to isolate myself to not hurt anybody, but itâ€™s like no matter what youâ€™re gonna hurt somebody, and in turn that person is gonna hurt somebody and itâ€™s a never ending cycle
