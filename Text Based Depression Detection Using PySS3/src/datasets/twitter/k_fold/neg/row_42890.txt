Chronic pain for over a year with no diagnosis and no end in sight, and it keeps hurting more. Also comparing my predicament to Cyberpunk 2077's story because that hits way too close to home for some reason.Basically my head hurts non stop and there's no cure or cause, I'm tired of even thinking about it so won't go into too much detail. Spent whole year going to doctors. I can't work or study in this condition, I can barely play video games or do any of my old hobbies. So when I'm out of savings in a few months I am kinda out of options for what to do.

I have slept for 3 (or 4?) days straight this week just because it hurts so damn much. It took me a while to actually fall asleep but I managed to go back to sleep as soon as possible every day.

I'm slowly going through Cyberpunk 2077 right now, just finished it, and if you played that game's prologue or seen trailers for it you know that the protagonist, V, is in a similar situation except at lest they know wtf is wrong with them. Damn that game is good, and for some reason speaks to me so much, so many coincidences with my irl predicament.

* Something causing pain in right side of head somewhere behind the ear? Check.
* Getting strong visual artifacts / glitches in vision? Check (visual snow).
* Audio glitches at the same time? Check (very loud tinnitus).
* The only difference is that V gets those once per day but for me it's constant all the time 24/7 since last year. At least I don't vomit blood...
* Nickname is V(ec). Check. Almost feels like the characters are talking to me directly.
* No known cure? Check.
* &gt;!In one ending you have to perform months of mundane medical tests that end with the doctor telling you what amounts to basically "idk".!&lt; Check. **Can show the middle finger to the cold hearted and dismissive doctor 10/10 game of the year!**
* &gt;!Have the option to end it all? V had a gun at least. I won't do it without a good way out. !&lt;

Comparing my life to a stupid video game like an idiot. I am going crazy actually. Because of the pain! Haha. I even have the urge to pull the pain out of my head too just like V wants to at one point, though there is a biochip in that spot in the game. In one of the endings &gt;!you can kill yourself and then get a bunch of gut wrenching calls from V's friends.!&lt; It broke me so much, I had tears in my eyes for the rest of the day. I don't want to do that to others. But on the other hand I don't think I can endure this torture for them either. That wasn't the first ending I got, so at least that's good right?

So in most of the endings &gt;!V gets only 6 months to live, and there is even a small bit of hope for a cure. I think I'm gonna give myself 6 months too.!&lt; Who knows, maybe I'll find some way to turn things around.
