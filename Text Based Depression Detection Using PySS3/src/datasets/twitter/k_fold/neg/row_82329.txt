I don't know where else to put thisI can't get myself to stop thinking about it. I can't really get help either, I don't have access too therapy or friends that would want to help.

I don't know how to feel, I'm so confused about my situation. I've been wondering for a long time if I'm being abused. My parents called me names (retard, dumbass, idiot, etc.) They've punched, slapped, hit me with a belt and now I'm scared to talk to them but I also feel like I'm just overreacting. 

I don't know how to deal with any of this it's overwhelming and it's making me so exhausted. I can't do anything and I just want it to end.
