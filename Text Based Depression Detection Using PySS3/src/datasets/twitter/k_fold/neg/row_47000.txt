My funeral would be cheaper that getting help.At least I tried.

My insurance doesnâ€™t cover mental health. It would be nearly a $100 every week to see a counselor and about the same, but monthly, to see a psychiatrist. I canâ€™t afford this. I donâ€™t even have a job because I canâ€™t even leave the house anymore due to depression. 

I really tried getting better, but itâ€™s impossible. My money would be better spent on funeral arrangements than counseling and psychiatry that I would likely need for the rest of my life due to bipolar disorder.
