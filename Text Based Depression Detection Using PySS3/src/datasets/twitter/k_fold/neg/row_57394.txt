I said I wasn't thinking about suicide, but I really am.Yesterday I made a post with all my problems. I said that I wasn't thinking about suicide. Today I checked my grades an I have a GPA of 2.34. This is the 2nd time I've thought about suicide this year. 

I don't know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't know what I'm going to do after Highschool. I don't have anything in life planned. I have no "special talent". Everyday, I browse reddit. Learn random facts. Play runescape, yes runescape u can say w/e u want, but it's the only game keeping me calm. I have made friends over runescape, some I've talked to so much that I feel I know them more then any real life friends. 

This 1 class, I have an F. Mandarin language class. Every time I think about this class, I want to kill myself. I hate it. I want get out. Countless times I've told my parents. They never listen. I can't bring myself to tell them that I'm thinking of suicide.

I'm talking here hoping someone will listen. I have been thinking about talking the school councilor. But talking to people about this is hard.
