Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m so tired of everything. Iâ€™m tired of being a burden and a failure and the problematic child. Iâ€™m going to be turning 21 this April but canâ€™t find the motivation to care anymore. For my birthday I want to slit my wrists and slowly die in my bathtub. My life is so meaningless. My family would be better off with me dead and forgotten.
