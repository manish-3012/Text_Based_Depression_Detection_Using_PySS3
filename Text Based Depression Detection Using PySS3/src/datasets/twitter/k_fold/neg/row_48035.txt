I need help please..I'm such in a depressed state because of school, I can't even think good anymore , I'm 17 and I have a decent life , but recently , I'm so sad and stressed that I constantly think about suicide, and about how I'm such a mess..., I've never been to a doctor for my mental health, and I've never told people about my depression, but lately is too much for me.
