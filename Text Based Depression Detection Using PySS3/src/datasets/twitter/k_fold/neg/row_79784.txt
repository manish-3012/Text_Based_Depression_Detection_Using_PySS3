Can someone please love me?Anyone? :(

I've never been loved in my life. I've never felt the touch of someone caring or been told I matter or mean something.

I've never known affection or friendship. I've never been held and told I'm worthy of care and compassion. I've never seen a gaze of pride or warmth or endearment.

I pine every day for someone to show me kindness. For a soft embrace or a gentle caress. I cry and scream and shake with desire for it every single day and it never gets better. I make myself sick because I want it so bad. I throw up and then scream and then throw up again.

I just wanted love. For so long I just wanted love. I wanted somebody to be happy I was around. I just wanted a hug. A cuddle. A caress.

I've never known anything but coldness and darkness and fear.

I've never known anything but hatred and wrath and violence.

At most, I've known indifference and tolerance.

But not love.

Never, ever love.

I watch everybody around me taking love and affection for granted and it makes my heart hurt.

Every day I'm in pain. Every second. I wanted something so simple, so trivial to everyone else, but I'll never have it.

Someone tell me what it's like before I go. Tell me what I missed. Tell me what might have been.

Anyone...

Just hold me...
