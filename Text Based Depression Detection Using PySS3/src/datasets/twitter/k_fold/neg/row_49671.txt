college hellHi everyone,
It seems as if I have reached the end of a very long tunnel, a rock bottom.
I have suffered from depression for years, but never has it been this bad. I am healthy, am surrounded by people who love me, and am at a great university, yet the thought of getting out of bed each day is unbearable. 
Every interaction with another human leaves me wondering if they hate me. I canâ€™t see why they would like me, and I try to convince myself otherwise but it is impossible. I am disgusted with my body, my embarrassing personality, or my lack thereof.
I am a shell of my former self. I crave love but I will never allow myself to feel. I get blackout drunk every Friday and Saturday because the only way to ease the pain is to not remember it. I suffer from DP/DR, which makes like a living hell and leaves me begging to live a life in which I can believe is real. 
And so ends a simple story. A desperation, longing for some sort of comfort maybe. My mind is empty yet racing. 
Please feel free to share your stories (i love to listen). I hope that maybe, with the social media scam that college students often portray, some can find their stories here.
