Fuck me and my inability to manage stressI feel so tired and unmotivated.  I haven't been sleeping right (4-5 hours each night for the past two weeks) and my eating is off (only had a slice of pizza and half a protein bar all day). I talked with student services at my college and withdrawing from classes for medical reasons will still fuck with my transcript and possibly affect mh financial aid. It's almost like they are trying to tell me it would just be easier to kill myself or run off. I may have made a mistake (or not depending on how its looked at) by asking my chem professor what a medical withdraw would do first. So now she knows something is up, but she's the only one so thats good I guess
