I wish I didn't surviveI actually made an attempt last week. I took a lot of pills and said my goodbyes. I was ready to just die in my sleep. Unfortunately I woke up much later and had to stay in the hospital for a week.

I'm so angry. Why couldn't I just die?! This is unfair. I really want to try again with more pills but I don't want to fail and get sent back to the hospital. I'm alive for some bullshit reason. Everyone keeps trying to give me positive talks but I just don't want to hear it. Nothing can help me. Not medication. Not therapy. Not a positive affirmation in the world can help me. I want to be with my love but I guess I'm supposed to suffer. I just want to fucking die already.
