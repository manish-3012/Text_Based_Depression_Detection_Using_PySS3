Does life ever get better?I'm 18, and i've been homeless for 9 months. My dad was sexually abusive, so I left my home. I just graduated high school a few months ago, and I've been working full time for a while. No matter how hard i try I just can't get out of homelessness. 

I had a section 8 voucher and put in applications for housing, but they all got rejected. The advice i got from my caseworker was to continue on with section 8, and get an extension.


 I had section 8 for 4 months and every application got rejected. I don't have any credit history, or a cosigner/guarantor, or 3 times income for any place. 

Now, I've been applying and everything has fallen apart. Due to the above, none of my applications get accepted and I don't have any family or friends here.

Everyday is a living hell, and sometimes I think about prosituting just so that i'd have a place to live. I'm not sure how much longer I can do this before I break.
