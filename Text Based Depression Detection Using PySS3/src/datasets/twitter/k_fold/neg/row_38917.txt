I'm getting really tiredI'm completely overwhelmed. I just broke up with the love of my life because she can't emotionally commit to me, aka she still has feelings for her ex, and I feel like my life is crumbling. I have a dead end job that I hate and literally reduces me to a dancing monkey. I'm 23, have no idea what I'm doing with my life, I really do want to just die, and I feel like the only thing holding me back is knowing what it would do to my family...
