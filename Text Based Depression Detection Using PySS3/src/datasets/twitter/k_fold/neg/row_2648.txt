I just think i shouldn't even try anymore.For a while now I have been feeling so weird as if, my feelings are completely numb.
I am confused because of everything that is going on, and to be honest during the day I just want to end it so I don't have to suffer.
It hurts me, because I put a fake smile on for everyone and pretend to be in a good mood.
At times I just want to cry and punch the walls, because of what happened in the past and now.
The reasons, I have no friends only acquaintances but it feels they always forget me.
I am two grades below where I am suppose to be and I feel like a stupid person.
I feel as though I make my mum and dad think I am a 
waste of air in the house, because I don't do my chores often because of my bad sleeping habits.
I feel like a no body when I go out, I try my best to ignore peoples stares ((I am a skateboarder)) and it feels as though they are judging me.

Lately I just want to hide and never be seen again.
So many things are going on and I don't seem to have control of my mind and thoughts.
I am scared and confused now, even sometimes to scared to get out bed.
I am lost and I don't know what to do anymore.
