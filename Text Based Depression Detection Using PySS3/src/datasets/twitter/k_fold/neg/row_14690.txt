Do I deserve to die?Iâ€™ve never been an easy kid. Iâ€™ve always found a way to make trouble for my family, Iâ€™m a disrespectful lazy retard who doesnâ€™t even deserve to be alive, much less waste my familyâ€™s time and resources. Iâ€™m so fucking stupid I donâ€™t even understand what I did wrong this time. The only way I can imagine making everything right is offing myself, as there is no possible way for me to stay alive and not be the disgusting waste of space I am. It might make my family a bit upset during the aftermath, but Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll look back and see this was for the better. I just need to figure out how to do it without screwing up like I always do, I donâ€™t want to make things even worse by racking up medical bills. Iâ€™m just so tired of trying my hardest, Iâ€™m so stupid everything I do makes them mad. Iâ€™m sorry for being born and Iâ€™m sorry for making you deal with me
