School counselorsSo I broke down last night and told my best friend about my plans to kill myself. She told me that I need more support than she can give and I need to talk to someone. She recommended my high school counselor but I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s a good idea or not. I know counselors say that theyâ€™re here to talk to but it seems like mostly they just handle schedules and stuff. Also, what would they do if I told them? Idk Iâ€™ve just been doing really bad lately, the only reason Iâ€™m still here is because I promised my friend Iâ€™d try to reach out to someone first.
