I have everything going for me and it still isnâ€™t enough.The guilt is immeasurable. I have a great career, an amazing wife, pets that love me unconditionally, but I still think about killing myself every single day. I havenâ€™t. I donâ€™t know if I ever will. But living with this pain every day and burying it is getting to be too much. I donâ€™t know what to do.
