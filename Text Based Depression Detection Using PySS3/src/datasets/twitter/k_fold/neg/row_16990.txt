Suicidal thoughts without action?Iâ€™m a 16 year old with depression and anxiety. I struggled with self harm in middle school and Iâ€™m clean now, but my depression still hasnâ€™t gone away. I can be having a good day and then my anxiety and depression convince me that no one cares about me, or that I should kill myself. My mood is completely down for the rest of the day because my anxiety makes up fake scenarios of those I love telling me hurtful things or not caring about me at all. I will think of how I would kill myself, everything I would say in my suicide letter, what I would text those I care about before taking my life, what would their reaction to my text be, and what would happen if I survived and saw them again. It is almost comforting somehow and I think about it the rest of the day/night. Iâ€™m never going to take the action, I just keep getting these thoughts and itâ€™s terrible. I have so much crap Iâ€™ve gone through or that my anxiety makes up, that one minor thing that is silly can make me have suicidal thoughts because of everything that is built up. Do you know why this happens or what to do about it?
