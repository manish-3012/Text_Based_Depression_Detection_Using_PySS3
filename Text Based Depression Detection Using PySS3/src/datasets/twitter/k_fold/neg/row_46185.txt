Help.Iâ€™ve been sat awake for a while now, feeling nothing. Itâ€™s currently midnight, almost 1am but it feels like 9pm, maybe 10. I feel like I have no sense of time anymore. Thereâ€™s a weird feeling in my head and Iâ€™m sat here crying even though I am not upset and I donâ€™t feel anything right now. 

No one seems to take my situation seriously. I have moderate to severe PTSD, depression and anxiety, caused by lots of occurances in my childhood and with my family. 

Iâ€™ve given up all hope at this point. At times like this I would usually be so upset that Iâ€™d try harming myself but Iâ€™m past that. Iâ€™m afraid of killing myself, but I canâ€™t stand being here anymore. I canâ€™t stand the pain it would cause. Iâ€™ve never felt this empty, nothingness before. It hurts.
