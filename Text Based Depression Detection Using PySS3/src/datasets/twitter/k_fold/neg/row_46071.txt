Don't know if I can recover a second time.About 5 years ago, i seriously contemplated suicide. I told my self if things didn't work out this year I probably give up and accept things would never get better. They actually did and i had a few good years, but my depression got the better of me and everything collapsed. Now I am worse off then ever before, as I this time I have financial debts, and permanent damages to my body from abusing it. Now I have to try a pick myself up again and I just don't know if I will be able to this time. Without the support I had last time and my health issues and age catching up with me I am afraid I will fail. I see the life i could of had and just feel like I missed my chance.
