My final goodbye. Posted here before.[â€“]Serniebanders69[S] 1 point just now 
Update: He fucking unblocked me and he said that he was so angry that he said "When I see your face i will beat the fuck out out of you". I asked him why the fuck he lied to me about the girl and about loving me and he said "Because I can". I begged him to sleep with me for the night and he said "No, I'm getting my sleep tonight. Not dealing with a problem." And he just blocked me again and left. He knows how terrified I get when I'm left alone and I've been getting panic attacks non fucking stop that it's fucking killing me. I just want the pain to stop. This will be the ladt fucking goddamn time that someone hurts me. I still have my rope, I'm definitely going to fucking hang myself. I finally managed to tie the noose. I have been fucking lied to and hurt my entire life. If you need to know the full story, look at my past posts and it details everything. Thanks, Reddit. You've guys have been a very nice community. I can't even get out of bed because it hurts. I love you all. Please be happy with your lives and don't be like me. And Please, love your children and adopt some unwanted ones. I always wished my parents loved me. That was my biggest wish in the world. And without their love look at where it has led me. I kept on trying to find love from the wrong people and every single one of them hurt me. Goodbye. I love you all.

I'll end it before he hurts me. I live in Connecticut and people call me Sol. It's part of my name. So if you see anyone in the news with "Sol" in their name then it's me. Thank you all. I love you people. If only we had met in real life. Love you all, goodbye.
