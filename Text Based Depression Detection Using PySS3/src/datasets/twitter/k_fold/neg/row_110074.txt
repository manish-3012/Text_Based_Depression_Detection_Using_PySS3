Depressed &amp; anxious alcoholic; I don't want to be alive anymore.TLDR: My anxiety, depression, and alcoholism are controlling my life and I want to die.


Throwaway account for obvious reasons... 

I apologize for how messy and convoluted this is. It was difficult for me to type.

Long story short, I did something both horrible and stupid AGAIN after too many beers. I was doing ok for two weeks... I had gotten drunk only twice, granted I still acted like a fool, but to me, twice was better than everyday like it has been for a long time now. So in my head I was making progress, until last night when I added yet another psycho, embarrassing notch in my belt.

I did my usual damage control. "I'm so embarrassed", "That's so unlike me", "I had a few too many", "It will never happen again", etc. Knowing  well that I was full of shit as I typed every word because it's happened so many times before and it will probably happen again. 

But I am feeling like I can't do this anymore. I can't cope with the shame and embarrassment. I can't find meaning in my life or the strength to try and find meaning. I have little to no friends and I am also going through a divorce. I don't have a relationship with my parents either because I had a very difficult childhood and chose to cut contact with them for the sake of my mental health. I also have some pretty deep wounds from my upbringing that I haven't really tended to. 

I am essentially alone and don't really have anyone to lean on or say "Hey, I desperately need help" to. I am battling alcoholism and mental illnesses alone and I feel like I can't fight anymore. I don't really want to fight at this point.

I'm 21, F, attractive, decent body, have a good job, etc. There are things to be thankful for in my life when you look at it from an outside point of view, but I'm not thankful for any of it. Honestly, I couldn't care less.

None of that really matters to me. I genuinely hate myself and see no point in living anymore. Everyday is filled with the same shame, the same negative feelings, the same endless cycles of self destruction and misery. I wake up and face the same demons every morning and I can't go on like this. 

Staring at my wrists and imagining the blood running down is a pleasant visual, and oddly calming.

I'm stuck in this cycle of getting blackout drunk and acting insane, and I don't know how I'm supposed to stop. It feels like this is bigger than myself and I am unsure of how to tame it. 

I don't really know what I'm trying to receive by posting this, but I am so desperate. Any advice or words of encouragement would be nice. I'm hanging on by a thread and am considering admitting myself to a hospital because I feel like I'm closer to suicide than I ever have been before. 

Just please help me, in any way that you can.
