Please tell me there's medicine to reduce anxiety from empathyAnxiety I get from empathy is so much more intense than my regular anxiety and I'm kind of scared that it'll be what finally makes me take the final step. I'm going to ask my psychologist about it asap as well, but it would make me feel a bit better if there is medicine to either reduce empathy or the anxiety from empathy (none of the meds I currently take do)
