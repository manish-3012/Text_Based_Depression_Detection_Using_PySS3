I dont think I'm going to survive 2020I'm staring into the void. Ive tried everything. Medication,  therapy, exercise, whatever other bullshit apparently makes you feel better. I hate Christmas. It was my moms favorite and everytime I think about it and spending another holiday alone, I just sink. I want to take drugs again and escape. Hospitals dont help, they just tell you suicide is bad. What a fucking joke. My life is a fucking joke. Ive read over the note Im leaving behind ober and over again. I want to send it and get it over with.
