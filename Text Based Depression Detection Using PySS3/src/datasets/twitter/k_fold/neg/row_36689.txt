Not an emergency but... suicidal thoughts have come backUpdate: thinking of hangover myself. Anyone there?

I have bipolar disorder and ptsd. I got in another fight with my wife and I left the house. I dont plan on going back to the house til tomorrow. Some thoughts of suicide have come up and i would just like some company. Anyone care to talk?

Edit: thanks to all for your help. I feel better now and am going home soon.
