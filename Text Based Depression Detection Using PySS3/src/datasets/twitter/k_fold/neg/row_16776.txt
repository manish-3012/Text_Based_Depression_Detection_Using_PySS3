Iâ€™m doneMy wife hates me and wants nothing to do with me. Anytime I have a problem she twists it into my mental health issues (I hear voices and people screaming at all times it makes living life hard) she left for a night and did god knows what... 

I had a child with someone before I met my wife and she started stalking me and refusing me access to my son. Heâ€™s a year and a half now and I missed his first words, his first steps... I missed it all... I brought my wife around him for 6 months and then my ex refused to give me access to him. My wife now thinks I ruined her life because she thinks she wonâ€™t be able to have kids and she got attached to him. My family resents me for it and she is claiming Iâ€™m making more money then I am so Iâ€™m going broke spending all my money on a lawyer to prove my income for child support benefits.

 My career has been slowly spiralling. I think more about killing myself then I ever have before. I just canâ€™t do anything right.

I donâ€™t want to be here anymore
