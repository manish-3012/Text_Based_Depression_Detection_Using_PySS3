I wanna dieIm seriously contemplating killing myself right now. My friends dont know cause i have been keeping a happy smile in front of anyone and in honestly tired. There are only some that I told how depressed i was but they brush it off like it was nothing. The only one person i trust has physically hurt me and made me more depressed than ever
