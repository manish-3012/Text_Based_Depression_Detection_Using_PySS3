How is suicide selfish, when ...?Nobody invites me to go out anywhere. I've spent most of the last 7 years sitting at home by the PC, just surviving school.

People make fun of me whenever I try to get out of the lowest rung of society.

I never get a chance to have a human to human conversation. When I try to speak, everyone just becomes quiet and finds an excuse to leave. (I'm don't start talking about anything depressing)

Nobody trusts me. I've never betrayed anybody. Everyone trusts a tattletale more than me.

I am 20 years old and never had a single boy show any interest in me. No one other shows any love, either. I'm loved by cats only.

My youth is waning, but I've never experienced what it is like to be alive: to do something stupid with friends, to participate in a competition, travel around or just do anything, literally.

My lasts three birthdays were spent alone, crying my guts out. Also, I've no longer have any energy to smile, be playful, or try making friends again. I'm broken.

Delusions are the only thing that keeps me alive. That says enough.
