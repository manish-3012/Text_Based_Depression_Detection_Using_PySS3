can someone save me?so my mind is really bad ... it create stories that i know its not true but still affect me, slowly killing me.
i feel empty, i feel nothing but sadness right now, tomorrow i will be alright this will be forgotten, but i know it will hit me again, the pain builds up till i can't handle anymore and i cry and plan my "future" (suicide), i always liked the sound of the ocean... it calms me, the silence underneath, the darkness the thought of breathing and all the pain, all the feelings, all the thoughts vanish, the fact that i will became just a memorie...
right now my best friend is who is holding me up, he know somethings but he does not know why i say he is important to me, why i love him... 
i always say to him that i don't want to lose him, he knows that i have jealous of others that think that they are the real best friends, he is still in school that why he doesn't say to them the truth... my best friend never lied to me, i believe when he says the they mean nothing that i am his only best friend, his brother ... but still ... i'm afraid of losing him because of my mind.
