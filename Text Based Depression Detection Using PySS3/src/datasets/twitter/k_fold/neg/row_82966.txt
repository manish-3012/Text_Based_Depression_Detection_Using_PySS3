Was given a second chance at lifeAnd I didnâ€™t want it.
I still donâ€™t months later. 
I have got no friends, I have got no drive.
People that I thought mattered are never here by my side, itâ€™s always just me. My boyfriend thatâ€™s across the country always tries his best to make me feel better, but it just isnâ€™t happening. I need a friend. I need people that will come over and hang out or pull me out of my house and make me do something. (I can do things for myself, just have nowhere to go/no one to go anywhere with) 
I have never been this alone.
I think ultimately my final decision here is going to be just silently killing myself.

This isnâ€™t all thatâ€™s going on, thereâ€™s so much more. Itâ€™s a big mess. My brain is fried and Iâ€™m afraid I canâ€™t say anything else
