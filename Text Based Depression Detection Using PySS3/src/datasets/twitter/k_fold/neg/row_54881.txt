I was in a toxic relationship, and I laid hands my (ex)girlfriend last week. I hate myself. Please. Help.I was in a two year relationship with my now ex-girlfriend, and it was a very toxic, abusive, and exhausting relationship. We both loved each other so very much, but we both cheated on each other as well. The joy and laughter we have together is genuine and pure, the sex we have is raw and intense but the fights are equally as intense and toxic as well.

Then one day, I punched, choked and kicked my girlfriend. 

And never in my life, have I felt this disgusted at myself. My parents despises me (I overheard my dad speaking to my mom, and calling me a disgrace, a failure, among many other things), I have no friends to turn to, and I am therefore left alone to my thoughts.

Ever since that incident, I can barely sleep. I would get constant nightmares, I would occasionally get breakdowns that would sometimes last hours on end, and I would eventually find myself shivering in my own pool of tears in a cold, dark empty place that is my bedroom.

The mental and emotional trauma has forced me to think about leaving everything behind and just ending it all. I'm at my wits end, I don't know what to do. I'm shivering and tearing as I write this. I don't know what's happening to me. I hate myself so much, but I don't want to die - but at this point it feels like that the only way out. 

TL;DR: I punched, choked and kicked my girlfriend - and my very own thoughts and inner demons are killing me from the inside. I hate myself and want to die, but like the coward and the sad excuse of a human being that I am, I am afraid.
