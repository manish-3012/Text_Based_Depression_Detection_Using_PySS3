i can't do this anymoreall my friends left me because i have such poor control over my emotions. i think things and they just spill out when im typing because there isnt enough space in my head to keep them and apparently thats manipulative behaviour

i've been abused my whole fucking life and developed some really shitty behaviour as defense mechanisms and i'm having a real fucking hard time unlearning them even though im trying. people keep saying i don't try, or that i'm only trying for a short amount of time, but i am CONSTANTLY trying

one of them promised they'd stay but they left. they lied to me.

the girl i fell in love with will never love me back. i snapped at her over a game because of pms and she blocked me and won't fucking talk to me. i can't make it without her, i need her. i love her so much.

i'm trying to get help but it's been days and my shit had to go to a panel so they can decide if i need help. i attempted suicide again a day and a half ago. it's the third time i've attempted this month, but apparently im fucking invincible

i'm not even supposed to be here. i was supposed to die of cancer years ago. why the fuck am i still here? why cant i just fucking end it now. i hate this. i hate living like this. i just want to take a bunch of pills, curl up and go to sleep and not wake up.
