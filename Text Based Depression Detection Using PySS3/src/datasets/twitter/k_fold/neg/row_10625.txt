I don't think I can live like this anymoreI've run out of ideas and I'm feeling like everything is futile. For most of my whole life, people have made fun of me so I have no idea how to interact with anyone, unless I make jokes about myself. This means that I can't have a normal conversation. In my teenage years I only ever used to hang out in school with a couple of other people, and I never did much outside of it. At home, I have a father who screams and shouts non stop, and also insults my mother. We barely speak in my house - unless my father goes on one of his drunken rants where he starts calling me a loser. In my first year of ubi i took a "sabattical" because I didn't really make any friends. I thought at the time that because I was ill during freshers, I would be ok starting over. This hasn't been the case. While some may say I am in a better position than before, the reality is that I am surrounded by acquaintances, but not friends. I still spend most days alone in my room. I still struggle making good conversation with people, especially girls;I should mention here that I have never had a girlfriend, or any girls that are friends. I have absolutely no personality, and it is obvious that people do not want to talk to me one on one.

I find myself worrying non stop about things and I'm getting sick of it. I suppose I just wrote this to vent, because the truth is if things keep goin on like this for the next few years i will definitely kill myself.
