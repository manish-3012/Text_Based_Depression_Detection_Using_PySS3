Why is it always so hard to write about yourself?I wanna tell people what's going on with me but I don't have the patience to process all that pain.

So I guess I'll just tell you what I'm up to instead. Last night I drank to subdue the psychotic nightmares. Cried about war, threw up, fell on the floor, probably pissed off my neighbors. What did you do last night?
