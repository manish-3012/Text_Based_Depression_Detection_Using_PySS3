Life is strange now that I've picked a date...I feel both alive and dead. Every moment takes so much more energy than the last. I yern for Saturday as much as I hope it never comes. I desperately don't want to die, but I am incapable of living this life I've been given.

I'm so fustrated by how unfair life has been. I can't help but have a constant taste of bitterness in my mouth.

I thought if you tried hard enough you could achive anything. But gods have I tried my hardest.

Why is our society so shitty? Why do we not care about those without? So many answers I'm now sure I'll never know.

I'm not looking for support or anything I guess. But perhaps someone else out there gets it too?
