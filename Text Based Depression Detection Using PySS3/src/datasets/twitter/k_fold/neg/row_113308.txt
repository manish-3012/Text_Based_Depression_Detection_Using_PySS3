If this is adulthood, I don't think I can do it.Maybe someone can help me at least feel like this isn't as bad as I think.

I'm in my twenties and I'm rooted in my career and I'm fairly successful for my age. My family life is ok. I have a small group of friends that I see on a somewhat regular basis. I also think about my own death every day.

Sometimes I think about doing it myself and when I've exhausted myself, I think about dying in "freak accidents". I've never actually attempted to hurt myself.

I just feel like I'm stuck in this horrible cycle of feeling overwhelmed by my own thoughts (negative or otherwise), not being able to cope with my mind, and then wondering if maybe there's nothing actually wrong with me and maybe every single young adult goes through this and it's just part of growing up. But if it's part of growing up, does it ever stop? Or do you just learn how to deal with it better? If it's the latter, I don't think I can take it much longer.
