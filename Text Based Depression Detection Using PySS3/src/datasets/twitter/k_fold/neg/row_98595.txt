From a mid level IT guy, to a stock trader, to a diamond and gold dealer, To a dead man.I\`m 35 in south America I\`m in a really crappy situation.

 Each skill toke me from one business to another, but the precious gems and gold trade screwed me up bad...

The fact is over here in Brazil this business is a little bit tricky and nobody does it legally, they make impossible to conduct it legally and licensed, because we have to put up with corruption in government, every tax is literally a disgusting  spit and slap in our faces, it\`s damn stupid to anyone who's being in America or Europe.

As you all can imagine Its not a walk on the park, hiring dirty cops as security because we don't have the blessing of the  *Second Amendment over here, so self defense is illegal here.*

I was born and raise in a great family, in fact pretty well off even to American standards until my father\`s businesses started to collapse, gradually thinks ran their course and I find myself with a over 60 years old mother, a stupid divorced older sister and a 11 year old niece traumatized by the divorce looking up to my like her father. Suddenly I have to provide to all of them. keep in mind the average person over here has to work the first 4 months of the year just to able to pay the basic taxes so it\`s a bit harder than the US

overcame all this crap and became very successful able to provide a very nice life to my  family.

But the stress, pressure from the damn diamond trade started to get me a time bomb, my own dirty cops plotting   to steal from me, other dealer are not simple competition they're my enemies capable of blow my brain in a blink of an eye, of course I  had to adopt the same policy, I had my bacon on the line 24/7!!!!

Just for the record  we don't have non of blood diamonds thing over here, you buy the land set the operation or get approached by random farmer that found a diamond while they were fishing working their land etc... So I wasn't a monster  warlord with slaves stereotype European white guy in africa with private army,   and all that inhumane nonsense doesn't happens over here with the exception of the ruthlessness among dealers.

The horrible things I had to witnessed and do to survive this life crushed my spirit so bad, to the point I started to lose deals, lose small fortunes on a weekly basis, my underworld payroll kept getting bigger and bigger, enemies rattling my cage, more and more, cops/thugs getting killed from both sides, craziness everyday, guns piles of cash, gold bar/ingots at my home everywhere, guns all over the place inside my fridge, bathrooms, showers and having to keep all of this as hidden as I could from my family.

I\`ve decided enough is enough! I had to put my family\`s well being and safety first, what\`s the meaning of having millions and millions of dollars worth of gold and diamonds around my bed, and not being able to sleep because I became paranoid and extremely stressed out about everything, with a good reason because by the time I had being ambushed, attacked, shot at, being in the middle of shootings and having to act on it, it was like the wild-west the fastest trigger lives another day, all of this in a 15 million people city! Sao Paulo!!! I\`m talking about a global business hub with a lager number of private helicopters than NYC not a 3th world big city   But every event that takes place, Law enforcement covers it all because is a the culture of minimize the sh\*t  money people do, especially when those doing the mess feed their greed, I guess all of you guys head the cliche from some scum drug dealer " you become a hostage of your craft"

I never poisoned children with my product, never performed executions, pushed destruction towards the less informed or the exploitation of people with addiction.

I don't know why I\`m even elaborating details about this universe, because... hell!!

every lady dreams about being proposed in  this Disney set up, the charming prince type of guy kneeing and flashing that wonderful  shining massive ring with the perfect F.L. class round perfectly cut gem with the refraction on 100 suns.

I\`m already running out of energy...

needless to say I spent my very impressive  wealth just to get away from this universe 

I still have a nice lake home where my family lives, and I\`m almost 3 months isolated from everything and everyone.

trying my best to keep my sh\*\*t together in front of my mother and niece/daughter.

I\`m running out of money and losing it more and more every day!!!

 I\`d get a minimum wage job to support my beloved ones  f I didn't have so many enemies in town.

to get my freedom and life back I'd have to neutralize at least 8 Mofos but I don't want to do it anymore.

I think the best solution to keep my mom, lil niece/daughter and stupid sister is to run away or off myself but I know going missing would cause them more pain than get my affairs in order and off myself in the less shocking way to them.

I know I sounding very cold about it all, not caring about myself to me etc...

But it comes with territory, this cold calculated way of thinking.

I wish I didn't have to do it, but I don't see any other way out of it. I still see the beauty and I\`d love to enjoy a happy life with the wonderful woman I love but keep her away to keep her save.
