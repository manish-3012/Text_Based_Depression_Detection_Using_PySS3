I don't deserve to be aliveI'm useless, and I'm not even going to be able to finish high school on time this coming year. I constantly lie to my mother and tell her I'm getting things done when I really just browse the internet and sleep. I'm lazy and it's almost impossible for me to force myself to do work I don't want to do. I constantly fail to complete things I told people I'd get done. I said something I didn't really mean to my best friend when I was upset recently, and she cut me out of her life and wouldnt forgive me for it. I only lie and disappoint people all the time, and I never do anything of value. I probably deserve to feel horrible all the time, I'm a piece of shit. I feel selfish for complaining about this stuff too, because so many people are worse off. There are millions who deserve to have my life more than me, because I'm sure not using it well. If I owned a gun, I probably would've killed myself already. I don't see a reason why I should keep going. There's no future for a person like me. I can't change.
