Help with a loved one ...tl;dr our adult son tried to commit suicide for the second time in as many weeks. He is currently stable, and safe at the hospital.

At this point, his mom and I fear it's only a waiting game of "when will I get away with it" .... We don't know what to do. 

For some back story, our son is trans, on HRT and under the care of several doctors, and at least one therapist; he does not live with us anymore - he moved out almost two years ago, and since then he has gone down hill mentally. He's been in a psyche hospital three times now (four once the hospital he's currently at sends him back). He used to talk to us about his mental well-being. Nothing was taboo. We had in depth conversations about what ifs, and woulda couldas, etc. When mom and I didn't have an answer, we sought outside help in the form of therapists or actual psychiatrists (always his choosing and choice, never ours - don't think that we were like "OMG SEND HIM TO A SHRINK"! kind of parents.)

The doctors and therapists and such have swapped up his medications so many times over the past two years - I believe he's been on just about everything by this point. (Since he's now an "adult", I don't know EXACTLY what he's been taking and how things have swapped, only that they have)

I don't know what to do. His mom cried herself to sleep, again, tonight because she doesn't know if she'll have her son tomorrow. His autistic little brother (15) went to bed confused because mom &amp; dad were frantically on the phone with doctors and EMTs when it was his bed time ... and here I am, at 2:30am, drinking and pleading with internet strangers for advice and help because I am so very scared.

I don't know what to do. I am scared. I have always, my entire life, known what to do; for the first time I am begging for help from someone. Anyone. 

I cannot wake up to "that call". Please, any advice,  I literally beg you; provide it.
