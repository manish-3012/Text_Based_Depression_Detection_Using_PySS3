Whoâ€™s Really Being Selfish?Iâ€™m 23 years old, I want to kill myself. I have for 6 years. People say suicide is selfish. But isnâ€™t it also selfish for someone to tell me to keep on living, when they donâ€™t know the pain I go through? When they have no idea how much agony being alive causes me?
