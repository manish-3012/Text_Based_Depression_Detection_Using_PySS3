dont want to but dont know what else tto dohalfway through a bottle of vodka as i write this. i dont normally drink.

im drinkin it to work ip the courage, i guess. I convinced my boyfriend to go out tonight so i would be allone.

i can afford private herlp and the nhs cant really do anything for me,

i dont think theres a way for me to get better. i tried calling forward thinking but i couldnt tell them. they asked if i thought i could keep myself safe and i said yes. i tried telling a friend bit i didnt want to.

i dont know what else to do. 

i dont even know if ill go through with it tonight.  i hope so because i cant do another day of not being able to do anything or even afford food without humiliatin myself.#

i give up.
