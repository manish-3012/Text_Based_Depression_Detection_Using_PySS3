Update: Things not going quite so wellPsy-kosh was kind enough to check in me with a message a few days ago.  I figure I should write an update since my [last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/aq6qw/update_ill_be_on_medication_soon/).  I've been taking Lamictal for the past two weeks or so.  It's still getting into my system.  The doctor had said it'd take about 5 weeks or so before I'd notice anything.  I haven't started my other medication (Vyvance) yet, due to some complications with the free program (namely, I need last year's tax forms to apply... but I can't find them).

I've felt pretty down a couple of times, including suicide ideation.  Nothing immediate.  I'm mostly keeping it at, "In three months when my money runs out..."  I am starting to worry about my money situation.  I'm also feeling extremely frustrated with my incredible disorganization, memory, and attention/focusing problems.  It seems I have a lot of ideas for stories or other projects, but I can't actually do them.  I'm also worried about applying for jobs because I can't remember my last jobs.  I have only vague recollections of what I did.  Usually, there are questions ask about specific circumstances... which I can't answer in details (if at all).  There are lots of moments I really just feel like giving up.  In many ways I already have.  When I quit my last job in the middle of last year, I basically did so with the intention of killing myself once I ran out of money.
