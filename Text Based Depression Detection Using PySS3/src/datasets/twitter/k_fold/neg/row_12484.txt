There's no point in tryingNone of them love me. My body is degrading and fucked up. I'm pretty sure I've fucked up my stomach these last few days between what I've put in and what won't stay down. All I'm good at is freaking out. I'm not even good at games. My mom tried to comfort me and it ended up with her yelling and me locking myself in my room. I just genuinely don't see a point in my life. I never feel safe. I always feel wrong. Even when I'm clear headed and not crying I think about it. I thought I had friends but if I try to talk to any of them they get scared. I feel so alone in my life. My parents have more important things to worry about. At this point my organs are probably worth more than my net worth will ever be. I'm not enjoyable, nice, smart, or even funny. I'm just stressful, boring, and mean. I just don't think any of them would actually miss me. They might be sad for a while but I don't think me being gone would have a negative impact in any way that compares to the positives.
