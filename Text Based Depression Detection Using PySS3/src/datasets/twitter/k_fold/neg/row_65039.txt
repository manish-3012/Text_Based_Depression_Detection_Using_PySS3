Can't bear change. Nothing makes sense any more. I am going to kill myself soon.I'm from the UK. Yesterday we voted to leave the EU. This has wrecked our economy completely. I and millions of others have lost our right to live and work in the EU's 27 member states visa-free. The cost of living is rising.

There's no reason for me to be here. Travel was all I had. I'm trying to figure out whether to overdose on pills, hang myself, jump in front of a train or drown myself. I want to die.
