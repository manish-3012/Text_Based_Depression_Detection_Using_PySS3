I'm losing everything.I've finally been given an ultimatum: find a job in the next two weeks or be sent back to your abusive family and separated from the only one you've ever loved. This comes right at the same time as losing two of the most important people in my life, not to mention two pets who were still just babies. Everything I touch keeps dying. 

If you want to accuse me of being lazy, I don't blame you. Maybe you're right. I've been applying. No one wants to hire me, I have no advantages over the hundreds of other people applying for the same jobs. Two weeks. I might as well go unicorn hunting or set out to become a Pokemon trainer. 

I know - I'm not entitled to live here without paying. We're staying with her mother for clarification. I just can't go on without her. I love her and I'd do anything for her, even if that means getting out of her way permanently. 

The truth is that going back to my family has never been an option for me. Not without her. I will die first. I'm sorry I'm so worthless. My stupid fucking autism and mental illnesses trip me up every time. If I go back to them, I'm back where I started. It's all been for nothing. 

I don't know why I'm posting here. I already told her I loved her and said goodbye. I'm not planning on sticking around much longer. Maybe some dumb part of me still believes there's hope and someone out there can see it.
