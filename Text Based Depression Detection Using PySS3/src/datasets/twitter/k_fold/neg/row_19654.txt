Falling apartI am 21, a mother of a 5 month old, and so suicidal. I just foind out that the guy I've been dating for a year and a half, who is also the father of my child has been cheating on me for a while. With 3 other girls. I was suicidal before, now I'm just done. I want to be dead. I hate my life. I feel awful for my son. I wish he had a good mother. I want to die. I need to talk. Please help. My heart is broken.
