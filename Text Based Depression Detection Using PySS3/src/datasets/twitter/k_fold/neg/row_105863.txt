Unemployed 23M, I can't stop fantasizing about an attempt.I have been battling serious depression for 3 years. I have been getting help for over 1. On fluoxetine as well as cannabis. I self harm, currently 2 months clean.

I'm sitting in my apartment that my parents pay for with my long time friend getting stoned and watching tv. All I can think about is cutting myself, or killing myself. I even saw my counsellor today, that my parents pay for, sigh I will never be abke to function. 

I frequently fantasize about attempting, I don't want to die. I just desperately want more immediate help. I just want to stop suffering. In Ontario, Canada our mental health support is terrible.

I've failed and had to drop out of University, all at once I lost free counselling, prescription coverage and my transit pass.

I'm currently trying to fill out job applications and get my resume out. How am I supposed to work?

I've been hospitalized before and it was fucking horrible. 8 hour wait time in emergency, then a 72 hour hold. I'll go into cannabis withdrawals and they'll shove me full of fucking benzos.

My counsellor wants me to toss the blades and eat, obviously, but neither have happened yet.

My friends and family our supportive, yet I'm still useless. I'm so tired, I just don't want to live anymore. It doesn't seem worth it to me or ever. I'm only alive to stop others from suffering.
