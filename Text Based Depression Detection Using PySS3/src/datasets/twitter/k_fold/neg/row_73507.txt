If there's one thing that I know I want, is that I want to kill myselfFirst of all, thank you for reading this.

I don't have a terminal illness, excruciating pain, debt, problems with my close family, or any other existential threats outside of my control. All issues have been created in my head and come only from me. I've had numerous chances at life and I'm very young (20), yet I have wasted almost all of them and paralyzing anxiety has controlled my life for as much as 6 years. 

My urges of commiting suicide come not from the fact that all doors have been closed, because it's not the case, this urges come from the fact that I have misused my time for the past 6 years, most importantly my college years, and that means that I will not achieve as much, and will always be behind others in terms of friends, knowledge, jobs, experience, money... you get the idea. The expectation that I will always have to put extra work from now on for years because of it, is killing me.

I will be unhappy, having lost all meaning, with a job I dont like, with people I dont relate with or no people at all (I have very few friends and always had difficulty making new ones, I have been told that I may have aspergers), with meager prospects and always working harder for less and for things I dont care about.

My terminal illness is my past, and theres no cure for that. Can I change? Yes. Can I find a person to love? Yes. Can I work harder and try to catch up? Yes. Will I do it? I want to say yes, however, my brain (chemicals?) want none of it and want me to end myself.

Again, thank you for reading this. Have a good day
