idk what to do anymorethis might seem dramatic but i can feel my mental state deteriorating and itâ€™s all because of school. my parents expect straight aâ€™s from me and i simply canâ€™t provide them with it anymore. im struggling to even get aâ€™s and bâ€™s because my three ap classes take all of my attention. i told them i have straight aâ€™s because i have too much pride. i have a fucking c and i have been stressed for two months straight and i cannot go through the day without thinking about school. i wake up to get ready and i literally want to die just thinking about my grades and school. my teachers have no mercy and i just feel like a disappointment lately. i wanted to be a surgeon my whole life but now i just wanna stay home all day and think about if itâ€™s all even worth it because now it seems like nothing even matters anymore.
