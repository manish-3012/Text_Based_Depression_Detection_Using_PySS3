I want to ask a question and I think this is the right placeHi all. 

  So I don't, nor have I ever feared or felt I was going to take action to end my life. However, I've been through a lot of....forced introspection lately and I have started to identify is this:

  What I'm feeling is a dark and cold and sad comfort. One that in this life that wasn't asked for, where everything is changing and nothing is in your control, not even what's going on in your own head sometimes. But the rock - the cold comfort will always be there. There's one thing you can control. It helps calm me down in a really morbid way. 

  I don't know if that's just nonsense or something profound. I just wanted to get it out there.
