Why shouldn't I?Why shouldn't I fucking kill myself right now. I will always feel pain. I always get the same fucking bullshit responses from people. I almost wish I could be tortured. I'd love to cry and scream in pain. I would scream and wish that I had never desired it, but death would come soon anyways. Fuck life and fuck happiness, that myth. I'm going to drink and try self harming for the first time. See how far I can go. Goodbigt
