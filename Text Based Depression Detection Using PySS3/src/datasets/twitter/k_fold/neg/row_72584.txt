What is something you do that helps you cope with depression?Hi, I've been diagnosed with depression since 15 years old, I'm 21 now, since then I've been trying to find some hobbies that makes me cope with it. 

I did therapy for a while (5 months) but it simply didn't work for me. I actually just accepted that is something I'll have to deal with the rest of my life. 

I used to draw to express my feelings when I'm on a bad crisis, sometimes I write too. But now I'm just tired all the time, and can't do any of both to help me.
But I also like to talk and meet new people, that's mainly why I'm on Reddit.

So what is your guys ways to cope with depression?
