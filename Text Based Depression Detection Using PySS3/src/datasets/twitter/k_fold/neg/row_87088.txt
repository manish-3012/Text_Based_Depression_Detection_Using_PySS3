Why am I still here?I am a 13 year old... This may be normal, don't know, don't care.

Today I had a dream, where all my stupidness and anxiety were shown completely raw. All I have been thinking about is what a waste of a human being I am.

There are people around me that are the most hopeful and happiest people in the world... And then there is me... A stupid idiot who can't do something good in its entire fucking life and who is just a hateful and annoying person for everyone around them. 

I have changes of attitude all the time, in one moment you see me laughing like it was the best moment of my entire life, and the next one I am feeling like the worst scumbag of idiotness and shit around the world because of that, people probably have no idea what I am honestly thinking... That I hate myself, for every action, for every word that comes out of my mouth, for everything that I could've been... But now it is just... Me...

I will be completely honest. I WANT to kill myself, I haven't done it yet since, one, I am never completely alone, and two, it will be sad for the people around me... My family, my "friends" if they even exist, and my dog. And I don't want them to waste even more money with a stupid funeral or something like that.

I HATE myself.
