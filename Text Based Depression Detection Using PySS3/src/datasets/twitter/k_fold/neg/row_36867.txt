I'm in a tough spot rnYesterday I got bad news from a friend that another friend of us was put in the hospital because of self harming. Not psych ward but his physical condition. I dknt want to get into details what he did but I feel responsible for it as I told him I'm trying to help someone else and myself when he asked for my help. What do I do? What do I say to him? I feel like I just cant handle it and IF he gets better hes going to end it and then me.
