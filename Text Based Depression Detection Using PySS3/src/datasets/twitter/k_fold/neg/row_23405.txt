I'm so tired..I'm so tired the whole time. Not Sleepy-kind of tired. But mentally exhausted to a point I don't even have energy to breath. Like, it actually hurts to breath. I suffer from depression and diagnoses for years, with bad help from psychiatric ward that both made me feel worse and made me feel hopeless and worthless. My family is barely ever there for me, pretends I'm air. Dad's been alcoholic my whole childhood and mom slept around with guys after guys. Now, they are either super nice and everything, or the meanest and pretends I don't even exist. 

I'm in psychiatric ward again, going back and forth through doctors and psychologists and special doctors etc etc. But I'm so tired. I feel I made a lot of changes in my life to something good. I honestly feeling much better mentally then just 2 years ago. But I'm so mentally exhausted I don't have energy for anything anymore. I don't want to exist, I'm both suicidal and loving life at the same time. 

And I don't know what to do anymore, I just don't have energy left for anything anymore and it's affecting my life...
