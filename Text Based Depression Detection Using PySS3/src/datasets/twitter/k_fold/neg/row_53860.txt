Just found out my ex-fiancee is engagedI'm really struggling to keep it together. I'm gonna end it soon. I can't deal with this shit anymore. I already know the date I'm gonna do it. 10th of July. The day she left me last year. 

Someone on here said that therapy won't help them, only a specific person will. Well, that's how I feel. Only she can help me. But she won't. Because I mean nothing to her anymore, even though she still logs into my facebook. Fuck it, I don't care.

Thanks for listening.
