I don't think I can keep doing this. I'm just so tired, I just want it to end.I'm not going to kill myself, but I definitely wouldn't mind if I died. I don't know where to post this.

I have atypical trigeminal neuralgia, and I have for the last 5 years. Constant severe pain and it's just wearing and wearing on me. I'm 20 years old, I can't work, I can't drive, I can't even go outside if it's too hot. I have control over nothing, I'm a burden on my family. It's getting worse. 

My parents thinks I'm an addict because I'm on a lot of pills. I'm really, truly not. My mom has decided in the last day that she would be better in charge of my medication that I would, even though she has no fucking idea what she's doing. And I'm fighting her, because that's the one thing I can control in my life.

She's made it very clear that she thinks I'm an ungrateful little bitch and I'm crazy and that she is sick of catering to me. She said "If you don't like it, there's the door."

So I said fuck it. I left. I went to the playground. I cried. I calmed down, I felt a little better, I went back towards the house.

And she fucking *screamed*. What the fuck did I think I was doing, I made everyone in the house go look for me. She told me to leave, so I left, and then she's screaming at me because I left. Whatever.

We fought. She took my pills because who the fuck knows, she says I'm worthless, lazy, an addict, crazy, all sorts of nice things. I tell her to fuck off.

Long story short, I'm at a friends house, I hate my family and I hate myself. I'm so fucking sick of this. Of EVERYTHING. I just want it to stop. I just want to be normal. I want five minutes where I'm not in pain. I want to sleep through a night without waking up from the pain. 

I can't keep doing this.
