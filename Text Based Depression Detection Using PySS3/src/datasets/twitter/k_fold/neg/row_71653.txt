I feel lost and Iâ€™m not sure what to doAs the title says, Iâ€™m feeling lost and Iâ€™m not sure what to do, I feel as if Iâ€™m unnecessary here and that I have no real place anywhere, Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore, my family of course is under the expression  that Iâ€™m fine, even though Iâ€™m not, I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore, I feel as if people would be playing phase the lord at my funeral. So I might as well make them happy
