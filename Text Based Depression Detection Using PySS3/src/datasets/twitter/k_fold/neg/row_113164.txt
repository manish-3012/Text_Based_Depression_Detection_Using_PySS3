Mom just called me wondering where I am.... just when I was about to go for it..
Told her I was at home... I was staying with her for mental health issues.. she called asking why I wasnâ€™t home,didnâ€™t expect her to wake up so soon.. I told her Iâ€™ll be home in a bit... but I was ready to end it.. now Iâ€™m more likely to be found soon enough to recover..
