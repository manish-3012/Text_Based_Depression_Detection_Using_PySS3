Today, I am a far cry from the person who loved life.  I don't know if I can cope any longer.If only it wasn't for my family overseas.  They would be devastated on top of all the problems they themselves are living through.  Today, I called them and despite myself it was like a goodbye.  

I've been unemployed/underemployed for the past three years, going on four.  I will be homeless very soon, and the possibility I might be getting a decent job within a couple of weeks will go away with that.  Just finishing it all seems like the thing to do as time goes by.  My suffering will end, but what about my poor family?  I'm afraid, soon I will convince myself.
