advice about a friendMental health is wack, this wonâ€™t be the first time I post here. Anyways, hi. Iâ€™m a 16 year old female who has been struggling with extreme mental health problems since I was 13. Fun, I know. Itâ€™s gotten progressively worse over time as a result of trauma, blah blah. Right now.. I kind of just want advice.

To put it in the simplest way possible; I hate myself. I hate myself in many aspects, and the one Iâ€™ll be talking about is when it comes to looks. I am overweight, I am horrid (thatâ€™s what I think at least, but my family tries to be like â€œoH nO youâ€™re pRetty). Yeah, itâ€™s horrible. I have this friend, Iâ€™ll call her Sarah for the sake of this post. Uh, yeah, sheâ€™s been.. mean?

Okay, Sarah and I have been friends for over three years. As of now, sheâ€™s my best friend. I lost my closest friends awhile back for various reasons, and sheâ€™s been my best friend. I love her, sheâ€™s amazing. Weâ€™ve always had this really close bond, and weâ€™ve always teasingly insulted each other. It was never a toxic thing, but suddenly things are just spiraling in more ways than one. The issue here? She wonâ€™t stop commenting about how ugly I am, how fat I am and disgusting I look. She will go on and on about how disgusting I am, how sheâ€™s so much skinnier and prettier. God, I swear sheâ€™s a narcissist all of the sudden. Sheâ€™ll compare herself to me all the time and invalidate me and stuff, I hate it so much. Sheâ€™ll just go so into depth if that makes sense? Iâ€™ll just be having a fine time, Iâ€™ll feel okay, and suddenly she just starts saying that. It hurts, Iâ€™ve told her this, she doesnâ€™t stop. I told her I donâ€™t like it, she said â€œI donâ€™t know how to respond to that.â€ Fucking, what? Just say youâ€™ll stop? Oh well, itâ€™s fine but Jesus.. the stuff she says is hurtful, Iâ€™m so sick of it. 

I got a job recently, and she wonâ€™t stop asking me to buy her expensive items. Yes, we are close friends, but itâ€™s starting to get annoying. She thinks that by talking dirty to me she can get to me; I used to have a crush on her which she was aware about which is why she does it, but not anymore. Currently I am not interested in relationships, so when she does that I get uncomfortable. Sheâ€™ll be like â€œyou like it when I talk to you like this, donâ€™t you?â€ Iâ€™ll say no, then sheâ€™ll say Iâ€™m lying. She hasnâ€™t done it enough to the point where I flat out tell her to stop, Iâ€™m too much of a pushover and I donâ€™t want to make her angry so I havenâ€™t spoken up.

Let me put it like this: sheâ€™s begging me to buy her things which is getting annoying. I will buy her things once in awhile but she needs to stop asking so often, I have a phone bill to pay and stuff and I donâ€™t make much money. Itâ€™s getting annoying. She calls me ugly and stuff, she knows itâ€™s hurtful, she wonâ€™t stop. These two things top it off, she makes fun of my trauma for one. She hasnâ€™t done it in awhile, 
but god it always leaves me stunned. I went through a lot and confided in her and only her about it, then she makes jokes? This one, sheâ€™s done more than once every day this week. I had a sister that passed away, she wonâ€™t stop making jokes about her. Iâ€™m gonna sound really childish for this, but here goes. My sister died a little after she was born. I never really got to meet her, but it still hurts? I donâ€™t know, I know it sounds stupid but Iâ€™m so lonely yâ€™know.. I donâ€™t make many friends outside of the internet and I just think â€œmaybe if she was alive I would have at least someone who accepts me for who I am,â€ â€œmaybe if she were alive I would have someone there for me,â€ other things. It just makes me sad, itâ€™s impacted our family a lot. Sheâ€™s been making jokes about my sister, and it makes me so angry. I got angry with her one time about it, and she said I was dumb for feeling bad. â€œWhy are you being so defensive about someone youâ€™ve never met?â€ Something like that. It just.. hurts.

God, Iâ€™m so hurt. I donâ€™t want her to act like this, I want things to go back to normal. I donâ€™t want to drop her, I donâ€™t want to be alone, I donâ€™t have anyone else, but still.. I donâ€™t want to spend all this time feeling constantly angry with her yâ€™know? I donâ€™t know what to do, I canâ€™t confront her cause she wonâ€™t take it seriously, she just never does. The last time I confronted her about something she just kept responding with â€œI knowâ€ or something. What do I do? I really donâ€™t want to lose her but this hurts. Someone give me advice, please? Ugh, Iâ€™m sorry if I sound dumb or desperate but.. I am. Also, Iâ€™m sorry if this is the wrong place to post this. Thanks.
