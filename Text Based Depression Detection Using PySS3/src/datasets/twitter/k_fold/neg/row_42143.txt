Urges too strongIve already tried and failed 4 times this year, I've been making plans for another quite thought out attempt instead of my failed last minute ones. But im getting urges to overdose tomorrow which i know has such a low success rate but im not sure i can get myself through it without incident. I have quite a stock of medication's both otc and prescription. I just don't think I can stop myself.
