feeling hopeless and aloneim never going to be good enough. is this all there is to life? i cant ever seem to get my life together. im so sick of these constant up and down cycles in life. one minute its good, the next its bad. "it will all be fine" i hear that shit all the time. well its not fucking fine and it hasnt been for a while. i just dont want to be in this world anymore. nothing makes me happy. i feel horrible all the time. i sit in class and it takes all my strength to just not cry. to hold back my sobs. it makes no difference if im dead or alive. there is no one who cares. no one who understands. ive lost all my hope and nothing is keeping me going besides the fact that i cant honestly find a way to kill myself. ive tried a couple times and failed. i want this time to work. G-d, please take me.
