It was not obvious at first but everyone I loved, cared, friends, relationships have left me.It is time for me to check in I guess. It has been years since Iâ€™m over addiction and hardcore depression but recently I started thinking of doing it again as I have made terrible choices and some mistakes that I donâ€™t even know what they are as Iâ€™m not being told but at first a couple not really close friends stopped talking with me in groups I asked them for a while and got no reply and later I heard they do not want me anymore and this was after a terrible breakup with a person I loved the most and probably hurt the most during breakup, anyway. Later I wasnâ€™t in any groups, nobody was messaging me and I started talking with them but most people had no interest or was just trying to get done with it. And later one my closes friends since childhood openly stated he is not talking to me anymore and said he will never say why and I shouldnâ€™t ask. I made new friends but canâ€™t trust and even the new ones I made was there for my past or current successes or looks or whatever and when they were done, they just left. I literally have nobody to talk to and I even hate looking for a friend or someone offering out of pity as it feels extremely condescending. I am willing to do all the hard work, years of work, at the pace it needed to be, but for most I donâ€™t even know why they donâ€™t see me fit anymore as I was once adored. For the ones I know the reason even if I did everything they see as right for them even on my deathbed I know I would never hear letâ€™s say my ex, the person I was with longest, loved immensely, profoundly, with my everything, I wouldnâ€™t be forgiven. I hate myself and I have nobody to listen how I hate myself. I will keep on moving forward better learned from my mistakes and never repeat, I know but when something good comes to me there is always an expiration date I can see but ignore. If I dropped dead, nobody would even know anymore. I want to feel loved again and I am sober 2+ years but God is it tempting. Like you give them everything and assure mutuality and those friends you had for years with a mistake or even with nothing as I do not know just disappear, live happily and leave you fucked up. Being Bipolar, an ex-Addict and having ADHD doesnâ€™t help either. I donâ€™t think I can ever trust anymore. I love though, everyone, everything. They just donâ€™t return.
