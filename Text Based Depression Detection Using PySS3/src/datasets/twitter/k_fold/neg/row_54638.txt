What is wrong with me?I have such an easy life. Good friends, musical talent, good looks, a loving girlfriend and family. No plan for the future, but plenty to fall back on. Why am I like this? Why is every day so draining? I have two things that keep me here: Music and my SO. Every time I think about killing myself, I think about how unfair it would be to my friends, but they aren't the one's that keep me here. I'm sure many of you know what I'm talking about. Is there a problem with my brain?
