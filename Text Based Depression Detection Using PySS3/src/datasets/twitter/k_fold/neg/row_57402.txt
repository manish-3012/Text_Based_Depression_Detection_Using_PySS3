hope is losti know this is reddit and i'm probably about to be crucified but i really have lost all hope lately and last night's election was really the nail in the coffin. i had so much personal investment in this and my heart has just been absolutely broken. i don't see any hope in the future for me or people like me. it feels like i just get lonelier and lonelier every day as my allies become less and less in numbers and everyone else gets more and more hostile towards me. i really don't have anything going in my life, i have no job, my grades are shit, people generally don't like me, i just spend all my time failing at things and getting angry at the world. i wanted to get into public service but at this point it just seems hopeless. i've been losing my faith lately as well, i'm an orthodox christian by the way, russian born, came to america and all. so much hostility towards us lately but my family is pretty westernized and thinks i'm weird for holding on to my heritage and all. i could get into my life but i'll be here all day. idk if i want to die yet but i think i'm getting to that point. i've been delecting my social media accounts and have generally just been trying to withdraw from people, they mostly just come at me with hostility anyway. mhm..
