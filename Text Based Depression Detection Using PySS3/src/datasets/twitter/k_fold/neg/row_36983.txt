Every day is torture, can't commit suicideLooking for sympathy. I've tried everything to make life bearable. Read hundreds of comments on here too. I'll just skip this part, writing coherently is very hard. Tried killing myself too and failed miserably. First, just preparing the suicide took ages because of debilitating mental illnesses; doing ANYTHING usually requires more effort than I can give. Second, fear. Of the pain. And of the horror in your last moments when you know you can't go back but you instinctively struggle to keep alive, of the nightmare awaiting those who find you, of destroying your body and still failing to die. Third, the knowledge that my death will make the person who deserves it the least, suffer just as much as me right now. While those who took advantage of me and hurt me will still be living happily without so much as a guilty conscience. After that one time I really attempted suicide, I think I should know that I won't do it. I'm trapped here with no way out. Quite a few decades of misery and struggle to come. The pointless fantasies continue though. That's all I guess. Thanks for reading.
