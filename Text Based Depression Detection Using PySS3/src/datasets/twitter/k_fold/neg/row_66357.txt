I'm sorryTo my family and friends.

I really am sorry. I know you tried and even though most of you have no idea what it's like you tried your best to understand. Thank you for being there for me as much as you were.

But it's all too much, the voices, the mood swings, the impulsiveness and irritability this month and soul crushing depression next. The shadows come alive and haunt my nightmares but now my waking moments as well. The paranoia. 

There were so many who were hurtful to me but I don't blame you. I know you don't mean to hurt me. I have never been violent but you treated me like an animal. Laughed instead of trying to understand my feelings, use my delusions as a source of humor. But it's okay, I wouldn't expect you to understand, after all if everyone else says it and I'm the only one not on board maybe I am a monster indeed.
