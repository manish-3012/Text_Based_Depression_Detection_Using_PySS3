ME QUIERO MATARi dont really know where to start, i want to die  and leave all the people that i know behind, cause at leats they will have a nice image of me, instead of keep living against my will and ruining my life, ruining everything, excuse my english, im not native, im from chile, and my country doesnt really have a hot line, i dont talk about myself or my problems i never had anyone to talk to, and when i was little and i try to talk to adults they just dont really care, "oh you just a child, you dont know what your sayinng" i just swallow the pain, the only reason im sharing this here is cause y'all dont know me or will never do, i usually when i see people that i havent seen in years and they ask me how im doing, i just tell them how bad im doing how sad and drepessed i feel, how empty and numb, and thats because i proly wont see them again, and the proly will forget at the end of the day what i just told them,  since i was little i learn how to be in pain by myself, not telling anyone or even given a hint, im 20 years old at the time, my depression  started 6 years ago, when i first got into middle school, to a fkng place that i didnt wanted to go, but you know im a kid so what do i know right ? all my friends from basic school went to other schools, and i was forced against my will to go to a diff one, alone, just cause  its not like my opinion matters, it doesnt, i feel so much anger against my mother, she have take some horrible decitions in his life involving me, i cant really blame her, my fkng father left a long time ago, she by herself raised me and my two brothers... i just dont really know how to write this, excuse my english again pls, even tho i think i know plenty, i never seem to be proud of myself.

Its so hard for me to explain how i feel, im really trying right now,( I HAVE NEVER IN MY LIFE SHARE WHAT IM SHARING HERE), one of the reasons i havent kill myself is cause of my mother, just the image of here crying makes feel like im the worst trash in the world for ever thinking of doing something that would make my mother cry, even tho she has made so many things that had made me cry so hard in the past, i blame her for most of my problems, its cause of her that i got depression, i have some much anger inside me , i was bullied all the time that i spent at elementary school, (i called basic school before sorry) i had toxic family members growing up, i have suffered so much from dumb bullies and from my own family, i feel like im such a good person for still taking to my mom or members of family, like i said i have never talk about this NEVER, all this hate,rage and anger has been acumulating for over 10 years, i remember this time i got into a fight at a party, and i almost kill the other guy, i had to pay for his operations, and that almost got me time in jail, i was 18 at the time,

im tired of living in this wolrd, im tired of this life, i dont wanna live the systematic life that everyone has, excuse me again its really hard for me to write this, i have never shared so much about myself of my problems , i feelt like this is getting long, i dont really know what im doing writing this here, i dont really want to talk to no one, today i missed school, cause i was not feeling well, i dont feel motivated, for nothing , nothing makes me want to anything.

  
sorry i cant explain myself good, is just to hard for me,
