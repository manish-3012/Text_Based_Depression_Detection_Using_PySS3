I want to tell someone that I want to kill myself tonight but I'm scared of the response I'll get.I wish I had the guts to actually tell somebody know what I want to do. I'm scared though think of me differently, or not like me anymore. As if they even did in the first place. I wish I could just text somebody to have someone to talk to, but I don't. I don't want to kill myself whole nobody knows. I'm just too scared of what would happen the next day, or how they'd think of me.

I just wish I could talk to anyone about something, anything. I'm just starting to feel like I can't fight off sadness every single night anymore.
