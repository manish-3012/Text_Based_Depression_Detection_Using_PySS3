My Mom's currently in a deep dark place. Long post, but I still need help with this.Hey reddit. I really need someone to talk to right now, especially when it comes to helping my mom out of this. My mother is around 50 years old, and is in a household raising me, my 20 year old brother and two dogs, while married to my dad, all living in Orange County, CA. This is going to be a long post, so I'm going to embolden everything that's a red flag to her situation, or highly significant in my eyes right now.

About 30 minutes ago, she stormed out of the house, after she mourned to me about her life, **how nobody seems to care about her (Her key phrase throughout all of this is that nobody "Picks her"), and how the hurting would stop and that life would be better off for us (My father, brother and me) if she killed herself. She also noted that if she killed herself, we wouldn't really bat an eye either way.**

This all came after a trip over the weekend spent with my father and brother visiting extended family in San Diego (About an hour and a half away). That same weekend, my mother wanted to go to a dog park brunch event with my dad, but those plans seem to have been scrapped by my dad when he got the call from his sister that they'd be in San Diego that weekend. They had a long argument about it around 3 weeks in advance to this happening, and I consoled her about it in the meantime. I did ask if she would be mad at me or be fine if I went if he actually ended up going, and she gave a yes. After the weekend trip was over, we got back home and **she was silent to all of us. Today was the first time she spoke to me since Friday** , and I used that opportunity to talk about how annoyed I've been at the silence, and the mourning within the second paragraph above happened. 

**My mother has had talk of suicide before**, as she's reached the boiling point in arguments with my father many times, with her getting to the point of yelling, with my dad still in a low tone, confused on why she's mad. **I've been able to calm her down and console her every other time**, and spend a lot of time to make sure she's heard, and that I understand where she's coming from. **This time has been different, since she says that everyone in the house including me makes her feel like nothing.** 

She hasn't had a good childhood, with her parents abandoning her and her 4 siblings at an early age in the bad parts of Baguio, but she often refuses to outright admit her parents neglected taking care of them. After somehow graduating college, she was able to get a visa to the U.S. to help serve in our church, with the main headquarters of it being stationed in Anaheim, CA. That's the place where she met, and married my dad a bit later on. The church is a big part of her life, dedicating a lot of her time to prayer and incorporating the bible's teachings in her life. Even looking from an objective standpoint, it hasn't been too negative, but she admitted in her mourning that **she hasn't been reading her Morning Revival anymore for the part 3 weeks (A sort of prayer guide). I'm not really all that into it, but she's stuck with it for the past 30 years or so, so hearing that was a big red flag. She said that she's felt like she's begging with God for a better life and to not bring her closer to killing herself, but that she's just wasting her time, so she stopped.**


My father has sparked situations like this before, as he's a very energetic and surface level person. He's great at his job, has a scarily upbeat attitude throughout, but is terrible at listening and social nuance. He often doesn't listen to my mother much, and when he does, he misses any feeling or context behind the words. **He's admitted to me somewhat in secret that he doesn't try and listen that much anymore, since he feels like he she's mad even when he tries to get it right.** Short term and long term arrangements they make together get tossed out of the window fairly often, or even if they're attended, he'll be distracted by working ahead for work, playing on his phone, or chatting up strangers. It also doesn't help that my mother remembers mistakes for a long time, so every time he forgets plans with her, Mother's day, or her birthday **(All three are appallingly regular), she remembers it later, and adds to her hurt.**

When she's not busy with cooking or taking care of the house, or if she's been stood up on plans again, she'll usually be on Facebook. This doesn't help things, **as her friends are always posting great romantic trips they're having with their husbands, or wonderful parties they've had for special events, reinforcing the fact that her own events have been shit year after year.**

All the more, she does guilt trip her family a bit, bringing up past disappointments that have no bearing on the issues at hand to try and make us sympathetic to her point of view. This may be a minor point, but my brother told me to possibly post this to /r/raisedbynarcissists instead of here, as he's been a bit manipulative with both of me and my's brother's time in general. 

That's all the backstory to it right now. After she stormed out of the house, I called my dad and explained the situation to her, and  called her afterwards to try and make sure she doesn't try anything drastic while she's out of the house. She answered the call and said she's trying to distract herself from the current situation, so she went out and voted, and was doing grocery shopping as we were on the phone together. She mainly talked about the same stuff she said in the second paragraph, **but focused a bit more about how I'd feel if she was gone. Something that especially stuck to me is that she said she'd "end up as the old lady in the nursing home that everyone forgot about",** and hung up soon after. In the middle of me making this post, she came back home, and has remained silent to me and my brother all the same.

I don't know what to do, reddit. I love my mother, and I care about her, but I don't know what to do. She's mentioning killing herself to stop the hurt, she feels like a burden, and isn't receptive to much consoling like she usually is. I know she needs help, but has gone to marriage counselors and such in the past, but it didn't work at all according to her. I just don't want her to die. I've read all the resources in regards to the talking tips and risk assessment guide, but I need help to help her.

Thank you for your time.
