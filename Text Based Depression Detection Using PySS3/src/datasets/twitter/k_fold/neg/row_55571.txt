no one will knowyeah, since I've mostly stick to making friends online only for the last two years, if i die next week literally no one will know. 

and i guess that's good. i honestly feel like i wouldnt go through the attempt at all but i got pills that could out me for some time and i guess thats enough self harm for these 2 years. and maybe it'll be enough to keep me off another attempt for another 2 years or so. 

it'll be good for me.
