I have no one else to talk toIâ€™m 19 on the outside I have a pretty decent life I guess but behind closed doors I wanna die more than anything Iâ€™ll start from the beginning Iâ€™ve always been bullied in school not having the best clothes not having the best phone then not driving not having friends just was never good enough ya know I developed early but my mom didnâ€™t wanna let me wear bras because I was being too â€œgrownâ€ whenever Iâ€™m sad itâ€™s always your period is coming or she cries and it makes me feel bad so I just pretend to be okay my dad wasnâ€™t around like we would talk on the phone and he sent me gift cards and stuff but then it all stopped I have older brothers one of them is gay so heâ€™s the golden child anything he needs he gets and heâ€™s almost 30 Iâ€™m 19 Iâ€™m not working at the moment Iâ€™ve applied to jobs everywhere no one wants me not surprising tbh but hey school starts in August Iâ€™m just a mess right now Iâ€™m sorry this is probably all over the place if anyone even reads this My grama is hard to talk to somehow everything is my fault I bring everything onto my self regardless the situation I did something wrong so I donâ€™t have any friends and no support system im a cutter my legs are covered at this point it makes me feel idek I can express how I feel on the inside on the outside I carve words and stuff it helps believe it or not umm I met my first ever boyfriend on bumble we went to a movie he was really touchy but I didnâ€™t know how to navigate the situation so I just let it happen I was scared I felt like I couldnâ€™t move I didnâ€™t know if he would hit me or try to do more if I told him to stop Iâ€™d never been on a date before so I didnâ€™t know what was okay and not we ended up dating for 6 months I believe he cheated and didnâ€™t value much I was sexually inexperienced and that changed really quickly he would always touch me or kiss me or make comments about like needs and not being used to not being able to do ...... or ........ to his girlfriend and me wanting to make him happy and keep someone I really loved we ended up having awful .... all the time it was like doing something just to get it over with my first time he didnâ€™t wanna kiss me or look at me he just kinda did his thing and moved on I cried in the bathroom and tried to act like everything was normal i still remember that experience and it just makes me feel so low like so low I almost lost it when we broke up I loved him he was my first everything and he moved on so fast I didnâ€™t get out of bed for a week I couldnâ€™t sleep I couldnâ€™t eat then a while later I met another guy from the same app he called all the time we would spend hourssss talking he was so beautiful I thought he liked me our first date was amazing it was so easy to be around him I felt safe it was really intense obvious sexual attraction from the beginning umm idk it just worked very soon after things went downhill but we always tried to make it work I tried to make things so easy for him I Ubered to his house and home sooo late at night we had .... alll the time I just wanted him to be happy he told me he loved me and that we were something special and we would be together forever now that I think about I was just a toy to him he never cared he never listened when I was sad he didnâ€™t even bring me home when I didnâ€™t have the money to Uber and I would have to ask my mom I just keep trying to find someone to stay and to love me and no one can Iâ€™m just wittle s Iâ€™ve always been really sheltered and everyone tells me I have a very childlike way of looking at the world but like I just donâ€™t understand I just donâ€™t wanna be alone anymore whatâ€™s wrong with me I have so much guilt and shame and embarrassment I just never wanna be seen Iâ€™m a used ugly wh0re maybe all I am good for is ..... itâ€™s the only reason guys wanna even talk to me Iâ€™m gonna be alone forever I just donâ€™t wanna be here anymore
