In the morning I have glimpses of hope, feeling ok, by night I think about how I may end it.At the start of the day I feel a little hopeful, Iâ€™ll research jobs and think maybe I still have a future. Then I see all the jobs I canâ€™t make due to my diagnosis (schizophrenia) and I get depressed. What happens was I am getting booted out of the military for an incident that occurred while Downrange, with left me with a diagnosis. Now Iâ€™m losing my security clearance, my career, everything Iâ€™ve worked for and done the last 16 years is down the drain. I canâ€™t continue my job in the civilian world, I canâ€™t work law enforcement, I canâ€™t continue my pilots ratings. By the end of the day I come home, not even make dinner, lay in bed and start thinking about if I should end it, how I should do it etc.
