I've been contemplating ending itI'm a 15 yo male I recently broke up with me girl friend of two years and I miss her but I feel like I screwed things up to badly I used to be suicidal before when I was living with my abusive father the only thing that stopped me from kms back then was my friend group I'm still friends with them but at this point telling them how I feel isn't helping at all I feel constantly tired and I'll feel like crying but my body just holds back all my emotions and nothing's helped and at this point I feel lost and my parents keep stressing me out over school and I'm doing good at that and everything just feels like it's crumbling down around me and I just feel like everyone would be happier if I was just off this Earth
