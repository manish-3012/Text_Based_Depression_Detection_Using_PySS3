Not currently in danger to myself but might changeHello! To keep this short I'll avoid the details of the story unless it seems necessary, but earlier today there was incident that had me in a depressed state and I barely kept myself from doing something that could be considered stupid. However, the only thing that has kept me at peace for the time being was distractions, but distractions don't last forever. I tried to text 741741 while the incident was going on, but my phone doesn't do numbers that aren't a 10 digit number. Whenever I'm in a state of downtime I can feel the desire coming back. Does this seem like something potentially concerning that I should find help with, or let it go for now and see what happens?
