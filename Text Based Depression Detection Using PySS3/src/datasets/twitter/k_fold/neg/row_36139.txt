I don't have a reason to live and I'm scarred.I have been in a deep Holden Caulfield level of depression for the past few months and last night I put a belt around my neck, I did not go through with the act. I cried and felt like my whole world was collapsing. I don't feel I have anything to live for, I have a mom that loves me and a family that cares but I don't care. I'm trying to get a job currently, and am attending Uni in the fall but I feel too as if I have made the wrong choices with my life. I don't have many friends and my social skills are not up to par with others. I'm 18, M, I workout regularly, but I have a small amount of social skills and nothing I feel to really live for. I also recently came out as bi and am wrestling with self acceptance at times.
