First time talking about this.So, I have never opened up to anyone about my mental issues besides my psychiatrist and I even sugar coat things speaking to her. Some background: I am 25f, once divorced, a veteran with a troubled past, and I have been on a constant battle of "one step forward, two steps back." I have trouble opening up to people close to me because I dont want them to feel at fault or hurt over me. My life has been a whirlwind of addiction (I'm sober now), mental illness, and dealing with the backlash if all that. I feel like I should be in a career I love and be starting a family at my age but I have gotten no where. 

I know how easy it is to say "just go to college, keep your chin up, you have so much potential, etc."  The people around me are broken records. I know I will never do any of that because I lack the motivation and willpower to follow through with accomplishing anything. I'm hanging on by a thread. I took myself off my medications and I am taking a crack at sobriety which is making things worse in my head. It opens up the doors to feeling everything so intensely.

Anyways, I havent made a solid decision yet on when and how I will leave this earth but I know my time is coming whether it be a month from now or 30 years from now. I'm just plugging along and going with the motions to stay afloat until then.
