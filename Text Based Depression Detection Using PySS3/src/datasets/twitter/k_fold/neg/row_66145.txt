I don't want to see adulthood.I turn 18 in two days. I've always had an anxiety issue but lately it's just escalated to a total mess. I'm never in a good mood, and the only emotions I feel are fear and sadness. I'm completely socially inept and I find it hard to even speak to my few friends anymore. I know nothing about life outside of high school and I am totally unprepared for the outside world. The only thing I find solace in is self-harm, which I've told nobody about. I am a complete and utter wreck of a person and I have a strong desire to end my life before I fuck up even more. I have the functional capacity of a middle school kid, so how am I going to be an adult? I have no idea how to drive, I've never had a job, and I don't know how taxes work. Humans are supposed to be social creatures. We've built and advanced our society purely by our capability of communicating with each other. That's why we have language. So why are people like me so incapable of using it in the world? I can barely order food at a restaurant without completely fucking up, and I'm pushing away the few people I could feel comfortable with just due to my fucked-up mind. I'm so fucking done with life. I'm just bad at it. I'm already losing.
