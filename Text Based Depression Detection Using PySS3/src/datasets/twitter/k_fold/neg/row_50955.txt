I admire those who kill themselves.I commented this on a recent post and Ive been thinking about it. Why is it consodered cowardly to kill yourself? Ive stared down the barrel of a gun. Ive had my finger on the trigger. Both times I couldnt go through with it. The courage to end your life, completely aware of the consequences is something I wish I could do. I want to be that man so bad. I want to end myself, cease existing. Bit Im too mich of a coward to do it.
