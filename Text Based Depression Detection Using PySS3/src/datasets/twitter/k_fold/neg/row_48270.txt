I want to dissolveItâ€™s all so meaningless, I wake up everyday just because my body forces me to, I do everything automatically, robotically, not because I want to but because I fear the consequences if I donâ€™t itâ€™s tiring. 


I canâ€™t do things that are important, they stress me out and make me feel worse, I canâ€™t do things that are superfluous, I feel like Iâ€™m just wasting time. 


I canâ€™t deal with this, Iâ€™m not strong enough, but I canâ€™t get support, it feels like whatever I say goes in one ear and out the other itâ€™s frustrating. I canâ€™t do anything if I wanted to or if I needed to I just want to waste away. Nothing feels substantial anymore.


I going to try and starve myself this month, so at least itâ€™s going to be slowly, so I donâ€™t notice it. Itâ€™s the best I can do right now. I donâ€™t have the money to buy a rope and hang myself, this is all I can afford to do itâ€™s all that matters to me
