My mother looks at the as if I'm some kind of abomination because a fortune teller told her I'm faking my mental illnessI've been postponing this for years now. I'm too scared to kill myself because I want it to work out 100%, but there's always a change that it might go wrong. My mother went to a fortune teller. Well, the problem is that she completely believes those people. She even lets them make important decisions for her.


My stepdad has been abusing us for years. He's a disgusting human being - unbelievably racist, homophobic, and a huge fan of Hitler. At this point, I'm very much convinced he's a psychopath. I've been begging her for years, telling her that she should just get a divorce, but she just won't listen. Finally, she snapped, and considered getting a divorce, that's when she decided to go to a fortune teller to make the decision for her. 


Well, turns out the fortune teller kept mostly talking about me after she said that she shouldn't get a divorce because 'it's all going to be fine in the end'. Apparently, I love being the center of attention, and don't want to go to school, and that's why I'm faking the severe depression and anxiety I had been diagnosed with. 


So now, my mom's lovey-dovey with my stepdad again, thinks that I'm just a lazy dirty leech, and wants to kick me out of the house. I mean, she has every right to do so since I'm 18, I guess. But my life pretty much ends here. Right now, I'm taking a break from school because my memory and concentration got so bad that I was failing classes. I haven't graduated from high school yet. I live in a crappy country where you can't get a GED. I don't have any money because my parents never allowed me to get a part-time job. 


So, now what? Is it better to become a depressed, homeless kid or a dead kid? I think it's pretty obvious. I can't live like this. I have nowhere to go, and nobody is going to give me a job.
