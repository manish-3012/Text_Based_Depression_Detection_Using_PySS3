Again thank you for anyone who helps and sorry for the long read

Ive never felt love, or I have when I was born through becoming 6 years old. Then my brother was born, he started getting all the attention. My dad left my family also and my moms main care was to my brother. I was never cared for my entire life, gotten blamed for a ton of things, and have dealt with anxiety and confidence issues. In high school starting my freshman year I met a girl, the first girl I started liking and we started talking a lot and I started coming out of my comfort zone. Someone got jealous of me because he liked her to and he made some rumors about me and she started hating me and started ignoring me. 

But I got over it, she raised my confidence in me and I appreciate her for that and it helped me my sophomore year, I got a job at a fast food place despite being only 15, I got my drivers permit, made some new friends, and started supporting myself, and even gotten into fashion and clothing and even started working on the major I want, which is Multimedia. 

But then the end of my sophomore year, I met a girl, we will call her, Athena, and I new Athena through a friend. I eventually started talking to her because I thought she was extremely cute. Big puffy lips, a narrow yet chubby face, big pearly black eyes, and she was skinny an about 5 foot 4. I fell in love with her immediately, she was an awkward goofy girl. She really liked clothing, and aesthetics, and editing photos and videos. We had so much in common, we eventually started dating after a week of talking and there was talk around all of the school about us. On how we were the most adorable couple, when ever me n her got separated in an assembly or line or anything. Everybody were purposely put us closer together, which felt nice since me nor her were considered popular.

&amp;#x200B;

Weve done everything together, and going on into the end of my junior year weve been dating for a year and a half, weve first experienced alcohol for the first time, we made out a lot and weve ended up losing our virginity to each other.  We have created a Facebook page together with both our edits on and weve reached over 100,000 followers.  I got my license and we would constantly drive to other states and me and her shared the same music taste too. Weve been to 20 plus concerts and even wen to California together when I turned 17. 

&amp;#x200B;

But then she started turning sassy and rude, and I dont blame her I started to get jealous a lot of other guys and I would be mean to her. and after two years of dating and two years of all these experiences with her we broke up. Everyone new and it was all people talked about. Her friends soon got mad at me because you know how girls are towards their friends exes. And they started creating rumors about me. My anxiety started coming up again and soon developed into depression. I started missing school the end of my junior year, about 50 days and lost my credit. I missed her everyday, I have over 1000 photos of me and her, and in my room I have so many gifts and things hse has made for me.  Our facebook page ended up getting deleted and me and her stopped talking, her friends and family hated me and convinced her to stop talking to me. And her being the most caring person in the world, she cared about everyone more then her self, listened and stopped talking to me. I tried \*67 calling her and using multiple texting apps, to try and reach her, but I was denied every single time. 

Summer came and she started reaching out to me again and we would hang out occasionally and she would always tell me that she liked me still and wanted to be with me. But she didnt want to date and that she didnt want her friends to get mad at her for dating me again. When we hung out it was either sex or just watching tv in my room. We never went out because she didnt want anyone to see us together and never let her friends know we were talking again and it angered me and around the beginning of my senior year we got in a fight because I told her if she really did have feelings for me she wouldnt care about what others say or think. She then blocked me again and started ignoring me again. 

&amp;#x200B;

And with the beginning of senior year I was told since I lost my credits I would have to appeal them and if not, I wouldnt graduate eon time. I came to an agreement with the admins that I wouldnt miss more then 10 days and I would keep my credits. But with her ignoring me I havent felt my myself and I started missing days of school. Up to now on this day, I have 10 absences from school. She is still ignoring me and her friends and family still hate me.

&amp;#x200B;

I dont know what to do anymore everyday at school feels terrible, I get compliments on my clothing a lot and it feels nice but other then that everything is terrible. I started hating my two year job and my grades are going down and fast. 

&amp;#x200B;

I started self harming and a lot, all over my thighs and being honest it hurts a lot. I can barely run or walk or stand still in general without my legs starting to ache or hurt. 

&amp;#x200B;

All my friends know Im sad but I dont think they realize the state my mind is in, some of them know about my legs but it feels like they arent really bothered by it. Everyone just tells me that I need to get over her but I cant I literally cant, but they think Im just being stubborn. I have thought suicide on many occasions and I feel like with how everything is okaying out I will soon fall down to these thoughts in my head. 

This upcoming December 14th will be my 18th birthday, Ive spent most of my birthdays alone but the last two were with her and I know my mind is gonna go bad this upcoming bday. 

&amp;#x200B;

I constantly go to the bathroom so stay in my room because everything in my head get shaky and feels like those fuzzy tv screens. These are the times Im scared of because thats when the suicidal thoughts start really coming up.

&amp;#x200B;

I just dont know what to do with work, school, and her. I really want to talk to her,  I just want her in my life again friend or more, because she gave my life meaning. She was the only person who really like me and cared about me. I feel like before the next year I will probably end up committing suicide and im scared.

Idk what to do

I miss her

edit: I have been to many therapist inwhich all have told me that I should get over her and there are other people with worse problems.
