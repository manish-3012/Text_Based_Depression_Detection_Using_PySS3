I hate my lifeIt just sucks. I gotta sleep alone every night, never been loved by a woman . I gotta live the rest of my life forever alone. Im only 20 but I know my fate.
In a different life I could be cuddling someone and be attractive, and loved, and have a good job and have talents and not be mentally ill. But nope. The hotline kept hanging up on me and wouldn't even answer. It's obvious life wants me dead. 

I want something to live for but it wont happen. I only live to not be defeated by all my demons. I've almost killed myself before and death is some scary shit to me. It's scary living in a world where if God exists he seems evil and if not then wtf where will I end up. Being alone in a possible infinitely large universe with billions of people hurts. Oh well.
