I guess I donâ€™t even know where to begin or what to sayI feel like I have no future. Nothing worth breathing for. I felt like that for 10 or so years. And then a woman came into my life. And it was all ok, I had a purpose and it was her. For fucking years it was her and I nothing else mattered between us. Then I got her pregnant when she was 17 and I was 19, and I wanted to keep the child. She did too. But her mother who hates me wrenched her into an abortion. And I felt even hollower. I feel like itâ€™s my fucking fault for not being there as a partner and father, like maybe I could have done something. I joined the navy after that and was soon kicked out for medical reasons. She was then ripped from my arms, and sent away for mental problems that were caused from the whole abortion situation. And I stayed alone working shit jobs. I lost the career I wanted my whole life. The woman I love is locked in an institution. I feel like a failure as a partner, a father, and as a provider. I developed a disgusting alcohol addiction, I canâ€™t go 12 hours without it. Everything feels like a mess. I constantly feel like Iâ€™m having a heart attack, and when Iâ€™m not awake and feeling that all I want to do is sleep, and when I wake up I drink myself to sleep. I have no idea whatâ€™s going on with myself or what Iâ€™m feeling anymore, Iâ€™ve tried to put an end to it several times but the god damn gun always just clicks, or I always just wake up the next morning alive and well. I just donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know if this is a cry for help or just me bitching. I know people have it worse than me and it just makes me feel even worse because I feel this fucking hopeless and shitty. I just donâ€™t fucking know anymore. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to my family and friends but they all just say buck up or stop being a pussy. Everythingâ€™s gone south.
