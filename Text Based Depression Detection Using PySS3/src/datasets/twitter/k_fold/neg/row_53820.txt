okay.alright. iâ€™ve tried to kill myself but failed so this time i wanna see what my body can handle. iâ€™m a little scared of what comes after but they say the most peaceful way to go is while youâ€™re asleep. i thank everyone whoâ€™s been here for me. iâ€™m not the greatest person so maybe in a way my death will make the world a better place. iâ€™m trying pro stuff now. merry christmas to all, and all a goodnight. &lt;3
