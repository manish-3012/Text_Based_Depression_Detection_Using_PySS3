Having a hard time dealing with my self.Lately Iâ€™ve been really depressed and itâ€™s been getting worse. I donâ€™t have any family or friends to talk to about it and my girlfriend has been just neglecting me when I ask her if I can talk to her. Just found out sheâ€™s cheating on me too so there is that on top of everything. If I didnâ€™t have my kids I would probably just end it now. They are the only thing that Is holding me here. Iâ€™m scared itâ€™s going to keep getting worse though and that they wonâ€™t be enough to keep me hanging on.
