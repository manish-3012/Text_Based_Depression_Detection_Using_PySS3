Suicidal thoughts?I'm thinking this is an appropriate place to post this, but please notify if it isn't. 

If I have detailed plans of suicide, such as:
1. Excusing myself to go to the nurse's office in order to get some medicine at around 11.25 am (theoretically the least crowded time) when a lax teacher is supervising, leaving all my precious belongings on the table and then going through the back stairs, after which I'd loop around and go to the windows open on the second floor, climbing off said window and jumping to my death, making sure that I'm falling head-first

Or

2. Going to the rooftop of the building by firstly turning the handle to the right, then pushing the window 15 minutes before others would crowd in, proceeding to then find a surface to step on before falling to my death, ensuring that I'm falling head-first

Should I seek professional help, even though I would not be courageous enough to do it because I am afraid of heights?

Thank you kindly.
