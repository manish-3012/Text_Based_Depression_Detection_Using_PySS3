i want to kill myself because i feel no one can love mei tried to kill myself in september after the first guy i ever fell in love with broke up with me. i survived but i couldn't go back to college. so now i just stay at home every day. i feel unmotivated and depressed. i lost my best friend, the person i love most in the world. i tried talking to him again and he already has a new girlfriend. he said im too crazy and weird and he doesn't miss me at all and has completely moved on and doesn't care about me. i feel completely unloveable and useless. to me there is no point in being alive if i can't have romance and love. i thought he accepted me and all of my flaws, but i guess that wasn't true. i never want to have my heartbroken again. i just want to die and i wish it had worked the first time. i'm too crazy and emotional and weird for a guy to love me. i hate myself and i want death rn.
