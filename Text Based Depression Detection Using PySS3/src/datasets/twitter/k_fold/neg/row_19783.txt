It's the Most Dangerous Time to be Awake HereI live in the USA, Eastern Standard Time and I'm watching the clock, waiting for 5AM to hit.

Research demonstrates that most suicides occur between 12AM-5AM,  with a peak between 2AM-3AM. I call this the Devil's hour as, if I have the misfortune of being awake, the suicidal thoughts always intensify during this time. It was hypothesized that the significance of this peak time could be attributed to nightmares, but anyone suicidal person who has fought through a long dark night of the soul can tell you that the real nightmare is being awake, without the every day distractions of living. The world is asleep and at no other time is the soul laid more bare. 

It's just turned 5:03AM so, statistically speaking, I should be safer. Those on watch be wary of this time of night.
