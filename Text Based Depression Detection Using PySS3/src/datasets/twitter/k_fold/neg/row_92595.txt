Needed to get my thoughts outI've always been stubborn and I know what I want for myself. Once I make up my mind, I've made up my mind. I've had MMD for almost 10 years now, so suicidal thoughts are no stranger to me.

I'm not going to do it yet. But I know I will. I know people always say encouraging words to make you feel better, that you are loved and cared about and things can get better. But once I've decided, you can't convince me.

To everyone, I appreciate the kind words during these times. But really.. I just want to be heard. Talked to like a normal person. Maybe share some stories?

This is just how I feel. Obviously everyone feels differently, but I'm getting sick of the reasons to stay alive. I just want to be treated as if I'm not some broken cause. I'm human too.
