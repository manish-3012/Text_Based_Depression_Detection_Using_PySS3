I tried to end my life on Christmas. How did I fail?The title says it all. I did an overdose of prescription opioid pain killers from an old surgery i had a few months ago, along with self harming. It just made me feel sleepy, and i couldn't sleep...and tried again last night and still...nothing. I scarred up my arms pretty terribly, and I just...Can't face work tomorrow. I cannot, and will not face tomorrow. Regardless of what has to be done.  
I've emailed my therapist all of my truths (she's out till the 11th), if i were to live and go to the hospital, I'd lose my job (contributing to my lack of wanting to live) and honestly, I've been planning this for a year.  
How the fuck did I fail? My research was fucking spot on and now I have no backup to lay on. How fucking could I. I just don't want to be here anymore. Thousands end their lives daily (every 10 minutes someone attempts), so I'm not "special" i just want to succeed.
