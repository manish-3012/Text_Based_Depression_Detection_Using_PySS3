It's Time.Life just isn't worth it anymore. Girlfriend of 3 years left me for someone else, can't find a job, my mind is screaming at me 24/7 to just get it over with. It's been this way for years, even with professional help.

I've set my date. Made my plans. I've made people smile, helped people. I hold those memories dear. Who knows how I'll be remembered, but hopefully I'll be a good story. Feels good to type this out. Thanks, Reddit.
