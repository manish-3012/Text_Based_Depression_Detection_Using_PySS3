iâ€™m going to do it.iâ€™ve had enough. life is just the same shit over and over again. iâ€™ll never be able to accomplish my dreams. i donâ€™t have the work ethic. iâ€™m losing interest in all of my hobbies. i donâ€™t have the motivation to work hard anymore. iâ€™m failing all of my classes. i canâ€™t find love anymore. i just donâ€™t see it ever getting better. 

goodbye internet. 

iâ€™ll be back soon.
