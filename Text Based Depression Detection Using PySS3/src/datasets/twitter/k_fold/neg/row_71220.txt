Giving upI'm done trying. It's seems no amount of self improvement negates my flaws. I've lost weight, tried forming social/romantic relationships, reached out to those in need, worked in numerous job environments, etc. It all leads me to the same conclusion. I'm clearly not built for this world. Last month another one of my friends killed himself and i think i'm going to be the next. No matter what i do i wind up in the same position. Alone, depressed and scared of the future. I know how it ends, it's just a matter of when.
