UnworthyI feel like I am stupid, worthless, and completely unworthy. I feel like the people in my life are only there because they feel obligated and that I am a burden. I am completely and totally crazy. I know that my family will be upset, but I honestly believe they will be better off. We are going on vacation the week after next, and I am going to do it then. I can't wait to be done with this struggle that I have been battling for a decade. The only reason I haven't done it yet is to take care of my cats.
