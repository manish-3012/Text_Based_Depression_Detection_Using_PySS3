How to break outI'm escaping from life by being on PC or sleeping. It used to work but now I've come to a phase where I can't sleep without constant torturing thoughts of my life and suicide. 

And if I'm on PC I don't even do much, mostly I do nothing but to browse net. Even games aren't fun anymore. I feel like I don't it and should be living a life instead of playing games. I can just stare at the screen doing nothing because the sound of a computer fan is relaxing,  almost hypnotizing.

In short only 2 things that I loved doing bring me no joy anymore. I can't get out, no matter what I do in day and how constructive I get I always feel depressed after. It's always there always
