Stressed and smothered, need encouragementMy parents abuse me, and I'm not sure I can make it through the three years till i can move out without killing myself or having a psychotic break.  I may have coped somehow up till now but everything just feels impossible, the littlest of problems a mountain-sized impass, and I am not allowed even the littlest of freedoms by my parents, even while they pretend to care for me.  How do I make it through this?
