I feel emptyI have been suicidal every single night. I've given up on trying to not hurt myself. I don't trust my friends anymore. Nearly all of them either ignore me or verbally abuse me if I feel unhappy around them. The verbal-abuse ones think I'm feeling that way to hurt them. I normally don't feel emotions anymore either, like they kind of just shut down. I just feel empty and suicidal. I can't even get myself to talk to people anymore, which is easy since no one really messages me first anyways. I don't even know how to accurately describe how I'm actually feeling. I just want to lock myself in my room and lay in bed until I die.
