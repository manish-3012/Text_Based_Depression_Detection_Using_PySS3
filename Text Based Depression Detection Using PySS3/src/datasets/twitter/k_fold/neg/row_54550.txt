Creeping up on meHi I donâ€™t Know who to tell or trust with this. I am in the military and have been stationed over seas for over a year and some change. Honestly I have posted before on here about how I almost killed myself but didnâ€™t lord knows how but I am here and breathing. Honestly itâ€™s gotten kind of better but I still have that feeling of wanting to kill myself lots of times I still feel like a burden on everyone I talk to,everything I do in my job and in general. I just feel emotionless and anxiety ridden tbh itâ€™s a feeling like I donâ€™t care at all something itâ€™s just not right but I find everyday I want to kill myself and it creeps closer and closer on me I just want to find some happiness genuine happiness but I find that hard to come by.
