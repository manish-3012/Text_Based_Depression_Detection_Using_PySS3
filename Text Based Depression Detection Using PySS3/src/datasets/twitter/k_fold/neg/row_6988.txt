Why do I keep trying to get better?I'm so so exhausted.  I've been severely depressed and chronically suicidal for 10 years.  I've had several attempts over the years, and a lot more "close calls".  I've tried various combinations of meds and been in individual and group therapy, I even spent a year in a residential treatment facility.  I've literally had more psych hospitalizations than I can count.

Even when I'm having a good few days, I can't really enjoy them because I'm just bracing myself for the bad to come back.  Everyone is always like "It gets better!!!! uwu " and like, yeah, it does, but it never stays better.  Why look forward to the good when the bad is just going to come right back?

Why should I fight to get better when the fighting will never stop?  Even if my mental health gets better, there's so much social injustice and shit about the world.  What's to point in bettering myself internally if I can't make things better for myself externally and things will continue to suck?  Why should I make my mental health better?  I don't *want* to be able to put up with how awful the world is.  But I also don't want to be stuck fighting for a better world for all of my life.

I hate this chronic suicidality.  Wanting to die is my baseline.  I've gotten better at managing the impulsiveness, but that just means the thoughts and urges have evolved and changed, and become more dangerous.  The impulsive suicidal behaviors have decreased, but the more planned out, thoughtful, more likely to be successful thoughts (and to some extent behaviors) have taken over.

I had a planned attempt back in May, and a very planned almost-attempt (a friend talked me out of it) a little over a month ago.

I'm just so tired.  I'm not currently actively planning anything but the thoughts and urges are absolutely there and I don't really know why I'm fighting them.  It's not for myself, that's for sure.  It's for people I care about, who care about me.  I don't want to hurt them.  But I feel like I am forced to make the choice to either hurt my loved ones or continue on in a world that hurts me.  I hate that decision.
