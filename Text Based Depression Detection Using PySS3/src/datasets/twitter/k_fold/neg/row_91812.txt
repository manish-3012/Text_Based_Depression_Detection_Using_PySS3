Tonight sucks!Yesterday, I went to a burlesque show, got to meet the performers, got their signatures and got a photo with them. I didn't really know what to say to them, or ask when it came to signing a book. I don't know... I hate myself for expecting more than what I experienced. I felt like I was just cattle, I was just another customer. I wanted it to be more personalized. Okay, maybe I am just expressing my desire of wanting to feel special. Regardless, I feel like I made a mistake of going, because I was reminded of my ex. Someone in the audience wore the same perfume as her. I mean don't get me wrong, the performers were babes, but man. I kept on being hard on myself, like I am no worth a woman's time, and I am afraid of messing things up again. Shit, at this point, I am damaged goods. I don't believe I deserve someone's time. Ugh, then on the commute back home I had to hear a bunch of drunk people shout nonsense. At 2 in the morning, I just wanted to go home at that point. I guess, I am better off staying home. I want to cry, but my body is resisting. I am noticing it is becoming more and more difficult to feel something good, especially when I am by myself. I feel like a nobody. I feel like I don't belong anywhere after all my mistakes. There is more to this, but this is a little vent.
