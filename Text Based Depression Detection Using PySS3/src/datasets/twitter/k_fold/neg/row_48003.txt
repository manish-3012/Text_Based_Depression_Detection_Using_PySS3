Well just when i thought I had something good...So where i live, you go to primary school, then secondary school, then CEGEP and then University. I'm in Cegep and I was supposed to be there only 2 years but I failed some classes due to lack of motivation and stuff going on.

 During Fall 2016, I failed half my classes (3/6) and was obligated to sign a contract that stated I could no longer fail classes for the next semester (or at least thats what I thought). So I passed all 5 classes I took that semester (Winter 2017) and got on with stuff. This semester (Fall 2017), I took 4 classes to have 4 the next one and go to Uni next year. I however had a rough patch near the finals and the only thing keeping me going was that girl in my biology class, we started texting and then we went on a few dates and recently started going out together which is definitely the best thing that happened to me in years. I however gor my grades from my finals and I failed 2/4 classes and I received an email saying I could not attend my Cegep for Winter 2018. I didn't think the contract lasted until the end of my Cegep and I was starting to have some sort of happiness and boom! 

Fuck you !

My girlfriend doesn't know yet and we've only been together for 3 days (but dating for a month). She is good in school, and idk if she'll stay with me bc of that.

I don't know what to do, I don't see anything good coming out of this..
