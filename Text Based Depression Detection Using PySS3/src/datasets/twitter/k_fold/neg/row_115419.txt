Lack of interest in anythingIâ€™m losing all interest in all my hobbies.
I feel like a burden to everyone.
I donâ€™t understand my reason for wanting to die, 
I just donâ€™t feel anything. 
My life isnâ€™t bad, I donâ€™t dislike my job, I have friends and a wonderful S.O. 
But I just feel like life itself is lackluster. 
The only time I can get any type of serious emotions out of myself is through self-harm or doing something that could kill me. 
Its not an adrenaline rush it just brings me back to reality. 

Am I a bad person for wanting to throw my life and opportunities away?
