Why not I know why not. I work in the psych field. My worst day pales in comparison to others. Everything will get better.  But I can't stop crying. It was ended with my SO today after 8 years. I know it's best. I just can't deal with with the pain. It hurts. I can't breath. My entire existence is crumbling. I'm dying inside. This seems like the way out. I won't don't it. But my brain is screaming at me to jut do it already.
