my 15th birthdayi remember it so fondly
at the time i had dropped out of school right before exams i had no friends so most days were pretty quiet. my birthday was coming up and i was anticipating the worst and oh boy did the worst happen. i ended up not celebrating my birthday at all (just had a cake with family at least) it was the first and only time in my life that i was unable to even throw a small party or gathering as i was friendless, i also remember how i felt, already deep in a depressed state it hit hard on my birthday with the realisation of complete loneliness, i literally did nothing that day it was just like any other. it was probably one of the saddest days in my life.
it's now been 3 years and my 18th birthday is coming up i managed to find some friends actually quite a lot last year but i lost touch with almost all of them.my party is going suck again because of loneliness
fuck
