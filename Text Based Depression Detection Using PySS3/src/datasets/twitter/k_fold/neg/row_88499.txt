Are these types of thoughts worrisome?Iâ€™m 27 years old and have been battling with my mental health for years. Iâ€™ve had a good life, but a good life experienced with a haze of fear. 

My biggest fear oddly enough is needles and medical care: I spent months going to therapy for my specific needle phobia, and Iâ€™ve wasted thousands on exposure therapy.

After a decade of suffering from health, death and needle phobia; I have finally found peace within myself by accepting suicide as an option. 

My biggest fear is medical intervention. Needles and pain. Nothing else scares me that much, just the thought of needles and medical intervention on my body.

Iâ€™ve made a pact with myself that Iâ€™ll stop worrying about everything and stop trying to micro manage my health, but if I hit an illness or disease I will off myself. Iâ€™m not depressed I donâ€™t think, but Iâ€™m really not interested in getting old and suffering. 

Iâ€™m 27 now and with my health anxiety, living to 30 would be a miracle. Accepting my fate of 35 and living happily ignorant is how Iâ€™m going to do things for now on.

Fuck those black circles and early odd signs of disease, old age is not a suffering block I will allow myself to reach. And with that I find peace, control and a sense of power.
