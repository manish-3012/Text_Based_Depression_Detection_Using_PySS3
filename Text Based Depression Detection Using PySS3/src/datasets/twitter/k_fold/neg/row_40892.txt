Everything is a rollercoasterFor a few months I started getting better. I held on to hope as well as I could but I'm slipping. I'd lost 50 lbs on my diet until I got triggered a month ago, and I've nonstop overeaten since. I'm afraid to step on the scale to see how much progress I've lost. 

Everything I've cared about has been taken from me. People used to like me. People used to talk to me. People used to care about me. I've reconnected with a friend who's helped a lot recently but now that has to end.

My crippling fear of death has been very fortunate. If I finally reach the point where I'm willing to die, I can do it and I can succeed.

I'm starting to think about... my legacy. I think I want to advocate voluntary sterilization of severely mentally ill people. I don't want two adults who have been abused to decide to have a child to solve all their problems. I don't want people to ignore or hide their problems. I don't want another me to be born.
