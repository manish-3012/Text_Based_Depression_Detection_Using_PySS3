UltimatumI can't go on with this much doubt and uncertainty.

Today I tried to do the right thing. It meant someone got hurt (not from anything I did) and I'm not comfortable with that.

I risked a powerful friendship to give someone closure. There it is. I said it. I'm afraid this will backfire and send hell my way, leaving me without even the pitiful current existence of my so called support network.

If this backfires, if doing the right thing ends up making my life miserable, I have a way out. I'm promising myself that I will forgive myself if that happens. I don't want to persevere if I have to brave waters rougher than the ones I now struggle to wade. I shouldn't have to. I don't owe that to myself, I can't keep saying that. It would be foolish to keep lying to myself while life never changes. 

If things go bad, I forgive myself for being too weak to handle it all. I'm not a machine. I need a break.

May the universe have mercy on this weary soul. I am spent, but I will seek to persist if I am shown the favor that I so desperately need to jump start my life again.

Thanks for reading.
