not gonna be here for much longer. i give it a few monthsI'm always laying in bed alone.. That's all I do (no exaggeration) because I have no one. Everyone around me wants me to live the way that THEY want me to live. I am tired of doing everything I can to make others happy because i'm unable to make myself happy. My brother has all of these friends around him and I have absolutely no one. All I have is my dog. Living is not fucking working out for me. I've held on for too long. Nothing has gotten better.  I have tried to fix my life but there is no fixing. I am not meant to be here. I do not belong. I've tried to make friends but everyone either shuts me out or makes a mockery out of me. Everything is always going to be terrible for me.; all of the people around me? they have great lives.. but I don't... you want to know why? it's because i'm not meant to be here. I am simply meant to be miserable and that's how it's always going to be until I find the guts to kill myself. There is no sense in me trying to live and I feel pathetic for doing so.
