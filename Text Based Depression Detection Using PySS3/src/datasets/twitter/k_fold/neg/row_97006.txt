Fairly scaredIve thought about committing suicide for as long as I can remember. This is the worst it's been since I was in third grade. 

I hold onto hope for things to get better but the better I want is fictional, I've known for a while that what I want to happen is very very unlikely. I want to write stories and get a small fanbase or find love or find someone who'll show regular worry about me and be like "oh i see you're not doing well, are you okay" which is silly but i fantasize about people asking me if I'm alright a lot.

I usually just think about killing myself but every now and then I take it a little further and today I got really close to actually doing it which is scary honestly. I don't want to die but I also definitely can't live, this world was made for people but I don't feel like I was made like other people.

When people talk to me I struggle to hear them or come up with responses and I don't know where to look or what to do with my hands and sometimes I forget how to walk properly. I'm dumb as rocks and I work at the garden center at walmart and im awful at it, coworkers will ask me to do something and i rarely understand it.

Im also really hard to look at, i have these super creepy eyes and my hair is crazy no matter what i do to it and i cant grow good facial hair and my body is shaped weird. i come off as really intimidating ans scary and this makes it so that no one wants to be near me but thne the people who do regret it when i struggle to tzlk.

im bad at academic things too.

Im bad at writing and drawing or anything hobby-like. i feel that i have no skills whatsoever. 

Im bad at everything i can think of honestly.

I'm very very fragile and small stressors are all i need to crumble, oh they've boosted my hours time to sob all alone. No one would want ot be near someone like that. I don't even look human in the mirror especially when i cry. I look humanadjactent, its like i can barely recognize my face as my own when i look at it.

Today i was having it really bad, i was so tired and ive been working so hard and ive been trying my best to stay healthy and look nice and earn money and ive been trying my best to get better at things and ive just been trying my best but then i broke my tv and some stupid game ive been playing broke too and then i was checking my phone and it randomly died and it feels like someone was vert specifically telling me i couldnt be happy and i feel like everything is breaking again and im gonna stop having the energy to clean myself again. 

i really am trying my best i really want everyone to know that it was never much but the effort i give really was my all i just wanted to be better and happier.

Today unlike the other bad days i wrote a note and even grabbed my pills, i was so close to doing it but i thought against it and now im here begging for attention on the internet.

I know it may sound stupid but i really really want a hug, if anyone no matter who they were just held me or told me that they truly wanted me to be better then id be so happy but no one is like that in real life. sure on the internet its a little diffrent but in ral life i dont thinkg anyonke is going to be there for somene like me

i dont want to stop living but i really just want life to be completely different than anything that it is
