Overthinking is the causeI was wondering why Iâ€™m always suicidal and weak and unhappy and I just wanna vanish and not face anything , Iâ€™m not sure but  I think overthinking is what causes my suicide thoughts itâ€™s like I only see bad things coming and they come as I think that , Iâ€™m so scared of life , I wonder why people are scared of death while life is so much more scarier
