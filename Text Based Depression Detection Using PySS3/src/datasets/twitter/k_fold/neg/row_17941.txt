Just another goodbyeWho am I? I can't seem to answer this question... and I'm getting tired everyday just of thinking about it...

I've made great efforts during these 20 years of my life. Getting into a big uni just to lose a year because of my fucking depression, losing a lot of weight just to win it again, win some friends just so I start hating them....

This is really difficult, and I don't want to act longer. Am I a coward? Fuck yeah, I'm a lazy, fat, ugly, stupid coward. And I don't want to feel like it any longer. I'm tired of everyone telling me to make efforts, I've been doing that my whole life and it doesn't seem to be working

No one will miss a wannabe filmmaker who spends his days reading comics and watching films. There's enough people like me, I need to make them space. No one will be able to love me because I'm a horrific person. So? What do I have left.

I'm tired of people and family saying they care about me and don't want anything bad to happen. But then when I ask them to see a movie or to spend time with me, they always seem to have a excuse.

I'm tired of people calling me selfish for being tired of everything and wanting to end all. Yes, I'm a fucking selfish. And I will depart this world as one. I'm not a fucking good person and this universe isn't made for me to be one.

I'm just tired of everything... and if you never hear from me again, well... I deserved it.
