I could use some advice (gender dysphoria)I recently turned 22 and have been dealing with gender dysphoria for a little over 10 years, and for a lot of that time I've had suicidal thoughts anywhere from 'kinda wish i was dead' to actually cutting myself. Im not sure that I could go through with actually ending my life because of my sister and best friend who are my reason for living right now but between the dysphoria and multiple chronic medical problems my life seems to just spiral downwards. I want to transition but not only is most of my family hostile to lgbtq people, I would never pass and im not sure I want even more negativity in my life from people who hate me for trying to be closer on the outside to how i feel on the inside. I don't think i really want to die, I just don't want to live as who I am. I've read a lot of other peoples posts around the internet on depression and a common advice thats given is to find things in life you enjoy, but i feel like everything i do is tainted by the dysphoria and theres nothing in life i really enjoy or look forward to. I have no goals and just thinking about continuing as the person i am for longer ends with me emptying a few cans of beer and listening to whatever music makes me feel even slightly less crap. It hurts to look at my own body and I dont know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice anyone has. I want ro tell people but the second im around anyone I just cant say anything other than 'eh I've been alright' or something like that.
