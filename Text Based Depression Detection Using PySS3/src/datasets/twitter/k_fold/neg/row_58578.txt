Still thinking about suicideI feel like I should look for a therapist but I donâ€™t want to bc itâ€™ll be harder for me to get into the military. I donâ€™t really know how to put into words of how I feel ,but I feel like I wanna die all the time. I wanna do 4 years in the military and move out of my moms house ,but 4 years feels like a long time but I feel like itâ€™s also the only option unless I want to work a dead end job and stay with my mom. Iâ€™m starting to get more and more depressed as the days go on and the more time I spend time in my moms house.
