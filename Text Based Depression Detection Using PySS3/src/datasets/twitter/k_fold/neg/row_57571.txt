BPD and OCD are killing me.If you know anything about BPD and OCD and having both, then you'd have a pretty general (and accurate) idea of why I want to end my life.

There's this person I love, she's going through a really tough time in her life. I keep blaming myself for her feeling bad, but I am also aware that her current life circumstances are causing it. 

It's okay, I'm no longer afraid of death. I'm going to record two more albums before I'm supposed to begin college and then I'm going to jump onto a traintrack and place my neck along the track before a train passes over it. 

It'll be fine, it's too simple to fail. I'm so hopelessly in love. It's okay. 

I'll record my live album with all my best friends on New Year's Eve and my final studio album the week before and after that. I'll never release them and they'll remain on my computer and my two external backups. Nobody will ever listen to them or my previous four (or five?) albums. Nobody will ever see my hundreds of artworks. Nobody will read my poetry or look at my photographs, it's okay.

I used to fear death but I now realize I can use it to put an end to my suffering, which is great.
