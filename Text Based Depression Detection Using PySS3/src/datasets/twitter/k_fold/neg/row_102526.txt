Still alive, still a coward, still broke and hopeless.  And now hungry, too.Hello again, /r/suicidewatch.  I used to be DeadManWalkien and had a couple posts here about how I [lost my job for being suicidal](http://redd.it/vfo2z) and then [got stuck with $12,000 in medical bills for hospitalization "for my own protection" after someone who I thought I was a friend called the cops on me for being suicidal.](http://redd.it/vsw4b)

Paying that bill, and then my rent and student loans and utilities, left me with maybe $30 to my name.  I had planned to kill myself by getting run over by a car, but my walk to get run over turned into a jog, which gave me enough endorphins to decide to keep on living and see what I could do with myself.

Dumbest decision I've ever made.

My car ran out of gas yesterday, on the way back from a job interview where the person who called me in **to** interview told me he would never hire me because of my lack of experience, but he just wanted to talk to someone who'd graduated from the same school as him.  I abandoned my useless car and walked the remaining 15 miles home because I had no money for gas, having spent it on food, cleaning my interview suits, and, ironically, gas.  

I don't know why I went home anyway.  There's nothing for me here.  I sold everything I own--my furniture, my computer, most of my clothes--except for my phone, five days of interview suits, and my (abandoned, useless) car, all so I could afford to feed my cats, and then gave them to a shelter last Friday because I looked at what little money it all was and realized I just *can't*.  The only shelter within reach will kill them in three weeks if no one takes them in (and they won't, because they're not kittens), but it's better odds than if they'd stayed with me.  So I've slept on a bare floor in an un-air-conditioned apartment since then, knowing the *best I could do* for my cats was to makre sure they'll die from lethal injection rather than starve to death.  Either way I murdered them.

I'm going to starve to death too.  I am officially out of money.  Zero dollars and zero cents in assets.  I ate the last of my food Friday and haven't eaten since then, nor do I plan to eat ever again.  I refuse to beg, I will not go to a soup kitchen, and I'll die before I suck a priest's cock for charity or give thanks to a god I don't believe in and who wouldn't be worth a damn if I did.  You can go, what, three weeks without food?  Then I've only got a couple weeks to go.

There's no unemployment benefits coming for me either.  I checked.  My ex-employer is sticking to their fired-for-cause story, so I get nothing from the state.  My landlord is going to tape an eviction notice to my door eventually, but I don't care.  Honestly, if he did it would just speed up my death, since if he throws me bodily out of the building my scumbag body will try to heal itself with calories it simply doesn't have and will never get any more of.

There is no hope for me.  There is no future for me.  Even if I got an interview tomorrow, I'd come in looking like an unshaved, unwashed homeless man.  I'd come in late, too, since I'd have to walk.  And even if that interview somehow resulted in a job offer *that very same day*, it would be weeks before I got paid, during which time I'd either starve to death or be fired for poor performance (on account of having no calories to fuel my brain).  

This is how I die.  Starving in a barren apartment rotting in the summer heat.  This is the dignity of life /r/suicidewatch loves to speak of.  This is the "it gets better" you mindlessly repeat over and over and over again.

Fuck you.  Fuck every last goddamn one of you.
