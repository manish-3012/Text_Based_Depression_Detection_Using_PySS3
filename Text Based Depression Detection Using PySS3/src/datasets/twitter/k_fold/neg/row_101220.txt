I don't know how to deal with thisHello from Russia..
For past 3 years I've been dealing with a lot of shit. One of my friends hang himself, people who I knew and loved just kept dying. In addition, I started hating myself for many reasons, so naturally appeared depression. It was pretty unbearable so once I tried to commit suicide by taking a bunch of pills, which didn't succeed. In the end my roommate convinced me to go to doctor. 

I ended up spending weeks in psychiatric clinic, which costs a lot of money, but the only thing they managed to do to me was to make me fucking addicted to their pills. So I kept on living this pathetic life.

 A year ago i got in a long distance relationship with a guy. I really cherish him, but things got complicated because of my depression and self-hatered. I decided to end it in order to save him from my toxic nature.. Such a pathetic move. 

A few hours ago i received a suicide note from him. I tried to message him, but he didn't reply..

I don't know what to do anymore
