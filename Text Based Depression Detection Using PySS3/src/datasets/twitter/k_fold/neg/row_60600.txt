17. Going into my Senior year. Socially awkward. Feeling like my life is useless.I have only contemplated suicide one other time in my life. I was in junior high and was being constantly bullied by the people I called friends. I cried everyday during lunch and the only person who helped me through it was, and continues to be, my best friend that I could ever have. But unfortunately, I feel as though I need outside help to get over this one.

I have just finished my Junior year of high school and I feel as though my Senior year is going to be miserable. Hear is why:

* I am really involved in the choir department in my school and in my school choir is probably one of the most important things here. I am in the top two choirs at my school and in show choir here. There are three things in choir that I really wanted for my Senior year to be meaningful: Section leader(leads rehearsal for their section), dance captain(for show choir), and homecoming nomination. I did not get even one of them. Both section leader and dance captain went to a good friend of mine and homecoming nominee went to another guy in the class. Choir is my life. I made the all-state choir this last year and I was 1st-Chair Tenor 1. Unfortunately, my friend literally gets everything he wants(even though he hasn't made the all-state choir) and the teacher is in love with him. I, however, am not a kiss ass and am not as beloved by the teacher as he is. I feel as though the only reason anybody wants me in the program is because of my good singing voice.

* I am socially awkward. The bullying has calmed down a lot since junior high, but they have now moved on to outright not really wanting my company. I try to force myself into conversations, but it ultimately turns into me awkwardly walking away feeling as though I'm not wanted. I am seeing a therapist in order to try to resolve these issues, but I literally just started seeing her like a week ago. Since junior high, there have been multiple times when I have cried myself to to sleep because of my social standing with my peers. I feel unwanted and outcast by the very people with which I want to be friends with. I have, on multiple occasions, been called an asshole and immature(even by my parents), and over the years I have constantly been trying to fix the way people look at me, but I have never been able to get it to work. I just feel as though my life will continue to be miserable because I will never be able to fix the problems I created growing up. I know that most of the attitudes towards me I caused. I just wish that I could fix them.

* I'm an atheist. This isn't really a bad thing in my eyes, but because I live in Texas, it definitely becomes a problem. Most people look down on me because of it because they have learned that atheism is a bad thing. This has become a problem when I try to talk to people because a lot of them bring religion into the conversation and then end up disgusted with me because I won't shut up about my beliefs. Granted, I do talk way too much, but I apologize about it. I do my best to keep religion out of conversations, but for some reason all conversations lead that way one way or another.

I just need some guidance on how I should cope with these things. I just feel like if I can get through my senior year that I will be able to look forward to college and a new start. But I don't want to leave the legacy that I achieved nothing at the school at which I wanted to be accepted by my peers and become a person that people look up to. I just wish that I could go back in time to fix all the things I did wrong to make my life end up this way. I hope that you guys can help me get through this so I don't end up having to end my life this early in order to avoid being miserable.
