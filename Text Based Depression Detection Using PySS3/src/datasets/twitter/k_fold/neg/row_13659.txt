It feels like I'm invisibleIt feels like I'm invisible and everyone I know ignores me, I don't seem to have any real friends, I keep looking at my list and it's more like a graveyard than a friend list. Nobody texts me or seems enthusiastic to chat no matter how kind or nice I am I just get ghosted. Nobody wants to be around me, I'm just a terrible person and I should just give up
