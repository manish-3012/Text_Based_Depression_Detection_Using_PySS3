I donâ€™t want to live anymore.I have nothing to live for. I donâ€™t think that itâ€™s ever going to get better. I told myself that it was going to get better last year, and then I had a self harm relapse and a suicide attempt. No one knows about either, and Iâ€™m glad that only I know. No one cares about me, if they cared they would have believed me when I told them that I was suffering. My mom is extremely narcissistic and I canâ€™t stand living with her. I barely know my closet â€œfriendsâ€ and I donâ€™t care enough to go and spend time with them. I have no plans or hope for the future, and I know that I will be too lazy to get a real job. I donâ€™t care about any of my hobbies and I just feel bored and empty all the time. I feel like shit for most of the day, and I just donâ€™t want to live if I feel like Iâ€™m suffering the majority of the time.
