did bad this semesteri'm a bit drunk, so sorry if this is barely readable.

so, i think i did pretty poorly this semester in school. i stayed in a major i hated, dropped one of my classes because i have social anxiety and that class required me to interview three people. i lost my only two friends in school cause, frankly, they weren't that great friends to begin with. one was a massive passive aggressive bitch, and the other doesn't seem to give a shit about anything and is quite dense. that was really mean, but i don't hate them or anything. they're not bad people, we are just at different points in our lives, or so i thought. i haven't been doing so great in the classes im still taking. i have a b in one, but the others i may get c's in which sucks for my gpa. also, i've been feeling like i've been invisible lately. all of the aquiantences i have made this year are ignoring me. they only speak to my boyfriend. that's cause he actually talks to them though. speaking of my boyfriend, he has been pretty wonderful. i've been more than a fucking handful, and he has stuck with me. he is so supportive and tries to help me whenever im feeling down. i feel like i've been treating him so bad though. idk. he says i havent been breaking down emotionally lately, but i feel like i've still been whiney and bitchy. idk. i don't feel like i've improved, and i doubt i will in the future. im tired of waking up and feeling like i've failed everyday. i just want to be freee. idk. my boyfriend shouldn't have the burden of a crazy ass girfriend. he doesn't deserve it. he is too good for that. i love him so much, but i feel like he'd be happier with someone who has their shit together. idk. im gonna stop here so i can study for finals that im gonna take so i don't screw myself over too much in case i decide i still wanna be alive lol. idk if anyone is gonna read this. oh well.
