I don't want to live but I don't want to kill myselfI'm 15, and I never thought that my "friends" would be my biggest bullies. Over the past few weeks I've come to the realization that they aren't nice to me anymore, constantly making fun of me and I can't even remember the last time they did/said anything nice to me. 

I have a few friends left who I love to death but I hardly get to see them now that we go to separate schools. My school in general hasn't helped me feel better as my grades sink lower and lower. 

I just found out my dad was diagnosed with depression and I'm to scared to talk to my parents about it. For the past week I've wanted to be dead but I couldn't bring myself to harm myself. Thinking about all the people who still care about me and the actions that would follow after death are the main reason I'm still here. I know I'll get recommendations to leave those friends but it's hard when I see them daily and I play games with them and run with them. 
 
I'm tired of living like this and I don't want to be here. Thanks for letting me ramble. And of my "friends" are reading this because they know my username, I've talked to you about how I feel and you continue to push me.
