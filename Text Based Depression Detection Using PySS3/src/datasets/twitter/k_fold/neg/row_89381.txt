It can get betterI have had Suicidal Tendencies since I was young. There was one time in particular it was going to happen. I felt comfortable about it and had a counselor catch it because I never even mentioned it.  6 months later my life was better than it ever was. 
  I hope everybody on here reaches out and asks for help. It's not a video game where you get it do over. That is a decision that others have to live with for the rest of their lives.
