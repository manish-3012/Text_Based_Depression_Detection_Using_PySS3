high school student having grade troublesFor context, I'm normally a pretty good student (straight A's most of the time w/ honors and APs). About ten minutes ago, my Precalculus teacher posted the quarter midterms. I'll be ending this quarter with a D+. 

I feel like an utter failure. I know a lot of people, plenty of whom are my friends, who will be ending it with an A. My current teacher is a really good teacher, so I feel like most of the blame is on me. Despite being an extremely privileged person (2 tutors, literally all the help I can get), I'm still doing poorly. My parents are entirely supportive of me just doing my best and are okay with whatever grade I get, which somehow makes it even worse. I feel like an utter waste of resources and space.

I haven't been doing well this past quarter. I rotate between wanting to kill small animals to vent my anger, cry into a pillow, and total apathy. In the past two months, I've lost around 20 pounds (a little over a fifth of my body weight) because I don't have any appetite whatsoever. I can stomach one meal a day because I'm too stressed to eat at any other time besides dinner. About a week ago, I was scratching myself and ended up going past the skin. After that, I've regularly been using one of my shavers to cut myself. After this midterm, suicide genuinely feels like an option.

I can't really bring myself to talk to anyone I know about this. I feel like I'm too much of a bother. Writing this block of text makes me feel like a disgusting, attention seeking, spoiled block of shit. I feel bad about my grades, then I feel guilty about feeling bad because other people have worse problems. 

Not sure where I was going with this. That's it ig
