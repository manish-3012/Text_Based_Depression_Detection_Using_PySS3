Too Many QuestionsI just got back from missing a month of school. I used to skip class all the time, but I turned my act around this semester. Then I got sick. Week after that, I had a death in the family. The next week was gone by running a Goodwill clothing drive that caused me to miss 2 exams. 



I asked my profs if I could take a make-up. One said no, and said I contacted her too late. I was OK with that. The other said yes, and asked me tons of questions afterwards. Like why didn't you tell me about this earlier? Why didn't you turn in a random assignment from 3 weeks ago? The judgmental look in her eye is just too much right now. I would understand the questions if they came BEFORE she decided to let me make up the test, but she's asking these AFTER. 



There's no way to explain everything to her. I don't know what to do. It's my 2 year anniversary with my bf tomorrow, but all I can think about is having to take a test for an hour with her drilling me with questions about why I do/don't do different things. 




I'm FINALLY able to walk around campus on most days and not have flashbacks. For the longest time, I'd have a flashback to my ex raping me every time I saw a guy that looked like him. I finally broke up with him; I left an abusive relationship. Not only that, I stayed in school and managed to continue passing classes despite moderate-severe depression. Then, I turned my attendance around. And because of extenuating circumstances I couldn't go to class for a few weeks in a row. I was too nervous and anxious to ask for help, and it took every ounce of courage to ask for a make-up. Now, despite all I've overcome, I have to endure more questions about why I missed a petty assignment a few weeks ago or was absent to a couple classes. I feel I've overcome enough in my life. I know I'll at least stick around until after my anniversary with my bf. That's all I have to hold on to right now.
