i hate every single person, everything irritates me, i just want to die, i don't belong in this stupid broken worldi fucking hate everything, i hate life, i hate that we have to work just to survive, i hate every classmate, sometimes i pretend everything is fine and go into a happy mode, but i don't do anything productive, i have klinifelter, most likely autism, i can never express my feelings to ANYONE even if i really want to, they just think im fucking joking because normally im happy always laughing, making jokes, So i have bipolar disorder too, nice what else can i have? im just typing everything that comes to my mind in this post, I only feel happy, content for few hours after i have a good conversation, relationship with someone, but its rare, im so fucking unlikable, when my whole class is going to somewhere, everyone is in pairs, but im always the alone one? why? because im unlikable i always talk garbage because im anxious, i always regret everything i've said after i have time to think about it,i think about how it could've made me sound stupid, I've tried just ignoring everything, just going with the flow, trying my best to be happy and do the things i would enjoy, it worked for a while, but i stopped doing homework, lost my personality, nobody from my old  middle school class likes me anymore, i fucking hate this society, "everything is in your hands". Nope everything is decided because i didn't chose where i would be born, i didn't choose my family, i didn't choose my kindergarden i didn't choose anything that would be part of my mental developent and personality. so everything was decided for me anyways, i fucking hate my fucking phone that restarts every 5 min, i just feel like i would torture it if it was alive, 

i just wish everyone could read my mind without me trying hard and fail misrably to express my emotion and thoughs, i don't enjoy anything anymore, i don't want to play video games anymore, i don't want to study anymore, i don't even have dreams, wishes anymore.  i would've ended it if i could find a open roof..........  do i just keep going with tthe flow hoping i win a lottery or find someone JUST right for me(0.00001%) chance, because i can't bring myself to change myself and GET a happy life by working hard
