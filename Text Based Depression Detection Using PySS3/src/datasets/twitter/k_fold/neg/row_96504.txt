I only want to talk with people who think suicide is rationalI've dealt with severe depression for 2 decades.  They have been the longest minutes of my life.  I don't have a reason to live other than not killing your self isn't cool.  How do I change that?  Is it possible to want to live after you have been through what I have?  Who helps you want to live?  If I call a suicide prevention number or go to the hospital they only give a shit about 1 thing me living no matter how hard that may be.  These guys are selfish fucking cowards in my mind.  They exist to help family members and are not here to cure depression.  Honestly is there anywhere to go for that? It just seems that everyone wants to take away my shoelaces so I don't hang myself when I am wearing a shirt that would make a perfectly good noose.  People think that because you have a law degree you have something to live for.  Why not trust my judgement and let me slip away to peace?  Because you are all a bunch of selfish pricks that don't give a shit about people in pain.
