Why not?I've felt like a failure for years. Now, it's peaking. I got and lost a job within a week because I couldn't match the required pace in their bullshit system. Despite how much I try, I'm useless at everything. Even video games, which are supposed to be fun, are nothing except a reminder of my complete ineptitude at everything. I had to move to a different state with my family because, at 26, I'm too shitty to be living on my own. I lost my girlfriend because of how stupid I was.
And my parents don't listen. They keep guilting me with how my death would make them feel. I'm tired of it. They know I have no reason to want to live, so that's the only card they have left.
Unfortunately, I have no workable plan. I used to live about a half hour from the #4 suicide bridge in the US, but now, I don't know what I could do. I'm too much of a coward to slit my wrists, and I'm too shitty with knots to hang myself.
