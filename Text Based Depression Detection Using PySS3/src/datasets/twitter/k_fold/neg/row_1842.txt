3 weeks ago today I was in psych ward.3 weeks ago today I woke up in a psych ward on a 72 hour hold for putting a gun to my head on 2 separate occasions. I broke down and told a social worker at my place of employment who's a friend and the cops were called without me knowing and they braught me in. When asked why I didnt shoot myself, I responded with because I'm a pussy. Just posting this to let you all know shit can get better. I deal with suicidal thoughts everyday all day. But there is resources that can help you get out of the rut a little. I'm on wellbutrin and hydroxyzine. So far it doesn't seem to be doing much. But I have hope I guess.
