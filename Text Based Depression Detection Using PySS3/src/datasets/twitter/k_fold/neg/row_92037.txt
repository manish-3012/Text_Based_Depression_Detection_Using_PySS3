Help?Iâ€™m not sure what to type up . I feel like my minds all jumbled up. I know for a fact however is that I want to end it all. I want to but I have no courage. Maybe itâ€™s because of my religious background, but I know I need help. But Iâ€™m just too scared to reach out for help. Iâ€™ve tried chatting with the suicides hotline but I closed it before I got to someone. 80 people in queue. Thatâ€™s actually a lot. I want to talk with this 80. Honestly, I want to be that someone who helps those 80 people in queue on a Tuesday night at 12 in the morning. I want to help others but I feel like I should save myself first in order to help out. Iâ€™m sorry if this seems jumbled. Iâ€™ve been drinking the past hour to â€œrun awayâ€: I know I need help. Please help.
