Is this how I am?I've attempted suicide more times than I can count now. (What can I say, I don't have much of a talent for it.) I'm 21, and I've never been happy. Never. The best stretch of my life was earlier this year, when people were enjoyable and the world was new...
Then I was mugged, abducted, and cut by some random guy. Somehow I lived.
I took a deep breath and kept moving forward. Things were going to be okay, goddamnit.
And then my boyfriend broke up with me.
Fine, didn't need him anyway. Being my own person is great.
And then I was hit by a car. Knee injury, serious concussion. Guy gave me a fake name and number, so I have to deal with all the medical repercussions myself.
This all happened in the space of a month.

So I gave up. That was months ago. I sleep all the time. I cry all the time. I do nothing productive. I am not a contributing member of society. I may have just failed out of school.

I have no one to talk to, except my boyfriend. Poor thing, constantly has to put up with my shit. I finally cracked, and now believe that he'd be better off without me. Sure, he'd be sad for a while, but then he could move on and find someone who could make him happy. 

I've tried myriad therapists, medications, routines, everything. Multiple times. Nothing has ever worked. 

Is this how I am? Because if so, I can't do this for another forty years. I wish I had gone through with it ages ago. I am nothing but a detriment to everyone and everything around me.

What do you do when you tried everything? How can I make it up to my poor boyfriend?

The captcha is pretty hard to read when you're crying this hard.




EDIT: now my cat is missing. She has been the only reason I haven't killed myself in the past. What the fucking fuck, universe.
