Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymore ?Iâ€™m 19 and I have bipolar disorder. canâ€™t fucking take it anymore. I was dating a a guy and lived with him for 2 years and then he fucking left me because he said I drained him. Iâ€™ve been going to therapy/ medication on and off for three years up until this year when my insurance got taken away and I canâ€™t pay for medication that doesnâ€™t even make me feel better, Iâ€™ve been trying to meet new people but everyone eventually ghosts me or tells me Iâ€™m weird and leaves Iâ€™m not like super ugly or anything my personality is just trash I guess ?? And this is my first year in college and Iâ€™m already ready to drop out because Iâ€™ve changed my major twice ??? I found out I had a kidney infection today and I was dissapointed it wasnâ€™t fatal? I know that none of these problems on their own are major big problems but all together it just feels gross I just feel like thereâ€™s no point in living I will never be happy ?? Iâ€™m probably having a depressive episode right now but even if everything else was fine my brain will always be damaged and thereâ€™s nothing I can do about that thereâ€™s nothing for me it all sucks and Iâ€™m suffering so bad and I HAVE NOBODY
