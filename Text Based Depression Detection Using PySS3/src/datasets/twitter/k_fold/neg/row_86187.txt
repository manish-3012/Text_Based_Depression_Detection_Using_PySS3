Depression EndsAlone..
Feel so so alone 
I could do it now 
I never thought that l would or could
But l understand now , it's clear 
you just have to be in pain long enough 
to get to this point 
Wouldn't b missed
My children dont care 
They b sad, but dont need me 
Not anymore , but my
grandies might
I annoy some incredibly 
No matter what l do or say 
The barbs are always sharpened and aimed 
It hurts sooo much
I annoy everyone and am just tolerated
by most 
Don't want mine to find me ..let someone else
So disappointed that lm so easily sunk 
Blown down by every passing emotion 
Weak really 
No reliliance at all
Or just a sign that lm not quiet better yet
OR is this as good as it gets 
No motivation 
In the dark 
Feels like 
Nothing is important 
Nothing at all
But ending the pain .
