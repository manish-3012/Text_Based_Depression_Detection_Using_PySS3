More and more bad news. It's all tumbling down. Why bother?All the same if I die or not. Anytime time I try and explain myself I receive the same advice, same words, venting can only do so much until it's rendered useless. Every time I am just dismissed as edgy or gothic, a fucking mistake. I hate this world, I belong no where and have no desire to. And this so called "help" has done nothing but bring me down, lock me up. These passive aggressive assholes. I hate them. There is nothing left for me. Ring ring bad news they're gone. Fuck sake why bother. People are generally assholes. People either don't know me or completely hate me. I am always dismissed and shunned, always hated and I'll always be some big disappointment. Yet people behave as though my life matters and that they care. I hate myself. I'm a fucking shit stain on earth and deserve to die. My family was right, every person who has ever hurt me was right.
