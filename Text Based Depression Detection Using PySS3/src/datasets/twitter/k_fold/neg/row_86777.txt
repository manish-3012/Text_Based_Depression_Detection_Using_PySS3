How often do you think about suicide?Just a question, as I think about it every day. Is it normal to think about suicide often? Probably not, I'd just like to hear other's thoughts about the issue. (As a sidenote I'm not going to ever pull through with it I'm just wondering if it's as normal as I think it may be)
