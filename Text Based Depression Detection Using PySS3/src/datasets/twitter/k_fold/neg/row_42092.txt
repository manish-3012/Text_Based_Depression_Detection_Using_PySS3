No way to express my pain.That's why I'm here, there is no way to express my pain other than come on here and basically say fuck it all. I've been unavenged for too long, and yet I'm told I have no right to have a vendetta. Wish someone would understand. All i've been seeking is death, and while a comforting and supportive god is real for others, that reality is not there or open for me.

It just isn't, never has been, never will be. Dear universe, wherever the power lies, just do me one favor before I go, make all of those responsible for making me feel lower than the devil himself, or the lowest of the low... make them feel all of my pain, despair, agony, and feel what it's like to have your memories make you want to die every day for their entire life like they did to me. I was purely good, and they stole and robbed everything from me. Take it back for me, and once I'm dead and gone, I won't have to hear all of my betrayal over and over again against my will.

By the way therapists, go fuck yourself.

Med dealers, go fucking kill yourself.

My critics and enemies, go have everything that happened to me happen to you.

I hope you feel all of my pain, and then I will get to see you put on a fake smile the rest of your life while forcing you to live for years and years on end.

These are my last words, I'm gone. There was no help for me, hope there is help for others who somehow made it as far into these infinite depths of hate and dark energy as me.
