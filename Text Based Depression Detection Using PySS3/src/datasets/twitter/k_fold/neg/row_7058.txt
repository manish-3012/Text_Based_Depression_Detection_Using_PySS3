I really need someone to talk to right now.I really need someone to talk to right now, I'm having a relapse into my severe severe depression again (I'm still on meds etc etc.) I just really need someone to talk to; to help me get out of this state and make it a little more easier to handle things. I haven't even gotten out of bed yet today. I think my relapse was caused from my great aunt calling me today and bringing back terrible, terrible memories from when my mom tried to commit suicide, because my dad had been so abusive to her and me and my sisters my whole life. She was saying she doesn't like my mom or understand her and that my eldest sister (who is a sweetheart) is a bad person etc. etc. 
I just really need someone to talk to so I can through today and wake up ok tomorrow, because I know if I don't talk to anyone today, I will get worse by tonight and become suicidal again.
