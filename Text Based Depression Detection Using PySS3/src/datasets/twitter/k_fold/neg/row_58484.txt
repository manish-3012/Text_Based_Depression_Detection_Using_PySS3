I donâ€™t know how much longer I can do this..Iâ€™m so close to ending this all. I canâ€™t stand to go by day after day and pretend I donâ€™t feel this way. As if I donâ€™t feel hurt and alone and sad. I try to tell people how I feel and by the way they react, I donâ€™t think they think Iâ€™m serious... I want to show them Iâ€™m serious....
