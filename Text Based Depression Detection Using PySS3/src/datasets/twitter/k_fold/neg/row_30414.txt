The Sun Is Gone.I am not a happy person. I am not at peace with myself, and I do not believe I am capable of being loved. The sun beats cold on scarred skin, and the rain pours from no obvious direction. I first took to drinking to get rid of my problems. Then smoking, then sex. Now, no matter what I'm doing, working out, smoking, drawing or writing or drinking, I break down into a thousand tiny little pieces. After any pleasure, I find myself empty and alone. I have but one friend, who I am afraid I may have lost. I am moving schools to a place where I know they will bury me. I do not plan on committing tonight, tomorrow night, or this month, but I can feel the end upon me like I can feel an aching loneliness in my bones. I am sorry if I meant anything to the person reading this. I wish you luck in your journey, and I hope that you never have to feel the way I do.
