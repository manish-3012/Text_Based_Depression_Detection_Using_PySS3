my life is a disasteri failed school level 1, 2 ,3, my host family on exchange hated me, i was pushed into 2 art courses i entered planning to leave, i failed a university preparation course, completed my first year of university then dropped out, got exiled from 3 social circles in a year once

last year i dropped out and spent the year on the welfare in deep depression, going in and out of respite care

and i can barely hold down my job here at new world - I can barely hold down a basic supermarket job. ive been taken in by the upper management 3 times

im alone in a state of constant rumination against my will and i'm close to just giving up on life - constant rumination on the past which follows me 24/7 and puts me through an array of emotions every day.
