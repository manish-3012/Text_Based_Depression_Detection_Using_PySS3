What should I do before killing myself?Please to try to convince me not to do it.

I'm writing my suicide note tonight. What should I write to my family and friends to tell them that I loved them?

Brazilian Carnival starts Saturday, my parents will be out of town and my sister and friends will be enjoying this amazing time of the year. I'll take all the medicines I've and the ones I will purchase on the weekend.

What do you like to do? What do you recommend to try for the first time or the last time?
