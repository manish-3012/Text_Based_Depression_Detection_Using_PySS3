Fuck this life. Fuck trying. Created this account just to say goodbye.Long time redditor, and lurker in suicide watch.  I attempted suicide last year, pretty close to this time.  Thought my life was falling apart...ha!  I had no idea how bad it could get.

I'm about to be evicted.  I've lost out on two good paying jobs now.  My girlfriend lives in another state, and is struggling hardcore herself...and I can't even support her.

I have no family here.  I have no family within 2000 miles.  My ex wife won't even check on the kids, let alone give me child support.  she's too busy snorting her money up her nose.

I give up.  I have nothing to sell.  My vehicle is dying.  I have no support from anyone.  I just can't. I've failed at life.
