Advice to comfort my sister. ASAPMy sisters SO just cut his wrists in front of her several minutes ago and she called me in tears from home. He's been taken to the hospital already and she's on the floor in tears. I don't know how to help her get through this.

He's in the hospital and visitors arent allowed. 

This happened around 20 minutes ago.
