Just a general feeling of being lost.I haven't really confronted my depression, just accepted it. I cant tell my parents I want therapy and I cant afford it myself being 16.

I'm not even sure if I am depressed, I just keep feeling either lonely, or hopeless. I just cant stop feeling bad about myself. My main issue is that I dont feel like anyone else feels the way I do. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is an example of my thought process:

For example, recently I was watching The Walking Dead, Just completely out of the blue half way through an episode I felt pretty sad that even these characters had a better life than me, they had friends and associates. This is the thing, Even I barely can describe it I just dont get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

I can see why this just makes me look completely insane, but I just feel like I'm going nowhere. I didn't start feeling like this until I was barely 15, (I am 16 now.)
