Constant thoughts, mind racingI've thought about suicide for the past seven years. I used to think everyone thought about it all the time. Every day it crosses my mind and it would be so easy if only I wasn't afraid. I try burning myself but I'm not strong enough. I just want to disappear. What do I do?
