Life isn't worth livingEvery day is a struggle. Every day is filled with pain: emotional, mental, social, physical. My life has always been difficult. I fe like I want made to live in this world. There's so much wrong with me that will never go away.

But the worst part is that life isn't worth continuing. I have no future. There's no path that ends with me living a content or peaceful life. It's just different flavors of suffering. The only reason I don't kill myself is because of my family, and even that is waning. When  things haven't improved by May I will kill myself. My family can process and get over the pain of my death, but my demons are just insurmountable.
