Never thought I could be so bad at dying for someone who is so bad at living.I've been through this so many times. They keep saying I'm lucky that every time I try I fail to do myself in. Not for lack of effort or holes in my research/planning I might add. 

I just know that no matter what program, or pill, or baseless optimism they push immediately after I'm found or turned in...it's a waste of effort and resources.

I've said it before, but I feel so incompatible with life. I have no desire for a relationship, my job is tedious and draining, my employees have no clue how different I am when the lights dim for the night. I'm executing the same routine daily, and numbing the nights and weekends with drugs.

Why do they get so mad when I say I've had enough and want out? They genuinely wouldn't notice my absence.
