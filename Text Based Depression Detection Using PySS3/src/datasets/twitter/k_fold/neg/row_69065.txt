My girlfriend is very depressed and, through a lot of struggle, has realized that she needs to speak to a therapist. Her parents take psycho therapy as a joke. What do I do?She has a history of depression and has had some very bad lows (to a point where she contemplates suicide). I've been trying to help her for a while now, through the highs and lows, but it doesn't seem like I'm doing much. I'm out of ideas and could use some help!

EDIT:: Thanks to everyone that helped talk me through this, it was a great help! I'm going keep a bookmark on this page so that I can refer to the information, if need be. :) &lt;3
