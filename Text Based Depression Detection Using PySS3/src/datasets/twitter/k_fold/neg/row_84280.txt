Iâ€™m not courageous enough.I want to kill myself. I so fucking want to, but my fear of dying and my weakness as a person has been keeping me from actively going through. Like, what do I need to do to work up the courage? Start cutting? Try killing myself just on a whim?

I want to make the blow as softening as possible, meaning I clean up my room beforehand and also get all my money and college stuff in order before I finally leave.

I could get this all done in a week, but I only have until tomorrow. Accessing alcohol and drinking to death is how I feel is the smartest way to go at it, and it being New Yearâ€™s Eve is the only time I will see it in abundance.

I donâ€™t know what to do, and more importantly donâ€™t know how to feel.
