Now I can't even sleep in peaceI keep having nightmares. Last night I dreamed my cystic acne had come back and I was back to looking like a fucking avocado. Felt so shit I shot myself in the face just like back then. I can't even talk about without my parents saying I'm always dramatic. It's not fucking drama goddammit I really would shoot myself if it came back. Hell, I can barely look in the mirror now. Sometimes I wish there was resurrection or some shit because that's the only way I'd look half-shit instead of full turd.
