I deserve to die.My posts are downvoted. Am I just bitchy? Do I deserve to be yelled at every day? Am I the who's making the problems? If I'm so bad, I deserve to die. I don't know how the right way to do things so I post over and over again. And I get help. But I just say and do stupid things. Am I fucked up? I probably sound stupid all of the time. That one time when she pointed a knife at me, she should have just put it through me. It would have been a lot better. Sure, she hurt me a lot but at least I'd never fight back and feel guilty about it. I seem to be slowly turning into her. I don't want to be her. Please downvote me -9358903257809235892374082374. I deserve it. Please just ignore me. Just ignore my post and hurt me because I deserve it. I'm an idiot. I just need to die and get it over with instead of wasting everyone's time, but I'm so stupid that I don't know how. It must be too late for me to be normal. I'm sick of trying to believe that I'm a good person when I get told that I was born fucked up. They're the ones who have the job so I must be fucked up right? I must be a parasite? I wouldn't be a parasite any more if I was dead. Who cares if I'm a good person or a bad person? I'm just some person who sucks off others right? Isn't there some way where I can make the end of me? Everyone will be better off and they can rejoice in the fact that this horrible person is no longer here. Tomorrow, she'll finally go to back to work.. Hopefully I can figure out something so I have the entire day to do it tomorrow. Nobody will ever have to think of me again.

Edit: Thank you so much for your comments. I'm just really trying to put it all in my heart and come to peace with myself, but in a good way! Thank you.
