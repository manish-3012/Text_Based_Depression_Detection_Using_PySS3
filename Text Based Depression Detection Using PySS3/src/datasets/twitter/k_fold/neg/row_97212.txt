I feel emptyI donâ€™t feel like disclosing my name or family but every day I feel hurt. I feel like My life I spiraling down and the empty lonely feeling grows bigger. I tried waking up today to achieve something and maybe feel happy but it never happens. I used to watch movies go out with friends to hide the pain but deep down it hurts. Itâ€™s hard to be happy and my mom tells me Iâ€™m a loser because I give up trying to do stuff. I feel so fucking empty and I donâ€™t no what to write. I thought of killing myself a lot and i canâ€™t keep the thought out of my head...
