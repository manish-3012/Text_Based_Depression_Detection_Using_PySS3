I need someone to notice I exist...I feel so freaking lonely right now. Its not something that  goes over after a day or so, its been like this for years. Its like nobody ever sees or hears me, like i dont exist. I could try to talk to people and nobody listens, i could reach out to people on social medias but nobody ever notice me. It feels like im invisible and its killing me. I hate this life and if tings keep going like this I think I might kill myself. I hate feeling this invisible wherever I go.
