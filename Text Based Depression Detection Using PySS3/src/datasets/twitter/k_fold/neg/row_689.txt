Every day is my last dayEvery day I say I am going to kill myself today. But it doesn't happen and i have to wake up to this hell once again. I cannot live like this. What's the point of living if I'm just barely hanging on. My life is a wreck. Why bother breathing anymore. Why not just hang and be done with it. I just don't know.
