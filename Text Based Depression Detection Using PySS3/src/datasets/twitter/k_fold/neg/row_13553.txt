Suicide thoughts everytime I am alone.. But still want to live.. Anyone feeling the same?I've been depressed and having suicidal thoughts for three years now (bullied because I am still a virgin (I am a 21-years old male), have health problems, low self-estiem, the girl I love is with someone else, had one secret sexual intercourse with a stranger (man) while drunk even though I am not gay, etc).

I have a loving family and friends, and a strong belief that I can success in the future.. But when alone,  I am always having these thoughts of killing myself. I reached a point where I am having these thoughts several times a day.. I am afraid to commit it.. I can't stand being the "virgin" guy anymore, who always have health issues.. Please help me
