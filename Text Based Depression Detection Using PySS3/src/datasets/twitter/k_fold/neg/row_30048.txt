Don't play with chemicals peopleIt happened a month ago. Days after moving back to my university town post-christmas, I got a strong huff of some burnt chemicals at work. It left me dazed and confused, stressed and anxious.

"I'll sleep it off" I said at first. Then, "I'll head back home for a few days and regroup." Now, a month of full time work has passed and I return to university in a week. And nothing has changed. I have tunnel vision, struggling to read and adjust depth of field. My reality is jaded like a memory. Daily chores and even leisure activities and socialising have become too tiresome to enjoy.

I can't live like this. I don't know how long it will take for my mental stamina to give in, but if my state doesn't improve it will only be a matter of time. I can only endure so much.
