How do you stop yourself from feeling suicidal?I attempted suicide in mid August and although Iâ€™m doing somewhat better than I was then, Iâ€™m still in a bad place and regularly find myself thinking about trying again because the problems in my life that led to the attempt havenâ€™t gone away, and wonâ€™t for some time.

How do you guys deal with this and what suggestions do you have about how to work towards getting better? 

(Iâ€™m already on medication and receiving regular therapy and have been for a long time, since before the attempt, so Iâ€™m looking more for things I can do on my own to help myself)
