I did the thing your supposed to do, I went to the emergency. Iâ€™ve been here 2 weeks and itâ€™s so obvious they have no idea wtf to do with me.I mean they keep asking me what they can do like Iâ€™m the one who got the degree.  I got walked in on Friday as I was almost all prepped and instead I just cried instead and got put on watch for the night.  Iâ€™ve planned out how to do it without the noticing if they check on me.  I would have rather broken my neck quickly rather than suffocate but w/e.   Iâ€™m a little hesitant but I am rather pessimistic about anything improving for me.  The doctor is already patting himself on the back for a job well done cause apparently Iâ€™m doing better than two weeks ago and they wanna transfer me to another unit that Iâ€™ve been in before and Iâ€™m supposed to think that THIS time Iâ€™ll come out better.  My out patient doctor really insisted I come here on my own because he knew itâ€™d get ugly if the cops tried to bring me in.  For some fucking reason I listened.  Iâ€™m just so tired of trying.  I keep being told it gets better and Iâ€™m such a good person and I donâ€™t deserve to die but thatâ€™s obviously bullshit.  I keep promising them I wonâ€™t try anything for another day but Iâ€™m running out of patience.
