Advice?I'm so scared I'm going to do something stupid, I'm more scared I'm actually thinking about doing it.

So I've always thought about suicide as a teenager but it got a lot worse when I got diagnosed with Cancer at 19.

The thing is I always said I couldn't do it because of my mum and family, my mum more than anything. I put her through so much especially the cancer, she took care of me 24/7 and I love her so much but now not even that thought is stopping me wanting to do it.

I just want everything to stop right now

I was sent to therapy just after I went into remission but I feel like it made everything worse. I think a lot more about the things we uncovered. Although I'm sure it works for other people and that's amazing but I couldn't keep going to it. 

I think the problem is I did start to feel better talking to her and one day she reminded me that this can't go on forever as we were just here to talk about the Cancer. By that time I was pretty okay but I felt like I was taking too much time of off work so I agreed to end it there.

Then there's the fact that since Monday I've been waking up and feeling to throw up and every morning I think the same thing "you can do it right now, while your sisters asleep and your mums at work"

I just miss having someone to talk about these feelings, should I tell my mum how I'm feeling? Or like my friend in work? But what is he tells my boss?
