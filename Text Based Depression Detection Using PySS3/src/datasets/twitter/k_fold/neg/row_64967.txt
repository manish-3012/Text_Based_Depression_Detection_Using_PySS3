Lost &amp; ConfusedMy girlfriend is the only thing stopping me from hulking myself. Ironically, I'm the same for her. I'm a 21 year old black trans guy. Paying for transition is obviously out of the question. I don't have any family I can depend on. No one will hire me or give me a place to live and I've been actively looking since late October. I haven't held a real job since Dec 2015. I opened up a clothing company that I really care about but no one knows about it or checks it out anymore. I'm schizoaffective, which is schizophrenia + a mood disorder; bipolar II. Every day is a struggle and it's getting more and more difficult to get up in the mornings. I've been living in the back of my girlfriend's car because her father definitely wouldn't allow me to stay. 

On her shit, she suffers from Crohn's disease. She might go to jail for having her own prescription pills outside of the bottle (which no one tells you is illegal) and she considers ending it all daily. Her father genuinely doesn't care about her and refuses to help her even though he's more than capable. 

We're both hopeless and very tired.
