20 years old and had enough.I'll try and keep this short, even though I feel I have a lot I could cover in this post.

I turned 20 not long ago. I just failed my course in college, and at the moment it is undecided whether I should go back to college and spend another year there studying, or try to find employment. To be honest, I wish I could do neither and just stay at home. I'm tired of everything. For as long as I can remember, I've detested being a contributing member of society. I've always been a punching bag for everyone else; having been relentlessly bullied throughout my schooling years, and having been left with no choice but to embrace my worsening social isolation. I don't talk to anyone. I don't want to talk to anyone after the years of torment they have put me through.

I dread how my 20s will play out. I dread having to resort to being a wageslave for a society that is disgusted by my existence, having to deal with even more bullying and harassment at the hands of my manager and co-workers. I dread continuing to live knowing that life just gets harder as you enter adulthood.

I've always thought I'll be one to die young. I can recount having thoughts of hurting myself as early as 12 years of age, and even that scares myself. I just don't see myself dying a natural death of old-age, I never have. Honestly, the only thing stopping me from ending it all, is that I know my family will be devastated to see me go. Also, fear of what happens next is another thing keeping me back. Having no idea what happens after you die just utterly terrifies me.

As miserable as I am with myself... I want to try and hold onto life for as long as I can. I don't know how long that will be.

I just want a reason to stay alive.
