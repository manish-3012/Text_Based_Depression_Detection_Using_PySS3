How can it be possible for life to suck this much?I am a 29 yr old single, gay, unemployed, broke, homeless, ophaned millenial that has reached the point where I have no desire to try anymore. Everything in my life has been one struggle or another. I have no family, was a ward of the state until I was 18, I did actually go to college and earned a BS. However, its about as useful as toilet paper these days. In foster care I was put on ADHD meds and forces to take them everyday, now I feel like im dependent on them and am ostracized everytime I get a refill. Lost my job because my manager felt intellectually threatened by me, considering she only had a HS diploma. Been living in my car for the past week, only paying my bills off with credit cards hoping that Ill find a job soon. And now, it feel like this would be a lot easier if I just werent around anymore. Pretty sure nobody will notice Im gone until they find me in my car by accident.
