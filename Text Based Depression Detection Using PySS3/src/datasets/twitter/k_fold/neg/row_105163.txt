I donâ€™t even like myselfIâ€™ve become what all my bullies and abusers have called me.

Loser. Fat. Worthless. Lazy.

I know I shouldnâ€™t let them have this power over me. But I donâ€™t care anymore really. 

This life has shown me nothing but pain. Everyone who I thought cared about me has only hurt me in the end. Then abandoned me without an apology.

Everyone thinks Iâ€™m crazy. Maybe theyâ€™ve said it enough times that now Iâ€™m actually becoming crazy. 

Iâ€™ve been isolated for over a month. Only sleeping and watching tv and being on my phone. Unemployed and a waste of space. Friendless and no relationship. My family doesnâ€™t give a shit about me either. 

The answer is so simple. End it all. I have nothing left to live for. Why canâ€™t I just stop being scared. Iâ€™m failing at this too. Iâ€™ve always been just a failure in my parents eyes. 

I need to stop being scared. Everyone dies eventually. Mine is just going to be a little sooner.
