Toxic Friend, SuicidalWith abusive parents, and siblings that would rather do nothing, my mental state became unstable. Along with BPD and clinical depression, I hurt those who actually loved me. So I'm quite suicidal myself. Then came along one of my friends, the relationship felt so one sided with me putting all the effort in, she would unintentionally hurt my feelings and bring me down. But then she confided in me only about her and suicide, but after she talked and practically insulted me, saying that everyone else was better and she felt like they would be bothered by her. I know that people have different reactions to things, and something you might find okay, some might be traumatized. I was so pissed at myself for being so fucking pissed that her main reason for suicide was because her parents would sometimes occasionally fight, it made me so fucking pissed because I had parents that would push and shove me mentally and physically. I started slowly to hate her more and more, and I'm so disgusted at myself. I know that she could be toxic due to her own personal thoughts, and her having to cope with her thoughts, but she accidentally insulting me time and time again, makes me wanna commit suicide so much more. I wanna separate myself from her, but I'm afraid she might kill herself because there was no one there for her, or that if I tell her what she does to me, she will also kill herself because she felt guilty. But if this keeps going on I may not even be alive to support her, what do I do?
