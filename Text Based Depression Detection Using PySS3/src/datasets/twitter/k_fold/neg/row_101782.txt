Iâ€™m losing hopeHello!

I just joined this subreddit because I need to talk about it; I canâ€™t talk about it to my friend because I donâ€™t want him to be stressed or whatever, so Iâ€™d rather talk about it here (and I wonâ€™t talk about it to my parents, because Iâ€™m just a Â«Â crybabyÂ Â»)

Recently, death seems more and more appealing for me because of everything

Here are my problems: 

- Iâ€™m 18 and I have ptsd, and everyday my mind is torturing me with things like Â«Â youâ€™re faking it, youâ€™re worthless, nobody would care if you diedÂ Â»

- Iâ€™m going to university tomorrow, but I canâ€™t stop thinking about how everything I have ever experienced in the past will happen again in university

- I am blamed for not having friends to the point where my parents might think that Iâ€™m unstable

- When I see the state of the world, I honestly think that this unfair, shitty world should be left behind (even though sometime you can find beautiful things laying here and there)

- because of my ptsd I have to avoid many things to the point where itâ€™s ridiculous

- I canâ€™t stop thinking about how none of us is free to the point where I think that the only time we can rest in when we die

- I have huge abandonment issues to the point where if someone doesnâ€™t act the same way for a millisecond, I will stress because I will think that they will leave me

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m expecting by putting all of this here, but writing things is my way of coping with everything
