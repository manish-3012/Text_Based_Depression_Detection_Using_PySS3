absolutely tiredI was going to make another acc to post this but actually fuck it, I don't really care if people find out. I posted here before I believe. I have reached such a low moment in my life and I feel like I can't reach out anymore. I have no idea what to do, because I feel like dying every single moment I'm awake but I just can't bring myself to do it. I just exist, in a meaningless job, a meaningless college, with meaningless friendships that have no idea what happens to me because I don't bother them with my bullshit. I just constantly feel like, if I died in an accident, it would be the best thing to happen. And I also don't know why I'm posting this here. I guess I just need friends.
