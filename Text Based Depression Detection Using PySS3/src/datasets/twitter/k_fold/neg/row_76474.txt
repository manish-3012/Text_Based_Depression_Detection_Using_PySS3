The "I want out" feeling is getting unbearableI started a new full time job on Monday (9-5 in an office); 3 nights out of 5 I've ended up crying myself to sleep thinking about how miserable I am vs how happy I was only a couple of years ago. 1 thing changed and just like that I've been depressed for 2 years and my introverted/shyness turned into full blown social anxiety. I've distanced myself from all my friends, so much so that they basically forgot I exist.. I've failed at being a good son to my parents by being a complete mess for the past 2 years.. I don't take care of my diet or even bother with the gym anymore.. I just don't care.

I don't see myself changing for the better any time soon and I can't take it anymore. The only thing that has helped me so far is medical marijuana at night but even that is temporary and not a true solution. My work is under a 10 month contract and once it's up I seriously don't know what I'm going to do. I'll be 26 and to be honest right now I don't see myself going past 30. The only thing that could hold me back is my parents.. not because I like them too much to take my life, but because I know that they genuinely love me and that it would ruin theirs.
