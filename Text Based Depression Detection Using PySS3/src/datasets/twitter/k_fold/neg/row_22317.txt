i made a song to cope with the night?im tired, but i dont wanna sleep 
im hungry, but i dont wanna eat
i dont get it, nor does my family.
and nobody can seem to understand me.

i hope when im lying dead on the ground
that im not noticed, or that ill be found   
when i fall, i wont make a sound      
and when i do it, nobody will be around

suicide has taken over my brain,    
and when i think, im going insane    
i just want to get away, get rid of the    pain 
but im held back by some sort of chain. 

when i think of myself i see myself dead   
my thoughts were small but now they have spread    
when they see me falling, it doesnt have to be said      
for when they see me, theyll    understand me instead

for once

and before you beg for me to live or plead 
just know that i did myself a good deed.
i got rid of myself, in a world full of greed. 
and you should know- it was meant to be

instead of mourning, spread a good seed.
spread one to prevent suicide for people like me. 
because im not just it, there are more people in need
and now im gone, im finally freed

there are people who live, depressed 
this needs to be assessed
for their minds are similar, they are all a mess
the thought of death will manifest

suicide is not a joke
people like us have no hope
we often feel like we are a ghost 
instead of laughing, help us at most
