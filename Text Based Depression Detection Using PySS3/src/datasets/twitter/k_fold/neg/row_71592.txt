I'm calm, not upset, still consideringI've hurt my bf by asking if he'd consider opening our relationship. I wasn't looking for anything permanent, I just wanted someone for sex only. But instead, I hurt him by they question.

Due to having lost his job a year ago, and his house being forcibly put up for sale six months ago, he's had to deal with a lot of stress and depression. Which has negatively affected our sex life.

But instead of just accepting it, I started seeing if I could arrange for someone to take control from me, something that my bf knows I've wanted, and give me no choice. And I think I've gotten interest... And it sounds like they have enough to make it happen.

So, not only have I hurt my bf tonight with the question, he may be further hurt by me having sought out this attention. I should have asked him before I did this.

But, since this is my fault, I'm not sure what to do. Years ago, I had been self destructive. Two suicide attempts, and then actively seeking someone who's hurt/damage me enough for the injuries to finish me off. Stupid, I know. But guess what? I have more effective tools, more likely to work, this time.

So, do I wait, and see if my attempt to call off my plans work? Or know that my bf will probably never trust me again? Or try to make him pissed and leave? Leaving just means I'll go back to my old behavior, only more effective, either way. I don't know what to do. But like I said, I'm thinking. And can't blame emotion if I choose to kill myself.
