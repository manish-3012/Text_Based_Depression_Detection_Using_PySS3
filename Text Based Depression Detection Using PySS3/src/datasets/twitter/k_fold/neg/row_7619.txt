I want this to be overEverything I do is a waste of time. I'm piece of shit I deserve to feel this way, to suffer every single day of my life. Sometimes I wonder if used to be happy.

I try so hard to be hopeful for the future but that hope never lasts. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I hope I come up with the courage soon.
