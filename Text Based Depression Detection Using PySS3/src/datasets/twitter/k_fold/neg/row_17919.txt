A final letter from a man with nothing leftI don't know how many people will read this, it's not like the death of someone so insignificant will matter in the long run. 

My entire life has been a chain of horrible events - each worse than the other. And whenever something good came up once in a blue moon, it was coldly ripped from my hands. By all accounts I should have ended my worthless existence long ago, but you had to give me hope.

You told me that you loved me more than life itself, you told me I could trust you. And I did, despite everything telling me that I should not. I opened up to you about everything, laid my life down before you like cards on a poker table. I did everything for you - supported you when you told me about the abuse you've suffered at the hands of your parents, stayed up all night just to talk to you because you begged me to stay, made you gifts for no other reason but to see you smile, tried my absolute hardest to be the man you deserved - and what do you do? You admit to cheating on me with some guy you barely know and no longer caring about me a day before our 7th anniversary. When I ask why, what do you do? You scoff at me and act like nothing mattered. Like everything we've been through happened to someone else.

I'm honestly done. I'm sick of this lonely, meaningless existence. What even is my purpose in life? To suffer endlessly? It's all the same sick joke over and over again.

Today, the suffering ends.
