How to subdue suicidal thoughts?So it's 2 am and My depression and thoughts are running rampant again. I've been in this cycle now for 10 days where I dont sleep till about 4am in the morning, and am at a point where I can only last one hour AT BEST before I grow cynical to everything around me, and the only reason I can last one hour is because I'm waking up incredibly groggy from last night. My thoughts are very cynical especially if it involves sex or romance in some form. It's honestly gotten to the point where I'm thinking about it. I'm a virgin, and I've told myself that if nothing has changed for me in another 4-5 years I'm just gonna hire an escort to take my virginity, and then after I'll just go for it. Meds haven't helped me with my depression, but they may come to use soon enough.

Just to finish, I haven't been in any type of relationship yet and yeah, just college did nothing for me except for chewing me up and spitting out any confidence I had in me.
