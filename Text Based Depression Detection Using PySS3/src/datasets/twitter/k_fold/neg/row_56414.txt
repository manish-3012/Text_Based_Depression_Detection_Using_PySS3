If I did it..my parents would cry
but they wouldn't have to worry about me anymore.

my boyfriend would think it was his fault..but only for this one last time.

i would miss out on everything life has in store for me..which sounds good to me.

i wouldn't have to muddle through my messed up thoughts anymore.

I wouldn't have to hurt anymore.

the problems of the world.. the abuse, cruelty, injustices...i wouldn't even be aware of them anymore.  

I wouldn't have to deal with my friends not understanding how i feel and telling me i'm not worth their time.  i wouldn't have to admit they're right.

i wouldn't have to worry about death anymore.

all the stupid thoughts and dreams and regrets and pains would all stop without condition.  

the only one i don't want to leave behind is a stuffed animal.  a dog that everyone, even my therapist has said i shouldn't even have as a 25 year old male.  

i just hurt. i don't know what i even want or need, if anything. maybe just someone to talk to. maybe i'm ready to get it over with. *shrug* goodnight
