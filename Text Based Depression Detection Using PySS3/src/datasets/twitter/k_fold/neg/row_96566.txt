Is it a bad idea to confront your rapist?I was raped about 2 months ago and I haven't had any contact with him since. I've posted about this before so I'll just put it again down below: About a little bit over a month ago I was raped. But I say I was sexually assaulted because I'm too afraid to admit what happened to me. I was very drunk and my cousin had ditched me with one of his friends at 1 in the morning at a bar downtown. Now I was almost falling over drunk so his friend helped me home. Now I'm gay, and I was in no place to consent to anything, and if I had been, I wouldn't have consented. So we had started kissing but I wasn't really in control of my actions, so I stopped but he "convinced" me to keep going. I really was basically almost passed out but he started having sex with me and I had at no point said yes to anything. I had to push him off me and I managed to make him leave. Now that it's been over a month I've refused to let myself even think about it because I have a pretty lengthy history with depression and I've been feeling good lately and I don't want to trigger anything. It's like I've been pretending it didn't happen but I know that one day it'll all come crashing down. This is the most I've ever thought about it. I also have attempted suicide in the past.'
If I were to confront him what would I say?
