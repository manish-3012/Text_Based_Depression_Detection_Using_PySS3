Just feeling empty[17 M] I've lived the year doing my best to try and make everyone happy, took up commitments to make my parents proud, helped out friends who were going through a lot, overworked myself so they could have some time off, tried my best to keep a smile on everyone's face. I'd hide my breakdowns and panic attacks in the toilet so no one's really caught on. Today I've seen my friend get driven to the edge cuz of a small misunderstanding in an exam and I was scared he'd cut himself and I couldn't help him, all I could say was to let me know how I could help. Something's snapped and now I'm laying in bed crying and wishing I don't wake up tomorrow, I tried to picture myself dying but honestly it still scares me, but I'm not sure how long more that's gonna deter me. People around me say the vocal ones announcing suicide never really do it, so I hope that's true. Just wanted to get this off my chest, still have some notes written for people in case that day finally comes. Thanks for reading
