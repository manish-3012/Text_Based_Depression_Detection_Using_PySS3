I almost actually tried todayI've had suicidal thoughts for 3 years now and I've had times I really wanted to go through with it but deep down I always knew I would never actually do it but today I reached my limit and I held a bottle of acetaminophen and was completely ready to take a shit ton of pills and wash it down with alcohol.

The thing that stopped me was my family waiting in the car for me and I was scared they would come inside and see me. After looking up the symptoms tonight I'm horrfied and 100% sure I would have caved and went to the doctor but to think I actually had it in me to do it before I knew anything about the side effects is weird and scary. I think if I had a gun I would've done it. I don't have anything to use to impulsively kill myself so I'm safe I guess.
