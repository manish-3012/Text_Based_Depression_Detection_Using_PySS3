It's dullI have suffered through depression seriously for over 2 years now. It's always been a very deep sadness that I felt consumed in. It escalated around April when I would cry from simple thoughts alone. Thinking rationally seemed like a far fetched concept.
I had an amazing month this summer because I was in a great relationship with an amazing guy until a few days ago when he broke up with me. Of course I am depressed again. I realized that it's not just due to the breakup, but actually all my negative thoughts were covered up by the giddyness I felt being in a relationship. Now the relationship is done, so that leaves me here.
I feel so dull. I'm bored, but not in the way like I want to watch TV or have a bunch of friends over. Rather, I'm bored of existing. Of getting up. Talking to my family and friends. Working on things. I'm so fucking bored. Getting through one hour is tough sometimes. I can't focus. My rational mind says I should kill myself. Not even now, but certainly in the future. You know, when things get dull enough for me to not have any reason to put effort into living. I'm scared and I'm sad. I haven't played piano in weeks. I'm losing myself. I don't know where to go next.
