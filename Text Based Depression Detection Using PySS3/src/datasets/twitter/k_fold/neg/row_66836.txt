Exhausted.I donâ€™t really see a point in what Iâ€™m doing with my life anymore. I tried getting help, getting on meds, pretending to be a positive person, read all the bullshit self-help books that exist, and for what? 

Iâ€™m tired of being disappointed in people. Iâ€™m tired of saying goodbye to the people and things I love. And I donâ€™t think I have the mental fortitude to handle any further loss. No amount of coping strategies can get me through this. 

I sleep 12+ hours a day because Iâ€™m desperately trying to escape my own consciousness. But even my unconscious mind manages to conjure up horrific dreams in my sleep. 

I want out.
