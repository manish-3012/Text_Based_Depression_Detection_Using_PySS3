There is a light at the end of my tunnel, but its so far awayContemplating suicide has been a reoccurrence throughout my lifetime. I hate my life as it is, I am stuck, powerless and eager to change it. There is no hope in sight for the next 2 years at least. I know I have great potential in the way future, but none for now. Im just trying to lifelessly drag myself through the next years but sometimes I feel no motivation what so over and think about my other options. What should I do?
