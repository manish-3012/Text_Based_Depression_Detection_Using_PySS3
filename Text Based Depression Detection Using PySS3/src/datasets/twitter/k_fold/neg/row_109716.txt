ldr breakup hurtI donâ€™t want to kill myself, that feeling has passed, but I am in a lot of pain. Iâ€™d appreciate any kind words right now because Iâ€™m really not doing the best.. 

Things between my ldr and I was rough, and I was on a sinking ship trying to keep us both afloat. A few weeks ago he wanted to leave me, and maybe we should have ended things then. It wouldnâ€™t be anything compared to the pain Iâ€™m in currently. But he agreed to continuing to try to stick things out. 

I flew out to another state in the past week to spend some time with him.  To be fair I have been pretty disconnected all week, and havenâ€™t wanted to do much, but at the same time I also deal with mental health issues that can be super draining.  I wanted to speak about our issues in person, but never found the right time, because things seemed alright. And when I finally did crack of how I am feeling, he dumped me. The reason I had been repressing my issues for weeks now is because last time that things had gotten bad, the same outcome happened &amp; it really hurts my soul. 

I found somewhere to stay yesterday, and he came over for about 10 minutes, my conversation that I wanted to have got cut off with, not having things in common anymore, distance, &amp; being 1 sided because he doesnâ€™t care to put the effort in. 

Itâ€™s selfish and it really hurts. 
I have seen him 6/7 months consecutively making trips down, and not doing much for myself at all because I donâ€™t have much money and whatever money I did have was usually spent on plane tickets. 
I just donâ€™t understand why he didnâ€™t just ghost me etc a few weeks ago, I donâ€™t understand why he spent a week with me acting like things are fine, just to destroy me. 

(One thing that was extremely sus, was the fact heâ€™s always on his phone now &amp; when Iâ€™d look he would kind of hide it away when Iâ€™m messenger..)

He used to be such a sweet person, and he changed, into someone that just doesnâ€™t care. Donâ€™t get me wrong, I have my own flaws, but I can identify them and Iâ€™m working on fixing those. 

This entire thing has just engulfed me really.. it just hurts putting so much effort/time &amp; money, just for someone to throw it all away. 

It hurts, so much. 
I want to hate him, but even now, I care so much about him.
