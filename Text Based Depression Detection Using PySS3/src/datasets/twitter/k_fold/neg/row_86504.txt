I don't know how to help my friend...A friend of mine is in serious depression. He has no money for professional help. I am not emotionally equipped to help him. His parents don't care, he is very talented but going nowhere with his life. He wants to die but says he doesn't have the guts. He is constantly angry and hates all of this and says he wants to just end it. I don't know how to help...
