Still not worth it.I tried to make myself throw up several times in my friend's bathroom today without success. Now I'm sat in their kitchen. All of my closest friends are sat in the room next to this one but not a single one has come to see if I'm okay. My best friend, who I love with all my heart, is probably too busy fondling my other friend creepily to care about me. It's one of their birthdays so I can't tell them I want to die because that's just a horrible thing to bring up on your birthday. All I really want is a hug, but I'm too scared to ask.

I hope anyone reading has a much better day: you probably deserve it :) thanks for reading.
