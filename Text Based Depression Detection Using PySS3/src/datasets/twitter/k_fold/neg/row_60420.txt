What the fuck should I do?Almost thirty years old, never had a girlfriend, spending my nights and/or evening playing games because I have no idea what else to do to break my boredom. I have no real close friend and I feel loneliness even more during christmas time. Winter is just shitty for me, also I have too much debt, I have a hard time paying everything at the end of each months, all because I spend too much and everything seem to be so out of control especially when I get that depression in the winter. I feel worthless, don't want to call my mother, don't want to talk to anyone. I tried dating sites hoping I could find a girlfriend there but I stopped trying because I feel my situation is so hopeless that I don't think anyone would ever want to stay with me. I would also need to have a root canal, one of my teeth is broken but I don't have those 800$. I'm starting to consider suicide as an option, maybe I could do it on my birthday im March, I know I will be alone anyway on that day. I' already taking pills for anxiety disorder and I got help from a psychologist when I was younger, but it doesn't change the fact that I'll soon be a lonely thirty years old guy. 

Having a job is good, only  if you don't feel emptiness and loneliness each time you get back home.
