Does life really have purpose ?I dont see any point in living in a perpetual cycle of sleeping, eating,,fucking, working, shitting. Without any bias , if we look into life, we can see that it has really no purpose to itself. All things that we strive for are temporary and we just set goals and hold on to things in life to give our life some purpose, other than that humans as animals has no purpose on this earth. Everything that we do and see is just a trick of our mind. Humans as whole are poison to the earth and they are just so despicable with their cunning ways and hypocratical behavours that i sometimes think why would we even exist. All we do is being jealous, angry and just running like madman behind things which we dont need and which we dont even want and which make no sense. In the end, when we die, it is all gone, we wont even remember if we ever existed. I wonder why people have babies and they bring the suffering on them only to be parents.

I think life is a lie and we strive for things which dont even matter in the end bc we die eventually. It is just early or late, doesnt matter in my opinion.

I think many times about suicide but i am not brave enough bc i dont want my mother to suffer. Maybe after her, i wont stay long here.
