I'm ending it all in 7 days if nothing changesI know this is just gonna get buried like every other cry for help but I really just wanted to vent. I'm so undeniably worthless I have no talent no friends and no family that loves or cares about me. I feel invisible. To not have anybody who likes you for as long as I have its clear that I'm the problem not everyone else. And no matter how hard I try I literally can not develop any skills whatsoever. I fuck up everything I do and every time I try to practice at something I either get distracted, can't will myself to do it or just can't learn it. I'm just out of options and I refuse to live as a waste of space. No one will miss me.
