Feel like I'm getting closer.So I decided some time ago that of wait until my parents died before I'd kill myself. However more and more it's feeling like I won't be able to make it that long. 

No idea what I'm expecting by posting here, I can't really see what could be said. I've tried therapy, all sorts of different medications. Nothing helps, I just don't want to be alive. I'm 35 and I really thought things might have improved a bit by now but it's only gotten worse and worse as the years have gone by. 

Dunno how much longer I can keep up the facade.
