My best friend.A few years ago my best friend told me she loved me and wanted to be with me. But a week or two later she told me she liked girls and only girls and that was why we didn't date anymore. We remained Best friends for  a couple of years because I honestly thought that was why she didn't want to be with me. I respected her sexuality so I was happy just being her friend we even went to a pride festival... A couple of days ago she told me she met someone and it wasn't a girl. She made me feel so stupid for being upset that she told me the reason why she didn't want me was because she only liked girls.... This really fucked me up.
