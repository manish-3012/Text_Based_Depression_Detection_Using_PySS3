I feel so guilty.Iâ€™m sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place to post. I wasnâ€™t really sure where I could post. 

Two years ago one of my close friends killed herself. She had texted me everyday for weeks talking about it, and how sheâ€™d do it. Some days she was better, sheâ€™d talk about wanting a family and what she wants for herself. Most days she was terrible. It went on for weeks, every single day, and I always responded. 

One day I didnâ€™t respond. I suffer from a lot of mental illness and often feel suicidal myself. I guess I was getting worn down with constantly hearing someone I love talk about it. Well, the one day I didnâ€™t respond I get a message from her sister. My friend was gone. 


I feel guilt. Even now I just feel so guilty. It literally tears me apart and I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I can go a while without thinking about it, but it always comes back. I donâ€™t know what to do.
