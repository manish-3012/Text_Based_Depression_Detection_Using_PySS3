Talked to a loved one and things actually worked out but now I don't know what to doSo I do this thing every year or so where I tell my family about my struggle with suicide even though I expect the same answer- that I'm weak minded and that the bible will fix everything. I know I'm still juvenile because I need my family for validation, but I don't know, I guess I'm grasping for straws looking for anything to stop me from going over the edge. But today my mother was supportive and listened- she doesn't get it but she's trying her best to understand.

I've been desperately wanting to get better but I'm sitting in this grey area where I'm not in an immediate crisis but I know shit will go down the next time I bug out. I want to get better but I'm scared I'm gonna purposefully fuck everything up to the point of no return and I don't know where to start getting help.

Is there an online support group for this stuff? I live in a rural area and I don't want to show face...
