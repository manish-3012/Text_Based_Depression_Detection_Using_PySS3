If you are not scared of the scariest thing there is - death, why are you scared of life?I see lot of people typing "I'm not scared of death" - it's the feeling of peaceful ecstasy when thinking about ending these negative emotions, but deep down you are scared - I was also there.

Because if you actually had no fear of death, you'd have no fear of life either.

I've been there, but after overcoming suicidal thoughts and accepting my death - also the thought that i can kill myself tomorrow if anything goes wrong. I feel relief and peace of mind.
I am not scared to live, since I can end it tomorrow if I think - at the end of the day my current situation cannot be solved and it's worse than non-existence.

So before you buy razors or rope, just think - why can't I kill myself tomorrow? Let's just wait today until end of the day and I can go and do it tomorrow. (Next time do the same thing.)
