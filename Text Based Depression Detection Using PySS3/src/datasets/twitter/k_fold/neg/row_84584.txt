Being sick makes me suicidal again.Earlier this year I discovered smoking pot makes me not suicidal. I tried therapy and medication for years but all it ever did was make me even more anxious and depressed. Pot is so much cheaper and helps get me through the day. I don't even smoke daily, I'd say maybe 5 times in a 2 week period. It helps keep me happier, lets me function at work better, and it's pretty awesome cleaning the house and cooking healthy food while stoned.

Except I've had a bad cold/sinus issue for a month now. I don't have health insurance or money for a doctor. Even if I did, doctors give me such bad anxiety I become suicidal just thinking about having to go to one. (Same reason I avoid therapists, my phobia is pretty bad.) I haven't been able to smoke while I've been sick, it really bothers my sinuses. That, plus the doctor anxiety, means I'm ready to go through all of my craft supplies to find something to hang myself with.

I just want to not be sick anymore. I can't afford this. I already have issues due to all the abuse I went through as a kid, and how my finances are in the toilet. If I can't forget my problems for awhile, then I want out of this life. This world we live in is quickly going to collapse, anyway. With the economy, environment, and so on.
