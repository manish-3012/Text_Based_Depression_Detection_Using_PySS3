I don't want to be hereSometimes I feel that I'm just waiting for it to happen. Maybe it is today. Maybe it's not.

I never know. I think that when it happen, then it did. Maybe it depends on how numb or horrible about myself I'm feeling.

I wish I just didn't have to be here.

I wish I was never here, I wish I would never be remembered by anyone, because I don't deserve, because anyone should think about me. But at the same time, I wish I was important or helpful to someone at some moment. 

But between being remembered and just being forgotten, I'd rather be forgotten and I hope that's what happens when I finally leave.

I just can't be here anymore. I already don't feel like I am. I just need to let go.

I wish I could tell the people that I loved that I loved them, I wish I could tell them how important and special they are.

I wish I could tell my friend that even if I break our promise, that she helped me staying here for some more time.

But maybe I'm not leaving tonight, and it's friday night. I don't want to risk them reading anything and worrying. I just want they can enjoy their nights.

I just shouldn't be here. I shouldn't be in 2020. I shouldn't be inside this shell anymore.

I'm sorry if you read this. I just needed to talk.

It's selfish, but I'm allowing myself to do this today, because I don't know how long I'll be here to do this anymore.
