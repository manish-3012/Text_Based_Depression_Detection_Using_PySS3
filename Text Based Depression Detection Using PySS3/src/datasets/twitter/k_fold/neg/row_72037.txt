Stockpiling opioids and potassium for the past yearSo I have chronic pain and because of it, I am given opioids. I used to take them, about one a week (I was always afraid of getting addicted) and I was also given prescription strength potassium for my low potassium levels. Both are deadly if you have enough, and I now have enough. Everything is falling apart and I just donâ€™t want to live anymore. Iâ€™m scared that if I live too long and eventually get the strength to die, then Iâ€™ll have kids of my own who will be disappointed in me. If I die before I have kids, all is okay. 
I have a plan to do it now but I canâ€™t bring myself. I wish I was stronger. I wish I wasnâ€™t sad.  Sorry for the rant type post, I took two opioids so Iâ€™m a bit high
