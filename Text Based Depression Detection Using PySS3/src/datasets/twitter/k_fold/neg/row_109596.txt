Ups and downs and ups... And downs againI've been recently diagnosed with depression, while doing my thesis, during a global pandemic.
I know that maybe I'm victimizing myself, but I'm really struggling to deal with everything.
I've spoken to my thesis tutor and she was very comprehensive regarding the diagnostic and said that it was OK to move slowly now, with the work I've been developing.
Now, I'm just trying to be active. I'm taking some medication, prescribed by the doctor. But despite feeling "Ok" in some days and trying to hold every single piece of shit together, it sometimes crumbles down and intrusive, depressive thoughts come, once again.
2 weeks ago I was at my low I think. I though about ending it all, disappearing from the face of the world. It got me wondering if I never existed in the first place and how good that would be. The peace that it would bring. I just wanted to die.
I confessed some of this to my boyfriend and I really thought he understood me. But sometimes, I also thinks he judges everything that I do (and mainly don't do) or that I poorly execute. My self esteem is at the lowest point in my life so far (I'm 22 years old) and I'm just tired of feeling better, believing that it gonna be OK from now on, just to understand that, in the next day I had another breakdown that does not let me get out of bed. I also think that he looks at me like I'm a burden and I really do not want to be that. Besides, I think he finally understood that I'm a failure, unable to finish my master degree. 

Somedays I wish I was never brought into this world. Today is one of those days.

Will it ever get better?

I'm so afraid of the future and its downs...
