I want to kill myself but I'm too much of a cowardTitle says it all. I'm depressed, tired, full of anxiety, have no job, no gf. What's even the point of living in this terrible place? I'm 50/50 on this right now I just can't see myself actually killing myself but I might just do it... I've been getting help but nothing is getting better and I don't expect it to. These may be my last days on earth. I wish I could die right now without killing myself because that's a bad way to go out in my opinion..
