What if my problem is permanent?The stupid catch phrase a 'permanent solution to a temporary problem' doesn't take into account those with permanent problems. 

I have chronic pain from multiple health issues. My most recent health crisis removed any opportunity I have of having children. My whole future that I had planned included having a family. I didn't have a plan B. I didn't want a plan B. How could my boyfriend want a woman that can't produce a child? How can he not want to run off with a younger version and procreate? I don't even feel like a woman anymore. I am useless. I feel such profound despair and anguish. 

So now I face a life of severe chronic pain as well as having all hope removed from the future. I could have gone on if I had something to live for. I don't see how this is temporary. I don't imagine myself ever 'getting over' this. The physical pain and the emotional pain are my constant companions in life now. Not a minute goes by that something is not hurting, either emotionally or physically. It's unbearable. 

People say its selfish to take your own lifeâ€¦but I think it's selfish to expect someone to live an unbearable life just to please everyone. In five years ill just be a bad memory. In ten years, they won't even remember my voice anymore. I really don't think one person is important enough to save.
