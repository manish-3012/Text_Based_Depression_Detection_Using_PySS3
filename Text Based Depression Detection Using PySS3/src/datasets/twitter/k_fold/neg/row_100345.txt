Today is the day. I think it's time to say goodbye.First, I'm not looking for attention. I'm not crying out for help. I've been wanting to do this every day for weeks. I've done my research and I have a plan. It's CO poisoning. Easy. 

My wife of 8 years, my best friend in the world, left me a few months ago. She left me because I took her for granted and I'm a piece of shit. I miss her so much but she has gotten past me. She doesn't even want to talk to me. I reached out to her a few weeks ago just to talk. Talk about being depressed, etc. She said she can't help me with my needs. I will not be able to live with her being with someone else. I recently lost my job, I'm about to  be homeless and I'm almost penniless. I have nothing. I am devoid of hope. My exit plant has been set up for a couple of weeks and today is the day. 

Some of you guys who are trying to help on here were sent by angels. I wish my heart was as pure and caring as yours.
