I have suicidal thoughts and they are getting worse by the minute  Ok so i don't think my post belongs here or anywhere else for that matter, but i just need to get this off of my chest somewhere.

  So little backstory. I've been suffering with depression for 5 years and self-harm for a year. This year i decided to get some help and go to a psychiatrist in order to get everything back to what I assume is normal. Everything went alright for a couple of months, but due to the COVID problem I ran out of meds while self-isolating and i was left with my dark thoughts without a way out of this nightmare. 

  The world seems to crumble around me. I hate my life at this point and I want to end it all. My best friend who helped me reach out doesn't know all of my problems and thoughts, I am afraid of pushing her away, I feel like I am not her problem since she has anxiaty and depression herself and she needs to have positive things around her to get better and I try to give her all the support I can give while dealing with my problems.

  I am here to write my last fantasy, the last thing ever iwanna do before hanging myself and ending all of my problems forever. I want someone to read it and if someone is in my situation and really decided to end it all and can't have his mindset changed, maybe try it and see if the life is worth living or not. 

  So i wanna call all my closest friends, all the people that were around me, the people who helped and supported me and hang out, turn off my phone and just go for a night in the town, drinking having fun, laughing with them. I wanna be the happiest person they ever seen, I wanna sit with them at a pub look at them and then think to myself "The people that surround me are so beautiful".  After the night is over and I had the best night of my life, give them all a tight long hug and before we go apart tell them "Take care of yourselves, will ya'?". After that, I'll go into my garage and  hang myself thinking about them and how I had the best time of my life around them.

  I don't want them to remember me as the sad piece of shit, the good for nothing man that I am, I want to be in their memory as the happiest, most positive and supportive person in their lives which never thought twice before helping them.

  Many times i've heard that the happiest people in your life are secretly depressive or suicidal, always thought it's bullshit, but now that i am in that situation i understand why, nobody and i mean NOBODY wants to be remembered in someone's as the saddest person in the world and i don't want that either.

  None of my friends know about my reddit account, I keep it private. But if one of them stumbles upon it in the future and see this post I WANT YOU TO KNOW I LOVED YOU SO MUCH THERE ARE NO WORDS THAT CAN DESCRIBE MY FEELINGS FOR ANY OF YOU AND I DIDN'T DO WHAT I DO BECAUSE OF YOU AND I DEEPLY REGRET THE FACT THAT WE COULDN'T SPEND MORE DAYS TOGHETHER. I AM SO SO SO FUCKING SORRY, hope y'all can forgive me someday.
