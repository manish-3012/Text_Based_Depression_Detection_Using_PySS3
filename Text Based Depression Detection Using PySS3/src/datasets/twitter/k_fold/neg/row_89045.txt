I want to die right nowI donâ€™t want to come across like a whiny little bitch but I need to vent to someone or Iâ€™m literally going to try to kill myself, and this is the only outlet I could think of. My dog died yesterday, so thatâ€™s one less purpose I have for living. I also canâ€™t stop thinking about the fact that I am most likely going to die alone and never find a partner as long as I live. My meds arenâ€™t doing jack anymore and at this point I donâ€™t know if they have ever worked at all. I have no reason to be alive right now, all Iâ€™m doing is annoying people and I have no desire to live or anything to motivate me. I just canâ€™t kill myself because Iâ€™m too scared of the pain or of failing and getting injured or something. But I donâ€™t see things ever getting better and most likely they wonâ€™t. Iâ€™m not saying I have it worse off than other people or throwing a pity party, I know well that a lot of people are suffering more than I am and I wish they could find peace for themselves. I donâ€™t care about myself or my life anymore though. I never have much and whatever percent of caring I had is now at zero.
