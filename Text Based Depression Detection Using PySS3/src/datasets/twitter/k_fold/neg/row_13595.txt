i just fucking hate my lifeI'm sitting here drunk, on a bottle of UV blue, just hating myself and having nowhere to express it. This will probably be a mess so you've been warned.

 I fucking hate that I overthink everything. I hate how I feel fucking awkward around nearly 99 percent of the people i know and I have to deal with that. I hate how I think everyone hates me, how I think I have to do everything fucking perfect or I will just dwell and dwell and dwell. 

I fucking hate that my innattentive add makes me a complete fucking moron, with slow response times and extreme aloofness. I hate that when I first became depressed and started antidepressants I've been living in an anhedonic, pleasureless hell - for the past ten years.

 I hate that I'm basically addicted to my medication adderall, because I feel so fucking flat. I hate the fact that I'm completely unable to get close to anyone because I'm terrified of revealing any of my inner thought- 3 years of therapy has been ineffective because I am so guarded. I'm also addicted to alcohol, and I hate that I'm going to wake up regretting this post tomorrow. I seriously hate my fucking life, and I want to die.
