Literally no point anymoreearlier post here: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/t949g/fuck_it/
Excuse me for my lack of formatting, I literally have no idea how to make paragraphs on reddit and am too stupid to actually find out, lol.
So, my sophomore year of college is gonna start in 30 days, but i literally don't want to go on. I honestly don't see the point. It's basically going to be a rehash of last year, only with even less friends. I can't even drink or smoke anymore because of some goddamn depression medication that doesn't seem to be working anymore.I pretty much fuck up at everything and get rejected from everything except a few plays here and there. No one would miss me, and don't give me that goddamn circlejerk of "lol its gonna be ok." It won't be.
And, for the record? I did give a mental ward a try, and I have been doing medication for like 6 weeks.
