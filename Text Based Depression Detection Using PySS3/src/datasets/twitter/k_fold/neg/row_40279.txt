Well I never thought I'd post here.I'm young (18) I have a job in the sector I like (IT) my family gets by ok. So why am I here you may ask? Well it's because I'm a fucking ghost. I'm only here when you want to realise I'm here or if I annoy you enough (which I feel terrible about). Otherwise I don't exist. When other people have problems I do my best to help them. When I have problems I still have to help them because I caused them a problem telling them of my problem.

 I recently came out as gay to my GP. He's the only one I can tell that I know won't cause problems. My family? Mixed bag. Most likely indifference or maybe even acceptance for some. For others I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to bribe or pressure me to 'see the light' I'm also very attracted to one of my friends. this is terrifying for a number of reasons. It has been tormenting me for weeks. I plan to tell him this weekend. That could end in so many bad ways. 

Now do I believe I will commit suicide? No. So why am I posting here? Because that's what everyone says before they do. Sorry for the long rant. Anyone up to chat?
