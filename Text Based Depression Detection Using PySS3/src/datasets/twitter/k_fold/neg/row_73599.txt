I have an amazing life literally amazing why am I so sad and just want it all to endI have 10 children an amazing boyfriend I have a great job a wonderful home Iâ€™m not rich but we are very comfortable but I cannot ever get over my overwhelming sadness and wanting it all to end. I imagine it daily. Driving off the bridge in my car, overdosing on pills, shutting the car in the garage and taking a nap. I image the letters I will leave and how everything will be better when I donâ€™t have to do this anymore. Why is the actual living so so hard.
