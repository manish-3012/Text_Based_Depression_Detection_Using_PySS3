What do you see in us? What exactly is worth saving here?Have you ever considered that we're just not worth saving? That we're simply deplorable in the grand scheme of things? 

That we've made is a/n (at least somewhat) logical conclusion that we'd be worth more dead than alive?

I've never felt more worthless in my life, and I'm just dragging people down with me, family and all in consideration of debt and retirement. Maybe my family/friends just doesn't/don't know better than to let me go for themselves. One life is not worth 3,5 or 10 others; not even for the 2 that are your parents.

I don't want to die. I just feel the obligation, the need to. I know I can do these jobs that I've interviewed for and so have the interviewees; no one just wants to take that chance, and I understand it completely. I'm smart, as some interviewees have told me in regards of me graduating in the top 10-5% of my class, I just don't have the heart to apply and put myself out there anymore.

I'm broken and that in and of itself tells me I'm worthless and you should think so too.
