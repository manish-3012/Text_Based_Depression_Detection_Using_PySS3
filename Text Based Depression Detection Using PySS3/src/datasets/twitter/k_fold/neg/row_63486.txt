I don't feel safe with myself anymore.I've been in foster care for all of my teenage years. I have no family to fall back on. I live with horrible paranoia that consumes my entire life and i dont know how to get better. I have no resources. I'm too paranoid to talk to my friends about these feelings. I'm constantly suicidal but too scared to tell anyone because of how much that would effect the paranoia, being away from society in an inpatient mental health facility.

I don't want to take my life. I want to live my life. I'm only 18 but i don't know how much more i can handle before i end it.
