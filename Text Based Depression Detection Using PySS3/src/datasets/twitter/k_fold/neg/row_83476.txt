Im really on the edge.I posted previously about telling my wife that I went and got a lap dance while on a business trip. I've gone to get an STD test despite making no physical contact with my genitals and the stripper giving the lap dance but at this point my balls have been aching for a few days and I suspect something is up or I've injured them in some way. 

Regardless, I'm going to tell my wife what happened and I don't think I can live with the guilt, and I don't want to continue my life if she leaves. I've already set up a 12 gauge hollow point slug next to my shotgun so I don't have to search for anything when I'm ready. 

I cannot explain enough my regret for what I did, I love my wife so much and I wanted to raise kids with her and get more dogs and make her life perfect and grow old with her. But, I've fucked that up royally now and I don't think there is a going back.

I'm scared to do this and I promise I would not harm her in any way, I only want to remove the worst part of her life and that is me. 

I still at this point don't want to die but once the news is broken to her I don't know if I can hold on.
