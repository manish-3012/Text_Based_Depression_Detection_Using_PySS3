Its backHaving a hard time right now. my depression is back.  I didn't believe it would come back but it did. I woke up the other day with the thought waiting for me that today could be that my last day on Earth if I wanted it to be. Came up with a plan. since then I've been crashing. I just wanted to reach out and try to kick this thing in the teeth.
