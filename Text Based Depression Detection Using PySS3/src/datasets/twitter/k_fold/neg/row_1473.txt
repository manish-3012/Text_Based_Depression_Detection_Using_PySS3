I want it endFate was supposed to take me when I was a baby. I had my cord wrapped around and my neck. My mom did a fuck ton of fertility treatments just to have me. I feel like the universe has been trying to slowly correcting itself for letting me live. And i want it to win, but why like this. Why do I have to suffer with my own thoughts day in and day out. Iâ€™ve already tried to lock myself in my bathroom with an open jug of bleach hoping the fumes would kill me, but it got cut short by my mom throwing the door asking me why the hell I wasnâ€™t ready to go out. I just want it to end, why wonâ€™t it end. I wish I could get help but last time I tried she pulled me out of it saying therapy was a lie cause the therapist doesnâ€™t care about me. Please, can something just take me away already...
