- holding up the universei literally feel as if the entire world is on my shoulders when in actuality, my problems are probably minuscule. i lost the only person who was there for me through it all. even if â€œit allâ€ was only at the very end. they didnâ€™t leave me, i pushed them away. i didnâ€™t want to end up hurting them more than i ended up doing. i knew i still had love in my heart for someone i shouldnâ€™t. i still do. i canâ€™t just leave everything i had behind no matter how bad they hurt me. they were and are my best friend. i check for signs of the â€œpushed awayâ€ person every day. whether it be on twitter or spotify or anything. i sound insane, i know, but i just need to know they are out there somewhere. doing normal every day things. itâ€™s like a hug. i have never had a hug as warm as his was when we said goodbye. everywhere i go has signs of him. our songs play when i go out with the person who hurt me (letâ€™s call him robbie) our songs play in my car. they play in the restaurants we eat at. the memories kill me when we go to book stores and see dumb toys that we played with one too many times. it hurts. but loving him (pushed away boy - letâ€™s call him gus) would hurt him more than leaving him. i ruined his life. he lost his friends. i donâ€™t have any real friends anymore. i have one, but they really arenâ€™t a real friend. all i have is robbie. and robbie and gus are both leaving soon for the military. 
    then my family crashed. the most important people in my life have had strokes and things and are literally on their death bed. it really sucks. really really sucks. thatâ€™s the icing on the cake. all iâ€™m saying is, everyday i think of
ways i might die. itâ€™s quite depressing honestly and all i want is a warm hug. i want everything okay. but nothing is. none of this makes sense. i donâ€™t know how to make it make sense. iâ€™m just done with everything. iâ€™m not going to kill myself. but damn i want to.
