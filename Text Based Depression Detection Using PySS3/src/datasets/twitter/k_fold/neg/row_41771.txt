I wish I wasn't bornI have never been happy. I have been cursed in this miserable life. I had such a shitty and traumatic upbringing. I just want to be happy and to be genuinely loved. No medications seem to work. Everyone I care about I seem to smother and they leave. I had to move from where I was staying back into a toxic environment I don't even feel alive anymore. 
I have no friends they've all moved away. My ex boyfriend was all I had and he treated me like dirt and I let him because I did not want to be alone. I wish I was never born. It's too painful to exist and i feel trapped in this body I don't think there's anything good in this world meant for me. I ruin everything. I wish I would just die. I wish my suffering would end. 

I just want my dog to know that I love him more than anything in life and he's saved me so many times but I don't know if it's enough now. I just want to melt into nothing and no longer feel any physical/emotional pain anymore.
