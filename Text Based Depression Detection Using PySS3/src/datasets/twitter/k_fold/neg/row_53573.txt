I've just gone through a really rough breakup, and the suicidal thoughts are starting to creep in.My boyfriend of 1.5 years broke up with me rather suddenly two weeks ago. I didn't see it coming and now I can't find the motivation to do anything. I've been thinking a lot about ending things. The thoughts in my head about the breakup and relationship are endless, and I just want them to stop. I know I have things to live for other than the relationship, but it's really hard to focus elsewhere when this was so sudden.
