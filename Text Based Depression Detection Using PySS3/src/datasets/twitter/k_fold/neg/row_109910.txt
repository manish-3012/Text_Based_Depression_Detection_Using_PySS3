I find no enjoyment in lifeI find no enjoyment in life. There is only pain, confusion, heartbreak, stress, and fear. I have no friends. The few that I did have were recently taken from my life. My family treats me like scum. I am stuck living with my parents. I am trapped at home. I live everyday of my life waiting to die. I don't even know why I continue anymore. I wish I could be happy. Just once I wish things would go my way. I wish I could be like everyone else. I wish I could be like everyone else. I try and I try, but nothing seems to go well for me. What's wrong with me. I just want to be happy. I just want a break from all of this. I want to find friends and love, but the world always kicks me down whenever it gets the chance. I want to be normal.
