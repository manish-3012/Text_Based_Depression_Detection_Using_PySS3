It's my birthday today, and I wanted to let you know that it's possible to get better.Exactly a year ago on my last birthday, I posted that I was going to kill myself, I never imagined being alive until my last birthday, but I made it, and I pushed through. It is possible to get through the darkness, it looks infeasible and difficult, but it is possible. 

No, I don't want you to pity me for being happy, as I used to towards happy people, but I want you to at least look in my perspective, I believe in you, and if you can't take it, give up for as long as you need and try again when you're ready.
