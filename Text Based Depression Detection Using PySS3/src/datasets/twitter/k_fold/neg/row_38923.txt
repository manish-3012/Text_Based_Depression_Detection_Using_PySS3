My girlfriend will commit suicide if I don't go to the same college as her.I'm 17; she's 19.  We both want to attend Oberlin, and she committed there already.  But I have more issues in going, namely cost and my parents. Especially mom who wants me to go to UGA.  She is worried that I will kill myself at Oberlin, which is less likely than if I went to UGA, but my habits aren't great.  I can't just tell mom that my SO will kill herself, because then the relationship looks really unhealthy.  What can I do to tell her that life is worth living if I can't be with her for one more year (transfer is a possibility)?
