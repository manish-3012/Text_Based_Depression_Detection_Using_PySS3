I have nothing.There is so much pressure on me. I'm failing my classes and a close friend of mine is purposely ignoring me. I'm 21 years old and I feel like I've accomplished nothing. I have no purpose, no reason to live. I've lost my will to live. I feel like my life has no meaning. I want to die so badly, but I'm so afraid of what comes after.
