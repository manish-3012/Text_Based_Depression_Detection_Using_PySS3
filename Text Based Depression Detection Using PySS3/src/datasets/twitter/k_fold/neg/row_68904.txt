Want to share, and looks like there are some here who listen :)Hi I'm a 20 year old man, or boy. I'm currently in the lovely city of Trondheim, having a great time while visiting a friend. And soon I want to die.
I have thought about killing myself for some time, a few years. Waited to see if my mentality change through different periods in life. I realize it's not logical to stop at 20. It's just that I'm oh so very tired of feeling this way. 
I'm very scared of the act, never tried before. Very scared to fail.
The date I set a month before was the second of August, and I'm looking forward to it.

I have lived what I think should have been a happy life. Not that it was in any way sad either. But I guess that is the way of life :) ty for reading about me.
Also random name, don't kill me. I think I got that covered
