Is this wrong or bad?I've started cutting myself recently because the people at the day hospital I go to don't seem to be helping as I need. The psychologist there refuses to put me on her waiting list because she thinks she can't help me since I have problems communicating my thoughts and feelings so it would be a waste of time. (aspergers)

I've been considering making a suicide attempt because at this point I'm getting pretty desperate and I **cannot** afford a private psychologist.
