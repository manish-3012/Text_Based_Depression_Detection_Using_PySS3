My life is amazing so why do I still feel this way?Hello Reddit

&amp;#x200B;

As the title says, my life is pretty amazing objectively. Social life, professional life, financially, ... Everything is what it should be for a guy that's nearly 30.

Yet I still feel every day like I don't want to live. I understand people who deal with difficult times wanting to end it, but why is this happening to me? I thought that if I "checked all the boxes", it would be alright. It's not even like I dislike this life. I wouldn't want a different job or different friends. I've just never really had a will to live. In every stage of life I just thought "it will get better". But now that I'm graduated, found a job, live by myself etc., I don't have that hope anymore.

I'm seeing a therapist and she told me that it isn't that abnormal and that I should just "try to find joys in life". 

But I just have no idea what to do. My life is perfect, so I guess it's all in my head. 

These feelings have been with me my entire life, but the last few months it's been going worse and worse to the point where I'm seriously contemplating ending my life. I could ramble on and turn this into a book but I don't think that would help.

What do I do?
