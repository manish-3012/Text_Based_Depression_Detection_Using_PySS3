I've considered it a few years ( im new to reddit)I Feel that im a bad person, but Its because I haven't been able to forgive myself for things I Did as a young child, most people in my school don't see me as someone they would hangout with, I Feel incredibly lonely. I'm diagnosed bipolar I am also high functioning autistic. I feel like a loser. I'm also transgender mtf, my father has most of the custody but my mom has some, he said if he finds out I am wearing female clothing he will stop giving my mother money. I tried attempted to take more than my dose requires of medication. but just couldn't do it. what is there to life? its just so meaningless. besides breathing air. animals breath air, why is my life more important than a snails? some animal is going to eat the snail, and procreate. what do I Contribute to the planet. my genes are fucked up, no point in storing sperm in a bank. I'm probably never going to be in a long term relationship, im passing highschool with c's. I'm a detriment to society. society would benefit from my death, another more prepared person could take my spot in a college class. why is suicide selfish If my death would benefit society?
