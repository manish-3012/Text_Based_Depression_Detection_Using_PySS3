Just Can't Get A Break2018 has been the toughest year for me. Thinking that maybe just ending it would be better (and less expensive).

In January and February, I did not have a job and had excruciating tooth pain. Had to get the tooth removed to save money.

Started new job, feel completely lost at work still.

Found out I owe money to the IRS for a mistake on a previous year's tax return. Really hoping it won't impact my federal aid for school.

Had to have a root canal done in August. Probably need more work done on my teeth.

I'm just tired. Tired of 2018.
