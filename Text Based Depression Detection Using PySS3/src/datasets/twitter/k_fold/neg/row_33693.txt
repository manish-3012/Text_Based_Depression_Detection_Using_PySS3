I canâ€™t find a reason to go onIâ€™m 22 years old and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve been happy since I was 8. Everyone tells me it gets better but I donâ€™t know when because it only seems to get worse. I donâ€™t have a single friend anymore, f-ed that up with my 3 friends I had. My family is disappointed in me and dislikes me. Iâ€™ve never been in a relationship, barely kissed someone when I was 14, not even sure if it counts since it wasnâ€™t even a real kiss. I finally got a job but itâ€™s just a retail job even though I have a bachelors degree. Thought I would make friends at that job and accidentally came across my coworkers gossiping about how weird I was. Iâ€™m also really bad at my job even though I try really hard. Iâ€™ve been really bad at every job Iâ€™ve ever had. Canâ€™t get a job in my career field. Iâ€™m fat and ugly. Iâ€™m not very smart either and Iâ€™m bad with people. Every day is so miserable I just donâ€™t see the point anymore. No one cares about me and I donâ€™t really blame them Iâ€™m insufferable and weird so I wouldnâ€™t be hurting anyone. No one depends on me so I wouldnâ€™t be letting anyone or anything down. Iâ€™m not a good person and I donâ€™t bring value to the world so I wouldnâ€™t be making the world worse, in fact in removing my carbon footprint Iâ€™d been helping the world and I would be less of a strain on the worldâ€™s resources. Iâ€™m not happy and havenâ€™t been in a very long time so I canâ€™t live for hedonistic reasons. Iâ€™m not religious so I donâ€™t believe in hell or a greater plan so thatâ€™s not a reason to live. I canâ€™t find a reason to go on and I donâ€™t know if there one. I guess Iâ€™m just trying to either find a reason to live or work up the nerve to actually go through with killing myself because Iâ€™m such a coward I still canâ€™t bring myself to quite do it.
