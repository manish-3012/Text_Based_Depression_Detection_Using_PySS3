ByeAfter months of going to my doctor, taking several different antidepressants, counselling, seeing a psychiatrist, and just waiting for something to happen, I know that for me there is no getting out of this

I've been thinking about this for a while. I'm ready now. The idea of dying isn't scary to me anymore

I have a lot of left over antidepressant pills because I stopped taking them. I've got lots of different kinds. So I think I'm going to take a lot of different ones and hopefully that will kill me

It's night time where I am now. I hope I don't live to see the sun come up. Bye
