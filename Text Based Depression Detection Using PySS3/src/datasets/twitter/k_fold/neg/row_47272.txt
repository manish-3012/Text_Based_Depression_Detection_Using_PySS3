I donâ€™t deserve thisWill probably delete, just need to get it off my chest. 

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve ever done to deserve everything I go through. Every day I think about ending it all just to stop this pain, itâ€™s unbearable. If it wasnâ€™t for my father I think I would have given up by now.
