Tired of being lonelyIs it unfair that the only reason I can find to not end my life is to consider how it would affect the people around me and not myself? I feel so lonely, so depressed I can barely force myself to write this but I need to organize and express my thoughts. I replay the thought of grabbing my gun and ending it over and over in the back of my mind and it brings me peace. How can I justify to not if that brings me peace? I know that may not make sense but it is the certainty of not suffering when not is only attempting to seak happiness and live in lonely misery, there is no glory in failure.
