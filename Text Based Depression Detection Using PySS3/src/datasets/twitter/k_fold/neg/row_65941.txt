Whatâ€™s the point if I donâ€™t enjoy lifeThereâ€™s nothing I want to do with my life. Everything feels like a chore and it never gets any easier to deal with. When I look at my life and where Iâ€™m headed( decades of wage slaving and depression) it makes me so fucking depressed. I want nothing out of my life. I try to think of something worthwhile that I want to accomplish and nothing comes to mind. Life is a fucked up struggle.
