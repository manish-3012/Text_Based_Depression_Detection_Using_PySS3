I'm Not Getting BetterI've decided that it's just not going to get better. Try as I might, I can't get past what I've been through. It's tearing me apart every single day. I don't want to feel this way anymore. I can't. If I had an easy method of doing it, I'd be gone already. Won't be too long before I find one though.
