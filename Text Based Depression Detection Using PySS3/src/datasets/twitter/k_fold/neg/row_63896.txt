My anxiety is only increasing, Im pretty much dead on the insideAs the yrs go by, my fear has grown into a huge issue. I am so scared of opinions that they drag me on a leash, dress me up, and tell me what to say. The pain honestly makes me want to throw up, but my belly is feeling perfectly fine. My mind being dragged by the 1000 pound stone called my thoughts.

I can't breathe, saliva buulds up, can barely speak up. But nobody knows. Having anxiety means that telling ppl will give you more Anxiety. I feel I am just one more unhappy day from death. I have felt like this since 2016, and have submerged myself into the deepest, darkest place of pain. No hope, not even sucsess can take away the pain.

I will wake up tomorrow, and dread the fire in my classmates eyes. To them however, Im prolly a chimd minding my own business. But I am really screaming, with the only pain reliever I use to cope with my binding fear being the "It Gets Better" quote. Which I don't believe anymore.

I can't speak about it. My family may either watch me like I am a ticking time bomb or make jokes about it. My friends may not understand.  They think I'm funny, but I'm rly just a walking corpse, waiting for my lungs to catch up with my heart.ðŸ–¤

I honestly romanticize suicide. It takes away ppl's pain. People look down on you when they see you, but trust me, they'll love you and miss you when they are burying you. Funerals are now what I want to obtain the most atm. Poor family, they're religious selves think suicide equals hellfire. But I feel like I'm in hell, and one more day is a step further in the Lake of Fire. :(
