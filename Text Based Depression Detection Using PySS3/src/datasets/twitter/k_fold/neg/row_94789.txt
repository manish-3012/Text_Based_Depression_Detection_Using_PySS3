I tell my family I want to kill myself, anyone else?I have told my family members and coworkers on several occasions that I want to kill myself. Perhaps it's a cry for help, perhaps an expression of warning for what may come. I feel like by telling them maybe it will mentally prepare them for it happening, so some how, some way, it won't ruin their lives to not have me in it. Does anyone else have this talk with their families, what do they say?
