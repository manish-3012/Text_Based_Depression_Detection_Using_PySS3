I did it.I'm going to sleep. I just wanted to let my kids know that I'm sorry and I love them. Doesn't matter since they hate me. As for my husband, now you can pursue your dreams without me being a burden. You can now have the woman of your dreams.  I'm sorry for fucking up every life I've come into contact with. I'm sorry to my family, but one less fuck up is better for everyone involved. I'm tired. I'm sick. I'm fucked in the head. And lastly, DR, I'm just not strong enough anymore. Thank you for all your help and love.
