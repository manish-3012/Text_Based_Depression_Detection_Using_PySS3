Social skillsI've been struggling with depression and anxiety on and off for quite some time, with my first bout starting around 3rd grade and I am now 17. 
I moved in with my grandparents last year and I guess finally having a stable home with parental like figures has made a world of difference for me! I'm even going off my Prozac soon! 

The one thing that keeps getting to me, is my loneliness in school. I am generally happy now, I have relatively small anxiety, but I can't figure out how to create fulfilling friendships with people at school! 
I feel like in my depressed stupor and with my family being too dysfunctional to have friends over all of all those years, I somehow "missed" how I'm suppose to maintain and keep friendly relationships! 
Now don't get me wrong, I have a bestfriend (she lives back in my hometown) and I have a boyfriend here but I feel like I cling on to these people way too much because they are my only "real friends".
While  at the same time I barely maintain ANY relationships at school or have a single friend group. I'm essentially a loner, because I suck at carrying relationships! 
I don't know what is 'cool' right now to talk to people about, and I hardly know anybody to even friendly gossip about!

I'm starting new classes and I met new people and I've been pushing my self to talk to people but it is so exhausting! I keep trying though because I don't want to fall into my old pattern of "the less I talk to people the less I want to talk at all"

I'm nearing the end of my senior year and I need to figure out how to do this because I feel like this is one of the final things that are stunting my self growth and me getting out of depression once and for all! 
Does anybody else feel this way? Any tips? Ideas? 
Feeling lonely when surrounded by people hurts way more than being alone.
