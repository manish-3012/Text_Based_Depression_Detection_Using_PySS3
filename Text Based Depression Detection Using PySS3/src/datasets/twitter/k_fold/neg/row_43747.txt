Just Angry &amp; Suicidal#Crippling Chronic Pain

I have a pancreatic disorder. It is fucking painful. Hurts me to move some days. Yet, I can't get anyone to take the pain seriously. This is the 3rd month in a row that I'm going to be out of my medication early and it's causing me a great deal of stress. Tomorrow I plan to go to the hospital and tell them to get me off of it because I'm completely suicidal and cannot fight the war on drugs/opiates. I just really fear for when I'm going to actually need the medication. I was sober from November - February and it was like I was torturing myself because of the amount of pain I was/am in so my doctor put me back on the narcotics.

Reason #1 I want to die. Chronic Crippling Pain

#I'm a Fat Whale

I was never fat as a kid and then I got sick and packed on the pounds. I don't know what to even do about this anymore. I can barely get out of bed in the morning and shower without feeling like I need to take a nap. I weigh 200lbs and am 5'2" It's disgusting and I'm too fat. I fit none of my clothes and look like a slob most days.

Reason #2 I want to die. I hate my Looks/Body

#I Just want a Job but Can't.

Whoever said can't isn't a word is a dumbass. I've been applying to jobs for over a month with no success. I'm about ready to stab myself in the eyeballs about it. I just got an offer for a work at home position that paid just enough it would solve all my financial problems. Except I got the deadline mixed up by 3 hours PST vs. EST and they fired me on the spot. Yay, go me! I also got another job that I was with for 1 week and they lost 2 of their biggest clients by no fault of my own and fired me over it. It is infuriating.

Reason #3 I want to die. I'm Unemployable

There's more reasons but right now those are the top 3. I'm just so ANGRY. Angry, angry and more angry.
