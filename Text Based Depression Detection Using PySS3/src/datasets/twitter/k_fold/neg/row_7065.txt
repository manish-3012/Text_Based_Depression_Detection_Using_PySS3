Iâ€™m extremely conflictedI am suicidal, and though have never attempted it i still have dreams where i nearly die by my own hands. I am suicidal for a multitude of reasons, I want to grow up and live a happy life as a nurse helping people, but because of Covid-19 i am unable to catch up with my schoolwork to be able to do well. I find finding motivation to do it hard and i seem to have extreme mood-swings that either make me too carefree to do the work or too stressed to do any work.

I also believe i have gender dysphoria and im 99% sure i have it, but because of covid-19 i am unable to get the help i want. I also hate my body, i hate my broad shoulders, and my awkwardly long arms and legs in comparison to my torso, im extremely skinny and i donâ€™t feel pretty. I want to look like an elegant woman, but instead i look like The Rake or slender man.

i have a bit of a strange relationship with my parents, they claim they love me but i feel like they resent me, i feel an extreme disconnect with them as if they arenâ€™t my parents and they donâ€™t support me.

the only reason i probably havenâ€™t tried to kill myself is because i donâ€™t want my sister or friends to be sad since i love them all dearly and i donâ€™t want them to suffer like i have.
