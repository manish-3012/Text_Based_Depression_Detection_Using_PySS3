Hospitalization? Any advice? Experience?My therapist told me she's very worried by how distressed and isolated I've become recently and wants me to consider hospitalization.

Has anyone been hospitalized for depression or suicidal thoughts before? I don't really want to do it but I'm also worried about the state I've been in lately. 

I'm in the US if that matters. Any advice or descriptions of your experiences would be helpful.
