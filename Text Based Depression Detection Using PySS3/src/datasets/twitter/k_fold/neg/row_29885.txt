Iâ€™m okay with the fact depression will kill meIâ€™ve gotten comfortable with the idea of suicide. It will end my suffering once and for all. My parents just called and I suppose to start medicine tomorrow I actually hope it increases my suicidal thoughts that way I can finally have that last push. Theyâ€™re starting me out on a â€œsmallâ€ dose even though the doc said it sounds pretty severe it took him 4 hours to call back and my mom had to call back 3 times. I am 17, feel like I am going absolutely no where in my life. I am beyond depressed and I feel so hopeless I just don't know the point of living anymore. It's funny because not even two-three weeks ago I felt amazing and happy and this whole entire week I have just wanted to die. Let me start from the root of this cause. I currently live at home with my two unsupportive parents who do not help me with anything but complain about my life and how basically I am not doing anything and am a major disappointment(Like I already don't know that.) My dad yelled at me and said I was a loser and I had no friends. I told him I already knew that I sit and think of that 24/7 about how I have no one how much of a loser I am how no one even cares. My mom told me I was a burden on her all the time. I cant bear this anymore. Thats it. Im over feeling like such a worthless piece of shit and feeling like I can't do anything correctly. Ive tried letting my parents in theyâ€™re not supportive nothing helps. I don't enjoy things that I used to and I have absolutely zero motivation to do anything. Iâ€™ve never had a boyfriend meanwhile everyone around me has. I feel so left out in life. My mom was complaining about how sheâ€™d let me have money and Iâ€™d spend it on makeup because I wanted to become a cosmetologist, makeup was a hobby for me but now it has no meaning to me even though she doesnâ€™t work itâ€™s not her money she gets money from her mother. my dad is a piece of shit who doesnâ€™t give anything, he has so many dogs he uses for hunting he buys 4/5 packs of dog feed each week but doesnâ€™t give me or my mother anything, no money.  He said he doesnâ€™t care about me and he didnâ€™t plan on caring anytime soon. I just want to disappear and stop causing trouble for everyone around me. Just want to remove the burden. I've gotten to a point now where no one can even stop me and if I could say sorry I would. I look at myself and I just see someone I don't know anymore. Someone who doesn't have anything going for them, someone who is tired of being tired and just completely lost in life. I see someone who doesn't enjoy doing anything they enjoyed to do before except lie in bed all day doing nothing. I look at myself but the person looking back isn't me. And then I cry because nothing makes sense anymore. Soon, I am going to hang myself from the metal rod in the shower and for once I might feel some relief. I feel like I don't have any support or any help and I feel like I am in the ocean drowning with people just staring at me offering no help. I heard both of my parents talking shit about me last night calling me names and I was crying so hard my mom told me she didnâ€™t give a fuck. Iâ€™m never angry itâ€™s all overcome by sadness but now Iâ€™m angry at this world. Everything is so fucked up, suffering every day for no reason. 
I had a suicide note from 3 months ago but I eventually ripped it and thrown it away because I was afraid my mom would find it she found out about my self harm and blames everything on my phone. I am writing another note tonight, I will end this once and for all. Do you believe my suicide method will work? Hanging from the metal rod?
