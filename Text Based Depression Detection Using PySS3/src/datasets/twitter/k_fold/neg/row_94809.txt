I dont want to be humansimetimes I just wonder, why me? why was I born as human. I just dont feel like I belong here. I see birds flying around me, I see squirrels leaping from tree on tree. why couldnt I be one of them? just finding some food, trying to survive, not really caring about death and after some little amount of time just die. or even the trees, they dont have to care about anything at all actually. everyday I go to school, I can see that one particular tree standing there, watching me suffer and I just wish I could switch the place with him. but sadly, I cant. my role is to be human and that really sucks
