I going to jump off a bridge probably next week since I live close to one.Life is basically over for me, my mom has died from cancer and my dad left me when I was five so now Iâ€™m all alone and have nothing else to live for, I also dropped out of high school so now Iâ€™m just a stupid mistake walking around. This is going my last message to the world and hope you guys live a better life than me.
