Need helpIf I jump of the 6th floor (or 7th floor if you count the ground floor as the 1st floor),  is there any chance for me to stay alive and maybe be disabled after? 
I'm really scared of failing my suicide and I don't want to be in a wheelchair for the rest of my life.  
That is the only way for me to end my shitty life right now. 
Sorry for my poor english,  it's not my native language.
