Girlfriends gone. Im so lost. Just really need someone to talk to.I'm completely lost right now. I found out today that she had killed herself thursday night. We had a bad fight wednesday night, thursday night she did it. I cant help but feel as though its my fault. I cant stop crying, there wasnt a note, or anything. I just need help.
