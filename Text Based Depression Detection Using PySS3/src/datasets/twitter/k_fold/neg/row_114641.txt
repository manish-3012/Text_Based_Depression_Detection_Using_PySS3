Anyone else rent a room and hate it?I had a studio apartment once. I was master of my domain. Renting a room is like living with your boss. I have to watch everything I do and say to avoid getting kicked out. Itâ€™s stressful. I mostly stay in my room where itâ€™s safe.

If I get kicked out one day, iâ€™ll kill my self. Iâ€™ve searched craigslist from time to time to see what the market looks like and it doesnâ€™t look good.
