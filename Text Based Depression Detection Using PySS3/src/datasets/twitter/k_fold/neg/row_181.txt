Confusion, suicide and a sick petIâ€™ve been having a lot of suicidal ideation. Itâ€™s different this time though because I truly feel Iâ€™m not meant to be on this plane in existence. I finally realize that waiting out this pain is rather pointless because itâ€™s going to re-emerge again and whatever contentment I find in the spaces between isnâ€™t worth the darkness. I manic-depressive and I canâ€™t trust my own brain, my mind. Itâ€™s the worst itâ€™s ever been this time.

My cat stopped eating about a week ago. Heâ€™s going downhill and the doctors just figured out whatâ€™s going on but the situation is dire itâ€™s probably too late. I donâ€™t know what to do. Supposedly he has a 79% chance of bouncing back, but in the meantime heâ€™s on a feeding tube that I have to tend to every hour and a half. And any other time in my life, I would jump on the chance to help my companion animal get through a hump like this to live. But right now, well Iâ€™m suicidal, I donâ€™t know why am torturing him and torturing me in the process.

The vet said itâ€™s not torture. That he looks worse than he is. Iâ€™m not concerned that this vet is bilking me for money, believe me. He really thinks that if we do the tube feeding for about a week that he could be fine for another three, or five, or 10 years. But I donâ€™t want to be here another three, or five, or 10 years. I feel horrible that instead of snuggling with me like heâ€™s always done, my cat Stays in one spot unless Iâ€™m coming to feed him and in that case he runs away. Like bolts away for me, running into things along the way because he has the Elizabethan collar on.

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s good for him or me to keep doing this. I donâ€™t know if I put him down, I might come to me angry that I didnâ€™t do everything I could. And I donâ€™t know if that outweighs the anger Iâ€™m going to feel if he is deteriorating to a point of no return and his last days with me are horrible. 

I fantasize about killing me and him. Why delay the inevitable? This pain isnâ€™t worth it. We could be released from everything.

Advice?
