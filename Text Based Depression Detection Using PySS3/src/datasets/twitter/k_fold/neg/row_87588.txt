i think im going insanei donâ€™t know whatâ€™s happening to me. i canâ€™t stop thinking about dying, and the only thoughts in my head are about how much better things would be without me, and how worthless and stupid and ugly i am. every time i look in the mirror i see my image distort, and i break down. i keep noticing how all i do is stress out my family and worry people. im having graphic, reoccurring dreams about suicide and images in my head. itâ€™s all i can think about. im having such intense urges to cut, and im so conflicted all the time. ive been crying on my bathroom floor for an hour now, and i keep thinking about hanging myself from a pipe. i keep going back and forth in my mind about killing myself, and it seems like the logical thing to do even though i know itâ€™s not, and how selfish suicide is. i donâ€™t know anymore.
