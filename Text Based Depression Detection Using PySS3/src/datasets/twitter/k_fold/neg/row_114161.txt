Sorry, just need someone to read this...Let me just start with this.  I have a seemingly perfect life.  I have a steady, well payed job within my desired field.  I have a loving girlfriend of over three years.  My religious family and I get along great, despite the fact that I am an atheist. My family is considered upper to middle class, and was able to provide all the necessities, and then some (quite a bit more, to be frank.)   My parents are still together.  My sisters, their husbands, or in-laws, all get along great.  I'm living on the East Coast, after spending the entirety of my 22 years living in the boring Midwest.

But despite its perfect appearance, my life is a shithole, in which I am nearly incapable of being happy.  I guess I would say that it starts with my girlfriend.  We get along great, for the most part.  When hanging out, her patient nature makes her virtually the only person  who would put up with my highly volatile, unpredictable personality.  In addition, she is very hardworking--very motivated and success driven.  this is where the problem begins.  She is considerably more intelligent than me.  While the intelligence itself is not really a problem, the fact that I know she will accomplish more than I can ever hope to crushes me inside.  For a frame of reference, she's currently pursuing an MD/PhD dual degree program at one of the top five medical schools in the country.  She's literally outperformed anything I've achieved, and can hope of achieving.  Now I'm sure there are a few of you who have this pegged as sexism/chauvinism.  I'm not discounting this idea.  But while it may seem like chauvinism, I think it has less to do with gender, and more to do with my parents.

See, my parents are Chinese-Americans.  My Dad spent most of my childhood at work.  All three of the kids were taught to value hard work and perseverance.  Nothing was as important as working hard and doing your best.  Any sacrifice you made to improve your education, your future, was something my parents would be proud of.  In at least some part of my mind, there is nothing more important than how hard you work and how successful you are.  The fact is, I've tried to work harder--tried to get motivated--tried to find ways to live up to the standards i've set for myself.  But the fact is, I don't live to work.  As hard as I try, I just don't care about work that much.  I hated myself for not being able to work harder.  There's a disconnect between what I value in a person, and what I actually care about, myself.

What's made this all worse, is that I have almost no social interaction outside of work.  Not naturally outgoing, I've struggled to make friends in a new city.  Coming straight from the social promised land known as college, this sudden lack of social life is quite a shock.  And while I'll say that I moved out here so that I could experience a different region, a different city--the truth is that I'm out here because I wanted to be closer to my girlfriend.  and I resent her for it.  Its my own damn fault, and I know it.  But that doesn't mean that bitterness isn't there.

But that's not all.  My hell doesn't end here.  The thing is, I know that I deserve this hell.  there's a secret in my life that i've hidden for years, since I was about 10.  Since i was ten, I've been attracted to wearing women's clothes.  For years, I was in denial.  Denying that it was anything more than a phase.  Denying that I couldn't just stop whenever I wanted.  In fact, the excuse that I use, when I convince myself not to come clean, is that I still feel like I should be able to stop.  And that when the time comes, I will stop, and no one will ever need to know.  And my family and girlfriend, (especially my girlfriend) who doesn't have any idea, will be happier for it.

But I've known it would be an issue for the last 2 years.  And I've lied to my girlfriend.  betrayed her trust.  I don't deserve her, and I'm so afraid to lose her.

tldr; My life seems perfect, but its not.  I feel crushingly inferior to my SO, mostly because my upbringing.  Also, I'm a closeted crossdresser who's lied to and betrayed his SO, and doesn't deserve to live.
