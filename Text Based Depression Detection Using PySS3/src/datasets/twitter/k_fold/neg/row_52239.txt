stuck in limboI seem to be between a rock and a hard place, 
Living seems unbearable but so does suicide

Suicide isn't really an option to me, i would probably fail and have to move away to a hospital, and live with the memories and guilt, but if i did succeed my families lives would be ruined forever and they would never get over it

but living doesn't seem like an option. It is horrific, scary, boring, exhausting, I worry that I will never get over my mental illnesses.

How do I feel more inclined to live and feel less suicidal all the time, i'm only 15, i'm too young to have such a burden
