Things have changed for the worseI fucked up. I won't get into specifics, but it was a big fuckup. Probably the biggest fuckup of my life so far.

And lately now I feel... almost content about the idea of dying. Not the process itself, but of what comes after. I almost long for it at times. I had a mental breakdown yesterday; I sobbed hysterically and hyperventilated until my lungs felt shriveled and my mouth was as dry as a bone. I feel like I wasn't meant to be here. My grandma used to tell me that--I think she was right.

I don't want to sound like a victim. Things happened to me, and I did things in return. I'm not blameless for how my life is today. I just want thing to be calm. I want contentedness in my life; no anxiety or fear that I can't handle, no jumping at knocks on the door or raised voices. If it weren't for my family, I'd have done it by now. If it weren't for the nagging guilt hanging onto the back of my neck reminding me that I can't hurt my family this way, I would be gone.

I'm just too weak. Some people flourish in adversity and challenge, like a sunflower that curves its own stem to face the rays of the sun. I'm more like a weed that dared pop up alongside that sunflower, hindering its growth with my persistent worthlessness. I'm just waiting to be plucked out and thrown away. It's what I deserve, after all.
