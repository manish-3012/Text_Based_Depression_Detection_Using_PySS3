My last month alive.The past few weeks I have been obsessed with suicide. I finally found a method and given a lot of thought to how I will go about this. I am at peace with it. I hate myself. I hate what I see in the mirror. I would have never picked this life. I am incapable of feeling positive emotions. But I realized that all that is ok and that life isn't for everyone.
