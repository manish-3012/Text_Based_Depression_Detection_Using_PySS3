Got to the point where I think itâ€™s just the best option for everyoneNo matter how hard I try I just seem to hurt everyone. My dad left when I was young (now 23) so 4 years ago I decided Iâ€™d move to where he was living to try and better our relationship. 4 years later my dad fucks off again and Iâ€™m  still here engaged and have a stepdaughter who both I truly love but due to anger issues I got from my dad I struggle with shouting. I have no friends here and my life is literally work then come home to my family. My mum is an alcoholic and whenever I come to visit her she just spends her time In the pub, I refuse to drink because of how much she and my dad drunk when I was young so I like to avoid them really. My dad cares about me so much that I move 400 miles to see him but he just fucked off somewhere else again anyway and finally my family the best thing thatâ€™s happened to me seems to be on the verge of a break up because Im a complete shit head and canâ€™t control my anger in a positive way. Also Iâ€™m riddled with fucking debt. I canâ€™t keep upsetting my fiancÃ© so surely the best thing to do is just end it right now so I donâ€™t have to struggle or hurt anyone else anymore, Itâ€™s not going to get better and when i lose my family Itâ€™s going to happen anyway.
