Most painless way to go?  My options are overdosing, hanging/asphyxiation, cyanide poisoning, and stabbing myself (in the stomach, probably around my small/big intestines). 
  I could probably find something high to jump off of, but I would rate go another way. Hanging would probably be hardest because I'm not sure it'll hold me and I don't have any rope (Bedsheets?). 
  If I go by cyanide posioning, I may have to wait a few months. I could overdose, but I'm afraid I'll fail and get caught/ have brain damage. 
  I've tried getting help, but nobody cares enough to try. I just don't know what to do anymore. Even if I don't do it, I want the consolation of know I have the choice to, and nobody can force me to stay in this pain. Thanks for reading.
