whoreI'm a 16 year old female. Me and my best friend(we'll call her Kayla) stopped being friends when we went to a party together in another city and her mom found out. Basically she blamed the whole thing on me to get out of it and her parents made her never talk to me again. So I was with another close friend of mine(we'll call her Beth) one day and we went to this local restaurant to eat &amp; study. Well kayla's boyfriend was working there. We all talked for a minute but not for long. Later that day me &amp; beth were just riding around and he texted her and said "hey can you meet me? I just got off. we need to talk about our significant others" (he was talking about Kayla and Beth's boyfriend jay) well we all met in the mall parking lot and talked for a long time. he asked both of us if we knew anything that Kayla had lied about because he felt like she was keeping something from him. I said no because I couldn't just think of anything off of the top of my head but Beth said a couple little things. then he asked about the party &amp; who was there. well it turns out she lied about how many guys were there. then he asked about a couple more little things like that and I didn't lie for her because she blamed all that on me why would I? well he ends up breaking up with her over all the things we said. but when me &amp; Beth were leaving I got out of his car and as she was getting out he said to her "she's so hot" about me. now this guy is pretty attractive and that's pretty obvious but I never had feeling for him or even thought of him that way. but when she told me that I got kinda excited bc he's hot &amp; he thinks I'm hot. lol I'm pathetic. well a few days later he texts me and asks if he can come pick me up because he's sad about him &amp; kayla and I said sure. we end up going to the park and enoing and we were just talking and it was normal but he kisses me. and I'm not lying when I say I wasn't expecting it at all. I guess I should have but I didn't. it was nice. then I started thinking well maybe I really like this guy. maybe this could actually work out. again so fucking pathetic. then when he drops me off he kisses me and says "you have no idea what you just got yourself into" and I didn't. I had no fucking clue. not even a week later we hung out again because he said he wanted to seeee meeee yeah bullshit. well he picks me up and we go to his bank first to put his check in and then to Walmart to get golfballs(he still hadn't told me what he was planning to do at this point) then we went to the lake. but not just any spot on the lake. this specific spot was call sex circle. really secluded. but I didn't think anything of it because IM A DUMB ASS BITCH IF YOU HAVEN'T FIGURED THAT OUT YET. well he tells me to get baseball bats out of the back of his car. he planned to hit the golfballs into the lake. I told him like 10 time I know I won't be abled to because I am not coordinated in any way and am not athletic but he said it'd be fine so I just went. we had to kinda climb to get to the bottom where the water met the rocks and that's when he started hitting them. he told me to try and just like I said I couldn't hit any of them. so he said here watch me again. so apparently I didn't back up enough because when he hit the golfballs the bat kept coming and hit me right in the fucking face. right in the cheek. I didn't even know what happened at first. but then it hurt really bad. he said he was sooooo sorry and I said it's fine it's fine. and we went back up to his car but we didn't leave. we just sat there for a minute and I told him I'm mad at him just kidding around and he hugged me but was laughing. and then he started kissing me and when he stopped he whispered "get in the back" and I said "we can't do this" and he said "it'll be fine just get in the back" and I said "no not yet I'm scared" (I was a virgin) and he said "what are you scared of" and I said "that we won't be anything and you just want sex" and he looked at me sad and said "I thought we were something. I thought we were talking. " and I said "I guess we are" and he said "so get in the back I'll stop when you tell me to stop" and I said "I don't know" and he said a little louder "get. in. the. back. " so I did. and we did everything. and that's the worst decision of my whole life. even right before we actually did it I said not yet I'm scared and I said it's okay and just did it. I don't know why I didn't stop him. I wish I had. after it happened he told Beth and I'm pretty sure she told jay even though I told her not to. we talked for a little bit after that but obviously he got back with Kayla. it hurt so bad. and then he told her what happened. and she didn't hate me but she texted me and told me how hurt she was and asked if we could all meet up and talk about it. she came and picked me up and we met him in the gym parking lot next to his work. we talked it all out and me and her cried a lot. he didn't. I thought it was fine. it still hurt but I thought it was going to be okay. I thought I would be abled to move on in peace you know? but then people starting finding out more and more people kept asking about it and one of my "friends" even asked me about it in a damn group message for other girls to see but I denied it all. it's now summer and I thought it'd be okay. but my best guy friend just texted me and said "fuck you " and I asked why and he said "I can't believe you fucked _____. And I'm like the last one to find out. fuck you. don't ever talk to me again. " and I have no friends. me and Kayla made up but I just sent her my guy friend's message and she basically said it's my own fault. and I know it is. I fucking hate myself. and I told her I told him no and I told him I'm scared and she said no you didn't and I just fucking cussed her out because she wasn't there and I know I hurt her but I hurt every single day. I regret cussing her out. she was one of the only ones I had left. I have Beth but she told jay and jay has told people. even though I told her not to. I don't trust her. I don't trust anyone. I just thought I was different. I thought I wasn't a stupid whore who got tricked my boys but this was different. he's so deceptive. I got played and I know it's the basic teenage girl problem but I didn't think I was the basic teenage girl to play the role. I'm no fucking different. I've been talking to a boy and he knows what happened but I know it hurts him to talk about it. I just took a shower and thought about all of this. I want it to be over. I don't know if I could do it but it crossed my mind and that scares me. I'm just such a fucking pity party. a cry baby. always have been. always will be. I'm not religious but being pure meant a lot to me. this is way too long and I hope no one goes through the misery of reading it all. but if you do that was my story of how I'm a whore now and the whole school knows it. I hope you enjoyed it.
