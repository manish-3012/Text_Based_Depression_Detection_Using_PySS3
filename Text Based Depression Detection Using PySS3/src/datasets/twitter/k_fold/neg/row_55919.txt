I went down to Queens Blvd to end my life but I hesitated.I still want to live but my depression has been eating me up. Everyone I know has slowly abandoned me over time when I have was self deprecating. I don't feel good about myself anymore. I lost what the letters PMA truly meant. I used to have a great one but now I'm depressed. The only reason why I didn't kill myself was because I helpy business partner pay rent in a new office we opened up. I thought that would make me happier and occupied but instead I feel even more distant and more depressed. I see all the happy people in the world and wonder how that feeling is. I went down to Queens Blvd and stood their for a hour convincing myself to do it but I didn't. Yes, I live in Queens, New York. That has never happened to me before.... I don't know what to do I am so depressed and I feel like I let everyone down. I've seen a therapist and formed a support system with a group of individuals in my life but they have turned their backs on me. I've failed them and feel like a lost cause... I've been like this for a year and I'm not getting better. I'm in my mid to late 20s. 


What should I do, reddit? Where do I find peace within myself? How do I get these suicidal thoughts out of my head? I don't know anymore and I'm alone on this one... There's no one in my corner supporting me....
