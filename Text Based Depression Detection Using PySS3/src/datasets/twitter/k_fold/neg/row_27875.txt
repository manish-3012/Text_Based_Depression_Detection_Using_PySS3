Unemployed, depressed and suicidalI recently graduated from University(June 2020) and my plan was to do a MS in USA in my field. But because of this shitty pandemic I have to defer it to Fall 2021. I have a job offer with minimal wage but they are constantly delaying the joining.

I came to my hometown in March and stuck here. All my cousins are also here as we live in a joint family but they have job or are in college. . I am a laughing stock in my family and everybody takes advantage of me by sending me on errands (I also suffer from social anxiety and couldn't speak for myself) where I have to face my Indian relatives who ask me about my job situation.

I want to do something in comedy but I procrastinate daily by not writing any content. I had passions but currently I don't enjoy them. Whenever I meet my friends they look down on me because I am currently unemployed.

In my free time I regret about how I took gap year and still couldn't get into the reputed IITs and how I wasted my college life by being in my room and not gathering any memories and also not gaining any skills that make me employable. I wake up, regret my life decisions and sleep.

I have supporting parents but I feel guilty because I wasted their money in college fees and still not earning a single penny. I have a girlfriend but whenever we talk I feel she is better than me and self loathing starts. 

I feel suicidal and want to end all these responsibilities and pressure that this society has put on me but my parents will be devastated. 

Please help me.
