I'm afraid and I just need someone to listenSo I'm here with my citalopram bottle filled and another bottle half filled and I want to take it but I know it won't do the trick. But I don't want to wake up anymore. It's been 8 years since I first started to attempt to end my life and every time I feel like I can live everything hits me again. My mother pressuring me to take classes when I'm so overwhelmed with exhaustion I have to nap in my car between classes. My father commenting on my weight, my looks, my lack of a love life. My brother tip toeing around me because he was the one who found me trying to hang myself. I don't want to die but I feel so empty. I have no one to talk to besides my general doctor who refuses to recommend me to a psychiarist or therapist and my mother refusing to let me change doctors. I tried calling my university's student support line but they always tell me my problems are too serious and they refer me to the hospital but I don't want to be checked in again. Because it's all the same: You're depressed, take these pills, make a supprt system, release. I try. I really try but I feel so overwhelemed balancing this emptiness and loneliness with full time classes and work and being a good house daughter. I'm just tired of living...but I don't want to die but it's all I can think about.
