Taking myself seriouslyOn mobile so sorry for formatting and spelling 

Been considering suicide for the past few days for the first time in awhile. Already thought of how I would do it and a way to make sure I wonâ€™t back out. 
But this isnâ€™t there first time Iâ€™ve considered suicide definitely the furthest Iâ€™ve gone in terms of planning it out though. 
Feel like in a few weeks Iâ€™m gonna be over it tho and thereâ€™s no reason to bother/worry anyone about it. But at what point should I let someone know that Iâ€™ve been considering suicide?
