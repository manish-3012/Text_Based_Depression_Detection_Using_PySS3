I can't do anything right and I wonder if I should bother anymoreToday I lost my job. Second time I've been fired in as many months. Now I just don't know what to do. My boyfriend is also unemployed because the company he was supposed to start at had a hiring freeze. Our dog needs bloodwork (non life threatening) and I had to cancel her appt and feel horrible about it. 

I'm now waiting at a low cost mental health facility to be seen. It's gonna be a while. I feel just worthless. I loved my last two jobs but I wasn't cut out for them is what they said when they fired me. 

I really wish things would just get better, but they won't. The only thing keeping me here is that my debt would burden my dad in law (he's on my car loan) and my dog wouldn't have anyone to care for her properly. 

I don't get it. Life is just a loop of suffering and then things going OK for a while, and then more suffering and depression. It literally cannot get better. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. I haven't told anyone in person about how I really feel, and I don't plan to. I don't want to be locked up in a mental hospital and get in more debt.
