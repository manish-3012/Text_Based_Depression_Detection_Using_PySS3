I'm ready to eat a bullet.I've literally watched everything in my entire life wash down the drain. My brother-in-law and my sister hate me. My brother doesn't give a f*** if I'm dead or alive, and my renter is an absolute piece of s***.  on top of that my mom is in the second week of Corona virus and her organs are failing her.

I don't want to be on this world anymore. I want aliens to beam me up and take me away with them.

if that doesn't happen I'm going to go ahead and eat a bullet. I have some pretty f****** sweet ammo in my gun and I'm willing to eat 147 grain Hydra shock Winchester silver tip hollow point. That should definitely get the job done.

Is there even a point of being alive? I didn't consent being born. Yet here I am slumping my way through existence hoping that someone will think that I "did a good job". Those people don't even give a f****** less that become a doctor or a lawyer.
