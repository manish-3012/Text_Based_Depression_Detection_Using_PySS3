Putting it hereI'm putting this here instead of advice because it seemed more fitting. It is more fitting.
I've started high school. I deal with many things that make me feel very upset. School is just another thing I have to deal with upon my pile, and it's the worst of all. I don't know why exactly I don't like it. I mean, many people don't like high school, or any school for that matter, but school, no matter how much they try to help me deal with all my problems, It makes me want to harm myself in a terrible way. 
I just don't know what to do. I don't want to spend the next four years of my life feeling suicidal, I want to spend it wisely, taking online school, where the environment is less stressful, and I won't feel as depressed. I'm thankful they try to help me, but I've been pushed to my limit and I can't handle this.
My parents don't like the idea of online school. They keep telling me to try. Everyone thinks I'm getting better, but I'm not. I'm just getting better at hiding it. How in the world do I tell them or convince them that I won't be as depressed being schooled online?  And I know I'd be happier doing that because I've been seeing how I feel at school and as soon as I come home. It changes drastically. In a good way.
Please help me.
