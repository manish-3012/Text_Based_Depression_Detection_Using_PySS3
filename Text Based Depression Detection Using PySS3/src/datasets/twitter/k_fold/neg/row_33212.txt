My mind is full of fuckLast month I've been somewhat depressed and it's fucking frustrating.

It started when a friend told me over chat he felt kinda down and wanted to see a psych. A week later I was feeling completely useless. Tired, but sleepless. Hungry, but without any kind of will to eat. I cried randomly while thinking of a relative dying and I feel like I've given up on life. I see no future, no purpose, I don't know what I'll do when my parents die. I hope I'm not going to go as far as suicide, but I keep thinking of hypothetical situations where I'm in mortal peril, and I just give in.

I decided to stop that cycle last week, and forced myself to eat, and stay up and work on my projects. It got me up, a lot. I spoke to a friend and we talked until I broke down crying, and that cleaned me up a bit. I'm trying to turn my shit around and go back to jolly old me. I'm trying to wake up early (I think a huge part of this is my bad eating habits) and be with my family and friends more (another huge part of this).

I'm up... but I still look at the chance of suicide and letting go, and it still looks like a viable choice.
