i'm getting married soon and i literally just want to diei've struggled with mental illness over half my life and a few suicide attempts. i'm supposed to be happy right now. i'm getting married. instead, all i can do is lay in bed and cry. i don't know why i feel like this. i'm never going to get better. i want to die and i'm selfish. i can't stop thinking about it. is this normal?
