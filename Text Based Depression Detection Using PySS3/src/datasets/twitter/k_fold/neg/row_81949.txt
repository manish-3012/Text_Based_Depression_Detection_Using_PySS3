I can't be loved (M13)I don't know why, but i got like the worst body in the world, no attractive face, sweaty, weak arms and legs. I don't have any point in living

And then people just wanna ignore me because i'm the only one at my school without a girlfriend, maybe i'll go to gym nonstop and take some surgeries to finally be loved, i can't take this body that has no muscles and a big nose.

If i can't do that then suicide is the only option

And no this is not a troll or attention whore.
