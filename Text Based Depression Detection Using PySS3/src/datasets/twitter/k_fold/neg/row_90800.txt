I rode past the spot I almost hung myself 1 year ago.A little over a year ago I came extremely close to hanging myself. I was going to do it in a forest, in a spot 100m away from a popular cycle path. Today I rode my bike on that cycle path. The only reason I didn't hang myself was because my friend messaged me before I went through with it asking me to meet her. So I went and met her. I walked out of that forest. It just felt like such a huge thing for me to be able to ride that cycle path again, hadn't been back there since that day. It's been a struggle to get this far, I have ups and downs. But it's doable, there's always a reason to keep fighting.
