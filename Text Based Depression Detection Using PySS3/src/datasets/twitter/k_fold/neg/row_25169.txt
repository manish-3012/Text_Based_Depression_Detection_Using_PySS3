I'm at peace knowing I won't have this pit of fear in my stomach anymore. The only thing keeping me here is the hope that I will wake up from this 25 year old nightmare.I just had some family time recently. And I don't know if it's them so used to me being depressed. But it didn't seem forcedlike before, like they really wanted me around. It was so refreshing I could see through my depression for a short while. 

But,  I eventually returned to my cave of an apartment and the depression dropped in real quick. It's bad this time around. I'm nearly 31 and have crippling PTSD/Depression from a traumatic sexual encounter as a child. Which involves my biological father who I loathe to the core of my being. 

The last few nights i've had a very hard time staying asleep and returning to sleep after the nightmares i'm having remembering the details of the situation. I'm remembering from the scope of a 5 year old and i'm lost at the emotions that are returning. I have zero bearing on how to handle this. I've lived a full life of anxiety and fear not knowing why i'm afraid of the dark. But I now know it wasn't the dark that scared me it was the monster my father became in the dark that scared me. 

I've had this stored away not knowing. The pain was a normal aspect of my everyday life and I was none the wiser. I want this great fear gone.  Eased up so I can live and love how I want to. Not alone,  in the silent darkness you put me dad.. 

I hope --like my mother does-- that I can recover that curious drive that was lost years ago. I hope I can make someone feel on top of the world from the love I give. I hope I can travel the world and share my inner misery and provide a beacon of hope for those in the soup if depression like me. I hope I can lead a life where i'm a hero in someone's story. Maybe my own..

If I take my life, is  that all he wrote? He was hurt as a kid remained silent all his life to only carry this nasty burden to the grave.
