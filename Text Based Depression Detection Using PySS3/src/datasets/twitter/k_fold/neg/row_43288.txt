I can't deal with my health anymoreI've had a horrible day and im trying so hard to deal with how intense my depression is today but I am hurting so much and I'm trying really hard to not dump any of my shit on my boyfriend and he called me and got mad at me because he's sick of me always ruining his good mood. I never want to hurt him or bring him down I just fucking hate myself so much and I want to die and I'm pretty sure he is gonna leave me anyway cos I'm so fucking pathetic. I can't fucking stand being here anymore Idk why I'm trying so hard to get through this. I hate having mental illnesses I fucking can't stand it anymore.
