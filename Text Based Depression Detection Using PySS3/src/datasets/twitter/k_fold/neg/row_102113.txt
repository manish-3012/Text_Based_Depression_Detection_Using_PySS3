I feel worthless and I want to kill myselfWell, I just don't like the way I feel about myself. I feel like I don't have any worth to anyone in my life. I'm smart, I know all the things about the way I am are due to the decisions I've made in my past. I've failed out of a University. I went to community college to redeem myself, but I just don't have the drive to further my education like my family. All my cousins are doing way better than me, and I feel like I amount to nothing when I see or hear about their achievements. I do nothing productive at home. My parents want me to do better in life, but how can I knowing I've let them down when they have put their faith in me. I take more than I give in my family and I just want to end my life because the pressure of me being me weighs too heavily on my heart. I feel in my bones that if I end my life the rest of my family will be much more satisfied with the rest of their lives if they don't have me bringing their lives down.
