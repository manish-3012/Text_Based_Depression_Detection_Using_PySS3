My sisters number redirects to the suicide prevention hotlineI donâ€™t know where to post this. Iâ€™m so confused right now. We have been texting and then she stopped texting. She wouldnâ€™t answer her phone and then at some point the number was the suicide prevention hotline. I stayed on line until I could ask someone how it would be possible but they donâ€™t know. They gave me the info for police where my sister is as we live states apart. The police said they will get back to me. Now I am just waiting for some response but nothing yet. I am lost. One of her last messages was â€œwhatâ€™s done is doneâ€
Iâ€™m not even positive she is at the address I gave. She said she got kicked out. Her bf changed his number!!! I cannot get into contact with anyone I am so scared. Does anyone know why her number redirected?
