Every nightWhen I go to sleep, I pray that I don't wake up again the next morning cause I am too scared to take my own life. Life is hard and challenging  and I hate myself for feeling that way cause I know there are countless people out there who have it worse than me yet they manage to persevere. 
Hopefully the next life will be better.
