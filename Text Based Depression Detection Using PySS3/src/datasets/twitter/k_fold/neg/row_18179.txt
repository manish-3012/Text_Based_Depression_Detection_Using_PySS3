I hate this phraseEvery. Single. Fucking time i tell someone im suicidal/ wanna kms 80% of the replies i get are "but what about your family/friends :(" SHUT THE FUCK UP. Maybe the reason i wanna kms in the first place is because of my family, why should i stay alive just because I'll "hUrT TheiR FeELinGs"? They clearly dont care about mine, they only want me to be their fucking servant and thats all i am to them, so why should i care if they get sad or not?
