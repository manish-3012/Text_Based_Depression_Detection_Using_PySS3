I tried everything but perhaps itâ€™s time to let goIâ€™m an emotionally strong person. At least I think so. 

Iâ€™ve had my fair share of struggles. Broken family, abandoned by my mother, father died, sexually abused, career uncertainties, financial troubles, etc. Well, I survived them all. I did everything to survive. Even though I had to swallow my pride several times. I begged and had to stay in abusive relationships so that I could live. But I survived and Iâ€™m proud of myself.

Donâ€™t get me wrong. I also have a lot of good things going for me. Iâ€™m satisfied with how I look. I have friends and family. I have hobbies I love. And if I push myself, I can probably achieve great things in my career.

But Iâ€™m not happy at all. In fact Iâ€™m extremely sad. Iâ€™ve been like this for years now. Everyday I have to carry this heavy weight in my chest. I tried everything but I might give up soon. I think happiness is not for me. I donâ€™t know why I have to keep carrying this. I donâ€™t think I can go on much longer.

I thought Iâ€™m emotionally strong. But everyday Iâ€™m slowly losing my grip. Iâ€™m beginning to think that letting go may not be a bad option.
