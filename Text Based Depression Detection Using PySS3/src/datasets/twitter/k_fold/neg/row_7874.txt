Iâ€™m such a failure in life. I canâ€™t take this anymoreIâ€™m such a fucking failure that i typed this whole post out then got rid of it instead of it posting. I graduated college in December. Had to move back in with mom. Been job searching for a year to find exactly one job that wants me which is where Iâ€™m working retail part time making minimum wage which doesnâ€™t support anyone. Itâ€™s an Awful job that fucks me up mentally and physically and after working 5 days in a row (which never happens) i wanted a day of rest. Then my mom comes home today exploding that i didnâ€™t do anything and i need to find a new place to live. I already pay most of the xfinity bill, my credit card from college, and now one of my student loans and car insurance was added so Iâ€™m left with 10$ a week basically. Nothing in my life is working and i just keep thinking of all the ways to die. Iâ€™m ready for it to end. I canâ€™t do this anymore 
Edit: she came and asked why i was so upset and i told her all the stressed mental and physical and financial and tell her i want to die. â€œWhy donâ€™t you go to a therapist?â€ â€œI CANT FUCKING AFFORD ITâ€ and she said okay and left. I called my dad and told him and he just told me to find a new job. Itâ€™s like they donâ€™t even care enough to try and understand. I know theyâ€™d miss me after i was gone but i need it now and they donâ€™t care.
