Those whoâ€™ve obviously self harmed or attempted suicide and ended up in the hospital, what are some of the things the doctors/nurses treating you have said?The one time I actually ended up at a hospital for self harm the doctor who was stitching me up told me I didnâ€™t cut myself the â€œright wayâ€ and then proceeded to show me how I should have injured my self had I wanted to end my life.
