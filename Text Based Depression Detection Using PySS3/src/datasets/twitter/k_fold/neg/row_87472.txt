Anyone use suicide as a coping mechanism?For example, say something bad happens to you, and you say: â€œweâ€™ll it doesnâ€™t matter cause ill be dead soonâ€. Then you feel calming relief and closure that you are really convinced that this pain doesnâ€™t matter and will end soon. 

Its the only coping mechanism Iâ€™ve used that consistently helped and kept with me. Yeah, its bad, but its really the only one for me that helps instantly and keeps me relaxed/mood in check.
