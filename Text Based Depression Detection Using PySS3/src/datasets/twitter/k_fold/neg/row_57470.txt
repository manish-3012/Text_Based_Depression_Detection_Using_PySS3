It's fine, I just won't buy bulletsI should be too old for this, but I'm having a tough one.  I let a relationship go because I thought it would at least be manageable like every other breakup.  But I'm not managing, it haunts me all day and night.  I know she moved on quickly.  I already tried begging, I'm not ashamed of that.  I am ashamed of plenty of other things.

It seems impossible to improve myself, move on, laugh without feeling totally hollow.

I don't want to have to give up drinking, smoking, my ADHD medication.  I would really lose it then.  I can't talk about how bad things really are without a professional taking them away from me.

I know that I have to give up my gun, but I'm not brave enough to kill myself any other way.  It feels like I'll lose my one chance if I do.  I won't buy bullets for it, but it lurks there anyway.  My future cause of death is right there, it's an interesting thing to know.

I fantasize about blowing my brains out on the sidewalk in front of her house.  I know what a terrible person that would make me.  I just want to stop hurting, and I guess truly express my love and rage and devastation.

I never thought I'd be this guy, but letting her go was the worst mistake of my life.  I don't want to have to see the rest of it.  I should have committed to her more.  Instead, she's living the single life, very happily I know.  I want her to be, but that doesn't leave much for me.  If she would just change her mind, I would give anything.  But it won't happen.  I had to block her so I'd stop texting and calling late at night.

I'm venting here, but nothing will bring things back to normal.  I wasn't crazy until she left, I was a great guy for these three years.  Even I'm surprised by how melodramatic I sound now.  I didn't think I could be this person, seriously considering suicide over a relationship.  I just miss her so much, and it's totally futile.
