I hate not being able to talk about itThe worst part of being seriously suicidal is. It being able to talk about it. Canâ€™t tell my therapist or my family because theyâ€™ll have me involuntarily committed. Canâ€™t tell my psychiatrist, canâ€™t tell my kids good bye, canâ€™t check on whether my life insurance pays in the event of suicide because theyâ€™ll flip out. Canâ€™t fucking tell ANYBODY. Itâ€™s so lonely.
