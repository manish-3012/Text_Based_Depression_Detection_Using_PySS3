The wheelOf chemicals    

&amp;#x200B;

Or morals    

&amp;#x200B;

Maybe perspective    

&amp;#x200B;

Self-Reflection    

&amp;#x200B;

"Coping"    

&amp;#x200B;

Hands melting in water    

&amp;#x200B;

Putting the hands in water    

&amp;#x200B;

The sharp pain, then, less of a body    

&amp;#x200B;

This is wrong    

&amp;#x200B;

It feels like nothing    

&amp;#x200B;

Copies are smarter than me    

&amp;#x200B;

Copies don't exist    

&amp;#x200B;

Just better    

&amp;#x200B;

things    

&amp;#x200B;

Putting nail scissors next to my pillow    

&amp;#x200B;

Like hands in water    

&amp;#x200B;

The fluids don't melt    

&amp;#x200B;

though     

&amp;#x200B;

Yet it feels the same     

&amp;#x200B;

Doesn't it?        

&amp;#x200B;

Empty brain      

  

"tatsy" death    

&amp;#x200B;

Good morning

&amp;#x200B;
