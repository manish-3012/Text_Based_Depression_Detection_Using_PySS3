I donâ€™t want to live anymore.I got really sick from food poisoning in August 2019 and started getting tension headaches. Because of the headaches I developed really bad insomnia. I started taking a strong pain killer for the tension headaches which led me to get tinnitus (incurable ear disease where you hear a constant ringing in your ears) which of course made my insomnia worse. I only sleep 1 - 2 hours a night due to the fact that I now have sleep anxiety and have also developed Generalised Anxiety Disorder and OCD. 

I work a job that I donâ€™t necessarily hate but definitely doesnâ€™t fulfil me. Because of COVID Iâ€™m allowed to work from home which is keeping me employed because now my boss doesnâ€™t notice I spend half my day sitting on the couch feeling sorry for myself because I can barely function. 

Iâ€™m too scared to try medication so Iâ€™ve been literally trying to resolve all my issues through natural therapy but none of it seems to be working. 

I get by because I have a supportive girlfriend and family but I donâ€™t want to burden them all the time with my problems. I really donâ€™t know how much longer I can live with this
