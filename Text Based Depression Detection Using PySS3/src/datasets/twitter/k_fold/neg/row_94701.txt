Fuck all the stigma (Rant)Why is there such a bad stigma around suicide?
I don't fucking get it. You only live to produce money and children which will experience the same shit. 
There is literally no meaning to leave for as you die and even if you achieve something, we will all die. What the shit is the problem with ending one part of a forever miserable bloodline!?
I don't know if mentally healthy people fucking know but they don't matter, nobody does.
We are just trapped in because people fear the truth and blessfully ignore it.

TL;DR: The purpose of my and yours life is to make people ignorant.
