Self MedicatingDo and you guys do this with alcohol, sleepint tablets or other stuf. I don't when I'm feeling ok but when the depression is severe I do.

I only know it makes it worse then I end up feeling guilty and like a POS for doing it. But wheh you spend weeks or months trying to be virtuous, exercise, look after yourself, eat wll, work, etc and you STILL feel indescribably awful, it's difficult not to. I'm not trying to justify this (well maybe I am a bit (but wonder if others did it too). Would just make me feel less alone even though I know it's wrong.

It's damaging in the mid to long run but at least provides some respite in the short term and soetimes tht's just so appealing.
