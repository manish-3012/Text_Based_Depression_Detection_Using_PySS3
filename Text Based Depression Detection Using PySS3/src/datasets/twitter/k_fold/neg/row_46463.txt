I used to get suicidal when I started feeling sad and lonely like this. But now I actually want to live.This would normally be the time when I would start planning, or just wishing I could end it all. 

I can't remember the last time I've laid in bed at night to go to sleep. I stay up every single night, distracting myself with something or just sitting anxious and alone until I get too tired to keep myself awake.

I will sit alone at home trying not to make any sounds, or go for a drive if the silence becomes unbearable, which happens pretty much every day.

I often stay up until sunrise, then I go lock myself in my bedroom so one will see me as they wake up. Most times I just lay there motionless with my bad thoughts. Sometimes I don't sleep at all, and try to pretend that everything is fine during the day to whoever might notice me. Then I just know that the cycle will begin again as it starts to get dark.

But something strange is happening lately. I don't want to die anymore.

I have a weird feeling that things can get better. I feel hope that I might be able to live some kind of life that feels meaningful, or at least less painful.

But I have no idea how to get there. I feel like that kind of life would be possible, but I have no idea what I have to do to get there.

I've been feeling like this for a few days, and I don't know what to make of it.

Maybe it's a sign that things can start to get better, and it might make me more open to start to live again.
