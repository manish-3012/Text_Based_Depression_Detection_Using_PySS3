I donâ€™t like myself. I want to leave.15m
I best by start by saying i have Moderate to Severe ADHD, Severe Anxiety, Depression. 
So iâ€™m sorry if this post is a mess. I have just had an anxiety attack and iâ€™m shaking still and crying a bit. 

I donâ€™t like myself. People call me names and stuff. 

I have recently, today been told to kill myself. They donâ€™t know i have almost tried to for the past 3 nights. I have just been feeling down. Iâ€™m sorry. 

I feel kinda lonely at the minute. My friends are kinda just making me feel like iâ€™m a ghost and iâ€™m not there.

I am crying almost every day because all i think of is the bad things. I try to think positive but itâ€™s really hard to. 

I hide everything. I smile when i get made fun of. I laugh. Inside iâ€™m slowly losing the will to live. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Bottling up everything itâ€™s tearing me apart. 

It just keeps adding on with every little insult. 

My hobby gets made fun of. Itâ€™s mountain biking, but iâ€™m really good at it. But everytime i pass someone from my school or something i get made fun of and they shout things at me. 

I donâ€™t like myself. People donâ€™t know that i have mentall illnesses, they just think iâ€™m different. The only people that know is my closest friends.
