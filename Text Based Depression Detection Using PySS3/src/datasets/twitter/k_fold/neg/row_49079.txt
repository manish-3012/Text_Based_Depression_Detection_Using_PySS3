Death is a dreamEveryday I open my eyes to hell... no one thinks of me, calls me... everyone Iâ€™ve tried to get close to backs away. Iâ€™m really kind of a strange person, I donâ€™t even know why. Being pretty is pointless when no one likes your personality. What the fuck is wrong with me? Why am I so fucking weird. I hate me. I didnâ€™t ask for life, or this life. Iâ€™ve screwed up every good thing because Iâ€™m fucking delusional. Iâ€™m scared of everything. I stutter all the time. I come off like a fucking babbling idiot. Iâ€™m just pathetic, no body cares about me, how the fuck am I expected to keep this up. There isnt a single shred of hope left. The darkness of my closet and a rope is the most comforting thing I have. I donâ€™t know what the fuck I am or why I was born but I donâ€™t even like me. I need to go.
