Dead on the insideI feel like shit all the time, my wife no longer loves me, I've been cutting up and down my legs so nobody will notice for weeks now, I can't find any patch of unscathed skin to cut anymore... I just want to end it... I can't even bring myself to get out of bed today... I've been blowing off my friends and family for a while now too... It just feels like everything is crumbling... How can I get out of this slump?
