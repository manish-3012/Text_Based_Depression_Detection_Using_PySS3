Can't let go. Losing my mind.It's has been almost a year and a half since she left after 7 years. Who can say who's fault it was, it was none of us and both of us at the same time. We had no kids and we are in different countries now, we speak from time to time but I realize now she's not the same person I loved. 

The real problem is the person I loved. I can't let go. God, I miss her so much that there are no words to describe it. I'm 35+yo and try to think reasonably, to take it. But I'm just losing my mind. What I would give to have one day with her again. So much things we lived together. Some days I speak with her on my mind all day. There's not one day I don't wake up looking for her. There's not one day I don't think if she would like or think about my actions or just how I something on the house.

I have never really spokento anyone about this, but obviously everyone around knows that I feel, justnot how deep. I'm a very quiet guy about my problems, and serious man, a tough one I thought. A loner until ai met her. Only today I decided to write here for no reason, I...

I analyze things, identify my negative feedback loops, but I just can't get out. Night always comes with my demons. I don't see a point to new relationships, I find no joy on my successes at work, I'm just miserable. Sometimes all I can think of is that I had a great life, had a great love and thats something not everyone can say. I just lived already, and it's over, there's nothing else. I just want to have peace, just want to go.
