It should be the happiest time of my lifeIn the last year, I've gotten married, changed jobs, had my son, and moved- but my depression is worse than it's ever been. I am seeing a psychiatrist who has me on meds for anxiety, as I told my husband I was afraid to let the Dr know about the depression and sucidal idolization because I'm the one working full time in the household (my husband is disabled)  so I can't afford to lose my job and the family income although he works part time and gets social security disability. There is a bridge near my house that I have thought about jumping from, but I also think about drowning or pills. Do you think it's safe to mention depression to a psychiatrist in this situation? I can't risk time off work or losing income. I also haven't told my psychiatrist that I have sexual and physical abuse in my past, or that my father had bipolar because I have a distrust of doctors and figured anxiety was the safest thing I could explain my situation as without getting into heavy doses of medication or inpatient. What are your thoughts? I'm tired of feeling this was. I want a lifetime with my family but if I am only going to give them pain dragging this out I should just do it and end my life, right?
