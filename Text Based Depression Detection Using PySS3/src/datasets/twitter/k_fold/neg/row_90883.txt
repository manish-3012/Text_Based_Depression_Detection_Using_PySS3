Im scared of myself.I was very young when i first started to consider suicide and 4 years later, the only thing that has changed is that i have gone from fighting it to accepting it. I understand that suicide is a selfish concept but why should i continue to live if everyday is a struggle to me. I don't want to have to force myself to wear a fake smile to make my friends and family happy anymore. None of them understand what i go through and neither do i. I just get so irrationally upset about everything and no one is there yet its expected i be there for my friends. I feel like im empty inside and sometimes i find myself crying for no reason. These thought about suicide used to only occur when i was upset but they are now with me all the time. When im crossing the road i would be thinking about how easy it would be to step out in front of a car and for it to end. Its never going to go away and im going crazy because of it.
