Nothing in my life worksIâ€˜ve made plans to improve my life, but nothing works. I donâ€˜t suffer from depressions at all, but from a personality disorder. I went to therapy last year because of some issues with family and my job situation. I quit my job because I couldnâ€˜t stand it anymore, wanted to study, but every plan that I make keeps failing. Life apparently doesnâ€˜t want me to succeed. Iâ€˜d have to go and work full time again, in a shitty job, that makes me go crazy and I can say goodbye to a life that I would enjoy. I donâ€˜t want to live like that. If I donâ€˜t get a job, Iâ€˜d have to depend on my SO and our relationship is fucking broken anyways. I donâ€˜t want to rely on somebody, if I donâ€˜t even know how much longer itâ€˜s going to last. The only reason Iâ€˜m still here, is my family. I canâ€˜t do that to them. But I wish, because right now I only exist to not ruin my familys life. Thatâ€˜s my only purpose. My sole purpose is to keep my family sane. What a fucking miserable and sad existence. I wish I could just leave. They say life is full of possibilities, I feel like Iâ€˜m in a cage. I can either live life in a way that makes me miserable, or end it. Why should I even stay alive? Work another decade to save money again, that Iâ€˜m going to waste on plans that wonâ€˜t work again? Iâ€˜m going to be 40 by then, way too late to make anything of myself. I want to give myself until the end of the year, if nothing has improved significantly, Iâ€˜m going to end it. I donâ€˜t see why I should keep trying
