I want to live to make somebody happyIm turning older and older every year and I've never had somebody to love and now that Im getting old I'm becoming unlovable and I just think about how I can't have the one thing that'll make my life worth it

I see everybody with their significant others by now and I'm so sad, why can't that be me

I want to die now. Ive been going to the train tracks a lot recently but I'm too scared to go on them when the train actually comes but I Feel like if I go enough times i'll finally get the courage to kill myself. There's a bullet train that comes by like every hour so it'll be fast. that'll be nice
