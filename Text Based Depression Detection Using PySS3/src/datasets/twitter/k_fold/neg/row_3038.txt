When I reach 17, i'm going to kill myself. I'm lowkey kind of scared.right so from the getgo, i have no future. i already came to terms with that. i've evaluated my choices and it's either going to be having to man up and pull the trigger ASAP, or live my life either kicked out of the house homeless or as some neckbeard living here forever.

i've tried everything i can to atleast give myself a future. but it doesn't work. i have hobbies, but im not proud of them. i want to make music, but im also never proud of it and i cant sing loud because of my parents. what's the point anyway too, i cant even feel anything anymore. i have no emotions to express because i've died inside since idk.

to be honest, im both looking forward to but dreading the day when i have to die. i haven't actually planned it out yet. the future is scary though regardless. i hate the future. i hate MY future. i hate everything about me. i hate everything.
