That's All, FolksWhere to begin?

For the past ten years I've been dealing on and off with severe depression. Mental illness runs in the family. My grandma slit her wrists and bled out. My mom has borderline personality disorder and PTSD. She tells me on the phone all of the time that I'm the only reason that she doesn't "check out early" as she likes to say.

As for me, I also show symptoms of PTSD and borderline personality disorder. I've wanted to kill myself for a while now. It would be easy. I'm not afraid of dying. I'm relieved at the thought. Maybe the nightmares about being raped by my cousin would stop. Maybe then I could stop causing problems with my family by having these crazy mood swings. I go into rage fits where I'll make ten, twenty, sometimes thirty cuts at a time. I dissociate so badly sometimes that the razor is the only thing that feels real. I'm bulimic. I hate my body. I worry my family on a constant basis when they see the stretch marks and the scars.

If I'm dead, they won't have to worry about me any longer. I won't be a burden. I can't seem to stop hurting myself. I tried to throw my razors away yesterday and had a panic attack at the thought. If I just end it for good, then no one else will have to worry about me anymore. 

On the other hand, I feel incredibly guilty at the thought. My death might be the final straw on my mother's back. She might finally kill herself too. Then again, she's the one who told me years ago when I left home that I was meant to kill myself one day. That I'm simply prolonging the inevitable. Life is a joke, and that's its sick punchline.
