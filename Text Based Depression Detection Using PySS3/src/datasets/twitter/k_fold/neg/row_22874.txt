Im sorryMy name is Starr
I'm a 15 year old female
No one really takes me seriously when I say that there's something wrong with me and that I need help
I've been feeling this way since I was 13
And it's only gotten worse
I dig my nails into my palms sometimes when it's too much
I don't want to hurt myself
But I really don't want to be here anymore
My family feels as if I'm always at fault
On anything that happens
It makes me sad and very frustrated
If there was one thing I could live for
It would be for my girlfriend
But every second staying just hurts me more
And more and more and more and more
I wish I would just die from a car crash or something so I don't disappoint her
But it's too late for that now
I'm planning to overdose
I'm sorry
