HelpIâ€™ve been talking to this one girl online for about a month but recently this Iâ€™ve also been talking to this other girl I went to school with. I havenâ€™t told the online girl that Iâ€™m talking to her yet. I like both of them I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t want to hurt anyone. Maybe I should just kill myself already. I know Iâ€™ll do it soon anyway. Probably better than getting into a relationship and then hurting them cause I committed suicide.
