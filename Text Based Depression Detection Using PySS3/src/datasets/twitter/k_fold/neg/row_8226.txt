I'm just so done.I'm just sitting here, feeling exhausted. Exhausted and sad. Those are the only feelings I've felt lately.

The love of my life left me for my best friend six months ago and basically tossed me out on the street. I was homeless for three and a half months. I've sort of sorted my life up, but I feel so empty. Nothing makes me happy anymore.

My life has been pretty bad and it feels like it doesn't get better. Ever since I was a kid, I dreamed about having my own place. A place I could do everything I want, away from dad. Now I have it and I can say I miss him so much. There are so many people I've lost that I miss and I really want to join them. No one is keeping me here. I don't have anyone that loves me. No friends. Nothing. It's just me in this big world where no one gives a shit about me.

I miss being a kid, hanging out with my dad or my friends. I miss school where I was hanging with people all the time. I miss my best friend. Ever since she took her life, I've been thinking about it too. I can't believe it has soon been four years since she left this world.

I just... I can't take all of this anymore.
