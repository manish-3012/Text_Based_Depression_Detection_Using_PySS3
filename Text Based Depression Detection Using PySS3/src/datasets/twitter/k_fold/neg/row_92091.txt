How long are we supposed to hold on for?Iâ€™m fucking ready. Goddamn it. I fucking canâ€™t stand it. 

I called my friend and told him I was depressed and he said heâ€™d call me another time. He was my best friend when we were teenagers. 

Iâ€™m just tired of going in circles. No matter how much I try to break out of it I end up back there.
