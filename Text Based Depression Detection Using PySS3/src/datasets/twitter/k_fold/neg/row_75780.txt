I physically abused my boyfriend when I found out he cheated on me the second time.The first time he cheated on me I punched him in the face, and felt extremely horrible afterwards but I was still hurt, and didnâ€™t understand why I lashed out that way. 

A couple months pass, and I found out he was talking to another girl, we got into an argument over how he thought she was â€œfuckableâ€ ..  I then broke his tv and started punching him over and over for a couple minutes, and I feel like I canâ€™t live with what I did. I feel extremely guilty, I feel like I canâ€™t forgive myself, and it just keeps replaying in my head. That same night, he put a gun to my head, and I told him to do it, and I wish he wouldâ€™ve. I donâ€™t want to be here anymore..
