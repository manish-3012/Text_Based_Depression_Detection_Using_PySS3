Help meI have thoughts in my head about not being allowed to copy/imitate others or learn from them. I have thoughts about not being allowed to have idols or learn from other people. Every time I tell myself that it's completely normal to copy others and learn from others, some shitty voice inside my head tells me I am not allowed to and I feel weird in my gut. I also feel like I've lost my ability to analyze stuff. I cannot work out if this is just me being ridiculous or its for real. I don't know what to do and think of killing my self everyday. Has anybody tried/felt something similar??
