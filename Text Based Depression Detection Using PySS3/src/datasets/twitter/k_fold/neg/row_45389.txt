I keep having dark thoughts about killing myself, but I don't know why.I'm not depressed, my home life is alright, college is okay, I have good friends, I'm happy most days...but in the small hours when I'm left to my own thoughts, the thought of killing myself just drifts in...like whisperings in the trees and ill find my self sat there for hours just thinking about it, thinking about whats on the other side... :/
