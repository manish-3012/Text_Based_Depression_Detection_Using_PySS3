21F Itâ€™s all over for me.I canâ€™t take my life anymore, everything is falling apart and nothing will ever be the same. The worst thing thatâ€™s happening right now is that my brother is arrested for something horrible and I canâ€™t talk about it to anybody because itâ€™s still an ongoing matter. My whole family is torn apart by this, my mom wonâ€™t even talk to me because sheâ€™s only concerned about him. Iâ€™m afraid that sheâ€™s going to spend all of our families money and my college fund on him. But I feel like a selfish piece of shit for even worrying about myself right now. Even before I found out about this yesterday, I wanted to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for a long time, I donâ€™t think anything matters anymore and I canâ€™t imagine feeling worse than I do right now. Iâ€™ve been suicidal before, Iâ€™ve been in the mental hospital twice before after I was raped. Iâ€™ve had suicidal ideation for a long time, pretty much as long as I can remember. Even though my family gave me all the financial help that they could, I was always a sad child. I was molested starting at age 16, by my older boss at the restaurant I worked at. Then I went to college, and I was raped by a guy that I thought really liked me. I was dumb to think anyone could like me, Iâ€™m extremely fat and ugly. No one even believe me about the rape, the police made me feel like it was my fault. I couldnâ€™t cope with the trauma of the rape, so I dropped out of college and started drinking heavily. I was raped several more times because I just got myself into bad situations so I know that it was my fault. Things got a little better for a while after I stopped drinking and started going to therapy, but then this happened with my brother and I see myself going into a horrible downward spiral. I donâ€™t think anything can ever get better and I donâ€™t think that thereâ€™s any hope.
