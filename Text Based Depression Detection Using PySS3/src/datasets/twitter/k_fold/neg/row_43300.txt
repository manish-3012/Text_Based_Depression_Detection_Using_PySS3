When I close my eyes I can pretendMy thoughts are a blur so I'm using bullet points.

* Everything hurts. There is too much pain in my life. I want it to stop.

* I hate just about everything humans have done. Yeah, we've done some amazing things, but we've done a lot of extremely awful things. I don't like the societies we've created. I don't like the systems we have in place. 

* So I'm pretty depressed and suicidal. I also have zero self-worth and negative self-esteem. This has made me extremely anxious/nervous/shy. 

* I'm 20. Living at home. College dropout. No friends. Waste of space-failure at life.

* The only things in my future are college or a job. College is just like high school. Bullshit work just to make it hard. And a minimum wage job? Call me elitist but that's insulting. Those options look like they'll make me more miserable than I already am.

* I've made my plan and have started my notes.

* I don't want to 'feel better' or 'make it to tomorrow'. I want to solve my problems. 

* I've had it. I'm so sick of this. If I can't fix this, it's not worth 'enduring'. I know of something that will take care of everything.


This is scary. *I'm so scared*. I can't believe this is happening. What am I supposed to do??
