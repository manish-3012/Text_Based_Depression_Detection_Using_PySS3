If I donâ€™t graduate in May,Iâ€™m going to kill myself. So thereâ€™s a time limit. If I tell my therapist right now about my plan, will she hospitalize me? I was going to post this on Quora, but all I get is generic shit on there. Nothing really helpful. I figured, if I canâ€™t even get my grades in order and graduate, then whatâ€™s the point? My grades are all I have, in terms of human value. If I donâ€™t graduate, Iâ€™ll be doomed to a life of shame from my family and peers. I have to graduate. If I donâ€™t, Iâ€™ll have nothing to my name. My brain is starting to fog up. Probably to protect myself from hurting. Any advice?
