It's always like this as my birthday approachesBut it's different this year because I've found at least one way to do it (just in case--it's not set in stone, but I could feel the pull) without hurling myself in front of a bus or jumping from a higher floor.

I hate myself, I'm ugly inside and out, I don't deserve anything.
