Give me one good reason why I shouldnâ€™t end my lifeI always see people saying â€œyou will be missedâ€ or â€œdonâ€™t do it, there are people that care about youâ€ but I donâ€™t want to be told that. I donâ€™t want to continue living just for someone elseâ€™s sake. I donâ€™t have plans to end my own life and honestly I think Iâ€™d be too afraid to ever follow through with it. But right now, I feel numb to the world. I donâ€™t have fun doing anything anymore. Itâ€™s a constant struggle of just trying to pass the time. I canâ€™t live my life like this for much longer. I donâ€™t want to be numb anymore. I would rather feel sad because at least then I will be feeling something. Please, just give me one good reason why life is worth living because I really donâ€™t think there are any. Anything I do in life is simply to pass the time until I die. I wish I could enjoy life again.
