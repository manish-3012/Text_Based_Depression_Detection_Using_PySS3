Made it to 2pmEvery minute awake/alive is agonizingly painful psychologically. I am finding it harder and harder to Â«Â liveÂ Â» without very strong urges to kill myself. The things I used to do that helped still help but now Iâ€™m unable to motivate myself to do them. But today I made it to 2pm without completely breaking down in full crisis mode. Iâ€™m feeling OK enough that Iâ€™m going to go out and sit in a coffee shop and have a coffee.

Every day is different but today I made it to 2pm because I was here on Reddit reading about some of your struggles, identifying with them, trying to write a few words of encouragement, and browsing other subs to distract my mind.

So I want to thank everyone who suffered and felt enough pain to reach out here to allow me to interact with them. I had my time of crisis last week and the comments and encouragement and attention was soothing. 

Thank you everybody. I could say this everyday... I am grateful for this community. Thanks for existing. Iâ€™ll raise my coffee to cup to everyone who is hanging on by a thread, I am too.
