tired mostly...tired of fighting.
tired of trying.
tired of trudging though the muck of my mind and tired to fighting off the demons. 
tied of being strong. 
tired of forcing myself to keep going.... 
my battle with my depression is less a screaming war, anymore,  than a quiet resistance. 
Now instead of actively fighting i just lay here and hope I'll make it to sunrise.
but what if I dont want to.
what if I just dont want to fight any more.
