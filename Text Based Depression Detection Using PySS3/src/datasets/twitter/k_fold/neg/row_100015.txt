Why can't things just go right for a whileI thought I was going to go today without drinking or getting high, then life took a big steaming shit on my head and drove me to drinking again. 

My best friend suddenly doesn't seem to care to talk anymore. It feels like no one else wants to hear from me. 

I'm thinking about blowing a large amount of my savings on a trip to the Caribbean to relax for a couple weeks and then maybe just giving up and being homeless and hungry most of the time. I can't stand any jobs. I'll never have even one single nice thing I planned like a small rural house or a half decent car or anything like that.

Any job is complete shit. If you're not dealing with physical labor that severely damages your body permanently, you're dealing with a shitty boss or shitty customers. 

Any goals I had for life are completely crushed and unachievable now. 

I don't know who else to talk to anymore. I don't know what to do anymore. So I'm just going to post here in the desperate attempt to hope someone replies with something that makes me feel a little better.
