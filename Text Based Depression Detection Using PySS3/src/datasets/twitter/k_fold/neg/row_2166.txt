Accepting my FateSo.. I think Iâ€™ve been depressed for 3 years now and this summer has been the worst. I finally found my happiness but, she wanted to go separate ways. Being alone is something to get used to and definitely hard. My sister and her were bffs and now the bond has been broke. I think Iâ€™m going to accept my fate by fixing what I broke up and then ending everything because I donâ€™t see a point of living anymore.
