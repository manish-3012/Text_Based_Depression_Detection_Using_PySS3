I feel like a disappointment..Iâ€™m 18 and my family thinks Iâ€™m a piece of crap whoâ€™s never going to work despite me trying to get a job Iâ€™m capable of doing. They think Iâ€™m just going to live off of them for the rest of my life. Theyâ€™re not the only ones who think this either. Plenty of others do as well including some of my friends. I donâ€™t feel like living anymore. I feel like itâ€™s pointless and the best decision for me would be to end my life while Iâ€™m young so Iâ€™ll at least have all those good childhood memories and great memories of high school.
