I tried hanging myself today and I just overdosed on some sleeping pillsIf your reading this I may already be gone. Hereâ€™s some of my last words before I go. 


I fucking hate this world and all of its bullshit. Iâ€™m tired of all of it. Iâ€™m done getting made fun of for my depression my clothes my looks and the cuts on my arm. Nobody fucking cares about me, not even my friends, all they do is talk shit about me and my interests, Iâ€™m failing in school and my teachers hate me. I know Iâ€™ll never get the job I wanted and Iâ€™m just gonna be some dirty hobo on the street begging for money to get something to eat, thereâ€™s really no meaning for life, Iâ€™ll never find happiness and if I do it goes away and Iâ€™m back to this, nothing fucking works no mental hospitals, no therapy, no anime, no video games nothing fucking works. Iâ€™m a lowly stupid insignificant human that canâ€™t do anything right.

Goodbye Reddit, and everyone on here I hope everyone gets through it
