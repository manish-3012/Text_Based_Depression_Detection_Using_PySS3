I think about suicide every day.Title, but every time I do I think about my children and cry. I'm really struggling to carry on. Split up with my wife, still see the children, they are great but obviously challenging, 2 and 7 years old. I can't carry on as I am, and I don't know how to change. 

I have a good job, family close by, all the things you would think help, its just impossible. Things only seem to get worse.
