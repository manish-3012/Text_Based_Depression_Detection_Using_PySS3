I'm maybe 15 feet away from the woman I love.The love of my life is asleep on her couch only 15 feet away from me, and I'm sitting on the kitchen floor thinking of ways to kill myself. I cant take it. I love her so much, and I know she doesn't feel the way I do. And I get it. I wouldn't either. I'm a mess. I've let myself go. I've given up. I'm lazy. I'm just a piece of shit. Maybe if I finally do myself we can both move on and get some peace.
