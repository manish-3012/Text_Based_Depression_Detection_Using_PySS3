I never got the chance to be normalNo point in going on anymore I never got the chance to look like a normal teenage boy and Iâ€™m not even gonna look like a normal adult. Ever since I was a kid I was the shortest kid in my class and that continued on and on and on. Then middle school I was taller than some of the girls but from there I was no longer the shortest in my class but became the shortest of the boys in my school not to mention but I was fat too. High School came I accepted my height and stopped caring but I was never thin like most of the guys in my school and I felt extremely behind senior year hit and everyone became fit while some got fat but nonetheless I decided to get serious and am not average weight for my height but I still have love handles and a bit wide instead of being thin and tall like the normal kids. I feel so behind so many of these kids already look like fathers, Male Models, ducks even body builders hell even a lot of the younger kids look more mature than me. Iâ€™m currently struggling to get skinny so I can be normal but it sucks I never got to be a normal kid, teen, not even normal adult I look like a 14 year old boy still average weight with fat on my body instead of thin Never got a normal friend group because of how fucking biased each one was. It sucks that I will never be normal or even have a label to call my own. Why the fuck should I live if i donâ€™t even belong anywhere physically and socially I hope I die tomorrow by getting hit by a car or I hope I get in a car crash. Unfitting trash like me should be gotten rid off not taking up space for the people who deserve and I donâ€™t deserve any of it.
