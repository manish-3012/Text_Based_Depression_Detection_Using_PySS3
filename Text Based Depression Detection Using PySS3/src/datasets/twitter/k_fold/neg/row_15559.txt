I want to end it and I donâ€™t know why..I want to end my life and I feel like I donâ€™t know why. I donâ€™t understand why I feel this way. I have a decent life at the moment. Iâ€™m in the Army currently and itâ€™s pretty cool. I feel like my emotions are disconnected. Like Iâ€™m so desensitized from everything. My head doesnâ€™t work, idk how to describe it. I just donâ€™t feel normal. I know like â€œoh thereâ€™s no such thing as normalâ€ but this is different. I donâ€™t feel like my head is in the same place as everyone elseâ€™s. I process things weird, my emotions donâ€™t work. Iâ€™ve never had a good grasp on how emotions work. I donâ€™t know how to feel in certain situations. I donâ€™t feel empathy like a normal person, I have to pretend to be happy but Iâ€™m not like sad or anything I just feel, like, empty or something. I just think Iâ€™m lonely, here I am surrounded by people in the service but I just feel so alone, like Iâ€™m drowning in the ocean by myself. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m normal and I hate it, I hate the way I am. I could explain my whole life story on here about why Iâ€™m not normal anymore all the shit thatâ€™s gone down in my life but it doesnâ€™t even matter. Iâ€™m not gonna annoy you all with it or bother you with it. I donâ€™t even really know why Iâ€™m posting here. Itâ€™s probably just for attention so Iâ€™m sorry. You donâ€™t have to waste time on replying to me. Iâ€™m gonna try to sleep I guess.
