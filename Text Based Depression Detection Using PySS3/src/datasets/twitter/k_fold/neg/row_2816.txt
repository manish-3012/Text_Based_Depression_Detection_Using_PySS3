They're better off without me.My mum would have one less mouth to feed. One less person to spend money on. One less kid to worry about. She'd have a bedroom, not sleeping on the sofa to provide rooms for her kids. It'd be so much easier for my dad to ignore me when I don't exist anymore. My sister never liked me. My stepmum already hates me. My grandpa would have more time with my grandma, she's got Alzheimer's, and all the time he spends with me is time he could spend with her. They might miss me for a bit, but in the long run it's just easier if I don't exist.
