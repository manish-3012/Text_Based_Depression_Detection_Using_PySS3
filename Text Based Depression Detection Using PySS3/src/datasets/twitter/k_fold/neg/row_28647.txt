I donâ€™t care anymoreOut of the blue my bf of 4 years who I thought was going to propose this summer broke up with me on tuesday. I did everything right, went to therapy, got sober etc. the fact that the person who told me they loved me and promised theyâ€™d never leave could just make a decision like that out of the blue makes me realize this isnâ€™t a place I want to be anymore. I was just starting to let my guard down and trust people again. Thats ruined now. I just bought a bottle of Jameson for the first time in over 2 years. Hope it kills me
