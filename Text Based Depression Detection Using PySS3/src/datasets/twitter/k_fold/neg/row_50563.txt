How can I make it easier on the people after I'm gone.Trying to make a list and determine what will make it easier on people. So far I've been cleaning out my apartment so it won't be a mess and there is less for my family to go through. I'm also taking down notes on the things I have that are valuable so they know they know what not to just give away. Planning to make some kind of note to apologize for the inconvenience. But I'm on the fence for what to do about my job I have a couple of stuff that I would feel bad about being delayed until the news makes it back to them but not sure what I should say to get it shifted over to someone else.
