Physician heal thyself...First off, I work in healthcare and itâ€™s reached the peak for me at the start of the new year. All the naive has been beat from me. Nothing is going to get better about this system. I came in with ideals and self preservation in mind.
I can help people and save lives, maybe even spark change, and I will have a solid skill set so that I am able to leverage my job as needed. 

Iâ€™m the squeaky wheel. The squeaky wheel gets beaten into shape or drowned in oil until it stays quiet for ages knowing the price of making noise. 

It got to me little by little. And my counselor reminds me that this job doesnâ€™t define me and I need to be more than just my career when I think of my whole identity. Thatâ€™s the absurd thing - our careers have bred us to be the job, to give our all to the job, because not everyone can do the job - just we few. And fewer hold on long term. 

And thatâ€™s partially why. We keep reverting back to our weak human forms despite the bumps, injections and reindoctrinations of our God like ability and ego and hubris.  

I am a failure. I can only fight against this by truly letting go and it hurts so bad. And the cure is not living day after day denying and downplaying. I just want to end things because I canâ€™t take another psychological war fare because I stand up to the powers that be and cry foul. I do it to protect my life and patients alike.  And my coworkers would rather sell me as sacrifice than pitch in and help. 

I cant fix myself. I canâ€™t fight the dark in me any longer. I just want to be at peace.
