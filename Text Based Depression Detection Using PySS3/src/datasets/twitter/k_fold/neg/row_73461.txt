How does anyone have a vision of their future that doesn't end in suicide?All I can think is I'll never be happy enough or be able to make enough money to have a good life. So I'll kill myself before I get to retirement age.

And if suicide is my retirement plan, why waste all this time, why not just do it now?

I have a hard time understanding how anyone with basic reasoning abilities doesn't come to the conclusion that the best thing they can do, sooner or later, is fucking end it.
