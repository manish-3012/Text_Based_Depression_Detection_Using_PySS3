20 years just feel too much of a failure.I'll be 20 in March and I've been depressed for so long rn that I don't even recall if I've ever been sane. I'm in a relationship for 2 years now but we've loved each other since 2015. And in other lives, if you believe it. We are both suicidal constantly and we almost suicided together last month. 

I'm just so tired. For 3 years I told myself "one more day, you just need one more day and you will be ok" each and every day. Until I stopped. Because I never became ok. And now I just want to die. Again. There is sertraline enough in my closet to dope an army. And other medicaments too. 

I have no more in life to wait for. I'm a disappointment for everyone around me. Even for myself. There is nothing I value right now. Nothing I hold dear. And I just want to end it. 

There is a death letter I wrote this year, after a good friend of mine died of natural causes, out of nowhere, 5 days after her 21st birthday. I feel like I should send it. It is not a suicide letter but I don't want to leave without letting people know that I loved them so much. And there's no way of letting them know without ir seeming like a goodbye letter.
