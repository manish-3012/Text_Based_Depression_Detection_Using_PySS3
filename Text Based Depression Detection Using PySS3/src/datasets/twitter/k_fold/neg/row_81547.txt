Just confused so gonna take a shot in the dark. Have a good day everybody.I dont think i am depressed i am a 22 year old male, im alright for money and women seem to like me when i actually wake up enough but i cant connect to anybody ive never been able too and i havent had friends for about 5-6 years now. I feel like i dont enjoy anything to the point where if i dont put on a show for people i will suck any life out of the situation so i really feel like i have no identity and im just waking up reacting and going to sleep instead of living a life. I have talked to psychotherapists and a psychiatrist but the only thing to ever come up is suggestions for anger management but i have told them that although ive never wanted to end it all it is just looking like the better option as time goes on and as of late it has been in my head everyday and is just adding up and making sense now,as in i dont feel any pain but im never gonna feel happiness either i cant imagine anything that i would look forward to, the only thing i care about is the thought of it braking my dad and imagining his pain if i did do anything which isnt the healthiest coping strategy i guess. If anyone thinks they have a good idea for me or just wants someone to vent to lmk
