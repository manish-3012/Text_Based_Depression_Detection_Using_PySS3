Scared to speak up.I like talking to people about my problems, it lifts a massive weight, but anymore I'm just too scared to tell anyone how I feel. I've been abandoned too many times I just feel like I don't have the abikity to trust anyone anymore. So instead of saying anything to anyone I just lay in bed all day internslly crying. It's so hard for me to move and do anything anymore. I just feel like Im empty space. 

I feel like I've honestly hit a new low being 1 month with no reliable friends. I just don't see the point to any of this. I try to meet new people in my city but nothing has worked. All the dating apps are about useless and trying to meet people through facebook or instagram is difficult without appearing weird or creepy. 

Is it weird that i just want to have a friend that will let me cry into their shoulder and embrace me? Honestly I'm just so depressed I cant even move. Not even to consider suicide. 20th street overpass sounds really nice, but it's just too much effort to get up and walk from upwards of 12 blocks and then climb the massive slope just to get to the top of the overpass. 

I'm honestly too much of a fuck up to care about anything anyways.
