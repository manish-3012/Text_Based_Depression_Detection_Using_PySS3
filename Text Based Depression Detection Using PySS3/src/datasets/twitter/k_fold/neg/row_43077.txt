Anger and Self-HatredI have so much anger, but nowhere to channel it. Sometimes I wish I could just bash my broken skull against a brick wall so my family wouldn't have to suffer my incompetence and dickwad personality any longer. Not like I can care enough about my life to improve long-term.

Fuck this. Fuck everything. I should be violently killed.
