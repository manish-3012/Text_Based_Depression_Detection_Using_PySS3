i feel so lonelyI have no friends i ruined all of my friendships and all i have is my girlfriend who's honestly great but im ruining my relationship with her because im just negative and sad all the time. i am always sad and i almost have no motivation to do anything ever. the only time i feel genuinely happy is when im with my girlfriend and when we're not talking and on bad terms my depression just amplifies and its honestly horrible. its pathetic i cant find happiness in myself and i need another person to make me happy and its really embarrassing and i just feel like im good for nothing. ive been sitting home all day on a friday listening to lil peep and crying and i just want to fucking die. i was depressed my freshmen and sophomore year and then when i met her everything turned around and was great, but now i'm just becoming my old self again. im about to be 18 and college is in less than a year and im just a useless, sad and angry fucking loser. im too nervous and anxious to try and meet new people and once i lose my girlfriend i dont know what im going to do, ive been with her for 8 months and known her for a couple of years. i never have anyone to talk to other than my girlfriend and im too embarrassed to go to my family about things so im contemplating just using drugs to make me feel better until im old enough to move out and just blow my fucking head off wherever i live on my own.
