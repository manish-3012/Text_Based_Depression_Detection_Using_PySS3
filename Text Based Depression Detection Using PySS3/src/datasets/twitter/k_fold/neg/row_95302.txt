I deserve it all, it's time to act.I deserve the bleeding, the pain, the illness bot physical and mental. I deserve my isolation and suffering. I deserve it all yet I can't take anymore. I'm a sick mind in a sick body with no more options, no more ways to be helped. I was destined to fail from the very beginning. I think I'm finally going to set my plan in motion to kill myself. Starting tonight. This is the last place I will shout my thoughts into the void because telling people I know about them does nothing, and thus I've disconnected from everyone I know. I will enact such an awful, unhappy lifestyle onto myself. I deserve it all.
