Here I go again. Expectations are a bitch, I'll tell you that.Just got my grades for the midterm and it fucking sucked. This is my third times repeating the first year of college. I'm a fuck-up, no other way to look at it.

I've written down reasons for myself on why killing myself soon is better than trying to slog through life:

- I won't let people down anymore, won't be disappointing elders and friends. Everyone thinks I'm smart and have what it takes, but fuck that. I've been stuck in the same level of college for so long. All my high school classmates are going to be seniors next year. And here I am, stuck in first year. People will always know me as that guy who got left behind. When I was still in high school and middle school, I was an honor student. But look at me now. I'm a fucking good for nothing stupid guy. 

- I won't be wasting my parents time and money on me anymore. I feel like staying alive is just a waste to their money, sorry for all the money they've spent on me this far. I'm a good for nothing. People have been trying to help me and I don't really appreciate what they do for me. I mean, I accept what they're doing for me but what does it even matter. Fuck. 

Maybe killing myself I really the way to go. People won't expect anything of me anymore. And don't say it gets better, that's what people expect been telling me for sometime but no r what I'll always be a fuck up and you can't change that. I don't know if I can even change myself. Expectations are a bitch I'll tell you that.
