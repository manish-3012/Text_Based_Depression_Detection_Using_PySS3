Today's My BirthdayToday's My Birthday. It doesn't feel special.

I'm an alcoholic, I know that. I'm drunk anyway.

I'm trying hard not to die. It seems pretty close despite my feeble attempts at distraction and distance. I'm on that dangerous edge of ambivalence and weakened inhibition. I can recognize all of this in both curiosity and horror.

The only answer is to go to bed. I will flee toward sleep, and hope that I get there before the gun goes off. And in the morning, I need to get to the gym before I can start thinking. That means 0400. That's the only place where I can hurt myself and no one thinks twice. I will try to burn this madness out of my veins... Or at least exhaust myself so that I don't have the energy for anything else.

Happy Birthday to me

Yeah. Whatever.

I kinda hope I don't wake up tomorrow.

I'll probably be disappointed
