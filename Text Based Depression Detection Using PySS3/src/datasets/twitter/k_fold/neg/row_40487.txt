StuckI feel so stuck with my whole life right now. Like I can't do anything, everything I want to do isn't fun to do anymore, and the people I cared about and who were suppost to care about me left. I've been thinking about ending it for a while and now I'm thinking about going out with many others. Like if I'm going to do it might as well get recognised for it. But I might just end it tomarrow or something. Maybe tonight depends how the night goes.
