I don't know how to feelOne of my family members committed suicide. All I can think about is how my future will probably be exactly like hers. I've been depressed and suicidal for as long as I can remember. All I can see is my life ending the same way. She was only a few years older than me. It's always  been hard for me to even imagine making it that long.
