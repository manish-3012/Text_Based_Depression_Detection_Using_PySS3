It hurtsWhat do you do when the only thing you're able to do is fuck up in life?  You go to bed hoping that tonight is the night you don't wake up,  you begin to sleep away both days and nights...  I've always been the odd one out,  always that spare.   I've never been able to feel close to anyone.   I always feel like people treat me as a disease,  always avoided and forgotten. I try to be nice and help and cheer up who I can but I always have this feeling and its hurts so much.   I've spent the past 4 years in pain at this point i just want to end it all...it would be so much better.
