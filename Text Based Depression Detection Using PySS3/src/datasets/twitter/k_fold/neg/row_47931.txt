Emptiness and the yearning of deathIâ€™m currently on a vacation but on this vacation it made me realize even more why I want to die. Iâ€™m unlovable, a terrible person, and so much more. Iâ€™m only 17 so I donâ€™t have access to much stuff but I made a promise to myself that I would kill myself as soon as I could get a gun. I have no friends, my family doesnâ€™t care about me, I waste resources. Whatâ€™s the point anymore?
