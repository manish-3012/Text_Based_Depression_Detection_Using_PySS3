I don't care anymoreHi, so long story short. Just a 24 year old guy with no purpose and without any will to live.  Everything is so wicked that I can't see any meaning of life anymore. Just making one mistake after another without caring about it because I know, that I won't live so long. Just waiting for getting hit by a truck or any other accident because killing myself would make my "family" sad or something like that. Without any friends (i tried to connect but without any luck) So just living without caring and everyday it is harder and harder to carry on. I know that everything bad I make, is just only my mistake but I don't see any reason to change.  I dont't have any future plans so I just drift in a life and waiting for a change probably or death. So I am just another stupid jerk who can't get his life together. I am just fed up. Thanks for a reading this and spending your time because I had to get it off my chest. Cheers!
