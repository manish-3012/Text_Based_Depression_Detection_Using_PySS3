Being lonely in college while everyone around you is having fun kills me.I hate that itâ€™s the weekend and everyone is out doing fun things while Iâ€™m just sitting in my dorm pondering why Iâ€™m retarded sometimes, and why Iâ€™m not seen by anyone else due to my crippling social anxiety. Itâ€™s not like I donâ€™t have friends, but Iâ€™m never their first thing on their mind. I feel like people hate me silently, and I donâ€™t even know why as I havenâ€™t done anything to them. I get left on read constantly, and no one texts me first ever asking me how I feel, even though I do the same to them. I donâ€™t feel like ending it, but I think about the sweet release sometimes and that when Iâ€™m found dead, maybe the people that ignored me would acknowledge me one last time and how theyâ€™ll say â€œhe didnâ€™t seem like the typeâ€, or â€œhe was the sweetest personâ€. Like, why donâ€™t people tell me those things before Iâ€™m dead? People are cruel, and I wish I could tell someone, but due to societies rules, if I ever told anyone how I truly felt, Iâ€™ll probably never be looked at the same, so I sit here in silence, suffering in silence. That is all I had to say.
