My thoughts are haunting meIn the past, I've done some things I am not too proud of. I've hurt and manipulated others (don't really want to go into details), and struggle with these memories everyday.

I am currently a University student and I think this problem is getting pretty severe. No matter where I go or what I do these memories are always hurting me. They make me say things like "stop, shut up, go away" sometimes even vocally. Then I have to look around to see if anyone heard.

I've seen a therapist before, but it was for anxiety. Every time I almost brought up one of these memories to talk about, I got scared and held it back. I guess I'm a little bit worried of getting in trouble and maybe also I just don't want anyone to think badly of me.

I think I am a bad person. Though, recently I've started to work out more and focus on my studies hoping I might start thinking better of myself. But these thoughts are still there.

I had a test at school a couple days ago, I had to walk out of the room before I was finished because i was so scared and had to be alone.

I'm not sure what to do, I want to hang myself.
