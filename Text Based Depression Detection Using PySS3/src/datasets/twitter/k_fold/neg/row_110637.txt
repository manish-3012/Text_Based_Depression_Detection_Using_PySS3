My brain sucksIt served me very well when it came to career and job performance. But when it comes to relationships and self evaluation it tortures me tremendously. I feel that I treat anyone better than I treat myself and I can't get to liking or loving myself. No matter how well I do it seems that I could've done better. When anything fails I blame myself for not noticing that earlier or navigating the issue differently even when it wasn't my fault. Im depressed but highly functional. I feel like an imposter putting on a show and deep down I feel everything has no meaning and life is pointless. Thought repetitively about ending it but then blame myself again for being such a coward and not being able to face life head on. I just hate all these torturing thoughts and wish I could shut them down, or just silence it completely.
