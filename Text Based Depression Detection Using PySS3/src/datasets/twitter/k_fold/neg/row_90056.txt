Im 16 and I'm starting to drink on a daily basis to cope with suicidal feelingsMy mom is almost never home in week days and my brother beats me up. He has broke my hand, made me bleed a lot, and has me full of bruises. 

I'm a fucking liar and I'm too afraid to tell anyone my situation. When I told my mom about the violence, she put the blame on me. My mom's boyfriend is cruel to me, and sometimes kinda a pedo, but they normalize the situation.

All this, not to mention bullying. Going to school is fucking hell.
So, since (approx) a month ago, I drink half a glass of gin with coke every single day, so I get a bit calmer and happy. No one notices I'm a bit "drunk". 

This is fucking up my life, my studies and my mind. 

If I was suicidal before, imagine now. Some day I'll get too drunk and do it, and I know it.
