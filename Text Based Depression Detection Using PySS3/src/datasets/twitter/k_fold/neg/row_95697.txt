What do you believe in?Are you religious, atheist, agnostic? What do you think there is after this life?
I believe in reincarnation. Seeing it from a logic point of view, it doesn't matter what kind of person you're now to determine what kind of life you'll have, because no one decides what kind of person wants to be. However, i believe the world tends to be a little 'gooder' with time, so chances to have a good life improve. I hope my logic is a fail and there's happiness and rainbows for everyone lol.
