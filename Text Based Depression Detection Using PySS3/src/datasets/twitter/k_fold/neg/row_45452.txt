Incredibly funny thing happened during the last days. A week ago I was almost as happy as in my childhood and now I unwillingly planing how I will commit suicide https://imgur.com/nDSRjn7 

The chart above shows interesting thing. During this month nothing changed or happened but this mood swings... aren't they funny? Yesterday I was motivated to conquer my life and today I'm ready to leave it. Unfortunately my grandfather has already committed suicide and I know how sad would be my relatives, so my conscience doesn't allow me to repeat it.

P.S. I don't know if the link shows the picture correctly. Comment if it doesn't pls
