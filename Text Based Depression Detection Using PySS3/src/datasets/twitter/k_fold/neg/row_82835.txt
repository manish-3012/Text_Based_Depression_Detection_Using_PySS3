HelpOkay so background. Diagnosed with depression since freshman year of high school. Diagnosed with bipolar depression a couple of years ago. Iâ€™ve been through the ringer to find an antidepressant that works. Finally found one but super expensive. But got it anyways. Went to therapy for a long time. Basically thought I was getting better. Decided to stop therapy and medicine because I wanted to see how I would do on my own. For the most part Iâ€™ve still been improving with just a couple of steps backwards. I have a history of self harm and itâ€™s basically my only comfort/coping mechanism when Iâ€™m in my bipolar depressed episode. Iâ€™ve been under A LOT of stress lately and kind of snapped. I have since cut myself five times in the last 48 hours and seriously thought about ending it all. I have a good family (mom, dad, brothers) I have a healthy romantic relationship (boyfriend is basically a saint) but I still want to end my life. Iâ€™m at my wits end. Help.
