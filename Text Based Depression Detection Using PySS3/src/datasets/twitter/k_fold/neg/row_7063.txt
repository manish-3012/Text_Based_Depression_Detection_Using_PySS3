I tried following my dreams and it's making me depressedI gave up everything so I could follow my dreams. I gave up all the things I was good at, left my job, decided not to go to college blah blah blah just so I could follow my childhood dream of being an athlete. I've waited over 10 years for this. I just want to fucking do it. I want the resources, the practice time. I want to be an athlete all the time but I'm lucky if I get to practice 3 hours a week. Everything is getting in my way. I'm fucking done with it. You don't wait 10 years to follow your dreams just to get stopped in your tracks by a bunch of stupid shit. Every time I push up against it it's not use I don't get anywhere. I'm stuck. I'm stuck on 3 hours a week, crappy equipment and my own fucking lack of talent. I just want to fall over and die. I'm so done.
