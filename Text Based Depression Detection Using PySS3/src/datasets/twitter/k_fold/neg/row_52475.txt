It's time.Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it...I have no idea why. Fear of death? I don't think so. Fear of missing out on certain experiences? I have already missed out on so much, so no. I don't think I was ready yet. Not until now. 

I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side, not sure what will happen once I post this. I could die, or the attempt could fail....but it all doesn't matter to me. The risk is worth the reward. I am not giving myself anymore chances, and I am not going to make any excuses anymore, I am going to shoot myself. 

 I don't think I will delete this account - I want people to see what true failure is. Every other account is gone, deleted. I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone. Too late to turn back now! 

To the people who tried to help - thank you. I personally believe you should've never given me your time, but thanks. I hope you guys live long, successful lives. I hope you don't make mistakes like me. 

Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances. I know after I am done doing what I need to do, I won't have anymore chances. I have ran out of chances. 

Goodbye.
