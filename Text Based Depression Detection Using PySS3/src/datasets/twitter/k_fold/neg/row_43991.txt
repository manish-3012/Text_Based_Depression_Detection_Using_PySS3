Forced to get help, feel more suicidal...Parents forced me to go out to an appointment to get my cut's checked out.Put in the most awkward interview of my life, nurse was asking shit like " *how often do you do this?* " and " *do you feel suicidal?* " Obviously i had lied or falsified information as i could see my dad being visibly upset whilst i was there trying to contain my laughter.

Honestly the funniest thing i've experienced in years, a nurse being all serious in a concerning tone asking " Do YoU WaNt To DiE? " I don't know why it was so humorous to me but after feeling suicidal for half a decade,writing countless suicide note's and failing multiple attempts it just made me laugh. My answer was no for suicidal tendencies btw.

Long story short, im left feeling the void even more than before and i just want to die so badly.I dont want help, i just want to die that's all. Probably going to kill myself before reviving bullshit like anti depressent's and benzo's. Want to do more acid first.
