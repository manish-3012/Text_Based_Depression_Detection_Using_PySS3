This climate is unsustainableIt feels like I have been under a long, exhausting panic attack for the past year or so. To the point where suicide feels like the only solution to calm the fuck down.

Last year, I ended up in psych ward because my stress blew up. I was 100&amp;#37; sure I was going to die in WW3 the week after. It would be like this every. single. fucking. week. for the past year. I would only get respite during weekends somehow but nonetheless, this was the recurrent theme. I got stuck on this 24/7 news cycle that I used for helping me rationalize that it would not happen. Unfortunately, I seem to have attained a point where this cycle just feeds my anxiety and panics. 

Started to see some help last year, it's not helping much. It makes me feel more...misunderstood afterwards? I'm told to "simply stop looking at it" and "nothing is going to happen" even though it completely feels like the opposite. I feel like I must be aware of what's going on for some reason. People around me don't know what to tell me at that point. Gf stopped listening to me, which makes me keep these internal thoughts and they just feedback on itself.

Pills apparently did an effect on me but it doesn't feel like it now. I feel more helpless than ever.

Seriously. suicide seems more and more like an option these days. The main reason why is that, at least, I would get some fucking control over my life for once.
