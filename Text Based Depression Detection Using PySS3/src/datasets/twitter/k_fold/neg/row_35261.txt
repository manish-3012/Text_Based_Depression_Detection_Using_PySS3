This quarantine is just making me more depressedIâ€™m a high schooler in California and the governor just announced that schools are extremely likely to be out until the next school year in August. This sounds like a good thing but Iâ€™m really dreading it.

Iâ€™ve always hated how little motivation I have to do anything, and this quarantine solidifies it. Iâ€™ve set aside the entire last couple of days to do homework, and Iâ€™ve so far done none of it. Iâ€™ve turned off my phone and sat in front of my computer, but I end up just staring at the wall for half an hour. It isnâ€™t helped by the fact that weâ€™re getting all the schoolwork we were supposed to be doing on top of the homework. Thatâ€™s about six hours a day, every day, that Iâ€™m not doing.

But I canâ€™t do anything else either. I just sit around browsing reddit all day and I canâ€™t stop. Hell, I donâ€™t even have the motivation to switch between apps. Iâ€™ve been meaning to watch YouTube for like two hours. It took about a half an hour before I was finally able to get the motivation to write this stupid thing. Even when the quarantine is over the problem will still remain. Iâ€™m not motivated enough to plan things, or design things, or have fun, or do anything. If Iâ€™m not doing anything, why the hell am I still alive?
