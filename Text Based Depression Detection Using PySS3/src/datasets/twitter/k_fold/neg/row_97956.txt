Add an interesting title to your suicidal thoughtsPlanning on killing myself the 18. Im already on a therapyst and taking antidepresives, but I cant endure all the mess my life is. 

Been isolated without real friends for more than 7 years. The only person on my family that I cared for, my father, died long ago. 20 years with no studies or ambitions. Recently breaked up with my gf, longdistance relationship. She was the only person on my life making me feel happy and wanting to keep alive. The only thing ive been doing for months now is watch sarcastic memes and playing vydia 24/7 on my room while having breakdowns and selfharming me.

The idea of killing me scares me, but living more with this pain n apathy its not worth it. I dont want to continue, i dont find anything worth living for.

And...srry for the bad english i guess...
