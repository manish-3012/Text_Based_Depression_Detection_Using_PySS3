Shit has been bad, but Im not gonna kill myselfI live in Hong Kong and there's been protests against the Chinese tyranny for almost 4 months.
The way government use the police force to brutally suppress the protesters is so heartbreaking that I lose 4kg and had so many sleepless nights in these months just like some of the other HK people do. My heart aches for the protesters that are beaten or those who might already been killed by the police, and also some people who suicide because they could stand the government anymore. Tbh sometimes when I cant see hope for how things are gonna turn out, bad thoughts just creep up.

We have a slogan which means "We cannot lose anyone anymore" and it has motivated me to carry on since day 1 of protesting and I wish I could share this to all y'all out there who was thinking about ending yourself. Please remember that no matter how bad things are for you, you are NOT ALONE. Always look for help whenever you feel like youre drowning in sadness cuz eventually someone would care for you and understand your pain. Dont isolate yourself, take care.
