I don't have a gun so I think I'll spend just a last $110 or so on this shit to put a 9mm through my headhttps://www.cheaperthandirt.com/altor-pistol-9mm-single-shot-handgun/FC-787394000228.html


This is what I'm talking about. Single shot is good enough, if aimed properly a single 9mm round is more than enough. Don't care about the specifics, just know that I need to stop living as soon as possible.


This is an easy way to make that happen.
