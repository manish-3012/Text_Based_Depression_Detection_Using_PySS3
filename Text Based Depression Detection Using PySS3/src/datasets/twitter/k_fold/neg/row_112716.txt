i wanna die, i dont know what to do to get better

i honestly have no opinion on where to put this, but this subreddit seems somewhat appropriate i guess. im at the point in my life where i once again want to die, but i in all honesty dont know what to do. im pretty young(only a teenager) and suicide has been on my mind for many years. ive made plans to do it multiple times but i always get to scared the last second. i dont feel like i can open up to anyone about it, mainly due to the fact that when i did open up this person told me "youre white, you cant have problems". im too scared to ask my parents for therapy and there is someone i really want to open up to but im too scared if theyre going to be like the last person i told or if theyre going to tell someone. i would like to ask for therapy but in all honesty, i dont know if my parents would believe me about me wanting to die and i dont want to cause them even more stress. i honestly dont think ill be able to ask without breaking down or if ill be able to ask at all. i am absolutely terrified of telling my parents.

onto why im asking for advice on what to do. i want to die again, and its just getting worse. i keep having thoughts about killing myself daily now, and i just want it all to end. the thing is, when im thinking straight, i dont want to die. it would make that a few people sad, and i would do anything in the world from making those people sad. i want to live a long and fulfilled life, but i just dont know if ill able to handle life any longer. i dont think ill be able to decide on my own what to do, and i know if i do make a decision i wont follow through on it without someone expecting me to actually follw that decision. so im asking, should i tell this person about my thoughts and/or should i ask for therapy or are there any alternatives?
