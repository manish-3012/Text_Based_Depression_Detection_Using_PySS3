I want a will to livePeople need to understand the difference between wanting to live and having a reason to keep you from dying.

I'm sick of having to remind myself that "your mom will be sad" "your friends will be sad" "all their efforts will go to waste" "you'll bring bad reputation to your school"

these don't matter after I die anyway right I personally wouldn't care. I can't see their pained expressions I wouldn't know.

Where to people find the motivation to wake up early and "live each day to the fullest" what are they working towards I need to know. I'm so tired of dragging myself to the next day, doing the bare minimum then having a mental breakdown on how I'm falling so so far behind. 

At this point I don't care how bright my future could be even if its "just another 6 years" I don't want to live like this.
