Things really would be better for everyone else if I wasn't around.In a general sense, there would be more food for other people. A couple more jobs. More gasoline for others. Just more resources in general.

My siblings could have my car. My parents won't have to worry about me anymore. I wouldn't be screwing anything up for my employers anymore. 

I just have no value. I'm not pleasant to look at. I'm not smart enough to be dependable. I can't be a shoulder to cry on, not that I'd want to be. I can't be anything for anyone, nor can I really be anything for myself. I'm just not competent. 

I just don't have the energy to go on anymore. My whole life is just humiliating. I am and will always be the fool. The idiot. Can't learn from his mistakes if he doesn't remember them. Not smart enough to keep up whenever a curve ball is thrown or a wrench is thrown into the system. 

 I just can't stand the humiliation of my life. Every day I prove to others I can't be trusted. How am I supposed to prove them otherwise when I can't even prove it to myself? I am incompetent. I try so hard to not be and yet I still am. I am literally a walking joke of a person, but it's not funny. I'll never have anything to be proud of. I'll never have anything I can't just hang my hat on. Not even the smallest thing. I've never been useful enough to anyone. I am nothing. I'm so tired. I just can't keep facing people. I just can't do it. It hurts to look anyone in the face anymore.

 It hurts to see anyone and have them see me, to have to face them as my incompetent self. I can't keep pretending like I'm not. It just results in even more humiliation whenever I muster self respect and then fall flat on my moronic face. The only thing for me now is death. I have never been good enough, nor will I ever be. I will never be smart. I will never be good enough. I just want to crash my car into a tree.
