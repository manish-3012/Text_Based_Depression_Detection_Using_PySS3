I worryI would like to leave a suicide note but I worry that even that wouldn't be good enough how silly does that sound I'm worried about a few sentences on a bit of paper will not be enough for my family. 
I worry about how I will look after I'm dead again very stupid I know but I do want to look decent for whoever finds me. I worry that my house won't be spotless for when the people come and take me away in a body bag again how ridiculous I'm worrying about what some strangers will think of my housework while they carry me away... 
I worry that my last cup of tea won't be sweet enough and my last bath will not be hot enough I worry about alot of stuff I've always been that way since I as far back as I can remember. I've never felt wanted or accepted by anyone I was never good enough. I am one of those people who worry about what others think of them. Do you know how much I struggle to relax and chill out. My head is forever going over my past I have such a good memory I can tell you who was wearing what and what time it was and what we had for dinner that day for loads memories good and bad. 
I hate being so sensitive I grew up in a house of women hormones bloody everywhere I shared a room with my sister only one year between us we would argue about the light being on/off we would argue over sharing clothes, make up, books... I could hold my own in argument but not anymore even hearing people arguing I cry I know again how stupid I sound but I can't handle it. 
I know it's from being in a manipulative abusive and violent relationship for so many years I know this may sound odd but I think the damage is only really coming out this past year since we split up I'm such a wreck now I hate myself so much without sounding like a right selfish cow this Friday couldn't come quick enough I've had enough of this and these pains.
