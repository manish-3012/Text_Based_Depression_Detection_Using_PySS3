Im going to kill myself next morning.Im going to stay home from school and then do it. I have no friends anymore because i have depression and they hold it against me. My parents don't understand me and yell at me and pushed me to start cutting again after i stopped and ive been on medication and it hasnt helped. My own dad yells at me saying things like "i didnt cause problems like these to my parents" and just make me feel shittier then i already do about myself. Im so tired of this and i want it all to end everyone had their chance to say or do something different but noone changes noone cares. Bye guys
