Tried to help here, only made things worse for everyone. Even this subreddit is better off without me. Even when I try to help, i hurt others. The world will be good when i am dead. I'm psychotic and violent anyway, so it's best for the species.And on top of that, i'm a budding psychopath. The part of me that tries not to hurt people is dying, and I don't care enough to get help or not hurt others.

Another month or two, and i'm going to end up having stolen, raped, abused, or killed people for the fun of it. The people in my little world will wish i had never been born.

I'm tired to trying to help people. I know this makes me a horrible person, to look at starving people and think "That's sucks for you. Gonna go grab a burger now." and to just feel *absolutely no empathy*, but that's what I am. I'm evil, sick, horrible, and deranged, but i'm smart enough to hurt people and get away with it.

Everyone is better without me? Best to kill myself soon then. i'm an evolutionary mistake, and i'd best remove myself from the gene pool. While there's still some tiny piece of conscience left in my head.I wish I had been aborted as a baby. 

Be hoenst. If you knew someone was guaranteed to have have a psychotic break, and that they would never seek treatment because they enjoyed torturing others, but knew that you could (1) have them suicide now before they stole, raped, or ruined your life, or (2) let them, and then give them death penalty, any sane person would choose #1.

I wish i had been aborted as a child. My life has no purpose, and giving it one has no purpose either. Death is the only relief. I wish i never had been born.
