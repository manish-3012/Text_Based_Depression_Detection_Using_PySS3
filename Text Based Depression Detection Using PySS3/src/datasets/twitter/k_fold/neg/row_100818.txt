hope?I don't want to carry on. It isn't that I don't see a future for myself, it's that my expectations of my future are going to be crushed like they've always been. I'm tired of chronic pain and being told I'm going to grow out of daily seizures because they can't find a cause. I've talked to my mom about going back to therapy but since she works in mental health she insists that I'm fine. I was on prozac for anxiety potential bpd but because my doctors mixed the wrong medications I'm off of it. I've dealt with suicidal thoughts but I've just wound up with dangerous coping mechanisms and a victim of child pornography. I realize is selfish but i dont think i can keep going anymore without hurting others or making anymore stupid decisions.
