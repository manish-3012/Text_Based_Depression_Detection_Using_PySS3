If nothing I do is good enough than why should I stayNothing I do is good enough for society. I was valedictorian. I'm a performing musician. I got accepted into college. But apparently that doesnt make me worthy of anyone's time so you know what? I'm done. I'm giving up. I'm not putting on more second into trying to please anyone. If no one wants me here or cares if I'm gone, I'm just gonna leave.
