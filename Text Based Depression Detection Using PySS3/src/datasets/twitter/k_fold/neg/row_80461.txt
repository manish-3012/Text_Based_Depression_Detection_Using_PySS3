I'm back again.Not particularly going to do anything but I think about it a lot. For the past few months I've had my ocd get worse. Mostly stress I think. Besides physical compulsions, I obsessively worry about my fears and it gives me stomach pain and lightheaded feelings. The fears don't feel invalid and they don't feel rare or random but I'm too scared to talk about them. I see reminders everywhere. I know it's just me focusing on them but still. The overwhelming thoughts are killing me. It hurts because things aren't even too bad right now and were worse before but I can't focus on the good no matter what I try. I don't think I want to die. But I feel like most of my life right now is fears and obligations. It's not very splendid.
