I feel like my life is a spider web in a hurricaneHolding, just by the strings of the web, barely. So beautiful (the web design) and crazy, destruction everywhere, but the web is holding still. Such a mess. But still barely in order. Just enough. Just hope the web can be sustained for a while...any moment i feel something big can mess it up. But it would have to be just big enough. Im stable, but a little unstable too. I still think about death a lot. Just keeping it in mind.
