ExamsSo I have my final year college exams starting in 3 days, and I literally (in the most literal sense of the word) have not looked at a book for the entire year. It's inevitable I will fail, and my life is going to fall apart soon after. It all hit me today when I realised I had a book overdue for the past two weeks and have racked up an incrediblely large overdue fine that I can't pay and I've been on the verge of tears ever since.

I know this sounds like some petty shit, and there are definitely a tonne of people posting here with much realer problems but maybe that such small stuff affects me in this way means I'm not cut out for this world. I've been through this all before and I feel like it's inevitable I will go through it all again and I just can't anymore. There are people that love me in my life, and I know they would be upset with me gone, I really feel like they would be better off with me go. The past year, I've become the stranger in my family, the outcast and I've grown apart from my small circle of friends who are making other friends and living their own lives. 

I just can't. I feel so fucking numb. Recently I've started pinching and hitting my legs when I get stressed out and that preceeded my last depressive episode too. People in my life know I've suffered from depression but I think they think I'm past that. I think the truth is this is something that will follow me for life and I really think it will be the death of me (suicide or fucking heart issues with all the stress it is causing me).

I fail college, I have a blank resume, I can find no job, I have to live with my parents...there's only one way out of this.
