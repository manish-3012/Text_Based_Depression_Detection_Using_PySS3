What can I do?I've tried so hard to make her happy to the point i would stay up late in the morning. But I have to keep this short for everyone. It started a couple months ago my girlfriend and I were just going through patch and I felt like I couldn't do it. I needed someone to hear me out and maybe give me some pointers so I went to one of my exes. My worst mistake she acted as if that she was there for me but behind my back she was taking screenshots of our conversations. But after a couple days my girlfriend and I got better and then I asked my ex if she wanted to hang out. Without a second thought she said yes and on that day my girlfriend begged my to stay with her and I told her I had to go. Looking back at it I feel like a fool. So time skip my girlfriend found out about the my ex and I's conversation and the group chat my ex was sending the screenshots. All I can say is that I said some things that I regret. She couldn't handle the hate that she was getting and I was trying help but I was the cause of all of it. So my girlfriend said that she didn't want to ever see me again. Which broke me beyond repair and that what caused me the start cutting myself. My ex found out and thought it was funny I hope shes happy now. I now have scars on my left and legs but I don't show people. But My girlfriend found out to and told me that if I do that and then she's gonna do it too. So I did but Now as I type this I feel like I'm gonna take my life I can't get rid this feeling off my chest. Friends and family tried helping but nothing so I'm reaching out to you guys maybe someone will have an answer to this question. Thank you for taking your time to read this.
