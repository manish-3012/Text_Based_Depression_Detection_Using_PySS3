The devil part of me will always be hereI hate myself. I love my only when I am alone. I hate happy people. If I will never have a relationship I will be ruin everything being jelous of other womens. I am a weirdo. I am cringy. Always been, only in my childhood I was happy but still weird. I hate opinision and supposition from others. Let me die I am useless
