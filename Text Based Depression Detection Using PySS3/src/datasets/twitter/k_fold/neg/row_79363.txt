Really struggling now, very strong urge to jump out my window, can someone please just talk to me?I just, I really fucking don't wanna do this anymore, it feels like my entire life consists of getting my spirit broken and I just don't fucking want to do this....I don't know how to keep living like this, I'm so fucking, just, they should've killed me the day I was born, they really shoukd have, but now I can end it, I can, and I'm trying to fight the urge to.
