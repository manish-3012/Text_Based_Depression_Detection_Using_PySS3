I have everything anyone could ever want.But nothing I want.

Everyone's left.

And they dont even realize how much it tears me apart.

I will not tell them. Because you cant change how someone feels, only they can.

They made their choices, and it is not my place to influence their decisions.

And neither is it their place to change mine, and so I will choose.

Every night it's the choice again, and every night it's the same decision.

Until it inevitably isnt. I want it so bad, but I can't do it.

I'm so weak. I should do what's best for me, but I cant. I'm too weak.
