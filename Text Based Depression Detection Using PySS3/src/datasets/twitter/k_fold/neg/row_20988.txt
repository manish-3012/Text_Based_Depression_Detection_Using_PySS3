I Have No Reason to Continue.I think there are three primary reasons that someone could use to justify their continued existence in the face of the overwhelming suffering and dull indignity of life.

One. You are competent in some field or practice that you enjoy, or that the world could use. 

I love medicine, when I think about things I truly feel engaged by, health science and medicine is really all I can come up with. And the world always needs more doctors. But the fly in my ointment is competence. I just failed a class that will put me on a trajectory to never being a doctor. I don't have what it takes to accomplish my goals.

Two. Others care for you. 

No one cares about me. I have no family. I spend my days alone. No one would notice or even be affected by my death aside from those burdened with collecting my body.

Three. You derive pleasure from existing.

I have no mirth left in me for almost anything. At best, activities that I used to deeply enjoy and be excited for are reduced to empty, dull escapism. My thoughts are slowing, faces blend together, my mind is clouding, the center of my body feels numb, and nothing is worth doing. I need to throw in the towel.
