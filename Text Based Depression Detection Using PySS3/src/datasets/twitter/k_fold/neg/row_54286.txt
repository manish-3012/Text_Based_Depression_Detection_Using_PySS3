I think I'm doneJust heard of more serious pain that I've caused. Previously I thought of suicide as an 'if', now I think it's more as a 'when'. All I seem to end up is a burden, people try to express how many options I have, but whatever I do ends in disappointment. I feel like I've heard it over and over again, eat better, exercise more, take your medication, go to therapy, practice meditation, mindfulness, learn about CBT techniques, see your doctor, engage in social activities, find some hobbies, be human.

I tried being human, but these last 4 months everything has come crashing down. I feel like prolonging this is just a case of the sunk cost fallacy. Not all stories have a happy ending.
