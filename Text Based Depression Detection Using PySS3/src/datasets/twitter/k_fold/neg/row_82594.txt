Can't pay my bills this month, deep in debt.What the fuck can I do about it? I cannot pay it back, the job I am working at is about time go out of business and I have no special skills.
My car needs repairs and is about to give out.
My debt just keeps getting worse and worse and the only thing I can really do is kill myself to avoid it.
I cannot pay rent this month and I will be evicted.
Seems like this is all that life is and that it will get worse and more severe as I go on.
I am NOT asking anyone for money so please don't think that. 
Any advice would be great...
