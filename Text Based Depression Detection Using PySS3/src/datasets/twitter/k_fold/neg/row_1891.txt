I have been experiencing suicidal thoughts.ive attempted suicide once before and have been having thoughts of doing so again. recently my life has been falling into pieces. ive been losing so much recently. family members, friends, and just recently a partner who i loved dearly. ive been attempting to reach out and get the help i need but nothing seems to work. i still wake up every single day in so much pain wishing that i wouldâ€™ve died that night. im tired of putting on a fake face everyday and acting like im okay and that nothing phases me. ive had everything taken away from me. everything i loved is gone. everything that made me happy is gone. everything is gone. help me please. im trapped.
