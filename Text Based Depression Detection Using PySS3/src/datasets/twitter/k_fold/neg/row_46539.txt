I'm just too tired to keep living.I go to school during the week and when I'm not at school, I'm working. I'm facing a criminal charge that could (and will likely) end in me going to jail. I'm fucking 3 months sober and they say being sober is supposed to help you when it just makes everything worse. I'm too scared to do anything and I can't stop crying. I'm so FUCKING tired. I'm tired of living, being alive. And I can't believe I'm bitching about this on Reddit. I'm fucking pathetic and a sorry excuse for a person.
