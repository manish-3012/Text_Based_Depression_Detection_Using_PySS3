Guess who is killing herself this week?That's right, me I've had enough of living, I can't stand another minute of this shitty life.

I haven't decided on the day, but I do have a method.

The world will be a better place without jess.

I'll be forgotten soon.

I can easily off myself right this second if i wanted i can always slice my neck open with a knife i've got on my desk for that purpose etc.

I deleted most of my accounts that have any real ties to me, as far as I'm aware nobody knows about this reddit account.
