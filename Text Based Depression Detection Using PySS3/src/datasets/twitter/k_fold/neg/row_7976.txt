Failed attempting 4 times last night. Iâ€™m determined to succeed in it tonight.Long story short I have severe depression. My girlfriend broke up with me last night and I canâ€™t take anymore pain. I donâ€™t care anymore. I always looked forward to talking and seeing her. I loved being with her. Now Iâ€™m all alone and have no one to cuddle with and feel loved. Iâ€™m going to try to suffocate myself again and if that doesnâ€™t work. Iâ€™ll walk to a bridge overnight and jump.
