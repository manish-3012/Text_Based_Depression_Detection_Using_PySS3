I'm 14, and I have had enough.I have seen enough of this bullshit. I lost all of my friends because I have personal problems, my grades are at an all-time low, I fucking hate my family and the girl I have a crush on - who is also my best friend - now doesn't want me. My friends were the only thing I had in this life, and i lost them because I have problems controlling myself, especially under stress and anger. I don't want help. Stop telling me people love me, they care about me. They think I want attention.

I found aspirin and ibuprofen today. I think I will overdose next week, when our school has a two-day holiday because of Christmas. Nobody will be home except my little brother, he'll be playing games anyways, he won't suspect a thing. If I can't overdose, I'll put a plastic bag over my head, tape it to my neck - making an airtight seal and taping my hands on my back right after. Only thing I am concerned is the possibility of failing. If the former method fails, I'll probably bleed my stomach or have hearing problems. If the latter happens however, I'll probably have permanent brain damage. If I find sleeping pills, I'm definitely going for aspirin+ibuprofen.

I also have another problem - I'm a fucking coward so I don't have the balls to do it to be honest. If these ways prove to be %100 effective and mostly painless however, I am going for it.

Does anyone know anything about taking ibuprofen+aspirin? I think I have around 1.7 grams of aspirin and 2 grams of ibuprofen, though the latter is in liquid form. Should I use this as a reliable way of suicide? Will it be painful? How long will it take? Can I use them after taking sleeping pills or just before sleeping at night? Also, is the plastic bag method painful? How long does it take and is it reliable? Thanks in advance if you can answer.

Please don't tell me that people care or whatever. I know they don't and I am %100 dedicated. By not helping, you are just increasing my risks of having many more problems (for example permanent brain damage). Thank you to everyone who helps in advance.
