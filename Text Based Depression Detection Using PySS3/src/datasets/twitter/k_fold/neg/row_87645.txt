Locked In My Fucking House I'm Going InsaneMy friends constantly telling me how they lost their jobs, it's making me sad and sick, plus fuckin' police won't let me outside to have even a walk. I'm going insane. I'm probably going to get carried to a mental institution. 

I just want to end this shit, right now. Fuck everyone, nobody fuckin' understands anything.
