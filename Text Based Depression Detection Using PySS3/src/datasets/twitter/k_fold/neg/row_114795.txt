Is it time ?Ive been recently finding myself getting my affairs in order everything is set. 

Im 23 and a father, i live in the uk and my life is to say the least vanilla, i am single and have found that i am lonely .

My childs mother has a new partner and is a swell guy so i know my kid is in good hands, ive written out my notes to my mum and dad and for my kid when hes older.

I feel im finally ready for my journey to come to an end, am i right for thinking this ? I don't know, 

I needed to get this off my chest, my scars show a story that leads to my own inner civil war, i truly have nothing and no one to live for
