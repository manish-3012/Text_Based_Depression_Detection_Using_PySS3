I forget how bad it is until the suicidal thoughts start happening again.Now that i'm back in school my depression has hit even harder. Pair that with increasingly bad obsessive thoughts and a faltering faith in God, and you've got a recipe for disaster. It's taking all of my energy to get through the day, and by dinner time I'm exhausted. It feels like there is no escape from the pain, and I'm surrounded by people who I love and are emphatic, but I could never tell them about the obsessive harm thoughts or the fear of being forsaken by God. It feels like someone is holding me down in shallow water. I'm struggling up for air, but they keep holding me down. I don't want to give up, and I doubt I will because of what it would do to those around me. But I'd be lying if I said i didn't want to hurt myself. Sometimes it seems like the only way out, is out.
