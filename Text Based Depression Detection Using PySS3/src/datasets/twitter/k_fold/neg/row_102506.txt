Life with aspergers is not worth livingI've recently come to the realization that I can not and will not accomplish what I want in life with aspergers (yes I've been diagnosed). I am socially awkward and clumsy, I have been my entire life and that's never going to change because my brain is just wired differently. Because of this I am becoming intensely depressed and I have a ton of social anxiety to go along with that too.

I've tried everything, the more social I am the worse I feel afterwards because I just say stupid shit and can't make conversation for my life, I will dwell on this for days sometimes weeks afterward. I just never seem to have anything in my head to add to a conversation. 1 on 1 conversations are the worst, I've had people tell me how boring I am and old friends have told me they don't want to hang out anymore because of this. And I don't blame them, I wouldn't want to have to talk to myself either.

I'm tired of my fruitless attempts to fix my social life. I'm tired of seeing people around me be experts at socializing which comes naturally to them while I am so socially retarded. I'm tired of being told by people who don't suffer from aspergers that I CAN SOLVE ALL MY PROBLEMS WITH SELF IMPROVEMENT AND JUST GOING OUT AND TALKING TO MORE PEOPLE. No. I've tried it all, meeting new people, getting fit to improve self esteem, everything people I know and my therapist has suggested and nothing has helped BECAUSE ITS NOT SOMETHING I'VE DONE THATS CAUSED ME TO BE LIKE THIS, ITS HOW I WAS BORN.

So that leads me to why I posted here. I am going to kill myself. I don't know when and I don't know how, but I know it needs to happen. I don't want to live like this. I don't want to get to 40 and be a virgin with no friends. Maybe some people can live happily with aspergers and good for them but I want a girlfriend, a large social circle, a good job. All of which I know I am statistically unlikely to ever see with the way I am. Better luck in the next life I guess.
