Making it realIf things don't get better after I graduate high school (I'm 17) then i'll kms or decide to wait till I'm 30. By the time i reach 30 my life will be pretty much set, so if its not better then ill just bounce. Don't have a method (as the time approaches, if it does at all, ill find a way) but I know that if I reach 30 and I'm not any better, I will fucking kill myself. My birthday is 5/1/01 so I have, at best, 22 years, 300 days left until I decide to live or die. Let the clock begin

-stay safe, stay memein and schemin. I love you all
