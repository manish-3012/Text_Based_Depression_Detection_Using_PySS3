Im not usefulI have no use, infact since I'm deaf my parents had to buy Cochlear Implants and upgrades for them. It just seems selfish of me to be costing my parents thousands of dollars when my dad is unemployed and my mom is losing her job in April. Nothing is going well so, I'm depressed and none of my friends take me seriously since I'm always the one trying to be happy even though it is a cover. Please help me I just can't handle life it's too much
