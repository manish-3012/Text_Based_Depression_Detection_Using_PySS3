I can't deal with the future anymore.I've been dealing with pretty debilitating depression for over 3 years, and anxiety for most of my life. I've been in therapy for almost 2 years, and I've been on medication (10mg Prozac) for about a month. All I do is worry about the future, and I really can't take it anymore.  

After graduating college, the only job I could get was a data-entry job that paid next to nothing. I *hated* it with a passion, so after a year I went to grad school for Library and Information Science with the intention of being a school librarian. After a while, I couldn't work and go to school anymore because student teaching would have to be done during work hours - so I quit the job, continued going to school, and then found myself out of work for several months until I got a job working overnight at Target. This job pays even less than the job I left, and I *hate* working there even more. It didn't really matter because I clung to the narrow hope that I was going to graduate and **finally** get a real job and start moving on with my lifeâ€¦  

Except that now in my final semester with my student teaching, the school librarian I was working with told my professor that I was unsuited to the profession. She said I needed to be more "outgoing" and that I "couldn't continue a conversation." All of this is true - I absolutely abhor talking to people. I can't do it. It's both terrifying and physically painful to talk to people for any extended period of time, which is why I wanted to be a librarian in the first place - it's a building founded upon silence. The only things I thought I'd ever have to say are "Hello" and "This is due back the 23rd." So now after 3 years of time and tens of thousands of dollars spent I find out I'm woefully inept at this profession and that I'm in way over my head.  

I truly do not like people. I truly do not like socializing. I've thought about killing myself for many years, but now I realize that I *need* to do it. There's no hope for me - I'll never have a job, I'll never make any sort of actual money (I don't even mean being wealthy, I mean I'll never make enough to even pay my smallest bills), and I'll never be able to move out from my parents' house (which even *they* don't own! We live with my grandfather! They're two working adults and even THEY can't move out!). For the last several years I've had very little hope, but now the rest of it is gone. The world won't miss me. Aside from my immediate family, no one would even realize I was gone - which makes it all the more tempting.
