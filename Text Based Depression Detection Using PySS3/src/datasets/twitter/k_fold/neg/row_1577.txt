I'm a bit ashamed of saying it, but a girl i kind of liked has a boyfriend nowShe's always been too good for me. She's an extraordinary person. Very respectful, friendly and genuine. I just never had a chance. Like a 0/100000000 possibility. 
I really really tried to tell myself i didn't like her. But being honest i guess i liked her.

I imagined being with her. Not in a creepy way. I just tend to imagine situations. How it'd be going out with my friends and having a good time, hugging everyone i respect and "love", i imagine myself doing stuff I'd never be able to do, or saying stuff I'd never be able to say.

We kind of were friends (not bug friends, just... "friends"). *Were* because thanks to quarantine I lost any chance of getting to know some beautiful people i met not long ago, her included. Those friendly relationships abruptly stopped because of covid. 

I've recorded an audio-testament (is that an ok term?) and she was one of the ppl outside of my family i spent most time giving a personal message wishing her the best. 

It's stupid. I know. I just... Never stood a chance. I've never had a girlfriend (I'm 20yo) so I've got no experience. I've liked a girl just twice. Just two times I've feel I'm in love with someone. Both were pure idealization, just me imagining things. Having someone to rely on, being able to trust someone, hugging someone anytime and feeling better, not being alone. 

I feel bad.
