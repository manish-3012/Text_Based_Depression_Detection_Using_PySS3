My ex gf is currently in the hospital for a suicide attempt, I'm having trouble knowing what to do.Backstory here: http://redd.it/i44yi

The updated information is they admitted her to the hospital, and she has an actual room now, and may be there 4-7 days.

A little info I forgot to include in the other post: She usually lives about 30-45 min away from me, depending on traffic. She actually was just visiting this past weekend, as she has an internship 4 hours away, where her parents live.

I hope this doesn't sound selfish, but right now I seem to be having trouble figuring out what *I* am supposed to be doing. She wants me to come visit her, and I feel bad since she has no one else here. I know she was finally calling both her parents (they don't live together) tonight after I talked to her, but I'm not sure if they're coming or anything.

First of all, I'm not sure me being there is a good thing. At some point I'd think she will go from thinking I'm this great guy she's in love with, to thinking about how she's there because I called 911. She already said today she wished I had just come myself, and taken her to the E.R. so she would be there voluntarily. I told her maybe it's a good thing they are keeping her there. The Craigslist post was incredibly fucked up, and so was reading the notes.

Sorry for rambling, but I guess the advice is, what can I do for her, and what can I do for myself? I do not have any desire to get back together with her, but I'm pretty sure she still does. Another reason I'm not sure if her seeing me is good or not. I did promise her I would bring her some stuff from her apartment, so I am going to see her at least one more time, unless there's an unexpected twist.
