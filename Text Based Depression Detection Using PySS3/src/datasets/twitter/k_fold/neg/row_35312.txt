I want to go off meds so to kill myself.Wellbutrin numbs suicidal ideation.

Deep down, though, I know I am still a failure. Worthless, dog shit.

I no longer have suicidal ideation because Wellbutrin. A part of me, though, wants to remove the meds, so to feel the pain, so I'll do it.

While on meds, deep down, I still know I am hopeless.

Remove the meds. Give me full force, raw pain, so I can end it all.Â Otherwise, it's Chinese water torture, watching my life fail day-by-day.

I'm 40 by the way. About to turn 41 in a couple weeks. I'm fucked.
