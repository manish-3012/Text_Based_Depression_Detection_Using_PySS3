The pain itself is enough to make me gag and thoughts of suicide is now apparent, I need help.So recently Iâ€™ve just been really, really down over some things.

For some background let me explain: Iâ€™m a gay teen living in a predominantly conservative town in MO. I just recently had a break with my bf over some issues and we both need time to figure ourselves out and I miss him very much as he wants to come to me and talk to me on his terms when heâ€™s ready and this doesnâ€™t help me at all but itâ€™s besides the point but still very much important as itâ€™s *us that had kept me going and happy and knowing thereâ€™d be someone there for me. 

Up until 2 years ago I stayed with my Padre (father) and he went to prison recently as of then. I donâ€™t have a mother or moral family support and I moved in with my brother and some roommates. I feel hopeless as they are extremely homophobic and constantly tell me things like â€œyouâ€™re just being selfish always prioritising your needs over others.â€ No matter the argument even if itâ€™s about weather or not I can have FOOD or any other necessity as I donâ€™t even always have clothes to wear as I have maybe a couple pants and shirts I switch back and forth on. Weâ€™re very poor and struggle to make ends meet and when I sometimes complain that we have nothing like when I havenâ€™t ate in 2 days and I get told â€œtoughâ€ shit because theyâ€™re also struggling to eat food themselves. We get into arguments constantly from when Iâ€™m just trying to have a simple conversation with them I get told to just stop talking because they donâ€™t care and theyâ€™ll carry on another conversation and topic and if I even so choose to get frustrated I get told to stay downstairs and hear them out while they berate me saying that they hate how much I complain and theyâ€™ll be better about it. It never happens nor do I ever get anything close to an apology afterwards. 

This has been going on for about 6 months and we even had to kick a roommate out because he â€œAn adultâ€ abused me by trying to fight with me and ended up choking me and hitting me quite a bit. I just feel so numb and emotionless sometimes that I can never do anything right and that most just dislike me and sometimes feel as if I were to just disappear things would go accordingly and theyâ€™d be better off just without me since theyâ€™ve made it clear Iâ€™m very much a burden. I know itâ€™s hard for them I truly do. But when I have no one to talk to because Iâ€™m at risk for being kicked out because of my sexuality it only enhances the tension of the situation nor can I even talk about suicidal temptations and thoughts as they just simply believe itâ€™s â€œteenage stuffâ€ and if I even say that they donâ€™t care I get threatened to be hit or worse because of how selfish Iâ€™m being apparently. 

I feel the need to live because of the relationship I had prior and right now sometimes when I wake up I cannot even find a reason to. Iâ€™ve cut quite a few times which Iâ€™m not proud to say and makes me feel even worse that Iâ€™ve fallen from so much happiness and I feel itâ€™s all pain and cannot even see my future as it all runs blank like I canâ€™t even see myself being alive. On top of all this I canâ€™t seen medical treatment with all this corona virus talk and the fact I donâ€™t have insurance as my brother sees it as â€œunneededâ€ because I rarely get sick so I canâ€™t afford therapy or anti depressants or any medical needs even the non suicidal ones. I desperately need help and was just hoping to vent for you guys. I appreciate this sub reddit a lot as Iâ€™ve seen many stories and helpful people on here that i decided I wanted to share and maybe get some advice on a way to seek help, thanks for listening.
