I don't want to, but I feel like I have no choiceI'm a failure. It's night right now, but I'm laying here dreading the morning and crying over reddit. I've been preparing for this for a while now, just in case, but I feel like today I have to finally do it. My mother hates me, and to be honest it's mutual, though I never told her. I'm mediocre at everything I do, I have no future or a place I could go to. My grandma passed four years ago, and since then everything went downhill. I have no friends, and I feel like I'm just bothering people. I'm not a good person and I don't deserve to be treated nicely, but it still hurts. I just really don't want to do it, but I can't wake up in the morning and be a disappointment again. I just wish I could see my favorite city once more. Anyway, hope at least you guys are doing better out there.
