How to confide?I'm approaching the end of high school. I've had some trouble throughout high school since my grade 9 year (backstory: I switched schools for an unrelated reason in grade 10). It was usually manageable and I wasn't 'out of it' for more than a week. However it's been getting worse and worse.

The end of the last school year and following summer were especially bad. I talked to my parents, but I feel now that that was a mistake. I texted a few acquaintances, which helped me get out of it for the time being. I'm rather shy. I like almost all of the students at my school, but I have trouble getting close to any of them.

Throughout this year, I fell back into the same rut I felt back in the summer. The word spread, and all sorts of people tried to support me. The unfortunate thing is that I brushed them all off. The negative response my parents gave me didn't help, and I didn't want to be a burden on anyone; I want to be normal like everyone else. I don't blame anybody, but I'm having trouble being confident enough to be close to anybody.

I'm not sure if the people I texted over the summer are still my friends. It's rather strange to ask somebody how their day is when your last message to them was a suicide note.

I've called a suicide hotline over the summer, but the anonymity of it made the operator seem phony. I can't imagine the other person knowing exactly how I feel.

I'm starting to sink again, though I'm not sure why. I'm growing more and more distant from the people at school and my family. In my mind, what's the point of living if this cycle of highs and lows will just get worse and worse?

How do you bring up the subject of suicide? And how do you let the other person know that you appreciate their help and friendship? How do you tell if somebody will help you?

Thanks for reading. From what I see on this subreddit, I think this is a beautiful aspect of the internet. It gives me a little hope. I hope others will also find help here.
