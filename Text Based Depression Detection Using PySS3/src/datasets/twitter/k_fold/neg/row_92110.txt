The Totalbiscuit ParadoxI feel sad that totalbiscuit died, as he didn't want to. I just read a post from a stage 4 cancer patient who expressed their fear of death and how they cried in bed when they found out about totalbiscuit.

Isn't it strange how we are all human, yet we can be upset when we are going to die but equally upset because we can't die? It seems that being suicidal grants us the ability to transcend our survival instincts, because we consciously fight them - but we still won't touch a hot stove.

How did the genome get so fucked up.
