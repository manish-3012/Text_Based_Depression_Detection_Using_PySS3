I am tired of being me.I am 22 and have had only one relationship, i've been bullied more times than i can count, and i am tired of being faked out by fake online profiles. I am just done, i feel like everyone is out to get me and it is high school all over again. i feel like i am going to be alone forever, and i am sick of it. I have tried everything i can think of. I am really being honest right now, but i would like to end it asap. I am tired of this pain.
