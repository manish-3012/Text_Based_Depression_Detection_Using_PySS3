I think it's timeWell bois I'm in a place in my life that I should be happy af but instead I'm in the worst state I've ever been in. I think tonight is the night it all goes down. I'll drink some gin with red bull to get me going and then down tons of isopropyl and ethyl alcohol hand cleaners and just fuck up my insides. I've been trying to figure out how to get off this hell hole people call earth for a long time now and I finally think I have my way. Wish me luck everyone. Now I'm just wondering if I'm going to get a glimpse of God or if it will all just be an empty void. I'm ready to find out. 
Good bye to everyone I love. I know you will miss me for a while but the wounds will heal.
