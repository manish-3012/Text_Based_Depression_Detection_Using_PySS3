I have one person in my life but I still want to die tonightI love someone they are my only friend everyone else left me to be alone now they are all I have and time after time I've thought of suicide and they know I think about it but after awhile I started pushing them away trying to make them hate me so I could just die but they stayed with me I know it's selfish but I don't want to live life now and no one helps me with my feelings anymore all I want to do is to kill myself tonight or start cutting myself I know I need help but I really can't get any. This person is someone I love but I can't bring myself to not do it anymore I need a reason to live for them because I don't know what to do
