Suicidal I donâ€™t know why3 weeks ago my friend commit suicide. It really fucked me up. Iâ€™ve had bipolar all my life but ever since this happened I feel like Iâ€™m having disturbing thoughts. I donâ€™t feel depressed or hopeless, I know that people care. But at the same time, Iâ€™m so overcome with apathy and I want to kill myself. I keep imagining how good it felt when he jumped and just left this earth. I feel like someone is trying to convince me to cross over to the other side. Iâ€™m confused and I donâ€™t know if this is normal.
