I have all these health issues but none of them will finish me offIt's so frustrating. Instead of being given a life sentence of bad health that leaves me seriously disabled, I just want something to go wrong that I can die from. Yes I'm aware this is politically incorrect to say because happy people are dying. But it doesn't negate the fact that I wish I was the person that had something terminal. I live hoping that my kidneys will fail or soemthing like that, because I am too disorganised to actively commit suicide.
