I can't take anymoreI feel trapped and helpless I was diagnosed with depression and I didn't think I was, but they still put me on meds. Then I started doing worse in school because I felt like it was meaningless and although I am not falling any except math pre cal which I am usually good at. I just took the test today and I needed 67% to pass I don't think I did and I can't do it next semester because they don't offer it and I need it to get into engineering, but now that's all down the drain because of the stupid meds. Now I feel overwhelmed and can't take it anymore I feel like it would be easier if I was dead.
