My life doesnâ€™t feel like itâ€™s going anywhereI was sexually assaulted and I donâ€™t know how to deal with it. Iâ€™m a senior in hs and i havenâ€™t heard back from the program I really want. All my friends are moving forward and making uni plans and I feel like Iâ€™m getting left behind. My marks are dropping, Iâ€™m soooo depressed I donâ€™t wanna get out of bed, and it feels like no one sees me suffering. I barely see my mom anymore( she leaves before I wake up) and my sisterâ€™s never home. Everyone around me is walking past me and I donâ€™t know how to reach out to them. I just feel like a giant burden that brings people down if I donâ€™t act like Iâ€™m okay but if I act like Iâ€™m okay it hurts more.
