I was writing my Suicide note today then I listed down the songs I want to be played for my funeral as I was writing, it made me laugh and stopped me from committing suicide.I don't know it was just so funny that I'm listing down songs for my funeral. It made me laugh so hard while crying because some of the songs I wrote are hilarious to imagine when I'm dead.
