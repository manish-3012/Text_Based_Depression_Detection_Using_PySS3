Place to talk about suicideIs there a place to discuss suicide with people rationally? I mean, without people talking you down? I just want a place to have reasonable conversations about suicide where im not met with responses like "dont do it".

I checked reddit but subs like r/optingout and r/HowToDie have been removed.
