Life is utterly meaninglessHonestly I'm really losing myself. Life has no meaning once I die I die that's it. Here one day gone the next and nothing really changes life goes on. It's hard to find a reason to live cause the really is no reason. Even the Christian bible says it in the book of Ecclesiastes that's what the book is about. "Meaningless! Meaningless!" Says the teacher "utterly meaningless""everything is meaningless" ( Ecclesiastes 1:2) I wanna die i just wanna leave. The concept of finding meaning is just a mind fuck. I'm really losing it
