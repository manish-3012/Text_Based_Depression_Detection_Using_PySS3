Too many emotions flooding my head right now... I just want to sleep.For real. My head won't stop. I got restless legs. My mind won't stop either. I'm cycling through several emotions right now and it's becoming too much. On top of that, I've got thoughts of hanging myself.

My fucking hand hurts now from punching yet another hole in my wall. I can't fucking handle this pressure anymore! It's destroying me and all I feel I can do is idly sit by and watch until something awful happens.
