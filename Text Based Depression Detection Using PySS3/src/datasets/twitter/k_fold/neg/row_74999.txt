My future is doomedI have severe social anxiety and some form of Asperger syndrome... This prevents me from getting jobs, however, I can't live off of disability because it's "curable" through therapy treatments, which makes me extremely uncomfortable. I have a pretty big issue with therapy and medication, and I just can't do it... I really don't expect to live longer than 18 years... but if I don't off myself before then, I'll most likely just die from disease or starvation on the outside world, because I'll be homeless. It's sad but true, I don't want to live a sad life barely sustained by my family's income, I wouldn't want to be a financial burden to my family. Here, but think about it like this: if I die, it'll take them 6-12 months to get over me, verses if I'm alive, they've gotta support me their entire lives. Even if I do live... I'd be just like..... the NEETs from 4chan with no ambition in my life, and not able to get a job because of this, I'll basically be worthless. So basically I realized I've gotta off myself by 18, or move out, and live in the street and die from natural causes and just hope that it isn't too painful.
