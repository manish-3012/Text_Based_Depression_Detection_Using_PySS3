RepetitionI'm just so sick of the patterns, the mental imagery, the impulse to punish myself when I realise I'm in the room, the boredom, that moment I remember what I'm scared of every morning. And it's nothing. Weakness and being a bit pathetic. I tried cutting earlier but the scissors was blunt and I couldn't be bothered hacking like I used to do. I'm like, fuck, I'm 28. Grow up. I need someone to take me seriously for a minute. Anyone. People love me and try to help but the ones that understand can't help because they're fucked up too. The rest don't understand, and push me towards shit that "should" be good for me. I'm a 28 year old child without prospects with too much trauma/illness to forget. What is the fucking point.
