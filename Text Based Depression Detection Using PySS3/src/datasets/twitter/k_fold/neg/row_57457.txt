I don't even want to post thisI live in this endless cycle of pushing people away. Im in a long term relationship right now but my partner works 50-60 hours a week. It's not really working out because we work on opposite schedules. I feel like I'm so weak to even say that. Like how unbelievably selfish of me. But I'm really unhappy. We almost never spend quality time together or have sex. I'm just sad every day. 

I don't really have any friends. I moved to a city six hours away from my home town because I was stuck in an abusive relationship. I've been here for two years but I don't really feel close to anyone. So when my partner is gone I just feel like this unbearable burden. Like I cannot exist without them. I dissociate very heavily on my days alone. Like I can't really tell what I did day to day. Or what it feels like to talk to others. I don't really have any money to go anywhere. 

I go to school and work but my hours were cut pretty hard. So I'm alone a lot. And I wake up and lay around and do nothing. I don't even feel motivated to watch TV. Or play a game. What's the point when everything makes me so miserable. I don't even know what "enjoyment" feels like anymore. I just wake up and repeat this process of living/not living. 

I'm like just kind of afraid of everything. I had a really bad bout of anxiety a couple years ago. I couldn't even leave the house for weeks on end. And it's made it hard to make friends. Or anything. I just feel this never ending solitude.


I don't know. I've just been feeling scary low. I guess that's why I'm posting here. Like a weight is pressing on my chest and I'm about to collapse. I wonder often why I'm on this planet or why anyone is here. Everything just feels meaningless at this point. I haven't been able to get help because I don't have insurance or money. And I live in a state that has restrictive medicare. It's just hard and never ending.

Sorry for the long rambling post.
