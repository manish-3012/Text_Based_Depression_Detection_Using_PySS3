i don't see why life is so worthwhileI'm a shit human being and i deserve to die. I'm doing nothing worthwhile with my life. My parents hate me and I've let all my relationships fall apart. My grades are shit and i don't have any motivation to try anymore so i have no future to look forward to. If life is just going to run me over then why don't i just end it right now before it gets any worse.
