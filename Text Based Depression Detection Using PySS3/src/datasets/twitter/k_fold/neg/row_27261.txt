I've never posted here before... But I need some supportAnd I'll most likely take it down... But I'm feeling suicidal urges I haven't felt in years. Around five years ago, I was really, really ready to go. I didn't want to keep being here any longer.

Since then, I've gotten treatment and I'm on an antidepressant and meds for my panic attacks. But recently with the pandemic and pressure at work and being treated poorly by the people around me has just... zapped my motivation to stay here. This isn't sustainable. I don't know how I'm supposed to live out the next 50-60 years of my life like this.

The only things keeping me here are the reactions of others... Especially my parents. Even though they are some of the people who treat me the worst, I know losing me would break them. And fear. That's a big one. I don't know what's on the other side.

I know this is vague, but I don't want to give away too much about my identity just in case. But right now work is impossible, the pressure is too much and I have no social life because of it, and my parents are my closest support system and they are so often unkind and unsupportive and unwilling to deal with my mental illnesses. They actively get mad when I show symptoms, even when I try to explain to them that I am irrational and coping the best I can. I'm an adult (28), but they still act like they know my brain better than I do. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't have any plans or anything. But I know I can't tell my family, friends or therapist that I'm feeling like this lest I get baker acted... So here I am. If this post is inappropriate or needs to come down I'm so sorry. I ended up discovering this subreddit while looking for some support. Thanks for taking the time to read if you did.
