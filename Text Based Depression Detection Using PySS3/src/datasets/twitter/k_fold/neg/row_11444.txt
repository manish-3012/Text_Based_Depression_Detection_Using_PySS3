Please stop telling me that I matterIt feels like a lie, and it's not what I want to hear. To be frank, I don't know what I want to hear. There is no hope. I don't care about blanket lines of "everybody matters". _I_ want to matter. Me. _I_ want to be a person worthy of love and respect. But I know I'm not. I know that I'll never find anyone. Let me accept the truth of despair. Let me get accustomed to its weight. I don't want to hear lies of hope or positivity.

I'm sorry if I sound ungrateful. I'm not. I appreciate everything I already have. I really do. I often feel blessed for the things I have and I want to protect them. But I still... Know what I am. And I hate myself.
