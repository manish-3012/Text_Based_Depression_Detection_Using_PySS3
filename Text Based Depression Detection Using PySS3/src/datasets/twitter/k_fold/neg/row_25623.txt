Hi, my name is Nick, and I want to kill myselfWell, the title pretty much says it all.  I suffer from some fucked up shit.  I have been depressed for a long time, and I can't remember what it's like to be happy.  I was physically abused by my father for four years due to him being a raging alcoholic, and the memories haunt me 24/7.  I am also a paranoid schizophrenic; I hear and see things that aren't actually there.  It has caused me to have little to no friends, and the one person that I can honestly say was my best friend committed suicide.  I feel like I could have helped him, and it haunts me all the time that I didn't.  I have been in a hospital once, and all it did was more harm than good.  I feel like I don't have very much longer to go on, and I'm content with dying.  The idea of suicide puts me at ease.  I guess some people aren't meant to grow old and have families, and I am definitely one of those people.
