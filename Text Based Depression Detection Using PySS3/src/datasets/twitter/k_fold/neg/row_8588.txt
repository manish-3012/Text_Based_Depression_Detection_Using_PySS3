more reasonseveryday i find more and more reasons not to stay. iâ€™m not gonna get better any time soon, if ever. the world is falling apart. i donâ€™t understand how so many people can be so ignorant. it makes me so angry. it makes it easier to see the world without myself in it. itâ€™s becoming the most viable option at this point. maybe not right now, but at some point. iâ€™m just tired of everything. iâ€™m done.
