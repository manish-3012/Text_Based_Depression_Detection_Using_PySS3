I feel selfdestructive but i don't want to dieI have phases where I have extreme highs and lows, like right now i feel on top of the world and the next day I will feel like shit. 4 years ago i had this more frequent and more intense and I snapped and tried to kill myself but ended in a hospital for 2 months. 
For the last 2 weeks I feel the same as 4 years ago,  but I am afraid of snapping again. I would be grateful i someone who experienced this before can give me an advice on how to handle this
English is not my first language so sorry if I misspelled something.
