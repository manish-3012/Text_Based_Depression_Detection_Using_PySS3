Iâ€™m never going to get betterIt doesnâ€™t matter what meds I take or what I talk about in therapy, nothing is going to work. I feel better for a day or two and then Iâ€™m deeper in the hole then I started. Between the anxiety and depression I canâ€™t get out of bed. Which is probably a good thing since I want to just go jump from the roof. Iâ€™m leaving university for a while but now I have to find a job. Iâ€™ve only got my girlfriend to rely on, and Iâ€™m dragging her down with me. Iâ€™m never going to get better, itâ€™s just a matter of time before I kill myself.
