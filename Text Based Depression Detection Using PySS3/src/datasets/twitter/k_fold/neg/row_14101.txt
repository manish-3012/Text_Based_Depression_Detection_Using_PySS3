Iâ€™m going to lose whatâ€™s keeping me aliveA few months before I started to feel depressed I got a beautiful LoveBird. He was from a pet store so heâ€™s fairly traumatized and isnâ€™t a fan of me but I was happy just getting him out of the hell hole that was that pet store.

After a few months of Leo doing his own thing I decided to get two other birds that I could actually handle and love, that went well and theyâ€™ve helped me a lot with my depression.... until now. I come from a long line of allergies, birds and dogs are the rare animals Iâ€™m not allergic to which is why I got so upset when I started getting hives handling them. Iâ€™m 15 so puberty has been changing my body but I didnâ€™t expect it to go like this.
