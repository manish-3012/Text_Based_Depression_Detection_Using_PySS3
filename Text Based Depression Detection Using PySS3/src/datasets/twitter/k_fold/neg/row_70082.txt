Feeling worse when not suicidalI've come to the conclusion that I am not able to commit suicide, because I am too squeamish. I've had suicidal thoughts for a while but it's nothing I can act on.

In a way, this makes me feel worse. Now that I know I can't do it, I don't have the comfort of a way out for when things inevitably go wrong and instead will have to live through whatever misery will follow.

I'm not able to kill myself, but that makes me feel worse than if I could because at least in the back of my mind I had suicide as a fall back of comfort if things went wrong.
