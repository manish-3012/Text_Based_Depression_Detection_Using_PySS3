My Financial ManifestoI'm tired of struggling financially and to be honest I'm just plain tired. I don't believe I'm suicidal, but I do fantasize about it frequently. I have studied and gathered the following information for financial freedom and most importantly just plain freedom. Freedom from the bill collector, freedom of the judgement of others and freedom to do your owning thing.

1. Working for others will not give you financial freedom in general. If you choose to work for others, the only way you will get financial freedom is through stock options or sitting in a Chief Executive position or super high paying gig like being an Anesthesiologist. Yeah, go fuck yourself. Any other way is impossible. So, if you choose this route, make sure its a company you see growing into the future and make sure this company is in its infancy stage. 
2. Saving every dollar is overrated and over hyped. Yes, you should not accumulate alot of loans and credit cards, but don't expect skipping eating out and stopping Starbucks will help you financially in the long run. If you like certain human consumables, then go for them as long as it's not requiring a huge loan on them.  A huge loan is relative to the person.
3. Invest in yourself. This can be going to college, trade school, you tube, books, online training courses, etc. If you want to create something, you need to know something.
4. Chase your dreams and passions, if you can monetize them. Always be practical. Don't chase the dream if you don't see an avenue on how to distribute or execute. How will I market this? Who is my customer? etc.
5. You can get financial freedom in the stock market, bonds, venture capitalizing (see 6,7,8), etc; however, over the past X years evaluations of companies have become exuberant and it takes money to make it in this arena. Read Benjamin Graham books, if you would like to understand the true meaning of stock investing and how to evaluate a business. 
6. When starting your business, always evaluate competition and try to monopolize the industry. This will make success alot easier and pay off bigger. If the market is crowded, its best to move on unless you can really stand out in the crowd. Franchising and (Multi Level Marketing) MLM is the fastest way to wealth in this scenario.
7. When starting your business, always assess the timing of this business. Is the world ready for my idea(s). You really don't want to start a Movie Theater or airline business in a pandemic. You get the idea.
8. When starting your business, throw everything at it and take a huge risk. Be prepared for bankruptcy, if it doesn't pan out. This is your shot and you have to risk everything near and dear. No one else cares about your financial freedom, but you. You will never see a Uhaul behind a hearse and YOLO.

Alot of these rely on who you know and the connections you have. &lt;---Which that is the luck. Sorta, like I was lucky enough to be born in the USA and not in a village in Kenya. I can't get free from worrying about the bills and move onto to things I enjoy. I have struggled my whole life with money and I know what to do; however, I can't find the "thing" I need to do...until then, I will job hop and flip the boss the bird behind his back. Fuck life and God Rules. Amen
