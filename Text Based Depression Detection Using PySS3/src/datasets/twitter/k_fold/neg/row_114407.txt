Why do I feel like everyone is lying to me?What gets better? When? How? My mind feels like it's deteriorating. I've been subconsciously pushing people away and alienating them. I feel like everyone lies to me when they say things get better, living becomes worth it. I'm not in any danger as of this second, but I'm scared that won't last. I told my girlfriend she was doing something that was exacerbating my problems and she told me she wouldn't stop, when I do things to make her more comfortable all the time. Nothing feels real anymore and everyone only cares about themselves. I wish i had the guts to just go. I dunno.
