Idk where else to postI have a Similar post like this on r/r4r but idk where else besides here and there to post. Some context: I'm going through a breakdown, I'm keeping myself in bed so I dont get near things I can harm myself with, and the biggest thing is I'm home alone and I know where my dad keeps his gun. I'm not looking to kill myself rn,  I just would really like a distraction from my mind, just a conversation.
