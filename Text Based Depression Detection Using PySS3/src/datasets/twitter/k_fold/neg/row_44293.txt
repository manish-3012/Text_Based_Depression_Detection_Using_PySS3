I wanted to do it today but I can't.I don't have anything to do it with and any other options would be long, drawn out methods for doing so. I just want this confusion and self hatred to end. I don't have time to figure it out. I've already made enough mistakes so I'm stuck where I am, in college in a major which I'm not doing good in.
