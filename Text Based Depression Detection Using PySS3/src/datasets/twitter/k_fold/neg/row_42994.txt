how can i make it stopi literally try so hard, different doctors or comminicating or changing the way i think. but i always end up just wanting ro fucking die. i wish it would stop. i overdosed in janurary and now my entire family is hurting amd angry with me and holds it against me. i just wish i had succeeded. i dont wanna breathe. i dont wanna be alive but i feel trapped here and theres just no worth for me. all i do is hurt people and i really am sick of feeling guilty for being alive so id rather just be dead. this battle is one im destined to loose.
