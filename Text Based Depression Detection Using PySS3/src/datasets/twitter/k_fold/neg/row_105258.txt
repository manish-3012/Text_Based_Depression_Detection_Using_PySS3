Think i may finally do itBeen very depressed for a long time. Ive had occasions where i thought about suicide. But now after the betrayal and breaking up of the only person who brought me joy in the world i constantly feel dead inside. Nothing interests me anymore. The only kind of feelings i have now are painful ones. Everyday i contemplated dying. On a few occasions i planned to do it. But i kept reaching out to people to see if i could be convinced not to. Last night i finally came to the conclusion. I am ready. Was going to do it then. But i drank and passed out. Today is the plan.
