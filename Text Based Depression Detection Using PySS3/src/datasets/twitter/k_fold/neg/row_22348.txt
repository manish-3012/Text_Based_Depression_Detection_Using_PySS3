Social skillsI posted that on r/socialskills and some guy told me to post here 
So, I never been the popular kind of girl, actually I was mostly of my time alone or with a boyfriend, like ever, when I was 3 years old I had a kindergarden boyfriend and so.
When I was from 6 to 11 years old I suffered bullying a lot and no one would play with me (probably cuz i didn't like to play things such like catch or hide and seek), anyway i was pretty alone and the fact they would throw my toys in the trash and make fun of me didn't helped.
When I was 12-13 years old, it was good, i had some friends, but at 14 I lost almost everyone for different reasons and entered in a deep depression.
At 15, i try to do a course but i couldn't talk to anyone and the only guy i thought was my friend, sexually abused me, then I told an old friend of mine (from that 12-13 phase) and he abused me as well
Moving to 16, i had this boyfriend (J) but he suddenly blocked me and ended it all (i think he was sick of me, i had many sexual troubles)
And at 17 I entered in an abusive relationship, in which he would control anything i did, raped me 2 times and even beaten me
So now i have 19 years old, and I can't talk to people in college, i'm dating this guy I met on first semester (that was my best and only friend for a while) and i can't help from selfharming and suicidal thoughts everytime someone ignore me, seem to dislike me, don't invite me to lunch or something, and i try so hard to be noticed and to stay close and to say anything, but seem like no one listen and i'm tired to be a bourdon to my boyfriend and always be someone girlfriend
Anyway thats it
