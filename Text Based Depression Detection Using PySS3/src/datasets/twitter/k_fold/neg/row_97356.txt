what feels like the end of the worldi got a bad haircut a couple weeks ago. now, for stable people this also isnâ€™t an ideal situation either but they would be able to live with it, i canâ€™t. it was kind of the last straw of breaking down, because now i have extreme highs and lows, iâ€™ll be happy and distracted for a couple hours then iâ€™ll see my appearance and get utterly and completely depressed. a stupid bad haircut triggered such deep self hatred and i really donâ€™t want to live like this. i donâ€™t think itâ€™s just the haircut, thereâ€™s obviously underlying things to why iâ€™m suicidal over that, but i feel crazy. the only thing keeping me here is knowing that most people defecate when they die, and i donâ€™t think i can leave my mom.
