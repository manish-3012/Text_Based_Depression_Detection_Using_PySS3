Don't stop fighting...We live in a sick society. This world is full of selfish, careless and idiotic people. People that will bring you down because they don't feel it's worth caring for you. People that are close to you, family, classmates, co-workers, etc... they don't give a shit. Why? Because they are weak inside, they want to show their strength by bringing others down. They want to fuck with your mind and body so that it makes them feel better.

But these people don't own you. They don't fucking own you. As long as you are not locked up in a cell somewhere physically, you can fight for your life. I've wanted to quit plenty of times, but I owe it to 2 people in my life who kept me going. I probably wouldn't be alive today if it weren't for these people letting me know that I'm not alone in this struggle.

Don't let this sick society end your life. There are many ways you can get help. This doesn't have to be a lonely fight. It's not a fight against yourself, it's a fight against this sick fucking world. Help yourself, because you'll find that soon you will want to help others.
