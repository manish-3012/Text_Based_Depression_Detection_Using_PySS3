Never before has a quote spoken to me so strongly."I don't believe that people should take their own lives without deep and thoughtful reflection over a considerable period of time. I do believe strongly, however, that the right to do so is one of the most fundamental rights that anyone in a free society should have."

Said by Wendy O. Williams in her suicide note.
