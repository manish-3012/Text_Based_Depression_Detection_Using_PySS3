I will never be happy in lifeGot a useless music degree and I canâ€™t find a job now because I canâ€™t get an internship in a studio because Iâ€™m overqualified but I donâ€™t have the experience for a job. And with covid there are no jobs for my useless degree anyway, AND I found out target pays more than what I studied in. So now Iâ€™m having second thoughts about if I even wanna work for a company the rest of my life anyway, I would be miserable. How is this adulthood?? Everyone just wakes up goes to work and comes home and sleeps and still canâ€™t afford to live, what is even the point?? And then owning my own business would require even more hours, and trying to do music on my own is a complete joke because the industry is so gatekept. I feel like a selfish and delusional prick for thinking I could have that type of career anyway but how is anyone happy with a 9-5 (more like a 8-5 or 9-6 or two jobs even that still donâ€™t pay). Who has tike to travel and have fun and visit family? Who has time for life anymore? I also feel selfish for having suicidal thoughts but I canâ€™t find am inherent meaning to this world

What would I even miss if i left this world?
