I'm lonely and tired of hurtingI don't know if anyone will actually read this or not, but I need to vent somewhere. The person who I thought was my best friend lied to me and isn't talking to me anymore. And maybe it's silly to be struggling so much over losing one person, but the world is really shitty right now and I'm living in a new city alone and overwhelmed with everything. I've struggled with self harm before, and recently I've been falling back into that and thinking about suicide a lot and I just don't want to be here hurting anymore. I do have friends who I think would care so maybe it's selfish, but I don't know if I can keep doing this. People keep telling me I'm strong, but I'm exhausted and tired of needing to be strong when I'm just getting lied to and hurt.
