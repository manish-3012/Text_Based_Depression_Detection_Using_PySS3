I'm too sick to start this new job and now I'd kinda rather end my life than try to start everything fresh.[Some background here with the job thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/457mbk/im_too_sick_to_start_this_new_job). The position was as a stage technician, something I've been doing since high school. I got my BA in Theatre &amp; Film 5 years ago and have found it extremely difficult to find steady work in the field, settling for customer service and retail. 

Now I don't know what to do with my life anymore. Part of me wants to run away but a bigger part of me wants to just end it all cuz things don't seem to get any better.
