I almost did it todayI was really close to doing it I had a cup of bleach in my hands but as soon as it hit my lips I spit it out, cried for like an hour and then cleaned my room and did a bunch of chores and drank to take my mind off things. This isnâ€™t my first attempt and it wonâ€™t be my last but I canâ€™t let my mental illness control my life.
