Someone has been an influence in me wanting to kill myself, should I try to address it with them?There's someone who I don't know very well, but the last time we spoke they said things about me that really hurt and affected me. 

The situation is too complicated to lay out here right now, but they made very bad, ugly judgements/assessments/assumptions about me that went against everything I have been working on with myself just to try to be the best person I can for myself and others, and just treated me like less than dirt.

There's more to the whole story but after that was the first time I actually tried to kill myself, not just think about it.

It's been 7 months since then and I've been thinking that wanting to kill myself is no one's fault, ULTIMATELY. It's no one's fault except that what that person did to me, it's the only direct outside influence that makes me want to kill myself. They're the only PERSON that had influenced me wanting to kill myself.

And for a little while I've been thinking about if I should try to address the problem with this person or not. Not necessary tell them "what you did heavily influences me in wanting to kill myself", but just tell them why what they did was wrong and how it's been affecting me.

This person hates me, so I'm having doubts about it, but I really feel like it's one of the only things that will make me want to kill myself less. Should I try?
