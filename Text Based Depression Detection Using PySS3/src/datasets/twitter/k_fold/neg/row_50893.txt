No one will miss me if I'm gone. I can't take this life anymore. I really can't take it. I'm sorry to vent but I need somewhere to express myself. I am a 20 year old girl living an empty life. I haven't had good friends since elementary school. I probably go hang out with my 1 "friend" once every other month if that. I've never had a boyfriend before and it absolutely kills me. I've been asked out before (2-3 years ago) but I always said no because I was scared and I regret that more than anything. I am in college now, second year, and haven't made any friends. I just go throughout my day being a loner. No one talks to me really. I'm not like everyone else, I can't just let loose and laugh in a conversation. I'm sad inside and I feel like that will always be a part of me.

I look like a normal person who has friends and does stuff but nope. I also don't have a job, no one will call me back. I also don't give a shit about my family and vice versa. They are angry people and my siblings don't even invite me places, they hang out with eachother. I dont know why I would want to go on living if for the past 7, 8 years, I haven't don't shit but sit at home. What is my life? I'm 20 and nothing as changed I'm more lonely than ever. I just want to end it. I want to sleep forever. I can't see my life getting any better. Everyone seems so happy or full of life and I'm just a loner moping around trying to see if anyone cares, which they don't. If I had a gun I would be gone. I remember trying to kill myself at 10 or 11 by falling out the window. I wish I had pushed harder.

Sorry this is so long I needed to vent. I'm thinking of giving myself a timeframe.. if things don't get better soon I don't want to stick around. I didn't ask to be born.
