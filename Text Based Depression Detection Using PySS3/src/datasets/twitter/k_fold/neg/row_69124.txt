idkIâ€™m a 15 year old girl and Iâ€™m so fucking tired of living. my parents are both lunatics who hate me solely for existing. theyâ€™re a bunch of fuck-ups and they project their insecurities on me. They are truly the worst people ever. I absolutely hate being on this world and cannot imagine a future where Iâ€™m truly happy. the only thing keeping me alive is my fear of god. Ik that sounds ridiculous but Iâ€™m so scared. please help me Iâ€™m in so much pain and donâ€™t know what the fuck Iâ€™m supposed to do
