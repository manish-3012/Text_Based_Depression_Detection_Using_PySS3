Feeling Lost and HopelessI never thought I would get to the point of actually googling ways to kill myself but here I am. I havenâ€™t made a decision yet but I feel incredibly hopeless. My partner and I just got into an argument. Basically they have been supporting me since I graduated from college - they pay for a lot of my food, I have a very discounted (or non existent) rent, theyâ€™re a wonderful emotional support system, they pay for all of our dogâ€™s expenses - and they feel as though I have been dishonest with them about my progress at work. Iâ€™m trying to start my own business but Iâ€™m finding it to be really hard and I keep getting lead on by prospects that turn out to be crap. Iâ€™ve blown through most of the money I had saved to help me get on my feet after college. But the main reason Iâ€™m posting here is because my problem is that Iâ€™m lazy. I know it. Iâ€™ve always known it. I donâ€™t like to work hard at things. Iâ€™ve always been the kind of person to figure out a way where I can do the least amount of work possible and still be fine. My partner has told me that they donâ€™t want me to move into the new apartment that weâ€™re renovating in 3 weeks and they feel that I need to struggle so that I work harder. And you know where my mind went when they said that? Suicide. If I just end it all I wonâ€™t have to work hard and I can die with people thinking that Iâ€™m this amazing person that everyone thinks I am. But Iâ€™m scared. I donâ€™t think I want to die because I think of how sad some people around me would be. My mom lost her older brother to suicide when she was 9 and I feel like such an asshole for even thinking about doing it. But honestly my life feels so overwhelming right now and I keep thinking of all the work I have to do. All the healing of trauma. Finding a part time job. Buckling down and getting my business off the ground. Working on my relationship issues. It all feels like too much and when I think of that â€œto-doâ€ list it truly feels like itâ€™s too much for me to handle. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s too much for most people to handle but I just donâ€™t think I can do it. Iâ€™ve been in therapy for a while and I really love my therapist but when I think about doing more healing work and trying to get to a really solid place mentally I just think about how much quality care will cost both in time and in money. Which then brings it back to the fact that I donâ€™t have a job. I donâ€™t have much of a point or question in posting this, I guess I just needed to get that off of my chest.
