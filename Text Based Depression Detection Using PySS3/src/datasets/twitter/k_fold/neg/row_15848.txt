Has anyone else had positive effects with benzodiazepines? (In regards to depression and suicidal yearning)I don't recommend them, but benzodiazepines  are good for me and have helped me. And not in the 'look at all the drugs I do I'm so hardcore' kinda way, but in the 'I've had such intense depression since I was at least seven if not younger and desperately want to die even on a good day and benzodiazepines are the only thing that has ever given me any reprieve from the soul crippling sadness, however brief' kinda way. 

And as much as that sounds a bunch of pretentious whiny bullshit to convince people to do drugs. Brutally addictive ones at that 

But unfortunately I'm deadly serious. Even on a good day I want to die and when I do benzodiazepines it's like a weight has been lifted from my shoulders that I had no idea was there due to familiarity but that is crippling in a multitude of ways. And the only time I've ever felt it lifted in about 20 years is shortly after doing benzodiazepines. 

Unfortunately i have addictive proclivities and tend to do things to excess and so overdo it a bit when I do them and with two other addictions already there's no chance of a doctor ever prescribing me some even though I desperately need some. (I'm in the UK)

Sorry this is massively tangential
