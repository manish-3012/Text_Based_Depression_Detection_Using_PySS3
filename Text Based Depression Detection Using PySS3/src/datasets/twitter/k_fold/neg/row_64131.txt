I donâ€™t think this is survivable.TL; dr: I have a plan. I want out. 

My SO &amp; I are going through a break/up. Written that way because he said break but it feels far more like a break up. Insert all the clichÃ© best friend, soul mate bullshit here. Left our home last night and staying with a friend. I doubt Iâ€™ll be back. It wasnâ€™t healthy for me, for us. 

My SO said I was being manipulative by threatening to cut. I said I hid the sharps from him because heâ€™s a copy cat. Ironically, I never threatened. I never even intimated suicide. So donâ€™t tell anyone ok? My therapist knows, my sup knows Iâ€™m in a dark place and my best friend knows. 

Issues with my narc mom hating me. Work pressure. Money issues. Bullshit everywhere. I have two plans. Set up timed emails for who to give my phone to. Writing letters to my children who are beautiful and brilliant. They need a better mom. 

My supervisor pulled me aside and we had a meeting where I just sobbed for no particular reason. Yesterday wouldâ€™ve been the day if I couldâ€™ve afforded the items. Being $400 overdrawn because gas and food were needed, makes anything difficult. I hadnâ€™t eaten for days. 

Staying at a friendâ€™s house. She made me lunch for work. When I opened it, I found lunch, a cup of applesauce, cucumber salad for a snack and cutlery and a napkin. I lost it at the spoon. My SO has been so distant and angry, heâ€™s fully retreated. I havenâ€™t felt this warmth and general kindness in months. A spoon. A spoon broke me today. 

Iâ€™ve got a plan. 2 just in case. Like I said, I need to write the letters and Iâ€™m done. I called the therapist and she wanted me to go to the ER and said that f I didnâ€™t, she would call them to come for me. I said I was fine. I was stronger today. Itâ€™s like being in the ocean - some waves crash harder while others you barely feel. She made sense about a lot of things going on. She also made me promise to go to the hospital if I started drowning again. Iâ€™m a self-injurer, but this is honestly the closest Iâ€™ve come to suicide, much less considering admission. 

I canâ€™t knit there. I canâ€™t be alone with my thoughts. Iâ€™m high on imipramine, Trazodone &amp; xanax right now. My SO, or who it once was never bothered to say goodnight. He hates me. Blames me for everything. I wish I drank. Then Iâ€™d have 3 plans. 2 is enough. I donâ€™t want this life anymore.

I have a pact with a friend. I have to call her to say goodbye. Itâ€™s kept us both anchored. Iâ€™m going to let her down most likely. 

I wonâ€™t do it here. Iâ€™ll do it somewhere no one has to clean up after me. It will be fine. Why the fuck is this so hard. Iâ€™m emotionally spent.
