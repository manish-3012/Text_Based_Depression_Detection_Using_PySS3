Everyone leaves me.This is an update to my last thread. He left me. I went to get on medication, trying to be better, and he up and left me. Everyone constantly leaves. I was completely devoted to him. Even when I was going through my own shit, I would help him. Then someone in my dorm lied about me, thus landing me in the damn hospital all day on Thursday. I've been taking the pills (cipralex). I really have. But I'm lonely. If the person I care about the most, more than anything else, can just up and reject me, right along with people that barely know me, whats the point of staying around? If no one wants me, no one will care when I die.
