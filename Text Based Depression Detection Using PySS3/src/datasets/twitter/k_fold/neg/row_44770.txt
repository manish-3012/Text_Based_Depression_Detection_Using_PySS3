Is there anyone who listens to my stupid life story. I'm 29 and going to be a single mother.I have depression and anxiety. I have tried to kill myself many times. Since I was 11, I have been thinking about ending my life. The reason why I started to think about it is my parents. They never understand me. Even now they don't. 
I'm married and having a son. But currently I am separated. Staying in my parents house temporarily. That's so stressful and lonely.
I don't have friends. No one talks to me friendly and shares things with me. I'm so alone.
I don't want to mention about my terrible marriage. I don't want to be judged here. But I want someone who listen to everything of my feelings like what makes me feel want to be dead.
These days I just think about ending my life. Even though I have a son. I know in selfish. But im really broken and hurt. I can see that I will never be happy. I don't want to live anymore. Maybe until next week, I might be gone. But hopefully I would like to talk/share to someone about how life is terrible...
