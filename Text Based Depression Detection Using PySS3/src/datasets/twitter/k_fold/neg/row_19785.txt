I don't know what to do anymoreI just want to end my life so badly. There is nothing here for me here. I'm never happy anymore, I don't enjoy spending time with friends, all I do is lay in bed all day. I wanted to stop self harming cause I didn't want the scars, now I just starve myself. 

I keep telling myself to just hang on and not do it, but life just keeps getting worse and worse. All I do is suffer, and I want to stop. I've already written some suicide notes to my friends. Help me
