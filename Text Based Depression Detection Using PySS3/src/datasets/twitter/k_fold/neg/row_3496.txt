I think itâ€™s overI have made a terrible mistake that is about to cost a series of people not only their livelihoods, but in one case monetary impact so serious that it is their life as they know it. It is my fault. There is no question. 

I should have seen it coming, and I didnâ€™t. Or maybe I did but I didnâ€™t want to admit it to myself. I donâ€™t know.

I am sitting by a window, Iâ€™m away in a hotel, and where the fall would certainly kill me. My body doesnâ€™t feel right. My family keeps me here from moment to moment, but I donâ€™t know if I have the strength. As night falls I know these feelings will get worse.

This message is really embarrassing. Itâ€™s reads so badly. I sound like drama queen. But Iâ€™m a middle aged man, and no one can help me. 

I keep thinking of my kids and my wife. And I know that I must not do this. But I donâ€™t think I can stop myself. I know itâ€™s weak. I know some people will say I deserve it. I am starting to think this is true. 

I am so ashamed. So, so, ashamed. And so sorry.
