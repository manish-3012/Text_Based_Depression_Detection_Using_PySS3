So hungry I want to dieI have no eaten a meal in two and a half months. Iâ€™ve had a throat issue then and been too anxious to eat normal food. Today I feel very weak and like Iâ€™m going to vomit. My depression was already heavy but now I have no relief. Iâ€™m starving, anxious always, and have no energy. I want to kill myself everyday .
