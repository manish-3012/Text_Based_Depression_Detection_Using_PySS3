People have been urging me to take therapy before I kill myself but I won't because I'm pretty sure it's b*******For the last 10 years people have been telling me that I should get therapy before I do something terrible to myself. But I've met someone who took therapy. She constantly reminds herself how beautiful she is and how she has worth. But the truth is she looks like a fucking morbidly obese frog. She sits in her room all day and only briefly comes out to make everyone else miserable. She's cruel to animals and people alike. Everyone still avoids her at all cost. One day someone will find her lonely decomposing body sitting in front of her computer. Now she's so self-important that she post dozens of Facebook pictures of her in front of a river meditating. It looks like therapy just made her delusional. Therapy didn't help her why would it help me?
