Idk what to even title this.I'm just so tired. I wish I didn't freeze up every time I tried to end it. If I didn't I wouldnt be here any more, and why should I be here? I honestly cannot rationalize being here. I'm told I'd be stop being so depressed if I tried but the harder I try the worse it hurts when my attenots at fixing it fail. And they always fail. It's gotten to the point where I'm about to to tell literally everyone to fuck off nothing will stop me.
