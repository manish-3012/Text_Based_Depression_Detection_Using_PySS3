Please Help!!!I don't want to die (although I strongly wish I can hang myself with impunity and that'd be so easy), I don't want to live like this. I've been sobbing all day for all my wrong choices. My husband cheated on me with his ex and 'escorts'. I lost my job due to covid. I freaking got infected with covid. Life is terrible now. I don't have any strength left in me. Please help. Please!
