At rock bottomGot covid , broke up with my gf , almost lost everything I had , a very dear family member died from covid...now now im finally getting my life back toghether.
But i live on rent , and im completely alone and things are very rough.
After paying my utilities , i had left 15 euros to eat , which are now gone .
I get paid in 18 days and all that I have left are a bit of rice and 2 bananas.I have nothing else I can sell .Only my phone is left which i need for my work.
I dont live in usa and my shitty country cant help me.I cant get a cash advance , there are no food banks in my city and honestly....i woke up last night and had a panic attack....the stress im dealing with is too much and i dont know how i will survive.Life is ugly and shitty and im at rock bottom.I have nobody to ask for help and all that I have left is 0.25 eurocents.
For whomever it might concern reading....i am done.
