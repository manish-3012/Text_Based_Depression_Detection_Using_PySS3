The blade under my pillow is singing to me. I can't escape it's melody.My thighs have healed making more room to let my pain flow free. My canvas is empty allowing me to bleed onto the floors. Just the thought of touching the razor causes my heart to skip a beat, like seeing the girl you love after a period of not being together. It's been a 2 weeks since I've touched it but now... Now it calls to me louder than before. Killing my lungs with my juul no longer can fill the void. I need to feel the sting of the razor as it slides across my skin. 

I'm tired of being 16, I want to be non existent.
