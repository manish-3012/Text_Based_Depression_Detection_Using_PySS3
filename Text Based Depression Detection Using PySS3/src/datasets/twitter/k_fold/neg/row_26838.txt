what makes you guys happy?maybe it isn't the best question to ask on a suicidal subreddit but a friend of mine, who I talked to today and said her that I have some suicidal thoughts, told me to concentrate more on stuff that makes me happy. Since she told me that I am asking myself what makes me happy and I seriously don't know a good answer to that. I thought maybe you guys could give me some examples of what makes you happy so something good comes to my mind.
