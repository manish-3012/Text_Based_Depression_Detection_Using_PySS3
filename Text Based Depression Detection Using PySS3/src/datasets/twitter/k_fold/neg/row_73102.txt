I feel like I'm inside of a box that just gets smaller and smaller. I want out and I feel like suicide is the only way.Emotional abuse, sexual abuse, rape, stress, bullying, physical abuse. It weighs on my mind constantly, the thought of my own life itself makes me want to die. I want help and I just want to get better but everything I try is useless. I feel so powerless.

I've tried to make friends, I've tried to talk to people, and it just doesn't work.

I just want a reason, literally anything that my brain can deem a good enough reason not to just end it all.

I'm 17 and I'm pretty smart, I'm not majorly ugly and I'm not overly fat, I could definitely get myself somewhere good in life and I know it, I just can't bring myself to do anything about it all.
