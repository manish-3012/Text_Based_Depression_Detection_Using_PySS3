How do people not feel like this?How do people have such strong motivation that they can go on to tackle huge tasks like going to school for 10 years to be a doctor, or go to a military service academy, or put up with a shitty job in hopes of achieving something? 

How?  I can hardly put up with waking up in the morning.
