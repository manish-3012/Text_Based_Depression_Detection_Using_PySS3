I've lost everything thats important to me. I don't see any point in continuing my life anymore.Just a little bit of background to how I've fallen into the hole I'm in:

I'm currently 15 turning 16 (probably wont be around to celebrate my birthday that is in a few days but i guess it wont really matter.)

Earlier this year I got a full time apprenticeship position as a mechanic specializing in automatic transmissions. I was able to leave school and pursue my dream of working on cars for a living. I also worked my way up for it since year 8 including a Pre trade course, working on my own vehicles at home and a few other things. I was getting majorly socially isolated and bullied. the apprenticeship felt like a dream come true. (which it was for me at the time.)

skip around after 10 weeks of working. i get told that the company was too ambitious to hire a apprentice and that they had to let me go (not due to my performance or anything.) 

I was outright devastated, I lost my place in my dream industry. I was told that I had 4 weeks to get a new apprenticeship or I have to go back to school (and catch up 1st term) or find secondary education 

Its now currently week 2, my motorbike needs attention and I don't have the funds to maintain my pride and joy anymore. my phone got broken and I found out my mother had a heart attack with all this crap going on trying to look for a new job. I honestly see no point... I feel like I'm going to fail at getting a new apprenticeship and have to deal with the bullying and isolation from school on top of trying to complete 10 weeks worth of work including the current. 

I feel like I should at least seek some help from others and see if i still feel the same way. I doubt my feelings will change although. i have been on and off with my thoughts since year 7 and i think this is where i break.

if you are reading this, thank you for reading my rant, I doubt many people will give a shit enough to read this.
