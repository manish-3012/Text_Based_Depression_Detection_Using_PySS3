As soon as I get my hands on a gun, I'll shoot myself.Not much to say, my life doesn't sucks, I have friends, a girlfriend that I love, I go to college and student debts aren't really a thing where I live, but for some reason I hate being alive. Being alive, physically hurts, every day, only smokes and alcohol helps me go through my day. I hate having thoughts, I hate feeling emotions, I hate having to breath, to eat, I hate having sexual needs, and most of all I hate myself. I don't care if my mother or my girlfriend cries anymore, fuck that, I'm sick of forcing myself to suffer every day. If they truly love me they'll get why I killed myself and forgive me. The only thing that keeps me alive is the fact that I don't have a fast and painless way to kill myself, so if I ever stumble upon a gun, I'll shoot myself as fast as I can, right in my fucking skull. it ain't just an idea or a thought, it's a PROJECT. Fuck this place, fuck everyone, and most of all, fuck me.
