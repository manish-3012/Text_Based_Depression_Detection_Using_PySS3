How do you keep from wanting to kill yourself?Ok, Iâ€™m at the end of my rope.

Iâ€™m 22, for the last 5 years, Iâ€™ve been profoundly miserable, and my body dysmorphia has been ruining my life for the entire time. In addition to this, Iâ€™ve spent these years experimenting with every drug I could get my hands on, (LSD and cocaine are the big two) As well as weed, Molly, sass, shrooms, alcohol, lean, Xanax, adderall, crack. My relationships have all been abusive and horrible, but thatâ€™s probably just me being a narcissistic piece of garbage. Iâ€™ve also sustained at least 3 concussions from football and just being careless around heavy furniture. Iâ€™m pretty sure I cracked my skull. Iâ€™m in constant pain, my face is aging so fucking fast and I think the drugs and concussions have made me slow and cognitively fucking retarded where I used to be congenial and popular with my peers. Now I get shakes, my hands and arms are always in pain, as well as my knees. Iâ€™m super sensitive to light, I donâ€™t appreciate art the way I used to. I spend hours looking at photos on my phone of better times. I had to move away from all my friends, who are just about sick of me, and now I live with my formerly abusive mother and her unemployed negging husband.  What can I do for myself? Why live? Give me a reason, please, because otherwise this life is garbage and I donâ€™t care about anything. Please, guys I just want to be healthy, but if it canâ€™t happen fast, Iâ€™m just gonna off myself, because Iâ€™m not working for anything ahaha
