God I should kill myself.I'm a sex offender. What the fuck is wrong with me. I'm an awful person. Nobody deserves to be stuck talking to me. When I was near 11 and I shared a room with my younger brother I

I didn't do what you're thinking. I used my mouth. God it sounds so awful when I type it, my fingers feel weak from how much I just don't want to live, I don't deserve life. I've made many, many posts on here before, but I deleted them because I was feeling better at the time. Today I was already feeling bad, but the repressed memory of what I did came up out of nowhere, and I realized how worthless I am. Nobody knows but me. Every time I think about it I just push it down. I can't tell anyone because my mom was raped when she was 4, and what would she think of me then? I'm a cancer to everyone I know. I should kill myself. I know people might say "oh you do people like you" but I took a look in the mirror and I just can't stand to look at myself. I hate the way I look. Everyone always tells me to get a haircut because I'm a guy but its not even past my shoulders. I have had depression for a long time. I'm self diagnosed of course because of things I'll explain later, but I know it's depression because I've been having these feelings for over a year, and it's just gotten worse.  If my little brother knew what I did, I would definitely kill myself. I don't want to tell anybody because I don't want to put my mom through the trouble of dealing with it, as she's dealt with depression in 2 of my sisters, her all her life as she has an iron deficiency, and my step mom right now, since she lost her cat to old age. God I should not be alive. I don't know what to do with myself. Please, please tell me I'm not an awful person. I did it 5+ years ago, please tell me I'm still worth anything for doing it. Please tell me I have a reason to live, even though I don't. Please.
