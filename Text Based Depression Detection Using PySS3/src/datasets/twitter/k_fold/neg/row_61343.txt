Persistent pain and a loss of hopeHi Reddit,
I really don't feel well today, but I guess I feel good enough to ask for some help. I don't know what to say, but I guess I'll keep it to the things I feel most strongly. I am a transsexual/transgender and genderqueer woman in her early 20's. I deal with many health issues, some of which come from a rather fucked up childhood. The thing that hurts me most deeply is how difficult it is to live with my body. I feel that I can honestly say that I love myself. I am proud of that, and very thankful for it. Unfortunately I have health needs which are completely unaddressed by the medical system. The main one being sexual reassignment surgery. It's hard to describe the suffering that I go through on a daily basis to people who don't experience this. I've been doing my best to save money, but it always seems so fucking impossibly far away. And while I wait there is agonizing pain.
To be perfectly honest, today I had to really fight wanting to castrate myself. I'm a fairly logical and rational person, so I haven't done so. But the persistence of these feelings, and the fact that I have to pay for something so clearly medically necessary out of pocket really fucks me up inside.
I've genuinely attempted suicide many times in my life before, but not recently. I really try my best, but it's hard to have much hope in this life when I feel like all I have to look forward to from this world is oppression and hate for being who I am.
Thank you for listening.
