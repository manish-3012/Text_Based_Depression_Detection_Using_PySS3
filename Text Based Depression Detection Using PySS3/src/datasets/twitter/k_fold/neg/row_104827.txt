My time is running out.No throwaway because Idaf anymore. Today I decided that suicide is an option, I've gone strong for 5 years battling both bipolar and depression. I feel like things aren't getting better soon, in fact everything is getting worse. The last 3 years have just been a constant struggle and I've been trying my hardest. I don't have any fight left in me. 
 
If things don't look up I won't be seeing 2019.

I guess I'm here to look for advice, although I think it's past that point now.
