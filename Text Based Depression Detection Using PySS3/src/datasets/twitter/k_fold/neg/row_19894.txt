Never thought I'd be back here. I think this might be itI was finally happy. I found a guy that loved me. I felt secure. I felt sure that he loved me back. I was worry-free for 6 months.

Last night he admitted that he thinks I'm too clingy. He isn't sure he's still in love with me, and has considered breaking up with me. He wants to go out more, without me, which is my biggest trigger. I've gone through this before in relationships. It was torture. Then they broke up. That was over 2 years ago, and I've only just gotten over it. Even with therapy and support from everyone around me.  I can't go through that kind of heartbreak again. It would literally kill me. I just can't go through it again. I can't lose him. I don't know what to do. I'm so fucked
