Probably going to end my life soon.As I am typing this, I currently have almost 50 pills of differing types laid out in front of me. I've recorded my last words, typed my final goodbyes, except for this one to those who will see it. I'm 18, in 3 months I would have been 19. Currently have a job at Best Buy. And am not going to college because it's too expensive. I did live with my parents up until around a month ago, where I was kicked out and moved in with my grandparents. 

My girlfriend of 2 years and 8 months broke up with me last week, and I've come to terms with that. There was a lot I didn't do in the relationship that I could've done better. There were things we could've communicated better. We did not, and after a long history of depression, I finally wish to take my final step.

 I looked into the LD50s for some of these pills, and I'm taking enough for a 200 lb man to be able to die. I really hope I don't wake up tomorrow and have to go to work, since that alone would push me even farther over the edge. 

If anyone does respond to this before I do pass out, I might see it. I don't know when I specifically will, but at least I'll read some of it. 

For the rest of you out there, keep pressing forward if you can. Might not always be good but at least you're alive yknow? I've just dealt with enough to where I don't wish to be.
