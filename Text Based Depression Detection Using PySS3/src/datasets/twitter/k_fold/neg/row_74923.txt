Sometimes I wonder if it is going to ever get betterIt's so hard to keep going nowadays. It literally feels like I'm hanging on by a thread. I think one day I'll completely snap and go insane, I don't know if I'll be able to come back from that. Some days it's like I'm Truman and everything I've ever known is fake. I don't want to ever commit because I don't know if I can do that to my family. I know they'll never forgive me, but some days I feel like the only way I can stop the voices in my head are by ending it. I hope what they say is true, that it does eventually get better. But what if I'm the exception, and it never gets better. What if I make it all the way to the over ripe age of 80 and still feel this way. Are they lying when they say it gets better? Do they say that just to keep people from killing themselves. Like a treat they can get if they sit and wait? What even is better?
