30 years is too much.I didn't ask to come into this world. In fact, I was meant to be an abortion. But because I had a twin, they let mother keep us. Of course, I absorbed the triplet. So, why the hell should I stay? I've always felt like I was living on borrowed time.

I'm 30, 300 lbs with severe social anxiety, rapid cycling Bipolar, Schizoeffective disorder, Agoraphobia, PTSD from mother induced trauma, type 2 Diabetes, hypothyroidism, PCOS, a severely low credit score (thanks student loans) from failing college twice, no social training at all because I spent my time growing up in RTFs and hospitals, I was forced into pregnancy and child birth (with no medicine), have been emotionally tortured and manipulated by my parents for years, by ex boyfriends who do nothing but lie and cheat like my ex husband did, I'm poor because I live off of SSI, can't afford a car, don't have a license, live in a place that the rent is too fucking high, and I am stuck.

In my posts, you can read more to get a more in-depth view, but I'm struggling.

I already overdosed and almost died last year, but I lived. I wanted to die. I tried to be happy, tried to find my silver lining, but now I'm heading back to the dark part that wants to end it all again. Yes, overdosing scared the shit out of me, but after it was over and I was released from the ICU and psych unit (another one, yay..!), It became a blip to remember. And I'd do it again. I'm trying, every day, to find a reason to be happy and keep going, but I'm failing. I'm more depressed now than last year during the time of OD.

I'd love to talk to my therapist, but all he ever does is ask me how I feel, why, and when I can't explain it, he dismisses it as "depression". I need to "exercise and diet". I've tried for years. It doesn't work. It doesn't stay off and it doesn't make a big enough impact for me to stay changed. I feel cheated. Why am I alive?

I want to just say "fuck it", and end it. I know, "life is worth living, you can't feel relief if you're dead, you should call the suicide hotline, someone loves you", BLAH BLAH BLAH. Been there, done that, heard it all before. There has to be something more concrete than the typical limp wristed attempt to defer someone's emotional hardship from the shoulders of friends, family, or strangers, because let's face it: "Your feelings are too much for me to handle, and I'm not qualified for this! Uh, don't give up, honey, do it for your (insert valued thing here)! It only gets better from here! Um...Suicide is a cowards way out?"

Gods. I don't see the fucking point.

"I can't wait til you're 18"

"*Laughter at my attempt to stand up for myself*"

"She (old cat) thinks you're stupid"

"You're fat, you're my daughter, you're meant to be like me"

"I love you" (proceeds to never show it)

"(Goes to hug mom) Not right now, it's too hot" (every time)

"Why can't you be more like twin brother?"

"You want a sex change to be like your brother? You're insane"

"I can't come see you this weekend" (even after promising for months)

"I never said that"

"I never did that"

"What do you mean 'you want me to be you'?"

"You came to the wrong house (thanks Mom)"

"Not my fault you were arrested and sent to Juvy, you tried to run away from school and home"

"You're toxic, just like your grandmother"

"I don't love you anymore"

"You make being in love with you so hard"

"No, I'm not having sex with anyone else, we're married"

"She's just a friend"

"I need you to leave the house for a while, I'll respect you if you give me space"

"I fucked her twice"

"We're together but separate"

"We're over"

"You're a wife in a life with no room for one"


I'm done.
