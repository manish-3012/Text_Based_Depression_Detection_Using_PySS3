They call you coward for wanting to dieThey clearly do not know what lies beyond the abyss, there is something beyond rock bottom, encroaching upon us. 

You will wish I killed myself, you hypocrite bastards. But that would be the coward way out, isn't that right, society.

I wonder where you hypocrites will run to, what you will blame next, because its one or the other. Pick one.
