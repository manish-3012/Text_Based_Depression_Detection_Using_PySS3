Isolated myself almost entirely because of depression, got no future, no money -- fuck all except my cat. Im so ready for this all to be over.Im so tired of this.
Not just this pandemic but my entire life

I keep trying to change things but it gets shit on. 

New job? Nope they've withdrawn the post.
More money? Boss wouldn't even give a manager a payrise let alone me
New friends? Keep isolating myself and never replying to anyone


Literally its just two people and my parents now.

Im so done with all this. 
Its just a constant circle of shit and im done. 
If my cat wasn't alive I'd do it tonight.
