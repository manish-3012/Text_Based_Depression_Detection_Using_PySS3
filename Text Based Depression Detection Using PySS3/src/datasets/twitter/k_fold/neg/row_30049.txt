emptyempty. just empty. 

nothing is enjoyable or gives me happiness anymore.  

i called the nurses and talked for a while. i wanted to say to them that im about to end it today, but ive said it many times so it felt.. dunno. not worth it. i might go to the bridge tonight. i haven't been there in a while now. i haven't jumped yet but i know ill do it any time soon. i want to sit on the railing if possible, stare into nothing and fall. 

for some reason i couldn't get these words out of my mouth when i was talking to them. i usually don't have that huge of problem telling them, but today and now it just didn't go. 

when i was at the meeting today the nurse i usually go to told me even if i don't feel like it it's getting better and is better than last summer. she says this doesn't mean im well but it's better. 

so just because i can do some dishes, food etc it means im better mentally? no it does not. 

she asked what i wanted to work with and what im interested in. like, nothing. i haven't been thinking about work or doing something during the days. i haven't thought that far. only thing i think about and can think about is taking my own life every single day. i only see myself gone in the future and nothing else.

i don't want this anymore. i want to be gone. today.
