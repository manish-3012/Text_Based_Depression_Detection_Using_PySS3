Reputation ruined due to slander on Facebook. I know it sounds pathetic :/Long story short, I'm a masseuse, and often times i'm around girls that are naked, minus a towel. Someone heard a rumor that I was taking advantage of that situation and hitting on/making moves on these girls because they were comfortable around me. this was sent to another person via text, and that conversation was posted on facebook for thousands to see. 

I know it sounds so pathetic, but i'm having a panic attack, and i've been throwing up all day because of this. I'm not even friends with this person on Facebook, I don't even know them, and I honestly have not even looked at the comments of that but this person has so many friends that are also acquaintances  of mine, and I'm certain that this is getting out of hand, and everyone i know now thinks im a fucking creep and I can't handle this.

I know this might sound like a petty problem compared to some other stuff here, but in my country, reputations like this are such a big deal, and i've already gotten a few texts about implying that people are disgusted in the comments, hate me, etc, so i know it's bad and I don't even wanna see it. 

My heart has been pounding out of my chest all day and i just want this to end. 

I'm not saying I'm suicidal, but due to the severeness (i know that is not the right word but I don't know the correct word) of this situation, i feel like if this continues i might just want it to stop.

if anyone has any words of advice on how to not let this get to me, I would very very thankful to you.
