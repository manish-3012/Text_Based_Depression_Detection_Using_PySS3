My mother who adopted me past away and thereâ€™s nothing I could do about itI donâ€™t know what to do at this point. Sheâ€™s in California and I am in Oregon studying. She broke up with my â€œdadâ€ so I am left with no family! Her family is in Britain but I donâ€™t think they care. We called everyday to check in with each other and she seemed fine. What I probably didnâ€™t realize was she is depressed or whatever I donâ€™t know to provide me with education I think.... she paid for all my tuition and living costs for school... I donâ€™t think i can visit her as flight tickets are expensive! I donâ€™t even know what theyâ€™re going to do with her body.. at this point thereâ€™s no point of living as I have no one to live for. All I wanted was to make her proud... well she doesnâ€™t exist anymore..I donâ€™t know what to do.. maybe I can get a job and quit school just to see her,. Her body will probably be burnt by then... I donâ€™t know why life is like this
