My boyfriend is suicidal. He doesnâ€™t have a plan, but could make one at any time. Things are getting worse.My boyfriend is 19 and Iâ€™m really worried about him. He is severely depressed, and desperately needs therapy. I am really worried about him hurting himself although I donâ€™t think he will do anything any time soon I know that things are heading that direction. 

Since heâ€™s an adult the only way I can get him to get therapy is by force (he absolutely refuses to go). I need to tell his mom but I donâ€™t know if it will do any good because he isnâ€™t actively trying to hurt himself. I need him to get help but I donâ€™t know how to get him help if he wonâ€™t go on his own. 

What do I say to his mom, I need to tell her but I donâ€™t know what to say.
