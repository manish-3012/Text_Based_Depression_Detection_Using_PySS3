This is my first post to the sub.I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. I can remember being a moody little shit when forced to spend at night at my grandparents' home. I remember all sorts of little things from elementary school that haunt me to the day. I was bullied. Blah Blah Blah. 

I hate myself.

I hate how I look, how I talk, I hate how I keep fucking up.

This post is not, I repeat, it is not about me killing myself. 

This post is about me not really wanting to be alive. Like.. I don't care. The other day a friend of mine got drunk and he challenged me, saying that I actually do care about pain and life. Next thing you know there's a strategically started chemical fire on my wrist and now I have second degree burns. 

This post is just for people who feel kinda similar, not like they want to die right now, I guess, just people who don't really care. 

I have half a bottle of bourbon and I'll be around a little bit.

Peace, friends.
