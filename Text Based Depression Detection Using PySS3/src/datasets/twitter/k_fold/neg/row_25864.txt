lonelyI have zero friends, none
I am a good person, I haven't done anything to anybody since I was a little kid
I was very social last year, very outgoing, very nice
people will be nice to me in a conversation, but they don't want to be my friend
every time i would start to get closer to them, they eventually would just start to ignore me
I have no idea why
I do go to school in an area known for having snobs, it's not just a stereotype for my city it holds truth
I guess I just wish it different
I don't fit in here, people only want to be friends with people like them I guess, the jackass who only cares about himself and his shoes is the most popular, and the best looking girl.
I've thought about confronting the people who started to ignore me, but I'm not social anymore, they destroyed me. plus, I think I already know the answer, they just didn't like me and didn't want to aknowledge my existence anymore. I could be wrong, but that's my best guess. I have done nothing this summer, and now it's almost over, no friends, just been sitting at home doing nothing, playing video games by myself, doing everything by myself. meanwhile people are going to other countries, hanging out with their friends, staying up til 3 am. I'm so lonely I think I'm just going to end it, I am so depressed, my pain is indescribable, I am so lonely
