Done.My dad moved away for the year for his job. My mom and I donâ€™t get along and always fight. All I want is for my senior year to be over so I can see my dad again. When Iâ€™m done we are moving. Iâ€™ve been bullied my whole life and I can already tell this year is gonna be worse. My girlfriend and I are struggling. Her parents hate me and we canâ€™t hang out because of that and itâ€™s the middle of summer. Only thing keeping me going is my jeep. And my girlfriend. But I need help. Please.
