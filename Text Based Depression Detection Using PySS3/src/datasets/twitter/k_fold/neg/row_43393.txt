Code blueI suffer from bipolar 2 and I'm taking lexapro and lithium, but lately my depression is particularly crippling to what I call code blue. This is where I am suicidal but my anxiety is so high I can't get out of bed. I'm seeing my new psychiatrist next week, but I don't know how much more of this I can take. 

Tldr: I'm suicidal but I'm afraid to die
