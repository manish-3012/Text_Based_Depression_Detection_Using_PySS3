It's been like this for years. I don't want to do it anymoreI was diagnosed at 12 but managed ok until university where I was hospitalized 4 times and had to drop out of school. 
I turned to drugs, got clean 10 years ago, but I haven't been happy since. 
I go to work, go home, go to bed. I have no friends, no lover, just memories of times long ago that were good. 
I think I once got up in the morning and didn't just focus on getting back to bed. 
I was just released from a month of inpatient and am scheduled to start ECT on Friday. I have tried every med combo out there last year, while I was hospitalized for 8 months, I'm ok to start ECT. I've done it before and the side effects didn't bother me too much, and it seems like the last thing left. 
But I'm having trouble even getting to Friday. I'm constantly reading about suicide, starting notes and not finishing them, stockpiling meds and trying to clean house so that I won't leave too much of a mess. 
Everything just seems hopeless, and the guilt of hurting people isn't enough to keep these thoughts at bay. They've changed from me hurting them to me finally stopping hurting them. 
I don't know what to do.
