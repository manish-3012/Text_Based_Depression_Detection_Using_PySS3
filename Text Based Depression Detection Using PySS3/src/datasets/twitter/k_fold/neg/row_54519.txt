What do I do about someone online who is cutting/really suicidal/might be being watched by a male while doing all of the aboveLook I normally don't do this. I've learned one thing from the internet and that is you don't get involved.

This is a rare case. I found an account on a community (not facebook or a social one) that is uploading pictures of her cuts/a bunch of suicidal notes and thoughts/and even states that she cut herself on camera while the person watched. He did nothing. This is where I kind of got sick and thought back to one of the girls who were harassed cyber-ly and commited suicide. 

I don't want to personally involve myself - I want to report it to the police or something of that sort. The community that she's apart of doesn't really have a "suicide" type of rule so I'm afraid they'll end up deleting it without even taking notes of the behavior. 

This is obviously a throwaway. I would just like some advice.
