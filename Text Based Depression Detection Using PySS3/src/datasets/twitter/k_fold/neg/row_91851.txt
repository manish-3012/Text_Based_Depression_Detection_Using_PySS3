Passive thoughts....and first post here....Depression started \~1 yr ago

Had Suicidal thoughts then and I was better briefly 1-2 months (with zoloft) and lately I am back to the way I felt before. 

Still kinda hope that one night I will fall asleep and just not wake up. I never feel happy anyways, so what is the point of life? 

**I have NO plans or intent right now btw!** But the thoughts and the pain is still there.....
