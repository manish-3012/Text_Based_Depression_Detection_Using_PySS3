How did you guys keep going on?I know it might sound childish so i apologize in advace for a long nagging
I lost my parents when i was 13 and i do have a history of depression and suicide attepts but none for atleast 6 years
For the past year my life if I had been a complete shitshow I cut myself off from my family financially got my own Place looked like everything was on the right track and then it started i got hit by car And that lead to me falling another semester behind because of the injuries and inconsideration of my university my girlfriend of 3years (actually yesterday was the anniversary of the day we met) broke up with me and just as the new smester was starting boom
The whole world gets blown away by a viral outbreak ofcourse uni shuts down (dentistry) and im stuck with my thoughts
Stuck with all the little rituals the nicknames the memories and all the idiotic promises that seems so hollow now
Stuck alone in a home that we made still unable to use her side of the bed
To make matters worse my bestfriend of 9 years "breaks up" with me saying that all the times that we hang out i had ulterior motives and ...
I've always had the thought of non-existance like a permanent "its a wonderful life" show in my brain
But during these times i can only see how my dying wont affect much
I stopped texting friends and family just to see how long would it take for people to notice im not around and it took 68 hours till anyone texted or called
I even chose my method for when i decide to end it.
So i gotta ask you guys
The ones who still carry the scars
The ones whe stopped at the last second
What made you stop trying?
