Hey now the only thing keeping me alive is the possibility of study abroadI fucking feel guilty about being raped. Does fingering me count as rape??? Does not saying no count as rape? Does sitting there crying and then making myself finish so I could leave count as rape? Why do I still feel like thatâ€™s my fault? Itâ€™s not my fault but it is my fault because I went to the dorm and I stayed there even though I didnâ€™t want to. I thought Iâ€™d help me get over Francisco but it made everything so much worse. I hate myself for making that decision and I hate myself for saying nothing and doing nothing. I hate how I look and I hate how I feel and I hate my body and my soul and my heart. Iâ€™m just this ugly twisted little thing thatâ€™s limping around because I hurt myself and canâ€™t get over the fact that I did it to myself and thereâ€™s nobody else to blame. I canâ€™t blame him. He was just stupid and didnâ€™t know what he was doing. I canâ€™t blame â€œthe worldâ€ because what the fuck is the world??? How do you even define that? â€œI canâ€™t blame Francisco because even he wasnâ€™t *that* bad. He at least told me the truth sometimes of how terrible and gross and disgusting I am to the rest of the world. Iâ€™m a waste of space. I contribute nothing and I take everything. I donâ€™t give anything in return to my parents. I barely call my mom and I never say that I love her. I just ask and ask and ask my dad for things and I never give him anything back. I am literally the definition of excess and waste. I am nothing important, so why do I act like I deserve to be important? What is that voice in my head thatâ€™s so disillusioned and positive? Who the fuck does she think she is?
