i want help but donâ€™t know how to get itwell a few months ago my mom saw my leg plastered with scars from all the cuts on it, and now iâ€™ve basically stopped eating in general aswell. my moods been drastically worse... my mom thinks me not eating is because iâ€™m doing ramadan lol iâ€™m not muslim or even religious at all, sheâ€™s just denying anythingâ€™s wrong. i feel like if i tell her i want to go to a psychologist sheâ€™s going to say no and never take me. even the only person i know that would help me through shit has just stopped talking to me, and itâ€™s funny because she stopped talking to me right after i told her the most personal shit and about how i want to die because iâ€™m a useless piece of shit, mind you this was just a couple days after she told me she would always be there for me if i needed to talk, and now i guess i drove her away just like i do everyone else :) i guess the times getting closer now, i just need to finish up my notes for everyone i care about then off to the train station it is.
