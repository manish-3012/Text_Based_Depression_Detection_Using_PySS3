Too Much AbuseI'm planning right now. I want to go quickly, but I know there's no quick way. Background: all my adult life I've been abused. I was abused emotionally, sexually, and physically in the Air Force. Emotionally and sexual abused from my ex. Now my current husband emotionally abuses me. I'm done. I obviously can't have healthy relationships. All I am is a paycheck and a warm body. My current husband has just left me. I've cut some deep gashes, but nothing deep enough to kill. I want to go drive into a body of water. I think that'll work.
