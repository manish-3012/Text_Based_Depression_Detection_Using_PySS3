I'm a failureLost my unborn child. My boyfriend hates me. I have nothing to offer and I can't even commit suicide right. I just want to turn it all off. What else is there but more failure. I just want to be worth something. Can't be a mother. Can't be a girlfriend. Will never be a wife. Will never be anything.
