My girlfriend of 5 years broke up with me out of the blue yesterday. I've never had suicide thoughts until now.Everything I see makes me think about her. Everything that happens to me makes me want to run and share with her. I desperately miss her. She was my best friend. I have no one else. "Never again" is too much time for me. My heart is hurting so much.  I never felt so much pain in my entire life.
