Surprise surprise, I think I'm suicidalYeah, I (M 19) fucked up, made the biggest mistake of my life, cheated on my longtime girlfriend

I know I'm the fucking bad guy here, and I'm trying to find a way to live with myself but I just can't

It's all my fault, I recognize that, there's no one else to blame, I fucking dug my own grave and now I'm just laying in it, hoping it'll all end, hoping I'll just fucking leave and make the world a much better place in the process

I thought I'd grow old with this girl, but I fucked up and now I'm paying for it, she's paying for it, I've caused so much hurt and pain

I hurt her, I lost her, I had something perfect and threw it all away

I can't bear the thought that I, singlehandedly, caused so much fucking pain

I don't fucking know who I am
