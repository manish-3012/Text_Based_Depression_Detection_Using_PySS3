This is the worst it's ever been. I dont think I'll make it out of this one.I cant think of a time I was happy since 2013. Im sick of always feel guilty about everything. Ive been in a constant state of panic for 5 years. I cant keep a job, because I keep having breakdowns, and quiting. I cant get another job, because most one wants to hire me after looking at my resume. I'm taking care of my mothers sick animals, and I'm running out of money. Also, my brother and i tried repairing her leaky roof, and just made it worse. I told my mom I would pay for it if she hired a professional to do it, but she says no. People on Friday internet told me I need to call a contractor for give me a quote without asking my mom first, so hes gonna show up tommarrow, and my moms probably gonna flip out. On top of that, I just found out my neighbor got a puppy. This worries me, because he told me he use to hit his dogs to train them, and I'm afraid hes doing. The same thing to the puppy, so of course I'm obligated to confront him about that. My sister use to hit her dog to, and I had a talk with her about it, and was hoping is never be in that situation again. Also my truck is broken down, and will wind up costing more on repairs then its actually worth, so I need to look for another car to buy. My moms and alcholic who refuses to get help, and it makes everything else worse. Even if I stick around and make it past this, I know sorting else will go wrong. I cant do it anymore, I really cant, but if I kill myself, then my mothers pets will be left behind. That puppy will be left behind to potentially be abused. My mothers house will rot, not to mention my family would be destroyed. I feel like I'm hell, and it's a never ending loop of the same horrible problems forever. Some people aren't meant for this world, and I think I'm one of those people.
