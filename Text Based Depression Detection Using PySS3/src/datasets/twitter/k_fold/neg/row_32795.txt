happening againI'm sitting at work as i type this.  I just took on a new role and its very confusing... very sensitive... very important... but I can't get through anything.  Everybody else just walks all over me and i cant deal with it anymore.

I have a pair of scissors at my desk and I just opened them and pressed my thumb against them as hard as I could.  I am such a fuck up that I can't even get that right.

I can get roof access from the main staircase.  I've never gone up there, but I know it is there.  6 floors down.  I don't know if it would kill me, but I know that it would at least hurt me worse than a pair of scissors.

Barring that there is my car.  I would hate to think of hurting someone else, but there's insurance, and if you hit a wall going fast enough, as long as nobody is there then it would be ok.

I'm just so depressed right now.  I can't deal with all this stress.  I'm sitting here typing on here when I should be working.

im such a fuck up.  the world would be better off without someone like me.
