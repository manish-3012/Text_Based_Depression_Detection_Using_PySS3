Last night was going to be the night.I went in, determined to end it all. Usually when I go night walking I just want to relax for a while. But this was different. My body clearly got anxious, as did I.
"It's just eternal sleep, you'll wake up in someone else's body in another life and it'll be fine", is what I keep telling myself. But is that *really* how it works?
I've been trying to overcome this fear of death but nothing seems to cut it. I'm definitely one step closer, though.
I spent ~30 minutes recording voice memos explaining my trauma, probable cause of death and giving my legacy and my belongings away to the people that matter - not my family. 

Two of my friends think I'm dead. So I guess I got that going for me. But I'm alive, the grind to "relieve my suffering" continues. ðŸ™„

Not sure why I posted this.
