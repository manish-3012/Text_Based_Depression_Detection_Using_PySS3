It's simple. I don't want to live anymore.I'm so fucking exhausted. Tired of trying to improve my situation, when it never gets any better. I've made no progress at all. I'm 19, and I feel like the loneliest man on earth. My girlfriend left me nearly 2 years ago, blamed me for her bulimia and depression, told me she wants to be alone. Within a month, she's with some other guy, who's older than me, taller than me, richer than me, and probably has a way bigger dick than me. Not that I should care, but it drives me insane. I still love her. Meanwhile he fucking tweets about tying her up. She says she wants to be friends one day, but I know she hates me. I know she pities me, and I know she laughs at me, because I'm still hung up on some bitch I dated 2 years ago.

I'm in university, should be easy to meet girls, right? So I'm told. I haven't made a single new friend since I started, and I'm already in my second year. Plus all these essays are not helping at all. I have 3 papers due in 4 days, haven't started a single one, and I feel completely inadequate and unable to even complete one. I feel stupider than all my peers, like I don't deserve to be where I am. But right now, it's the only thing that keeps me alive. I need some immediate goals, or else my mind wanders. So I need to keep focusing on going to school, so I can have the illusion that MAYBE one day I'll meet some cute girl and I'll finally be able to stop feeling sorry for myself. But the school assignments just put even more pressure on me. 

I'm living in a house with a few friends right now, but our lease is up and now we've got nowhere to go, because for some reason nobody wants to rent to us. So it looks like I'm gonna be moving back in with my parents. That's just another step backward. All the money I put into this, all the time I spent, all for nothing. I still haven't kissed another girl (my ex was my first and only kiss). 

It's not that people don't care about me. My parents love me, the few friends that I do have respect me. But I'm in so much constant pain. I don't want to think about her anymore. I've been stuck on her for years, thinking of her almost every moment of every day. I want the pain to stop. I feel like this is my best option. Just cut myself off from the world permanently. As childish as it is, I want her to miss me. I want her to feel as bad as I do for what she did to me. The only thing stopping me from ending it all is my parents. They mean a lot to me, I don't want to hurt them. But I feel like the pain they receive from losing me can't compare to the pain I experience every day.
