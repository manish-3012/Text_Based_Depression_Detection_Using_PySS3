Can you bring a razor/knife into a therapists office?I know you're probably not suppose to, but can they check? I plan on getting a therapist once the corona is over and I need to know I'll be able to kill myself if something goes wrong and they're not in the room. I know it's wrong to let them see me like that but I need to know.
