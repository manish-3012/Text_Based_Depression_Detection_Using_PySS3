SOSHonestly, I hesitated to post on here but after a couple days of reading others post I think Iâ€™m ready to bring my thoughts to my keyboard. Recently my girlfriend had a miscarriage. Afterwards she was broken I could see the life slowly leaving her body day by day. I tried to comfort her, but it seemed as if she was too numb to the pain for me to help her. I could never have understood her grief even though I tried. Last week she took her last breath in this earth, the pain was too much for her to bear. Ever since Iâ€™ve been in such distraught. I feel like nobody understands how heartbroken I am. I just want to feel again. Maybe thatâ€™s why she did it.. she got tired of feeling nothing.
