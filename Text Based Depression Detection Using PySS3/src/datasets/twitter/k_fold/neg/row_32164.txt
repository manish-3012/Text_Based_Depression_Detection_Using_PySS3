Does it ever get better?I tried to kill myself recently. The first few days after I was abnormally happy....which I thought was weird. Now Iâ€™m just sad Iâ€™m still alive. I donâ€™t necessarily want to be dead because the pain that I put my family through isnâ€™t something Iâ€™d ever prefer to do to them again; however, Iâ€™m just kinda having a hard time coping with the fact that Iâ€™m still here. I lost my girlfriend. I lost my job. I have no money. I think when people say â€œit gets betterâ€ are just lying to make you stay.
