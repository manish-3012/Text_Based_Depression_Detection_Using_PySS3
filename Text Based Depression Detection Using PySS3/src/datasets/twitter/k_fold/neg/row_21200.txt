After 2 attempts, I am going to get it right this timeI don't know what to do anymore. I need an out from the pain. Self harming is not working anymore. I am sober and I know if I relapse for sure I am gone. My life is not that bad, but my BPD is taking over. No matter what coping skills I use I just can't get past my problems. I am not even asking for an easy fix. I am willing to work my ass of to feel better its just I feel like the more effort I put in the worse off I feel. I have all my medication sitting and waiting for me. I need the hospital but I just can't make the call this time or drive myself. I just don't think I want to be hospitalized anymore.
