Please, stop me.You know how people tell you that life doesn't ever turn out like you want it to be. Well, that's not the case for me. I have everything that I ever wanted. My parents love me more than anything, I have a full scholarship for a top ten college, my grades are excellent. My professors like me, my research mentor loves my work, My boss has been hinting about giving me a raise. I am well financially, I have never had any real hardships. I do not have any friends now, but I had good friendships before. I'm only seventeen and a sophomore in college. My depression started less than a year and it does not seem to be related to anything. I have never searched for any kind of help. I read other posts about people wanting to end their lives because of legitimate things, things that I do not even begin to wrap my mind around, and it kind of makes me feel bad for having depression for apparently no reason. As you see my life is kinda great. I think I am going to kill myself today. I have the means to do it, it is right beside me as I type. I just want to sort of intervene with what I set out to do. I just hope that someone can get me to see that this is not the answer before I do it. I really hope someone does.
