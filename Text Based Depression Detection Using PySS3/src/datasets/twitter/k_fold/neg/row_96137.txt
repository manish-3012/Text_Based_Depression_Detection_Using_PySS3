Today I end my life, for real this timeToday marks a full year since I flunked out of university and my life has been hell ever since. I can't get a job and I can't go back to school and my savings just ran out. Lost all my friends and my family is fed up with my meaningless existence and so am I. This is not another empty threat I really will do it this time.
