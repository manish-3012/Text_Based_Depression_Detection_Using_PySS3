Anybody else recently hear about the use of Tylenol (Acetomenaphin) to fight "existential anxiety?" God if ever a description of my life was written that would be the title.(Here)[http://www.chron.com/life/healthzone/article/Can-Tylenol-help-ease-anxiety-4442777.php] is the link re the tylenol.  Frankly I'm glad to hear of existential anxiety - till now I thought I was the only person who felt like he could hear grass grow and cars rusting.  It seems all I do is worry about what will go wrong next.
