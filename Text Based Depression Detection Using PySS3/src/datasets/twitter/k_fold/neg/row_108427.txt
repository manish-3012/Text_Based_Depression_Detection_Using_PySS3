The single most scary thought is, that I might never kill myselfI don't really know what I want to achieve with posting here. I probably hope to get some relief by venting and maybe to sort my thoughts a little bit. 

I don't really have one big reason, why I want to die. In fact I probably have most things a functional person would need to mak, whats generelly considered a good life. My parents were only together because my mother got pregnant with me , there were never real feelings between them and when I was 15 the ultimately got a divorce. I fully perceived this when I was a child, but I also can't say that I ever had the impression they weren't trying to make my life as easy as possible. They genuinely cared for me and probably still do. School was difficult, I always was a neurotic anxious mess so I also always was "that odd guy". Despite that, compared to what could be expected, I wasn't severly bullied, many just couldn't make sense of me and a few other probably actually tried to somehow reach out. In retrospect I probably always was apathic. I had no drive to be good at anything, I had no drive to make friends and the idea that I had a future was just something unreal. I spend my days mostly watching TV and later on the internet, I never was physically active and the recently the toll of that lifestyle shows more and more. School at least provided my some sort of structure. I had to get up, I had to eat at certain times and graduation was a goal I could actually somehow orient towards. 

After graduation it just got worse. I started at a university and I can remember talking to a single person, the whole semester. I never learned to socialize, but I was suprised it was that bad. I also barely learned anything, I didn't understand the organisational things, I was to anxious to ask anyone and I also didn't really care. I droped out after that semester and did nothing for the following half year. After that I started at a college, with the same results after 3 semester. I can't socialize, I have no motivation to learn and the worst thing is that I don't care. I know, that the state of mind I'm in is unhealthy and bad but if I think about it, there is no will to make things better and honestly there never was hope, that it could get better.

Three years ago I met my current girlfriend on the internet, I droped out again and we moved into the same university city to be closer. I guess I hoped that having someone that close would would at least be a reason for me to get my shit together, at least wanting it, but there was just nothing. I really like her, I can enjoy doing things with her, I care about her probably as much as I am able to care for someone. Which sadly is not that much, if I can't even care for myself. I talked with her about that, I wanted to make sure, she understands how I feel as much as possible and that I have no future. I told her quite directly, that she shouldn't feel bad for leaving me, if she has the impressions this relationship hinders her on the direction towards her goals in life. I know its quite cowardly to try to lay down all responsibility like that, but I truly believe, being honest is the only thing I can do.

I'm soon turning 25, for my whole life it went downhill. There was no major traumatic experience, that would explain my situation, no abuse or anything that would deny me a promising upbringing. I was in therapy for years, but I don't if it helped a single bit. I may know where some neurosis and fears come from, no healthy way to cope with it. Besides my girlfriend, who more and more seems to agree with me, I have no social contacts, no career future, even if I'd care the least bit about it and the only good thing you could say about my body is, that it can be used as prime example, that sitting 16h in front of a screen everyday, in fact is worse then alcohol and tobacco combined.

Besides knowing all of this, and in fact I knew where I was heading towards probably 10 years ago, I simply don't care. I should be angy, sad, devestated about how I life but all I feel and ever felt is apathy. In fact, I even have a quite clear image of what my life will be in 10 more years and all I can hope for is finding the strength to do this one single thing, to kill myself. My body is a husk, moved by the urges of the most basic instincts and instant gratificating dopamine rushes, anyway, just this one time I would have to overcome my self-preservation instinct. I can't imagine how painful it would be to actually experience how depressing my situation is, intead of just indifferently acknowledging it.
