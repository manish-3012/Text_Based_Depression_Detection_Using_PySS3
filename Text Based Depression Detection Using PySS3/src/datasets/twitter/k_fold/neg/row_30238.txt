Literally staying alive for one thing onlyThe only reason Iâ€™m still here is for my dog. I canâ€™t leave her, as much as I want to every single day. I feel like I owe it to her to stick around to take care of her. But god, if I had a guarantee that someone would love her and take care of her the way that I do, Iâ€™d be gone in an instant.
