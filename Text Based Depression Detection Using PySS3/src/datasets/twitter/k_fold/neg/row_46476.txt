I [18M] want to kill myself.I turned 18 last March and I've never really been happy in life. Unfortunately, I can't see things getting any better.

From the time I was little I was never allowed to be myself; anything deemed too feminine I couldn't do. When I was in first grade, I got molested by an older student, and that set my identify even further out of wack.

In middle school I lost all my elementary friends, and got bullied pretty harshly. I wasn't allowed to hang out with girls, so I really had no friends.

In my sophomore year of high school I finally gained some friends, but I always lied to my parents that I was also friends with guys... I still got bullied, but I felt okay. I soon realized, later on, that no friends I'll ever have will truly care about me.

Around this time I also got outed to my parents and it... didn't go well. Still isn't, and they prohibit me from hanging around any gays.

Lately I've been feeling washed up and useless. I hate my friends, my family, and on top of it all, my long-term ugliness is making me hate myself even more.

I feel like even if I were able to overcome all of this, I'd still never get over my past. But I don't even see myself overcoming any of this.

I have no one, I hate myself, I just don't know what to do.

So... why shouldn't I kill myself? No one would care and I wouldn't have to stress out over anything anymore.
