I donâ€™t know when itâ€™ll get better, because logically, it should be fine.The title says it all, really. Iâ€™m an 18-year old girl headed to a prestigious college next fallâ€”my first choice, actually. Parents and friends fell over themselves congratulating me.

I have friends (I think). I have a lot of people I can hang out with, but I also have a lot of people who consistently treat me with disdain and talk down to me because Iâ€™m the ugly, chubby, but lovable enough friend who you keep around to feel better about yourself. You know the type. Pretty if she lost 30 pounds. Sociable and always laughing because sheâ€™s not funny enough to make others laugh. Someone else could say the same thing she did and itâ€™d be ten times better coming from them because sheâ€™s no interesting person. Has lived her life like a romantic comedy without the happy endingâ€”a stream of unrequited interest, actually, punctuated briefly by guys who zoom in on her ass and seem to forget that sheâ€™s more than just a piece of meat theyâ€™re too ashamed to talk to around their friends.

I have a lot going for me. I have friends (superficial and bitchy though they might be, I do have a few true ones), my collegiate dreams came true, and my family isnâ€™t rich but decently well off. Iâ€™m sociable! I laugh all the time, for fuckâ€™s sake! Iâ€™m surrounded by plans on the weekend! But I am uncharismatic, chubby, awkward, inept everywhere I go. I laugh off the friends who speak down to me, eat furiously to combat the never-ending depression.

I donâ€™t know if itâ€™ll ever get better. Most things are okay externally but theyâ€™re really not. Iâ€™m really not.
