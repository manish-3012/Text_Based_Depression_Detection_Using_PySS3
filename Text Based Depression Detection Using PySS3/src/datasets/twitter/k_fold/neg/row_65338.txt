To all the people in their 20â€™sAll of your feelings are justified. The thing is, as a 32 year old whoâ€™s dealt with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was YOUR age, take a leap of faith when I tell you that itâ€™s going to be ok. The majority of posts here seem to come from people in their 20â€™s and specifically early 20â€™s. 

Look I get it. Today sucks. Tomorrow might suck worse but you killing yourself does nothing positive and isnâ€™t that the one thing you all want? Weather, whoever reads this is going through severe anxiety or depression suicide is NOT the answer. I can fucking promise you that no matter how you plan and think about killing your self, itâ€™s not the answer. The answer is to internally fight those thoughts that drag you into the dark abyss and say â€œno fuck you depression, anxiety, I choose, I fucking choose when I go. Not you, fuckerâ€. 

We all have low points and when weâ€™re in them we feel like thatâ€™s our world but the truth is you could walk a block in any direction and realize itâ€™s not. Mental health is a struggle but you need to exhaust every avenue in order to beat that fucking demon into the ground. Curb stomp that depression monster until it canâ€™t get up. 

Do what you all have to do so you donâ€™t want to hurt yourself or someone else
