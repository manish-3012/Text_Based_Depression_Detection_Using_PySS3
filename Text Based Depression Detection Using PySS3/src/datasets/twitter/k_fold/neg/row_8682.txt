Its my 18th birthday and I am feeling suicidalHey guys, I am turning 18 tomorrow and I feel horrible. I've been struggling with depression for 5 years . I recently started taking meds , but instead of helping me feel better I think I feel worse. I used to be so social and outgoing and for 1 year everything is going downhill.. I treat my family and my closest friends like shit and I cant help myself ignoring them and saying things i dont want to and it hurts me more than it hurts them.. I barely survive school, I am tired all the time and I lay in bed most of the day.. I feel alone as fuck all the time and Ive never had a one "true love". I think I have noone to talk to and share my pain with.. In school I have a group of "friends" with whom I only hang out to pass time and cant relate at all and they only talk to me if they want something... And there it is ,tomorrow is my birthday and instead of thinking of throwing a party and having a good time , I am thinking of how I am wasting my time , how worthless and insignificant I am, how I will fail in life and in univerity and how I want to die..
My brother's best friend killed himself when he was just 19 or 20 and I remember the pain he went through and I dont know if I can do this to him again...I feel like everyone know that I am feeling awful and there are trying to help me and I just keep rejecting them even tho I need their support, I feel horrible for that..
 I just want everything to be ok is it too much to ask for
