Suicide from rage. Suicide from frustrationI want to slit my fucking wrists and hang myself, I hate my stupid fucking job and i hate my miserable fucking life.

My job is a crock of shit. Itâ€™s stressful, i am under appreciated and underpaid and taken advantage of. I want to quit. If i quit i 1) as of right now donâ€™t have a follow up. 2) owe the company back for a sign on bonus and school costs. i financially canâ€™t do it. iâ€™m their fucking bitch. 

i am so stressed out and frustrated i want to fucking off the fuck out of myself. fuck this iâ€™m so sick of feeling this way. fuck the goddamn company . fuck everything . i have nobody or anything
