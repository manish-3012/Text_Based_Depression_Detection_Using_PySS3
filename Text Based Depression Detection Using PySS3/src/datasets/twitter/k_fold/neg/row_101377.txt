Please tell me it gets better...11 years old I thought about suicide for the first time. But I was a hopeful kid, I was only this upset because I didn't get along with my parents, right? Everything would be better when I went to college. I wanted to go to Cornell and become a vet.

16 years old I started drinking and doing drugs. I thought about suicide often, but always remembered the pact 11 year old me had made. So I filled my life with friends and boys, did my best in school, and patiently waited. 

18 years old I got to university. I was at a top school for engineering, far far away from all my problems back home. It took only one semester to realize this was a mistake; I was failing classes and the loneliest I had ever been in my entire life.

19 years old I attempted suicide for the first time. The second attempt would be in another few months. Both would go by largely unnoticed. I repeated to myself everyday that things would get better, and set another deadline for one year, when I turn 20.

I turned 20 a few days ago. I recently had a major breakdown and impulse dropped out of school. It's unlikely I'll be able to return due to financial aid issues. I can go to CC, but I would be five years behind my peers, and have no guarantee that I would get into any university considering my poor grades at my first school.

I'm scared and lost. Tell me it gets better? I'm having a hard time coming up with reasons to wait any longer.
