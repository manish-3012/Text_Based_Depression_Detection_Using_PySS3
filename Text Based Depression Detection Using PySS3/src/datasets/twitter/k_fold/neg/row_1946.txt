I am all alone.Lately I've considered throwing myself in front of cars on a road by my house. I can't stand my life and all the suffering that is this world. I don't want to talk to my parents or my therapist about these thoughts for fear of being thrown into the loony bin... I've been there and it sucks. I used to have a beautiful girl in my life who accepted me for who I am, but she's gone. I thought I might want to live on to find someone else but I honestly can't. I've tried that, all I've gotten is rejection. Everyone else is happy, why can't I be happy? Why do I have to slowly bleed out my emotions until I've become numb and utterly insane. I don't know if I can take this anymore and I need help. Is anyone there?
