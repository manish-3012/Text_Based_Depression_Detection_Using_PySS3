Taken a turn for the worse...I got involuntarily committed for a week for having some suicidal thoughts and making an attempt. A half-hearted attempt, triggered when I sort of "snapped" after a meeting at work.

Now I'm sitting, still "crispy" if you will, thoughts of ending it hanging out in the forefront of my mind.

A question to others who've gone this route, does it eventually subside? Does the immediacy of the "need" to end it all gradually fade into the background?

Thanks for your advice and suggestions. I'm rather nonfunctional at the moment and not sure what's going to happen next.
