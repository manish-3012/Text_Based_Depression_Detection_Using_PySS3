I don't want to do this anymore. I feel like killing myself is just inevitable.I don't even know why I'm posting here. I guess I'm just screaming into the void and hoping someone hears. I'm just tired of all of this. Everything in my life seemed to going in the right direction, but looking at the problems that are yet to come I get depressed. I haven't self harmed in a little over two months but I'm always getting urges. I'm tired all the time. Work is terrible (I work as a dishwasher), and along with school and everything else happening its too damn stressful. Part of me really wants to quit my job, but I really need the money just in case. I want to disappear and never come back. I've tried once before, but I won't fail the second time. I don't know when I'll do it, but probably soon. I know I should talk to a friend, but I'm not good at talking and I don't want them to worry. When I'm dead I won't have to worry about anything. I'm just tired. That's all.
