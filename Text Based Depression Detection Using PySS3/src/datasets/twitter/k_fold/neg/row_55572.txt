Nothing leftI had a friend that I talks to, she is the only one I have told about my problems, but I still haven't told her everything. She is also very depressed, so I didn't want to put preasure on her with my emotional baggage. Today I found out she actually got a boyfriend, more friends, and a better life. I was left behind. There is No one left. I feel like she doesn't need me amymore, and doesn't consider me a friend anymore. She doesn't talk to me that much anymore. I have nothing left. No help. I can't do anything I'm lost, and planning on ending my very long suffering soon. I have waited far too lo g for a good turn out, but no. I guess I have No place in this world anymore. Nothing
