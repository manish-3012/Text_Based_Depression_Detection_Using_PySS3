ContemplatingI'm **moving** again soon and I'm so **stressed**. My **dad is gone** and I have to **live at my grandparents** house for the next month. I hate this. 

\(I'm a **rape victim**\) and my mom recently found out. Everyone keeps trying to talk to me about it but I cant bare to think of it.*** I can't take thi***s. 

My only friends I have live very far away and my friend group is having **issues**, but they are my only friends. They **saved my life.** 

I just started high school and I have **no friends** \(Literarily\) at the high school I go to. My e**x wont leave me alone** after what he did to me last year... I cant think about it. I hate this so much. 

People **treat me like an object** here. This is too much and honestly I **don't rly have anything to look forward to**. Just death.

Should I just do it?
