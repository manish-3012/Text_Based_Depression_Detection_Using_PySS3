It makes me feel worse coming here since everyone here is still doing better than I amIm sorry if that sounds selfish but it's the truth. Everyone says that life is unfair and has its ups and downs but that's just a cliche phrase said by people who have it all. I read stories on here about people who have had a few healthy relationships and are complaining now that they are alone. I've never had one. I here people talking about how their family has tried to help but they cant accept help. My family is just one of my problems. I don't have friends. I can't turn to either of them. Nor anyone. I read a story about someone who used to be happy. He said that "it sounds crazy to say" that he can't remember what that felt like, but I can honestly say I have never felt true happiness. No friends or relationships since I was 5, my home life was horrible, I've never once been happy. College is no better. No one likes me. I'm a ghost on campus and anyone who has gotten to know me doesn't like me. 

Everyone is born with some advantage, except me. I can guarantee that even if you posted here feeling shitty about yourself, you still have something better than me. For example, even if everything is shitty, if you're white or if you're average height to tall, you can still be happy. I'm neither of those things. Even if you're neither of those things you could be smart or good looking or funny. I'm neither of those things either. I was born with literally nothing to help me in life. 

So most likely you'll feel better about your life reading about mine. I'll just be here watching everyone else live their lives, experiencing moments like love and going out with friends and relaxing with nothing to do. I just have to wait until I can buy a gun and kill myself. So its not much longer from here.
