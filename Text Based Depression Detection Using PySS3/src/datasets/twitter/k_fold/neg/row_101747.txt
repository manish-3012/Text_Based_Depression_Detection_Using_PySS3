fmlI'm at such a low point - I want to eat a handful of pills and go to sleep forever.  My family members are being rude.  Too much stress for too long.  I'm at a freaking breaking point.  The only thing that makes me hesitate is my 6 year old son.  (turned 6 today actually)  I can't stand the thought of being away from him - so what do I do when everything else becomes unbearable....?
