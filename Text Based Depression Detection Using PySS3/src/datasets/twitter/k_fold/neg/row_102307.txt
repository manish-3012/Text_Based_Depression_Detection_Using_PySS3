my brother is suicidal how do i help himiâ€™m 18 and heâ€™s 12. we get along at times but we also fight a lot. he had anxiety and some learning disabilities that make school really hard for him and he gets bullied for it. heâ€™s been out of school since march due to covid but heâ€™s still struggling a lot at home. today he got really upset over video games. he walked around the house yelling and scaring the dogs. he also punched a picture frame and cut his hand. then i grabbed a knife and ran to the bathroom and was talking about how he was going to go kill himself. we got the knife out of his hand and he began wrestling us and slamming me against a door. then he went into about her room and got a phone charger and wrapped it around his neck. i then wrested him and for it off him. then he pinned me up against a wall and put his hand on my throat and began choking me and telling me to let him die. at that point my mom got him off me. he then got a pair of swim googles and wrapped them around his neck. my mom just stood there and watched him while his oxygen and blood flow was getting cut off and said â€œhe just will pass outâ€ i kept begging her to go to the hospital. my brother has been talking about killing himself for months. today is the closest heâ€™s come that i know of. what do i do? i love him so much and donâ€™t want him to die but i donâ€™t know how to help. i want to bring him to the hospital but i donâ€™t know how much good that will do. i donâ€™t want to get him removed from our house but i donâ€™t know what to do. iâ€™ve been suicidal before but not in the same way he is. i donâ€™t know how to help. what should i do
