I don't care how much it hurtsAt this point I'd take any way out. I don't care how much pain I'll be in while I'm dying. As long as by the end of it I'm gone. I don't want to be here any more. There's nothing for me here. I'm in enough pain already. What's a little more if it means everything will stop? What's agony for a few minutes if it means I'll never have to feel it again? Who cares about the pain? It'll all be over when the pain is gone.
