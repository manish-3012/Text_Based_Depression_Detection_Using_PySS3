I am doneI have had enough,  I was doing okay today but  I told my SO to not give me attitude which makes me feel like shit. I stood up for myself for once. He flipped out and it turned into a huge fight. I try to make things a little better for myself and this is what happens.

Fuck it I'm just not meant to be here anymore. I am 29 years old and I have felt like this since I was 8. I gave it a good go. I really did try. There were times I felt brief happiness and that was nice. But three months of happiness out of 21 years just isn't worth it to me. 

My future isn't going anywhere anyways. Fuck it!
