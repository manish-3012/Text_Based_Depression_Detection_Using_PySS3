I canâ€™t continue with my lifeIâ€™m so hopeless last few days. Now I really understand why depression is a mental illness. Iâ€™m not sane anymore, Iâ€™m having awful mood swings and itâ€™s ruining me. One hour I can feel suicidal and other hour I feel kinda ok and start questioning whether Iâ€™m making it up, but even though I know Iâ€™m not, I always have to convince myself during those moments. It also makes me feel so guilty every time I vent to people and then feel better, I feel like I was using them.

I can barely function, I canâ€™t clean my room, I canâ€™t get out of bed and everyone just tells me to push through, but I canâ€™t. I canâ€™t explain why and feel like Iâ€™m just lazy, incompetent and useless and a bad person in general. I already gave up on so many aspects of my life, I feel like Iâ€™ll never find love and donâ€™t deserve it, I avoid lectures because Iâ€™m either too tired or too anxious.

Lately I canâ€™t even do the thing I love the most - making music. I sometimes get excited about doing it, but when I start I canâ€™t because Iâ€™m completely empty and feel so drained.

I canâ€™t go on like this, the crash is inevitable by this point. Iâ€™m going to therapy, but my social anxiety prevents me from telling the therapist many things, because it makes me feel so awkward, pathetic and overdramatic and the depression makes it impossible for me to work on the social anxiety. I donâ€™t want to be giving up like this, but I just canâ€™t force myself to do anything to help myself.

Iâ€™m so afraid that Iâ€™ll fail college because of this and that would be the last straw. I want to go on medication this week, but itâ€™s not going to help in time, Iâ€™m already behind. Idk what to do. I want this to stop, but I canâ€™t help myself.
