Life is a cruel teaseLife isn't just unfair, its outright cruel. Everywhere you turn, someone is living your dream. They are happy, successful, driving fancy cars, have lots of followers, are attractive and desirable... No single person has all of that, but you see glimpses everywhere. Everything you want but can't have. Life excluding you, keeping you out. Laughing at your pathetic attempts to better yourself or achieve your dreams. So you get discouraged and give up and sink deeper into depression and wonder why keep chasing the impossible. 

You go to therapy and get help. You try the meds they give you, try to be positive and focus on yourself and stop comparing yourself to others. You get back on the horse and try to chase your dreams again. But the goalposts have moved, and you're even further from achieving them than before. So you give up again. A vicious cycle that always ends at rock bottom. Why is life worth living if you can't have what you want? Even when you lower your expectations, somehow you can't even achieve that. You take out your frustrations on yourself through self-destructive behavior until someone notices or you end up in the hospital. Then you are in financial debt even thought you have health insurance (thanks america). 

I can't win. I can't do anything. I fall behind, or if I try really hard I can manage to stay still. But I can't ever move forward. I am too weighed down by jealousy and self hatred. I just want it to end.
