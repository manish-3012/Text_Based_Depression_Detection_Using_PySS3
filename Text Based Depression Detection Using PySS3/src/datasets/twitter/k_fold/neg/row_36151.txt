Can anyone stop me? Please?I'm not doing well at all.

Lately it feels like I'll have some great days, followed by terrible ones.

I've been exploring the sexual trauma in my life a lot more recently, and have been getting triggered by everything. I didn't realize how much it hurt me until now. I didn't realize how much what he did to me stuck with me.

He's abused me my whole life, mentally, physically, he pushed me so hard he broke my back. But lately the sexual abuse has been destroying me.

When I see depictions of characters I love in media being used, hurt, or exploited, it sends me into a state of such deep sadness and the panic is overwhelming.

Right now I just want to hang myself again. I have a rope on my ceiling that's been there for awhile. I want to do it, I don't want to be alive anymore. I'm such a broken waste of space. I can't handle anything anymore.

I think the world would be so much better off if I were gone, and I would like to stop feeling this pain.

when people tell you when you're little that it'll get better, I think that's a lie.

It can get better, but for some people, their dreams, like mine will never come true. I'll never be beautiful, I'll never be wonderful, I'll never be happy, I'll never be strong, I'll never be pain free, I'll never accomplish anything. I'll die alone. My only lover is an ocean away.

it hurts, it hurts so much, it hurts more than I can even fathom or put into words
