Gonna end it all in 2 monthsI can't cope with failure. Today was the final nail in the coffin. (obvious throawaray btw). Would've ended it today but I owe some people money and I have a code of honour that would not let me go away without paying my dues. But after that, I plan to end it. I'm drunk and crying right now.
