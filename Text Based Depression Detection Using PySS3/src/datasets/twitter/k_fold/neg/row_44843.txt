I'm going to die alone....tomorrowIt's not fair, but I'm starting to accept the fact that this whole "relationship" bs is not something I will ever experience. 

I mean I'm a short Asian guy, kissless virgin, does well in school, makes a lot of money. How many fucking times have you heard this story? Probably hundreds.

Girls mostly ignore me, so I try to approach them. When I do, they just dismissively try to shoo me away. It's funny because a lot of the time I'm literally just looking for female friends, and nothing more.

I'm literally more pathetic than friend-zoned nice-guy types because I CAN'T EVEN MAKE FEMALE FRIENDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm fucking 19 and I'm like the only guy I know who's never had sex or been in a relationship. 

You know, now that I've typed this up, I really, *really* should go kill myself. There are tons of bridges overlooking gorges all 10 minutes away from my dorm.
