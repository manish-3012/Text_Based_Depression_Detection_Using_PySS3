Feeling suicidalSo, I'm a 21 Years old male who had been strugling with clinical depression and anxiety for almost 5 years now. Some days are better than other. Today, for instance, I am thinking about going home after work and slice my wrists open. I probably won't, tough. I don't know. The idea of killing myself and what follows being eternal everlasting oblivion it's kinda of...attractive. I wasn't thinking about it yeasterday. I just can't stand myself, and bear this feeling of guilty. It is too much. I did this to myself, probably. If I am in pain, I think I deserve it, being Karma or whatever. I just can't take it anymore. 

I know that writing this really won't do any good, but I needed to say something to someone or vent...

Anyway, sorry for anything.
