Almost did it yesterday.The thing that stopped me was seeing all of my Game of Thrones stuff and realizing I want to see the ending. That's a really dumb reason not to do it I guess but it kept me here one more day. 

My job and spouse are both killing me. I found out that I can't have children. I just feel like my spouse and everyone else would be better off. My spouse is also mentally ill but nothing I do helps. The doctors and meds that we've tried for years don't really help. All they've done is turn a sad person into someone with a rabid level of rage. 

I pay extra for the suicide clause on my life insurance so my spouse could live off of it for a good while, find a better place to live and stuff. 

So... I figure I'll go through with it soon. But yesterday wasn't meant to be the day, I guess. 

I already kinda regret it. But it's almost comforting to know the option is always, always there.
