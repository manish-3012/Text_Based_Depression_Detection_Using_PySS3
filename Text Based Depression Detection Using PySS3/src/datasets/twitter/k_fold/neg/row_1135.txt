What would I for 40 years?Thatâ€™s the biggest thing sometimes. What am I supposed to do? Work? Marry?? Kids?

Iâ€™ll work whatever, itâ€™s possible someone will tolerate me enough to marry, I doubt im infertile.

But what would I really do? Say â€œIâ€™m home honeyâ€? Ball with the kids? Life was never fun or happy to live, wish I could skip to the end when Iâ€™m sleeping in a group home or something. Just be an old fart that tellâ€™s the nurses to go away. At least theyâ€™ll just think im senile. Stop bothering me people, I donâ€™t want to participate with you, I donâ€™t want to talk to you. I like being alone, no matter how much I convince myself otherwise. I get close to someone and realize i dont give a shit i wanna be alone again. 

How on earth do you keep yourself busy for 40 years
