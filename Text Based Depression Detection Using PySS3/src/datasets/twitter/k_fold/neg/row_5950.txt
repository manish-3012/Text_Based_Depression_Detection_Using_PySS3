I really do wish that there was another way to just feel happy.I don't want to feel how I do. I don't want to think suicide is the only option. But I think it is. I'm so done with this life and I'm done with no one every taking a single thing I say seriously. I'm just a joke to people, nothing I say either means anything. It's like I'm still a kid in everyone's eyes. I haven't felt like someone has supported me on anything for 3 fucking years, it's like everything I say is wrong to people. But if I upset somebody else I'm the world's biggest douchbag. If I upset them though I'm always at fault. None of my friends will really support me either. No one cares. Fuck them all.
