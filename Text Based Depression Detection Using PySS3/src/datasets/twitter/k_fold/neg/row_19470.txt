Increase in guis-tripping/trolls on the sub? Also not as suicidal.It may just be me noticing more and being stupid, but I've noticed it more in the comments and when I have they seem to be around the same time which leads me to believe it may just be trolls.

Recently I don't think I've been as suicidal, my depression has become much worse but emotionally I've become numb (linking park plays - heh) the only emotions I do have are anger and thus my actions could be noted irrational in nature at times... I don't get hungry but when I do eat it's usually shit food, I'm not showering and I haven't cleaned my teeth in probably 5/6 days now... starting antidepressants this morning/in a few hours I haven't slept yet.. I'm travelling later in the day and I usually find it easier to just stay up and if I get tired sleep on the plane and any car trips required afterwards.... anyway..
