I just want to donate my body.Best case scenario for me, I'd be put under and all of my organs would be harvested and given to people that actually want and deserve to live.
So many people around me, tell me how wonderful I am. But if that's true, why do I have so many people that also abuse me? It's my fault, it has to be. I dedicate my life to others already, but it must not be enough. I've been to clinics, going to therapy, and on medication. But nonetheless I just wish I could just stop existing. It's been like this for over a decade. And I don't always feel this way, but it always comes back. And in between I'm numb. This isn't living.
