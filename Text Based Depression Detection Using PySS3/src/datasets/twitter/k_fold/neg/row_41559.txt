Have a suicide plan mostly set, now just feeling numbI'm in therapy and on meds, blah blah blah. Everyone has (what i think are delusional) thoughts that I will get better, i just gotta give it more time. I've given it 15 years of my life. I told my husband and therapist that if I don't feel better within a year, I am definitely going to end it. No f***ing around with the "cry for help" kinda ODing nonsense. I have a plan, not fully drawn out yet, but got the basics down. 

I plan on doing whatever they tell me until then to try to get better. But at this point, I doubt anything will help. 

Now I feel kinda numb/depressed and just want to curl up into a ball and sleep forever.
