It would be too easy.I'm sick of being sick. Autoimmunity paired with general anxiety disorder and avoidant personality disorder is such a fun combination! 
I've been suicidal for as long as I can remember being able to form my own thoughts and had even attempted to off myself at 16 and have the scars to prove it.
I moved across the country recently (okay, well, seven months ago) to be with my now fiancÃ©. I gave up everything and everyone hoping it would help me fix myself because doctors out here are more understanding and less overworked. 
I've seen one doctor since being here and I feel so defeated because I can't get up the nerve to seek actual help due to the anxiety and depression. I'm also pregnant.

I've had some reoccurring thoughts lately involving passing during childbirth and freezing to death. I won't add details but I do know exactly how the second one would go down. As the title says, it would be too easy. 
And then i'll guilt myself for those thoughts.
"SO will be stuck alone raising this child."
"My cat will miss me."
But the ideation outweighs the guilt by about a mile. I even have dreams about it.
i need help but can't even talk to anyone about it. I know the internet is a vast resource, but I know nothing about the area i live in.
Sorry for the long post. Sorry if this post seems stupid.
