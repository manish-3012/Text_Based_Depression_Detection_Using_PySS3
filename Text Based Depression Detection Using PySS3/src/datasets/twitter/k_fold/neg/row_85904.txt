Feeling suicidal before my dateThis is my first post on this community.I have always found it very difficult to share things on internet forums like these openly, even though it is anonymous. To me it is almost like leaving a piece of me out there and scary. Almost like it will come back to haunt me.
   The only reason I have pushed myself to write here is because of some hope that what if somebody can really understand? My parents separated four years ago and I am pretty much on my own. All my life I have only seen them break off ties, not just with each other but my whole extended family, their friends etc.  I have always thought of myself as a strong person but now I wonder, why does anyone matter at all? Why do I matter in this word of billions of people? Why stop somebody from just taking away some extra weight from this planet? Why are human beings so needy? I miss having parents, a common home even though I am 27! I go on normally throughout the month but around my date, I start thinking about taking all the pills in the medicine box or doing something rash but I somehow in the end calm down. I wonder if this would last though. I have my reservations about therapy as crying gives me migraines. I feel stupid writing all of this here, sharing it with so many people. I find myself almost not posting it but what bad can come out of it? Humans may be the most evolved species but why then do we need so much care? I hardly talk to my parents anymore, they just make it worse.
