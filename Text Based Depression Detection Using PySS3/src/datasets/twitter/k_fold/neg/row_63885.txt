Hey all, perhaps a strange question but I'm looking for some resources for a university project.Hi all,

I'm a student studying paramedics and one of my assignments is a group communications project. Basically, a bunch of us have to produce a resource that can be used by paramedics to improve their communication skills with a particular subset of the community.

My group was assigned people who are suicidal. I figure, who better to come to than those who are devoting their time to those who need it. All I'm really looking for is a nudge in the right direction for resources and or information on communicating with people suffering from suicidal thoughts.

Our plan, subject to refinement, is to produce a kind of 'decision tree booklet' covering the different demographics that one may encounter and the different strategies that one would employ to effectively communicate with each demographic.

For the record, I'm Australian in Melbourne.

I've raided your sidebar already, but have yet to sift through and refine all the information there. Anyone who can think off the top of their head a good place to start would be helping out a lot.

I hope that posting this here is not considered to be in poor taste as it is most certainly not my intention to offend. If it is, I'll respectfully remove it.
