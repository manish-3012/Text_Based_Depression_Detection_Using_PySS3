I woke up and contemplated whether to give up today.I am thinking about breaking up with my SO (our relationship is failing because of me and my drinking.), I want to write out notes, voice messages for some close friends and family. Also go through my stuff to see which I am going to give away, which to destroy and which to be left untouched. Clean up my room and try to keep it as tidy as possible.

Preparations are going to take awhile. 

But having my dream, the constant fucking suicidal thoughts, the self destructive habits, ruining everything around me, burning bridges and fucking my entire life up, it all makes me think I've Had Enough.
