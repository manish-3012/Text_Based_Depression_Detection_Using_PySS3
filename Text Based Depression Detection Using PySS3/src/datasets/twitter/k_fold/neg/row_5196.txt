July 4thToday is the 15th anniversary of losing my father to suicide.

Every year I fantasize about doing something to honor his memory and help other people that are considering suicide... and I never do. I have always felt like if I could somehow share the pain in my heart with the world NOBODY would ever end their life prematurely again. Every year I feel the guilt of not being able to save my father, and every year I feel the guilt of not being able to save you.

So Here we are. I've drank my whiskey like I do at the beginning of every July 4th, and this time I've made up my mind. I'm going to try and tell you:

If there is anybody you care about in your life- ANYONE in the world that you care about... please don't do it. You can't fathom the ways the taking of your life will change the world. My life has never been the same... nothing is as good as it should have been. I miss my father so much and I would give anything to have him back. 15 years...


I wish I could explain it. I hope somebody out there reads this and decides to give their life at least one more day. If not for yourself do it for the people you would leave behind. You don't know how important you really are.


My fathers favorite band was Steely Dan. "When the demon is at your door, in the morning it won't be there no more. Any major dude would tell you."
