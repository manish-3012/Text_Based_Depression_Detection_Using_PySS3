Iâ€™m not going to do it.I want to stop crying, but I canâ€™t.
I want to stop hurting, but I canâ€™t.
The physical hurt, the emotional hurt, the mental hurt, the hurt I have placed upon others. I want to stop it all.
I never thought I was one who had suicidal thoughts until I read something the other day that thinking about dying or how Iâ€™d do it are indeed, suicidal thoughts. Who knew?! Iâ€™ve always envisioned myself as being too strong willed of a person to actually go through with it. Thereâ€™s plenty of times Iâ€™ve thought about taking a handful of meds and ending it and waking up with a clean fresh start. Iâ€™d never do it, but the thought is nice to think of there being nothing. Nothing to do, nothing to worry about, nothing to stress about, nothing to feel, just nothing. 
I talk to a psychologist, but havenâ€™t ever brought this up. I only bring up feelings of anxiousness, being overwhelmed, not good enough, my codependent tendencies, trust, and abandonment issues. Iâ€™m gaining weight again after busting my ass to lose 140 lbs and stopped binge drinking for 2 years. I have so much going on at work that I lied to my boss today and said my son was sick so I can do what? Sit here and cry and flip flop between anxiety and depression all day which leads me to worry about losing my job. I just want a day of nothingness. Is that possible without dying? Anyone know any resurrection spells?
