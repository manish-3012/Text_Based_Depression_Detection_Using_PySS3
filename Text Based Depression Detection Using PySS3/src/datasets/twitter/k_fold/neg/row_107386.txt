im just... donei literally think about killing myself almost every day, its non stop. people that are my friends have told me that its a "chore to hang out with me" its like they only do it because they feel some obligation to. i need people around me or at least to talk to me. im not an introvert in any sense of the word, but im not in a position to go out and meet new people, besides they would just tell me the same things everyone else ive ever met has said. "you talk to loud" "you talk to much" "you never shut up" " your way to hyper" even when i do meet new people, no one ever just understands me and it eventually becomes a chore to be around me and i just cant take it anymore. i tied a belt around my neck today and got it stuck between my door and the frame just to feel what it would be like to actually do it, and i wasnt disappointed, while it was around my neck i just felt this relief falling over me, and after taking it off i just want to do it... i dont know what to do.... im 21 and ive never really felt happy or content with my life, never did good in school, all my family members are doing so well and im at the bottom of the barrel, ive reached my end, idk if tonight is the night, or maybe tomorrow, but im half way through a bottle of vodka and i think ive finally reached my breaking point, i just moved and met up with someone i knew a couple years ago, (we were best friends then) and he drove out a couple hours away with some other people i just met and they didnt invite me or talk to me about it, they kept it hidden from me, which im guessing is because as always im just a chore to be around, ive tried to change who i am, and i just cant... i just cant. maybe tonight will be the perfect night to finally do it.
