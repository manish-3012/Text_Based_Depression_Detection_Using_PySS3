I'm very suicidal and I don't know whyEver since I was a kid I was always suicidal. I just didn't like living and wanted to die. There wasn't any depression attached to it but now there is and it's terrible. My major depression started last year and it's been one hell of a ride. The worse thing about it is that there's no reason for me to be depressed. I have the basic things I need to be happy, and nothing bad has happened to me. But I just feel so empty and depressed that I feel like now I have an actual reason to kill myself. I really don't see me making it to the end of the year alive.
