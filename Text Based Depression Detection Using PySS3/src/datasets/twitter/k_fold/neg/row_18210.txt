My Heart is BreakingHello all, I am here because I've had so many years of depression,  anxiety,  overall issues. I started reading this sub because I've had similar feelings that we've all had here and I came here to not feel alone. I am so heartbroken of the deleted accounts and I want so badly to reach someone and make them change their minds like someone did for me.

PLEASE. PLEASE if anyone needs someone to talk to or is feeling like they can take no more please reach out. I've come from the darkest darkest place and I know we can too!
