I'm loosing it, over 30, a bachelor degree in digital media, but can't do anything with it!I am at such a loss. It has been 5 years since I graduated, and been working in retail jobs because I just can't seem to get into anything with this degree. It was a little bit of music, a little video editing, photography, photoshop, a little inDesign... in the end all I had was 12 collages I created with photography and photoshop and can't get into anywhere....

I tried getting into internships, but they kept telling me my knowledge was lacking too much. That's because I only got a little from everything....

Now, I'm struggling with myself, I can only get casual positions in retail and loosing money having to rely on my partner. I don't like this. I want to be independant.

I tried so fucking hard, working on a portfolio and a website, but I don't know what is wrong with me, I can't create anything that is commercial! It always turns out weird and bad that nobody finds it interesting....

I have modified my resume so much, trying to get into even reception work, but they never hire me even with what I have!

I still have a few shifts, but I don't think I can do it anymore. I tried so damn hard , thinking I can become independant, I got a shit degree with nothing I can do with, no experience and my work is too crap anyways nobody will hire me or take me on...

I'm so tired, always applying, always getting rejected... I'm done. I'm giving myself a time frame to just enjoy my birthday month and I think it should be the end of it.

I'm sorry, I know everyone here is hurting, but this time I want to be selfish for once, think of myself and not care about others!
