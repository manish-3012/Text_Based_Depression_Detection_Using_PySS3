Trapped in hellOn one hand, I'm suicidal. There's not a second that goes by when I'm not thinking about killing myself in some way. And I'm not exaggerating. I think about it non-stop from the moment I wake up in the morning till the moment I go to sleep at night. 

At the same time, death terrifies me. I have trouble falling asleep because I lie in bed thinking that if I close my eyes I will start losing consciousness and fade away. I keep the lights on because the darkness reminds me of death and it makes me uncomfortable. 

So yeah, I'm stuck.
