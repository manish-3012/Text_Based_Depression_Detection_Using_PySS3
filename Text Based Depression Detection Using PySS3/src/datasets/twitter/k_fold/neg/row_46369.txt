HELP-- anyone near Avon, NY?A wonderful friend of mine has been depressed and suicidal (post-breakup) the last few weeks. Attempted and failed, but he left a post on facebook a few hours ago that was basically a goodbye message.

I am currently in South Korea, but his last post/location information is in Avon, NY. He hasnt been active on the internet for over 3 hours and isn't anwering messages or phone calls.
PLEASE-- if anyone in the area sees him his friends around the world are worried. Approx. 6 ft tall, average build, brown eyes, dark brown hair and facial hair, wears glasses. May possibly be driving a Prius.

I am quite worried. I have seen him very depressed before but not like this.
