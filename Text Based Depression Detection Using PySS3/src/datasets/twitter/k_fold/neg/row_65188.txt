I want to kill myself. I dont think I will go through with it, but I felt like I needed to tell someone.I have wanted to, to some degree, for years. These past few months have been bad. Waking up every day and swallowing the lump in my throat, trying to put on a normal face for everyone at work, constantly holding back tears. It is so hard. I just want to tell someone. I don't know what I expect to get out of that, I am just sick of holding it in.

I am finally full-on crying as I type this after months of three of four tears coming out. It feels nice. 

I'm making the least money I've made in years. I am barely scraping by. It is hard for me to afford to eat; I have one meal a day, sometimes one meal every two days. But somehow I make too much money for food stamps (I have applied). I lost my medicaid coverage last month because again, I make too much money, although 95% of my money goes to rent and bills. I was going to therapy, but now I can't. I absolutely can't afford health insurance.

I don't think I have any real friends. I have a girlfriend of four and a half years, and she is one of the only things keeping me from doing it. I dont want to hurt her feelings. I dont want to hurt my moms feelings. Or my brother or sister. Or I guess my dad.. I just want these bad feelings to stop. I want to be able to eat. I want a job that doesn't destroy me physically, emotionally and mentally and pays a decent salary.

I don't know how to get there. I'm holding on as hard as I can in the hopes that I figure it out.

Thanks for reading.
