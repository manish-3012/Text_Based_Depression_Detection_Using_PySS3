I had a bad downswing tonightI started to come down from hypomania after I was called an asshole for giving earnest but blunt advice to a friend by someone else. Then someone told me that when a psychologist is pushed to the limits of their understanding and suddenly their bullshit methods don't work anymore, they become angry and frustrated. And apparently one of the most important ideation I had was bullshit. I want to cry but no tears will come out. I feel... Angst, deep in my core. I want to punch something. I want to blow my brains out. It feels like I've reached the end of my rope and I'm barely holding on. It would be so easy to just let go.
