I've wanted to die for the past 10 years.I've reached the point again when I wake up and go to sleep dreaming of when I'm strong enough to kill myself. I'm 18 years old, and I've never wanted to be alive. I don't have any friends, but I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I try to be happy and enjoyable to be around, but I'm obviously awkward and I have no idea how to fix this. I want to enjoy life, but right now it's not worth continuing. I've been told it gets better, but I've felt this way for a decade, and I can't wait any longer for it to get better. I have to do something now. I either need to make some improvements, or just fucking end it. I've tried antidepressants, but I need to know how to be the kind of person people will actually like. If anyone has any advice, I would really appreciate it.

Edit: I just don't feel anything but fear and pain anymore. When I smile I feel like I'm lying.
