Too afraid to do itI'm 17 and i had suicidal thoughts for 5 years now. I really don't know what's wrong in my head, I've been to several doctors but they couldn't help me. I was 12 when I tried to kill myself first, then when i was 15. In the first few years the thoughts only came up on my birthday but now i feel it everytime. I have noone, everyone left me, I feel very lonely I'm sick of it, I'm always looking for an opportunity to kill myself, but im just too weak to do it. I feel physical pain because of this depression, It's just horrible.
