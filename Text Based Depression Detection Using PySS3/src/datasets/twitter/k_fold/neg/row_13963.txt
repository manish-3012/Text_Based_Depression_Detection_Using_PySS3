Feeling bit downAs title says right now i'm feeling a bit down. I'm diagnosed with BPD1 and even when I have had WORST times I think that I'm not doing well right now. It's 2 am and I cannot fall asleep even when being on anti-anxiety and antipsychotic drugs (for the implied purpose)
I am flirting with suicide once again, but as I stated, it is not an urge as once it was. I have not been sleeping well, and I haven't left my house for several months other than going to college (I fell on a lame routine that I hate)
I have lost significant amount of wight and I have been suffering with intense headaches (I already visited my medic, not worth talking about)
The good thing? I am directly canalizing all my energy to college, so I am without a doubt the best student in myclass (at least for the past 2 semesters hehe)
I feel lonely as hell. I can never create a significant relationship without me ruining it. I have always had problems showing affection to my loved ones; yet, I am by myself right now and it looks like it will be this way for some time.
Just wanted to vent some frustration I had, I'm not feeling between the sword and the wall (yet...)
