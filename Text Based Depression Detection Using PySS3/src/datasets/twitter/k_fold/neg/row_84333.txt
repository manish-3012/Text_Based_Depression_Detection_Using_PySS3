When people ask why......what do you say?

I'm about to get on Skype and tell my family I tried to kill myself.

I anticipate the most common question will be some variation on "why?"

Honestly, I don't know what to tell them.

So, I'm curious. When someone asks you "why?" -- "Why did you try to kill yourself?" -- "Why do you want to kill yourself?" -- "Why do you feel that way?" -- what do *you* tell them?
