How do I take back control over my life?Im 25 and I am at the lowest point in my life. I hit rock bottom. I dont want to bore you with everything, but something really went wrong for me years ago and its been downhill since. I have this guillt, shame and pain wherever I go and whatever I do. Doing even the smallest things takes a lot of effort. I need to go to the dentist asap but Ive been postponing that too. Someone please tell me what to do. Right now im in a really dark place and i am so lonely. Im in agony
