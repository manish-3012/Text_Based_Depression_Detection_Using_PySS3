I jumped off a two story balcony while high on shrooms.It happened Monday night around 8. My friends tried to stop me. I was so out of it I punched one of them and jumped. Luckily I land feet first. I shouldâ€™ve died. Now Iâ€™m at my family home for two weeks in bed and three months without putting any weight on it, living in Ohio so that makes travel even better. I know I can get through this, but I just donâ€™t know where to start with communicating with the friends who were there. When I jumped none of them knew if I was alive when they ran downstairs to find me outside. I feel like I hurt them more then myself and I donâ€™t know what to do.
