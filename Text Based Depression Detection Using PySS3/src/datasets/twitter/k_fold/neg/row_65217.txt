I was so close to doing it.. I don't know where to go form hereI haven't self-harmed in years, and just an hour ago I was in the shower at it again. I had the razor in my hands and just wanted to end it so badly. I told myself I'd OD first and then be back, since I was afraid of the pain... And then I just haven't.

I can't go back into the hospital. I can't. My grades are slipping already, and I'm probably going to have to be in high school an extra year by this point. But if I tell anyone, that's where they'll send me. My mom will be pissed and scream at me about how I'm throwing my future away by going back in, and my friends will worry about me. But then my only other option is to just off myself so I'll be out of the way. They'll move on eventually, and I'll just be another statistic. I'm sure I could put together enough pain meds that I won't feel much, then I can just end it. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who to talk to.
