existence is, as always, meaningless.something's been wrong with me for so many years and it's just not getting better. I got a fucking diagnosis on friday that I'm bipolar II, and my mother started crying -- when we got home I heard her on the phone with my grandmother telling her that she doesn't know what to do and that it's all my grandmother's fault for being terribly bipolar and passing it on to me

my medication gets sent here to my dormitory tomorrow evening, I honestly think I'm just going to take all of it when I get my hands on it. they're putting me on 25 mg of lamictal once daly to start and sliding up to 50mg twice daily along with prozac to help

but it won't fucking work even copious amounts of drugs non-prescription drugs won't work

my boyfriend had me start watching wilfred and told me how he started watching it after he tried to kill himself and how it's helped him and been a healing process and I know that he's trying to help but lately nothing works and I just want to die

nothing ever works I just want it to end
