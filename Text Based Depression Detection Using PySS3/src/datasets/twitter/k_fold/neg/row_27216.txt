I Feel TrappedIâ€™m tired of feeling hopeless. Things always get slightly better and then I end up back in this headspace again. I am a waste. I donâ€™t have the energy anymore, I just want to give up.
The only thing stopping me from killing myself is the fact that it would devastate my parents and ruin their lives. I feel trapped, I hate being miserable and suffering but donâ€™t want to hurt them. It would break me to lose them and I donâ€™t look forward to losing them either, because they mean the world to me. I wish I could die without passing the pain onto them but that isnâ€™t possible. I can only hope I die in my sleep. I have no option but to fucking suffer in misery until they pass and then Iâ€™ll end my pitiful existence.
And yet even then I feel like Iâ€™d be doing them a disservice because everything theyâ€™ve done for me would go to waste. But at least they wouldnâ€™t know.
I wish I didnâ€™t have to wait.
