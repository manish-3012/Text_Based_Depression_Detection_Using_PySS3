what is it like going inpatienti'm just at the end of my rope, i've been here a few times but i don't know what to do anymore i failed an attempt earlier and just can't get myself to stop crying or banigng my head into the wall hoping i get a concussion or knock myself out, at least maybe enough brain damage that i'll stop feeling like this

i've always been terrified of going to inpatient care, legitimately is one of the biggest fears i have, especially now with corona and everything (and it's starting to spike in my area again).
