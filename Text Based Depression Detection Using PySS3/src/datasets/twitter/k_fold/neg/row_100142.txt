I feel like Iâ€™m readyA little while ago, the only meaningful part of my life, a relationship I was in, ended. I was really depressed. 

A little while after that, I thought I was starting to get better because I wasnâ€™t feeling as sad. But I just wasnâ€™t feeling any emotions, and I still feel like that 90% of the time. 

Iâ€™ve never liked the idea of cutting before, but it seems more attractive now. Like a way to feel something, even if itâ€™s pain. 

I also donâ€™t see any reason to live. Iâ€™m not enjoying being alive, there are only 2 people who would care if I died, and theyâ€™d probably be the only two that would even notice. I used to feel guilty, thinking about making them sad that I killed myself, but I donâ€™t anymore. Iâ€™m gonna try cutting myself tonight, and see if it helps. If not, I think I might kill myself. Just to stop this meaningless existence
