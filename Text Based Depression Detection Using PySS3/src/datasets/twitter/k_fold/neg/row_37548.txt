Is aspen a good place to die?I'll be going there soon for work. I think I need help because I've been having a lot of thoughts like this about finding easy ways to die. I've collected a lot of methods in my head over the past decade from bouts of depression. I don't feel particularly sad or exhausted like I have been before, so it doesn't really feel like depression, but the thoughts are back.
