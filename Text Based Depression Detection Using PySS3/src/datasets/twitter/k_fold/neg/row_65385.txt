There really is nothing here.This world feels empty. Like an abandoned house, three once was something in the world, something keeping me going, something fueling a fire within. Now, only embers remain. With each passing moment, a knife seems more and more appealing to me. All my previous interests fade further and further away. If I can't fix any of this by year 30, I will take my own life.
