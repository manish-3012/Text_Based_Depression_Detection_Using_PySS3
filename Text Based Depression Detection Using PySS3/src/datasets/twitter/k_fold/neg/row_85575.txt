I'm sorry..I've spent a majority of my life fucking up and being incredibly reckless. My life is slowly getting worse and worse.. I cut myself yesterday hoping that would calm things. But it didn't and here I am awake at 3 in the morning. I think I'm just done. I've been here long enough and drained many people. I just can't keep this up. I'm tired and want out.
