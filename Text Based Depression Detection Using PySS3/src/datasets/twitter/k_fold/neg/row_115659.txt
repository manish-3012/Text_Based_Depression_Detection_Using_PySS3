Is it normal to be suicidal multiple times?I've felt extremely suicidal for months at a time at least four times in my life, to the point where I start making plans, and then it goes away. I guess because it's usually school that triggers it for me, and the semester eventually ends. This has been happening every few years since middle school. Is there something wrong with me? I feel like everyone else can handle the stress by either just doing well or just not caring too much when they fail. I just start digging a hole where I get so behind in every class I can hardly pass them and want another way out. I guess this was a little ranty, but I just wish there was a way to stop feeling so bad all the time.
