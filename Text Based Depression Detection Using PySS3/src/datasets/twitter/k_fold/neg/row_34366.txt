The DevilInteresting what the devil can do to someone. I'm struggling. No one cares. I've reached out for help and it's like I'm just a burden. No one will listen, they just pass me to someone else, like I'm just nothing. The devil is winning and I'm about to just hand him the gun. I need help. In my head I know it's wrong to feel this way. People say it's YOU that needs to change, YOU need to make that decision. I'm trying but when you are crippled with depression you feel like you will never win. When is the angels come and save me from this dark place. This place is so dark and there is no light, except outside my window which is where all my problems began. I'm not good enough, for anything. Daily I force myself to smile when in reality it's impossible. There is nothing to smile for. I've lost my boyfriend, I've lost my mother, I'm stuck in a dead end job going nowhere. The holidays are coming and all I want is to end it all so I'm not called "mean" or "sad" because I hate the holidays. I just cried for 15 minutes and found this sub reddit. I don't have a question for anyone I just thought I would spill my thoughts out here for anyone who gives a shit.
