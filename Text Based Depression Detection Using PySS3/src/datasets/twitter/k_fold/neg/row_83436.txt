I don't know if it was ever about me.I want to thank some of the people here for helping me come out and say this. I need help, big time. I used to like a girl, and I'm leaving it at that for now. We got along well, we were cool with each other. When she started distancing herself and not showing up to school, I joined my friends in making fun of her because I am a fucking moron. Short jokes, my friends called her malnourished (ironic, wait until the end). I ended up breaking it off with her after a bad fight and ended up leaving the school. I felt real bad, but didn't have the strength to apologize. Then...I found her hidden social media. It was by complete accident. I found out a lot: she has depression, takes meds for it, has body dysmorphia, family is broke and the girl had to pitch in to pay fucking bills out of a school fund, Dad gambles all the money away and always hangs out with friends at bars, works nights so she never sees him, was bullied before she came to my school, has separation anxiety, starves herself, etc. I was so sick. I started to find more accounts, one, being an account of hers selling feet pictures, most likely to make money to fucking live. I'm 16. She's 16. Get it!?!! I went into a rage and stabbed my arm with a razor, which followed by me burning myself on the stove (hand). I cried myself to sleep that night like a bitch. I have starved myself for months, only eating when forced to. I have pushed myself to work out till I can't move. I punish myself daily. And now I've found out she has cystic fibrosis. It's too much now. I have to die, but I need to help her. I was thinking of withdrawing all of the money I have, mailing it to her and then hanging myself, the most painful way that will actually work. I just don't know what to do. I have had so many breakdowns. Fuck my life. I ruined someones life. I deserve no joy, no love. I deserve death. And it's happening soon.
