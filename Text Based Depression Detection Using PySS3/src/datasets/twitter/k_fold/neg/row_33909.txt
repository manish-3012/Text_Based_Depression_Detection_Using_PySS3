why do i miss the guy who treated me like shitwe were just friends but it doesnâ€™t matter. i thought we were close but he lied to me stole my shit and tried to break into my room. itâ€™s been months since then and ive got my own place now. but i still think about him and miss the good moments. but I know he didnâ€™t really care cause if he did he wouldnâ€™t have done that shit. i donâ€™t go out much cause im afraid of running into him at the places we used to go to. my brain is dumb and i am dumb
