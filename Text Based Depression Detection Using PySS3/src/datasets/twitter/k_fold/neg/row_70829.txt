Bulimia.Iâ€™ve recently made an effort to lose weight. Which is staring in the mirror, pointing out all my flaws, eating, purging and repeating the process for every meal. Iâ€™m really done. I got sexually assaulted a few days ago (at least I think it was sexual assault?) I have no support from my family, my mom is addicted to drugs, my brother is a drug dealer and I have no friends at all. I really want this all to end, and thereâ€™s really only one way out. &lt;/3
