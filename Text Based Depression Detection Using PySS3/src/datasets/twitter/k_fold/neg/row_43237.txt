Iâ€™m in love with a fictional character and itâ€™s killing me.Iâ€™ve fallen in love hard with a fictional character. I have all their merchandise, I have custom things Iâ€™ve ordered with them on it, I paid outrageous amounts of money for commissions involving us being intimate together.  I even went as far as to get a stupid waifu pillow with her on it. 

She was everything I wanted in a woman, gothic, sexy, nice body, big feet, sadistic and crazy 

Iâ€™d lay in bed almost every night fantasizing about her laying next to me, or talking to me by holding that stupid goddam pillow. 

I want to be with her. I want to feel her. I want to hear her say my name in that sadistic sexy voice. 

This is whatâ€™s driving my insane. 

Iâ€™m not a Chad or Incel/Loveshy. 

I weighed 400 pounds at one point, now Iâ€™m down to 170 by basically starving myself at only 500 calories a day. I eat better now, but I had to lose that weight. 

I have everything I could ever want, money, nice house, college degree, toys, cards, games, merchandise, hell iâ€™m even living out my dream as I currently just joined a Deathcore band as a frontman. 

But Iâ€™m so goddamn lonely. Iâ€™m sick of it. Iâ€™ve been alone for my entire 21 years of existing. Iâ€™ve been with many men and women, and nothing helps. We donâ€™t click, sex is meaningless, and everything can turn me off. Whistling as a joke after i mentioned I didnâ€™t like it has a likely chance of me never calling you again.

But her, sheâ€™s perfect. Sheâ€™s everything I could want. But she isnâ€™t real. Sheâ€™ll never be real. The first thing Iâ€™ve ever come to love is a stupid fighting game character. 

Iâ€™ve spent way to much time being lonely, and she fills that void. When Iâ€™m feeling at my absolute worst, buying a merch item of her always cheers me up. But itâ€™s temporary. 

I want to scream. I want to cry. I want to know why I canâ€™t connect with a living person. I want to know how I could have allowed myself to make a idiot out of myself doing this. 

I canâ€™t feel anything anymore. I guess thats why I was diagnosed with ASPD. 

Sorry for any errors, Iâ€™m always drunk around this time.

Iâ€™m so fucking tired.
