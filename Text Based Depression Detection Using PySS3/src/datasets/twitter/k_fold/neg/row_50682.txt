Painfully rambling, pact fell throughMy stupid self fell in love with this guy.
I had a lot of talks with myself that it was okay to accept this happiness/feeling and accepting it would not lead to negativity.

A week into dating after so long of seeing each other he lost his job and packed up his shit, told me he was moving back home states away and to date other people.

And right around that time I was suffering hard with my life situation and a traumatic event nobody cares about how it's fucked me up anyway so this added fuel to my decision.
I entered a suicide pact with some random guy.
The *only* reason it fell through was transportation. We were only a few hours away but our plans were solid otherwise.

When my now ex was states away I admitted to entering a pact. When he returned he sat me down at a park and somehow, managed to get me to spill the details and talk about it.

He told me that when it came down to it I wouldn't kill myself, because thinking is different than doing and your brain/body has a defense mechanism against it.

Then he told me he thought he was my motive. I told him he wasn't but it didn't help the case.

Even with him back, I don't feel the same. I feel deeper misery. I feel like he is not enough to make me want to stay. I feel like he makes the situation worst, even though he is so sweet and loving to me.

Much like my family and kids, I just don't care if I leave them behind. I just don't care anymore. I don't care to stick around and I just don't care who I hurt. I don't think anybody would actually care anyway.

Not being able to go through with the pact, makes me feel like every day I'm not supposed to be here. I fucked up, I failed at the planning stage. I fucked everything up and I cant stop regretting it.
