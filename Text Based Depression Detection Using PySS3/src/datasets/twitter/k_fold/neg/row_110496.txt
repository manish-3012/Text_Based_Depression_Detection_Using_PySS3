lost my only friendShe's been going through stuff and I've just been making it worse by being a depressed mess. I became harder and harder to deal with and she finally blocked me now. Not answering me calls or anything. Idk how to go on from here. Meeting her was the best thing to happen to me in years and I just blew it like that. I sent her a package for Christmas and she said she's just gonna send it back. I've been crocheting and worked so hard on what I made her for her just to never see it. Fucking hate this. Fuck. I don't think I can go on
