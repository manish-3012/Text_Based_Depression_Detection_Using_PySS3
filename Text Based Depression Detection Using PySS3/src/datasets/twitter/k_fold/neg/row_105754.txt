Itâ€™s over tonight.I havenâ€™t been out of bed in 2 days. Iâ€™m a freshman in college but canâ€™t bring myself to go to class. The girl of my dreams for about 2 years now has decided to be with my best friend instead despite knowing how I feel. My parents and grandparents are helping me with school and will be disappointed if I fail, but I still canâ€™t bring myself to go every day. Even one class feels like an eternity. I stay up all night, write poetry, and listen to music to try to cope with the blows of every day life but I no longer can get by. Most of my friends donâ€™t care anymore. Thereâ€™s no use to continue when youâ€™re alone in a black hole. Antidepressants are starting to level out and not give as much relief. Iâ€™m in physical pain from my anxiety and depression and Iâ€™m going to end it all soon. The only thing thatâ€™s kept me here so long is my family. I love my little sister to death. She is my best friend and knows how hard life is on me. She will understand.
