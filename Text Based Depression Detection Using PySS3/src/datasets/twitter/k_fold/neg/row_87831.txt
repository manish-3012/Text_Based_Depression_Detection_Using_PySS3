I dont even blame covid anymoreI'm gonna be one of the approximately 45,000 suicides from unemployment in the UK every year... more this year, lol. I can't stop crying as I write the 20th dogshit CV that someone suited jackass is gonna look over for two seconds, jump straight to the employment history section, and reject immediately as though me putting myself in thousands of pounds of debt to go to university for 3 years doesnt mean a fucking thing.
