I just cut myselfIâ€™ve thought about it a lot, but never done it before.  Just a few marks above my knee that look like very long paper cuts. It doesnâ€™t help anything at all, but at least itâ€™s something I can do to express how much I hate existence. I wish I saw death as a way out, but I see it as a continuation of existence through eternity. So I donâ€™t even have the hope of a possible escape. I tried suicide last year. I survived, obviously, and realize now that I was trying to make a statement rather than find a way out. Because there is no way out. Itâ€™s childish of me to keep being upset about it instead of making the best of existence, but I canâ€™t just snap out of it. 

I see my psychiatrist tomorrow. Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™m going to tell him about cutting myself or not. I want to be honest with him, but I feel like Iâ€™ll be tongue tied when I actually try to tell him. 

Fuck life.
