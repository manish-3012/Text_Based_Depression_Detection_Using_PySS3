Child threatening suicide on Skype. How do I help?I can't figure out how to report this on Skype. A friend of a friend of my son is threatening suicide on Skype. My son's friend only knows this boy though Skype, not IRL. He's only 12 years old. All I have to go by is his Skype ID and that he lives in SW Arkansas. He said his mother passed away, and he has expressed that his dad is abusive. Also has a history of cutting. He lives in a different state than us, so I don't know if calling 911 would do anything. What do I do?
