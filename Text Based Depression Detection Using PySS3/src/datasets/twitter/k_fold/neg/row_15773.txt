Too damaged to be loved..Iâ€™m a very like able person. I have many friends, and I easily make new friends. 
I work well with others, and Iâ€™m very hard working. I hold my
Work to a high standard, and easily criticize myself when I mess up.

In the last four years, Iâ€™ve changed a lot. Iâ€™ve climbed a ladder I thought never existed.

However, there is one thing Iâ€™ve been trying to acquire and have failed many times to acquire.

Love. Embrace. Connection. Depth. With another person. Once I get close, I either scare the other one or push them away.

Iâ€™ve never experienced a significant other. It seems like Iâ€™m always giving away my energy and never receiving it.

Since 10 years old Iâ€™ve been depressed. Suicidal thoughts were not evident until after I was hospitalized at 16. 

I would maybe have an episode every 2 years since then. Iâ€™m now at the point where I have suicidal thoughts every day.

Iâ€™ve turned to hardcore drugs over the last year. Acid, Molly, cocaine... whatever makes me feel happy for the short time Iâ€™m distracted from my suicidal thoughts.

But itâ€™s no longer distracting me. I have an awesome support system of friends, yet I think they feel helpless.

They know Iâ€™m depressed... lost... stuck .. they donâ€™t really know I think of actually killing myself daily..

Iâ€™m at the point where I may need to start writing goodbye notes to those close to me.. 

I tried getting a therapist again, but Iâ€™m on a waiting list even though I told them my history and my recent suicidal thought behavior.

I just want to feel the pain. Iâ€™ve never actually tried to kill myself, just thoughts, but I want to inflict some pain on myself..

On my recent drug trip, I had a revelation that ... well I was molested as a child. Iâ€™ve always known this.. I even revealed this to my therapist when I was 10, but said it so non-chalantly that it spooked my therapist... I didnâ€™t see much of her after that... I think she was scared at how aware I was of it.. or maybe thatâ€™s just me projecting..

Realizing at such a young age the burdens I had to carry with me my whole life... Itâ€™s a weight no child should ever have to carry... but this was my burden, and I couldnâ€™t forget it..


I just want the pain to end... honestly Iâ€™m a hopeless romantic looking for the one who wonâ€™t run when I tell them how damaged I am because they know deep down how good of a human being I can really truly be.. but I donâ€™t think this will ever come to fruition..

Ive scared too many people away from me.. continuing to push them away...

When will I ever feel whole? When will I ever find love? Never? If thatâ€™s the answer, then Iâ€™m okay with that... but I just need an answer soon because I want to know if I should keep fighting for someone to love me , or just end it all...

Is it worth waiting in misery and pain for a dream? A fantasy? Something that is over zealous and never going to come to fruition...
