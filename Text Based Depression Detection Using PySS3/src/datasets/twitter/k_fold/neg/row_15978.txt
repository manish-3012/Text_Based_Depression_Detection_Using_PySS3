Would it count as suicide if you purposely starve or dehydrate yourself?Just a curiosity. A few months ago, I've thought about running lost into the wilderness without food or water and never coming back, because I wanted to die. Would it count as breaking the fifth commandment if you let yourself starve and dehydrate? It's not you that's forcing your life to end. It's just nature doing its course.
