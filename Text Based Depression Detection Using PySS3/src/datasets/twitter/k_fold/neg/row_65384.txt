I am tired of my lifeBeen alone my whole life, my family is full of egoists that only talk about superficial shit.

The last relationship I have been in I was treated like a burden and it left me heartbroken, traumatized and lonely.

Now I want to get a husky pup and everyone makes it so difficult to get one...

And it also seems I don't have the money for it.

Getting a husky pup was the only thing that gave me hope.

I am crying every day since the breakup.

Nobody gives a shit.

Therapy helps me but I am walking through life feeling like a ghost.

I am already dead.

I am tired, very tired.

And I can't endure this pain anymore.

I just want it to end.

I don't recognize myself anymore...
