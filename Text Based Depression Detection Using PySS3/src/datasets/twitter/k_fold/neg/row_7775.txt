I feel everything is f*cked upThis is a long thing, i feel that my own life is a mess. I was a good student until primary school 4th grade, but after that, everything turned to bad. Like all my grade were reduced by 1 for no reason, and all my teachers turned to hate me. My classmates hated me for no reason. At the end of primary school, my kidney stopped to work (this was another thing to hate me...).

From the start of high school 80% of my classmates were hate me (OK, that was partly my bad) and the first signs of relationships were at 11th class (but now I have no relationship with them).

I thought that the community of transplanted youth will be good for me, but after 5-6 years, they only laugh at me, and my "friends" doesn't care about me, only if I'm looking for them.

My mother and all my relatives are only screwing with me, all I do is WRONG. Yesterday my mother asked me if I can do her english homework (she attends some high scool) and yeah, what did she do? She complained about how slow I am...

And last:my Grandmother died recently, and I have nobody to talk with (noone of friends are cares about me) and this is only other excuse to my mother for verbally abuse me.

And the worst: I became addicted to alcohol :( (this is another big arguing...)
