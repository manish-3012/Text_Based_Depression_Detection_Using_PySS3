I cheated on my boyfriend. I can't live with it anymoreHi people. It's fine if you hate me or think I'm disgusting. It won't matter. Today I'll jump off the bridge near my home. I just hope I won't suffer. Amir, I love you. I always did. I fucked up and I did something horrible. I don't want forgiveness, I don't deserve that. I just wanted to apologize before I end it all. Thank you for everything
