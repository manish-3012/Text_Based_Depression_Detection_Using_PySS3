Is there something close to hanging yourself but still survive?I want a rest.  
In 9 hours is my last exit exam and I probably just lost another person that others would probably call a "friend"...  
I need a rest.  
I want to be gone and come back to another time, under other circumstances.  
Why do people kill opportunities for a lifetime? Why they say it will be a "no" forever?  
Just asking for a drink.  
Why can't I just do simple funny things with the people I already know for five years?  
How can I be gone for a time?  
What do they mean?  
Why can't they tell the cause?  
I need a rest.   
I want smplicity.
