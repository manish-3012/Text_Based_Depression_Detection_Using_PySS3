i should have killed myself alreadyLast year, on the 31st of December i promised myself to not be alive long enough for 2021. Now its fucking December again and guess what, I'm still alive. School's burning me out more and more and now that we're about to go back to normal instead of distance learning and every teacher wants to makes one exam after the other i really don't think I'm can make it. It's advent and I don't wanna ruin christmas in the long run for my family and friends but fr I can't do this shit. that's why i regret not killing myself earlier. why tf was i such a pussy i hate it so much.
