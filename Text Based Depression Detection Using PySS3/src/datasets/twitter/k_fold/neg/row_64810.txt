I feel as if I'm coming to an end.My name is Camille. I'm 19, and the eldest of 4 half siblings. I'm writing this because lately I've been feeling very on edge, to the point where I'm ready to go. Family hasn't been much of a help, I'm apparently the biggest piece of shit ever just because I didn't immediately go into college. Its also so hard finding a good paying and stable job, which adds on more stress. I don't know what to do anymore. I've been trying my best, doing all that I can. I'm done. Does family not understand that instead of being rude and pushy, they can lend a helping hand ? I really hope I don't fucking wake up tomorrow.
