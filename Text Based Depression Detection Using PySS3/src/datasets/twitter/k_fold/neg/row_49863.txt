I will keep on living, but I'm dead inside. No ambition. I'm just passing the time.I am in my early twenties, I have no ambitions to meet a partner, getting married and absolutely not having any children. My life is going to consist of me finding a job then working, so I can pay the government most of my hard earned money for them to continue to act like the tyrannical and authoritarian overlords they seem to think they are. Most importantly though so I can afford to live my life out comfortably. and not be a bother to anyone else. 

I despise myself and humanity. I will keep on going because although I may be in a hell of a lot of pain, I feel I probably deserve it. Hopefully some disease or something will get to me before I lose all my capabilities in my old age. 

I am going to slowly watch as civilisation deteriorates over my lifetime. Just watching the world descend into more and more chaos... Anyone else come to this conclusion after years of endless suicidal thoughts?
