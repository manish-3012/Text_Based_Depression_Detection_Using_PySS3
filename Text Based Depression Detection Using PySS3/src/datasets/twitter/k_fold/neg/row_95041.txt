The end will always be the same for meOnce again I've come to a conclusion that it can't actually get fully better. It just stops getting better and you can't so anything. It's worse than it just being bad. Cause you know it was pointless and you can't win. I hate how much I don't give a fuck about anything. The only things stopping me are my pets. Everyone will eventually be happy without me. No problems, no screams, just a happy family without that piece of shit. Why do they love me if I dissappoint them so much? I just want them to finally let go. I don't want help or comfort, I want them to mind their own life and accept the choice I made. Last week it was my birthday and I hope it was the last one. I'm fonna make sure this time. The only thing I regret in life is not killing myself when I wanted to. Now I just need to do it. I have to. This is a reminder to myself that I shouldn't give myself any hope and if I'm hesitating about it, I should just do it. If you want to kill yourself, because you really don't want to be alive, don't let people stop you, but seek some help if you want to, but just don't know how.
