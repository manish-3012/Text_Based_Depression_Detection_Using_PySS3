I dont want to live, dont have a reasonI am tired of my life, i feel like if i die, nothing will change, i am gonna be kicked from university because i failed an exam, my dad will be dissapointed and i feel really sad because he put some much effort in me and i failed him, i just dont want to live more, i wish some car just hit me while i am crossing the street, i want to sleep forever
