Just got fired from work after some legal issues from the recent past were found.I did something that I'll never forgive myself in February of this past year that landed me in legal trouble, got me suspended from college, and basically halted my life. While it was nothing that directly hurt anyone, it was something that looks very bad on a record and effectively ended any chance of me fulfilling long term life goals.

I had been going to community college classes in the meantime back home and working a non-internship type summer job, the same one I did all of last summer before anything happened, and was hoping after I was convicted that I'd still be able to keep that job so that I'd at least have some income short term, but decided not to tell them until convicted. Today I got a call from my boss that the HR department found something and I would need to be let go effective immediately. I've never felt so low and hopeless in my life. Even a no-skills summer job wouldn't take me with my record and I just can't stop thinking about how you only get one shot at life and I completely ruined mine. I really feel like there's no hope for a normal life and if I can't get to the goals that I had all planned out then I don't see any point in wasting away for 60 years being looked at as scum.
