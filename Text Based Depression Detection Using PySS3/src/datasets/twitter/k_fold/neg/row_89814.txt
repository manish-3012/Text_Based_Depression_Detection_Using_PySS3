NJ crisis help lineAnyone have a number to call? Planning to kill myself on the 6th and it is getting harder to wait. Was hoping I would be convinced by now not to do this but it only gets worse every day not better. 1800SUICIDE is gone I believe, not that it mattered, they blocked me years ago because I would cry too much.
