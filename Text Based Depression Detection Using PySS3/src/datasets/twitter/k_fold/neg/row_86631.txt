Tired againEver hear the song alone again naturally? 
I wish I could hold the people I loved. Most of them are dead. When youâ€™re 29 and your serious boyfriend of four years dies on his kitchen floor from an overdose....dying at age 33....I was a broken woman. I always will be. The following year my father died. Inbetween having friends of mine die from overdose. Many!!!

I fear my best friend will die any day and I pray he doesnâ€™t. Iâ€™ve lost so much of how the world and daily life used to be. All I look forward to is a car accident where Iâ€™m the only one killed. I might want to have my last drunken night somewhere, give away my poems, my music my art. My friends and bf all died too young even my dad. I cannot stand existing.

I thought I could make a difference, I do love myself and some abilities but when you have no drive left....without a choice....Iâ€™m surprised Iâ€™m not physically dead yet.
