Suicide Seems To Be The Only Path LeftI have spent years and years and years holding on to hope, and whatever I hold on to as hope whether it be a new lifestyle or love or habits or whatever, somehow always that hope is soured, and ends up hurting me instead. I am just....I am so tired of this. I am exhausted, I feel burned out. I put so much effort into improving my life and the lives of people around me, I put effort into relationships and love, and all that effort throughout time never has amounted to anything but me feeling alone, exhausted, and miserable. I've had a bad feeling this was my final year for a long while here and the way my life is going it just feels inevitable now. Death is my only escape from the endless dead ends in my life, from the constant struggles to improve my life and/or find some semblance of happiness or contentment. It all has gone nowhere and I just feel like no matter how the deck is shuffled, suicide is the inevitable end game here. I'm tired. I'm tired of exerting so much energy to feel better or make a better life or find love or do anything to feel happy and it resulting in disappointment and pain. I think I'm gonna buy a gun, and give my best friend one last chance to see me in person and tie up a few loose ends, leave some gifts behind, and just end this suffering. I really just feel like I extinguished everything and this is the only way out. I dont even want to try anymore. I have exerted so much energy trying to have a content life just to always be in pain.
