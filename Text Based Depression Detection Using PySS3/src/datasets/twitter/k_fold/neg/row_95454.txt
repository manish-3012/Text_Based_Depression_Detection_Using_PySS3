I've been like this for years, what's the point? I genuinely don't think that it will get better for me.I am a 20 year old man. I was diagnosed with depression at 8. I attempted suicide for the first time when I was 9, and then again at 11 and 12. 

From 8 to 14, I was on over a dozen medications in total. I also spent probably a non-consecutive year in psychiatric hospitals, where I was periodically abused by the staff (emotionally but sometimes physically). I feel like I keep remembering things that happened from my psych ward stays. I genuinely hate myself when I think about the things that happened. I can't ever forget them, and that really bothers me.

I am in college, and I'm going to be about $30,000 in debt when I graduate. I have an okay relationship with my family and good friends, but I just feel numb all of the time. Nothing has ever really mattered to me. I am starting to think that I will always be like this. I used to have moments of optimism, where I would think about the future and how things would be better for me. Now, I know that this was childish.

Another quite major thing is that I was born with a few pretty severe birth defects which affect my genitalia. Women have been interested in me since high school, but I hate my body so much that I have never gotten up the confidence to even kiss anyone before. This also makes me sterile, which in itself is really difficult to deal with. I will never be able to be a father, and I don't even know whether or not I'll be able to have sex or be in an intimate relationship.

Honestly, I really fail to see the point of living. Nothing I can do can change the way I feel. I have had extensive therapy. I have been on many different medications, so many that I can't even remember all of their names. I have tried meditation. I have exercised daily for the past four years, I eat very healthy, I get enough sleep, etc. 

People have told me for years, and all the time, that I am such a "good person", that I'm so responsible and kind and funny and smart, etc. etc. etc. All of this has always rang so hollow to me. I need to get out. I can't deal with this anymore. I can't deal with all of this frustration and depression for the rest of my life. I am tired of keeping everything inside of me. I can't deal with all of this anymore. I feel like there is nothing that can be done to help me. It's like I'm really desperate, but at the same time, I am just completely resigned. What should I do?
