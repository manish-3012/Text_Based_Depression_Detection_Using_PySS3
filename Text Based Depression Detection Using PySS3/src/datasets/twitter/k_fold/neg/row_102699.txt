Someone please tell me not to do itI have no one irl to talk to and who would tell me my life is worth living. I need someone to just tell me not to do it because Iâ€™m loosing hope. I just called my parents fifth teen times in one day and they are not responding: I havenâ€™t spoken to them in almost 3 weeks
