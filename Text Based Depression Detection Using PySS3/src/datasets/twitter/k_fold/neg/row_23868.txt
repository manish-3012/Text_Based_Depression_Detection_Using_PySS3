I donâ€™t know what to do anymoreToday is 2 days after my one year anniversary of trying to commit suicide. I really canâ€™t bear life anymore. Everything that could go wrong is going wrong and my life is a fucking mess. I donâ€™t have any hope or drive anymore. My bipolar outbreaks are controlling my life. I canâ€™t do it. I want it to end. I have nothing to look forward to anymore. I enjoy nothing anymore. I donâ€™t even feel emotion towards my fiancÃ© anymore even though heâ€™s all I want, but I donâ€™t feel emotion at all besides dread and anger. I want it to end. I donâ€™t want to keep going on like this.
