I can't be savedMy psychiatrst told me I've already tried all available SRRIs, nothing works on me. It has been 3 years since I got diagnosed with depression. I feel like I'm losing my mind, sometimes I don't remember a thing that happened a minute ago. I'm just a fucking trash, I want to try to hang myself within 2 hours.
