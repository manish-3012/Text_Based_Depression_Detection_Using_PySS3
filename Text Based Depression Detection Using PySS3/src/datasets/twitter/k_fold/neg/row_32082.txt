I donâ€™t knowLet me start off by saying this thank you for reading this. I guess Iâ€™m here because I donâ€™t really have anyone to say goodbye too. Iâ€™m not going to be here for much longer after this post but I want to say one thing, I donâ€™t live with purpose and what purpose does my life have. I tried to find meaning in my life and I just canâ€™t. I donâ€™t need someone to try to change my mind or have pity on me.... just listen and know that youâ€™ll be amazing with whatever you decide to do in life. This is me signing off, who knows maybe youâ€™ll see me on the other side.
