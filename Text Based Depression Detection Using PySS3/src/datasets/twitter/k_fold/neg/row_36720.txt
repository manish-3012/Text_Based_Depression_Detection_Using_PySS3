What do you do when you have no more support system?I've been living with my mom (I'm 25F) since I had to move home (major depressive episode), and since then she's really been my only support. I'm at a place where I can't really leave my bedroom, and I'm in no place to be able to work or afford to go back to school.

Recently, my very different kind psychiatrically ill brother has been calling up my mom at odd hours of the night, going off on long, delusional rants and including threats to hurt her. So she's been really stressed and caught up in all that mess, so I'm basically out of her radar.

What do I do now? I have virtually no one to talk to or help me in my recovery, and on top of that, I just lost my psychiatrist because he came on to me and I quit seeing him. So my meds are about to run out as of Sunday.

I sort of am giving up and just want to die, otherwise I'm just going to have to stick with this daily pain for an indeterminate amount of time, and I don't know if I have enough strength to do that. 

Should I go to a hospital? I know they don't keep you very long, but at least I would get some attention for a bit. Can anyone shed some light?
