Losing all the hope for future.I don't know if its the right subreddit to post this.

I seriously do not know how to say this but i have lost all the faith for future. I feel like dying but i am such a coward that i would never be able to kill myself. I don't want my family to go through that pain. I feel like such a loser. After moving to a new country couple of years back, i still couldn't make any friends. Last year, i lost my job which i hated btw but it was atleast paying my bills. I feel like i am good for nothing. I have no skills and my whole life sucks big time. Not getting anything has done a lot of image to my confidence. Everytime i feel this way, i just console myself. I tell myself that there are so many people in the world who have things worse than me but i can't always avoid my own suffering. I go online and see my friends from back home living their life to the fullest, meeting new people. And here i am wasting every second of it and stuck in this bullshit of a life . I know i won't kill myself but i feel like dying all the time. I just don't know for how long i have to suffer. I am losing all the remaining strength.
