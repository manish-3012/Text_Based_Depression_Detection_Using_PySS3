My last thing that made me happy is fuckedSucculents were my passion and my only hobby. They were like my babies but now they have fucking mealybugs because I got careless and didn't check a new plant. I can't do anything right anymore, i feel like the universe is just telling me that i don't deserve to be happy or have even one thing to think about. My therapist was a bitch so i stopped talking to her and she wouldn't let me have the sleep meds for my insomnia or anti depressants when i wanted to die. I'm so tired. I am always in pain with migraines, asthma or awful cramps that last all month. I was finally able to relax when the summer holidays started but i have been set a ton of work to do so i can't rest. I'm loosing my mind.
