Does anyone else feel like the universe wants them to kill themselves?Everything that can go wrong goes wrong for me, or atleast it feels that way.

I'm failing math (Engineering, so it is pretty advanced), I have a huge project in English I need to present for the whole class and so on. We finally got a 1 week leave from school now and of course I had to go catch the common cold right before the start.

I'm 2 days in, can't do anything fun on account of my throat hurting like a motherfucker, random headaches and an irritated nose, my tastebuds are fucked too so I can't even enjoy the 2L coke zero my mother bought for me at the start of the week. Since I haven't touched the Coke my family just took it and drank it instead, didn't care that I was saving it.

Everything is going shit, I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything I do in general, I can't succeed in anything, be it playing games on the fucking computer or just existing in general. Now my back hurts too and I'm only 17 years old, most likely temporary but still, when I move my back it stings.

Both my parents are kind of nutty, I don't understand it myself. One second they can be happily married and doesn't seem to care about anything, another they're fighting about nothing at all. I can't wrap my head around it.

My little brother has ADHD and is a spoiled little shit that I want to beat the fucking crap out of most of the time, but he's still my brother and I love him.

Everything in my life is total chaos, nothing goes my way, literally nothing. I can't think of one thing last week that has gone my way without me putting in an excruciating amount of effort to make it go my way. Fuck my life.

I know where the key to the gun safe is, I really just want to tear my head open.

Literally the only thing keeping me from killing myself is that my family would be sad and angry, but the concern for their feelings is starting to fade.

But whatever, it's just teenage angst, am I right? Haha.
