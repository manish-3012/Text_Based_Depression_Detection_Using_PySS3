VentI dont want help anymore, I want to disappear. In a perfect world, I'd simply erase my existence entirely, but it's not a perfect world. I have to man the fuck up and kill myself already. I've been putting it off for so long, but I've only gotten worse over the years. I'm fucking worthless, I cant do anything right. School used to be the only thing I was good at, but now I'm failing at that too. I don't have anything going for me anymore. I deserve all of my pain, it's all my fault. Nobody is to blame but me. I'm such a pussy, I cant kill myself but I cant put in the effort to get better. I dont care what anyone says, the world is better off without me. I'm a burden to everyone around me, they've all stuck around out of pity and I know it. I'm terrible at everything I do. I've failed every test this year, and missed most of my assignments. I dont have an excuse. Last year was the worst fucking year of my life, and I still got straight A's. I've given up on myself, its not worth the effort anymore. I'm suffering just to die in the end. Everything I know will be gone in 100 years, so why should I give a shit? I may as well end things early. 

In a few years, I'm gonna buy a gun and finish it off. Once I'm old enough, I'm gonna do what I need to get the fuck out of here.
