I need advice from others with suicidal family membersI need help, any advice just throw it at me. My sister is 19, sheâ€™s suffered from severe depression since she was a young kid. Me and my other sibling are bipolar but we have never been as depressed as her in our down phases. She is the sweetest person iâ€™ve ever met and she cares so much about people. She has been drinking and driving which is out of character for her, she totaled her car 10 days ago because she tried to kill her self by getting ran over by a train, hit something else instead and came home freaking out. she spent a week in behavior health where she definitely played her cards right and got out in a week. She acted like her normal self and said she had felt much better. We were still watching her and  being cautious but she is 19 and still needs her space. fast forward 3 days later she drove my dads car since hers in totaled. She drove way out to the country, and drove on a back highway (the 2 lane with no street lights no sign of nothin kind of back highways)  and drove off the road! she rolled over the car multiple times until landing in a tree. she crawled out and got help as she only suffers from whiplash now, thankfully. that car is destroyed and crushed to nothing. no one including any medical staff understand how she survived. as soon as she got to the hospital she said she wants to die again. 

i donâ€™t know what to do!! she is relentless and it is killing my mom and dad and destroying our familyâ€™s state of mind. we havenâ€™t told any family outside of us 6. We never put her down for her thoughts or anything like that. we tell her weâ€™ll accept her for whatever she needs even if it involves moving half way across the country.
