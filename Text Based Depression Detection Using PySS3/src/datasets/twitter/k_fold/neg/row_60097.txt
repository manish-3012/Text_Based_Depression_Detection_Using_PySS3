I don't know...I don't know... I've posted this in a few other places but I just need to release some emotions...I'm a complete failure...I have $5000 in debt because I have a spending problem. My job is hell and no one even sees me there. My future career is non-existent. I don't have any talents or giftings. My girlfriend has called me dumb, ugly, and a few other things...she is the only one who has ever wanted me and now I don't even know what to think about her anymore. My family thinks I'm a disappointment...I just feel like there's nothing left to live for..
