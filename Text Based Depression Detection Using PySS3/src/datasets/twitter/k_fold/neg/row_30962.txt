All i need is someone in my life.I don't have anyone at all, for ANYTHING. I just have to keep living so i can be jealous of others who don't even try to get what i need.
They have everything ready, and i have NOTHING. Why even try ??

Its ok. Lets say that i have accepted that i will never have a girlfriend and that im just fine. BUT having nobody at all? Seriously mate? What is this?

All i EVER do is sit on a computer. That has literally become my WHOLE "life". Im so homestuck cause i have zero friends. I have zero friends, because im homestuck. WHAT IS THIS HELL ???

Im only 15 and i will end this. Im really sorry for everything i have ever done. Im a true mistake, an accident, that nobody wants in their life.

Once i buy a bullet from a near store, i wont consider otherwise.

GOD! I will never even experience talking to someone, hugging someone, kissing someone, or even how it is like to have a real friend who you trust and rely on.

At least im not lost. There is one door left for me. Death!
Its the only light i can see. Some people are born to just do that. Everything is just so unfair. Its a good thing that in the end we all are the same.

Edit: Guys. I really didn't expect anything good to come out of this post, and yet you've temporally mentally helped me! I cant remember when i last felt this way. I really appreciate it. Thank you so much :') Your awesome :D
