I think I am ready to kill myself if things do not get better.I don't have a criminal record. However, I have been accused of quite a few negative things (nothing illegal though). If one google's my name, these things come up. It is true that some good things come up of which I am quite proud. And I am quite well educated and trying to improve myself constantly. 

However, I am worried that the things I have been accused of will haunt me forever. Basically (I filmed some people all of whom were adults and over the age of consent because they had been bothering me, the footage was not explicit and it was in a public area so I did not need to get their permission). 

They put a statement out online saying that I filmed  them without their permission (I did not need their permission, what I did was perfectly legal). Furthermore, if they thought what I did was so appalling then how come they did not get the police involved? (I would have wanted this to happen as once I was found to be doing nothing wrong they could be arrested for wasting police time) and how come they did not sue me (As they knew they would lose)

Now I thought about suing for libel but I was concerned that (as the wording accusing me was subtle making no out and out accusations but making the things that I did that were perfectly legal sound dodgy), this would cause the material to spread further and if I lost the legal case I would have to pay legal fees and I didn't want to give my detractors any money. 

Now, quite a few of the people accusing me have since been exposed as dubious people to say the least, so it is good to know I was right to be suspicious about them. However, I am worried that because I have negative things written about me online, this will affect my career chances. 

If a potential employer brings it up at an interview should I just point out that I have no criminal record?
