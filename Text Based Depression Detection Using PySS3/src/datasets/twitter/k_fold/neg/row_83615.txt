Fuck itNot sure how much longer I can keep pushing. Everyday it just gets shittier and shittier. If there were a loaded shotgun next to me I would not hesitate to aim it upon myself and pull the trigger. I'm losing weight (30 lbs down) and really want to change myself but every single night I am left with the same conclusion. I'm an unlovable piece of trash who will probably end up in a ditch somewhere anyways. I would always scoff when people went on the internet to complain about how the girl they liked didn't like them back but I get it now. The hardest part is when you trick yourself into thinking that they do like you, but then realize that there is no possible way that they could care about someone as awful as you. Losing weight has been easy cause I haven't quite the appetite that I had before lately.

The thing is I've been blaming everything wrong in my life on being fat, but as time goes on and I lose more and more and more, I just realize that I truly am a horrible person, and that noone could care about me. The fat wasn't hiding some new form of myself that would immediately be a perfect person, it was just hiding my skeleton. No matter how fit or how thin I'll ever get, I'll just stay unloved for the rest of my life. Maybe it isn't a bad thing. Things were much easier when I didn't talk to anyone and I sat in my room all day alone. Atleast I had my priorities straight. Atleast I didn't care about how much anyone else liked me. Fuck it I'm done.
