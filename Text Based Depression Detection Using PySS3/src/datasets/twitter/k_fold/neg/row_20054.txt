I'm slowly dying and want to drive away and dieI was so happy a month ago, had everything I wanted,  and goals to pursue.  3 beautiful children and a loving partner.  CPS got involved in our lives and ripped us apart. I am now homeless, I haven't ate in days and all I do is lay down. My partner left me high and dry and ive lost evrything....I have nothing to live for because now everyone is against me. Yes im human and might have said things out of anger and begged my partner I tried to go home buf he called the cops on me. I don't want to live anymore im not strong enough and these panic attacks and anxiety attacks are top much too bear.
