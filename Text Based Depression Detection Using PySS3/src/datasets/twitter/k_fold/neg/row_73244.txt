There are two parts of me. (Edit: getting used to mobile formatting, put space for paragraphs)

The part of me that wants to kill myself, and the part of me that wants to live. I mostly feel the former. Most days I don't have the energy to leave my bed or the couch. I sit at home alone all day wasting my time. Each day I realize how pointless it is for me to even try because I know even if I choose to live I will always be depressed for the rest of my life.
 
When Chris Cornell killed himself a few months ago, I had an epiphany. Since then, I have no longer ask myself the question 'do I actually want to kill myself'. I no longer ask myself that question because Cornell's death made me realize that is is not an 'if' question, but a 'when'. 

But then there is the rare few days where I sober up from my depression and I actually feel for a little bit. I feel love for my family and friends. I am excited to learn new things. I genuinely feel a strong core identity of who I am and what I want. Sadly these days are so few and far inbetween.

It was raining yesterday when I woke up. I laid in bed for hours mindlessly browsing reddit and youtube. I did finally get out of bed but I just went straight to the couch where I did the same all day. I haven't done anything productive in months and I am getting so fucking bored of this cycle where I try to distract myself from my own thoughts.

Now that winter is coming I can look forward to overcast, cold rainy days for the next forever. The part of me that knows I want to live is worried because I know that my depression is so much worse  in the winter. And the way things are looking I honestly don't think I am going to make it until 2018. I know exactly where and how I am going to kill myself. Fuck this life. It is sort of comical to me that all of these resources were wasted on me for 20 years, food, school, friends time and energy to be with me. All for naught, because I will soon cease to exist.
