No will to carry on with anythingI met this girl a year ago, we both were full of positiviti and spent every hour, every minute, every day together. We got really attached to one another, life was great with her, everything was we would go to sleep together, and wake up together, genuinly loved eachother, i would always stop anything i was doing when she would msg me, and so would she. It started going downhill when i got into heated arguments with close friends i had known for a very long time, i pushed everyone i was close with away, except for her we kept in contact and carried on being together, eventually something changed i got even more depressed for losing most of my friends, and i started pushing her away, i wouldnt talk about anything serious anymore, i was being a jackass and being distant, this was a problem because whilst i struggled to keep people around me she always met new friends online and irl, in a span of a month or two of barely talking i did get better and was coming back to my usual self, the problem was this girl had gotten over me. I have been trying everything to get her back, but the more i try the more she avoids me now, everything feels like shit and im lost without her, i know that ending myself isnt worth it but with my mind being a mess right now thats the only thing still lingering in my mind besides her. . . 
What should i do reddit (English is not my first language, and im writing this on few hours of sleep, so please forgive me for the mistakes i have left)
