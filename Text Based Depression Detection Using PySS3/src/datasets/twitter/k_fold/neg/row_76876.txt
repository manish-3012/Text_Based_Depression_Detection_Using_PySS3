Please helpIdk what to do. I recently gambled away 180k ripple (about 2 months ago) and I have been in a depressive state since. I have been having some very dark thoughts, and it hurts to see something that I have been working for a saving for all year long just to lose it, and itâ€™s now pumping. Roughly 80k usd in current prices. I feel like complete shit and fuck man Iâ€™m just trying to stay positive but Iâ€™m just not in a good mental state
