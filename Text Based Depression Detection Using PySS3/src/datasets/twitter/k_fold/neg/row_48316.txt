No hopeThereâ€™s nothing worse to me than being told by the one person that I shared my life with that thereâ€™s no hope. I ruined everything and every second of this feeling just makes me want to end all of it more and more. Why the fuck canâ€™t I just be normal? Whyâ€™d I have to freak out and ruin the only thing that made me feel remotely safe?
