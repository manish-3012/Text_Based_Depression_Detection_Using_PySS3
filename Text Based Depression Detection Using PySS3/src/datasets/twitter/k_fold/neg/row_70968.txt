Draft of my Suicide Letter?To (you, my love)

I'm sorry about the things I've said to you. My past doesn't justify what I've done. It doesn't. It never has. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. And in all honesty, I think you're beautiful. Everything about you is beautiful, don't let anyone take that from you. Even me. I don't deserve you. I never did. I think you deserve so much better - go out there and find it. I need to join my dad now. I feel like he needs me. I think he's lonely. So don't worry about me - I'm with him. He'll take care of me. I want you to know that I love you, not just as a friend but as a lover and the only family I've ever truly known. I do. But not all family is healthy. I have to go. Please don't hold yourself back. You are so amazing, I can't even begin to describe it. 

So keep at it.
