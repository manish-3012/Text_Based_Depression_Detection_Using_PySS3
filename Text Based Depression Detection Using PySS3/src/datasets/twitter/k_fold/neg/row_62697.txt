I survived multiple attempts, years later Iâ€™m thrivingI made this post because it breaks my heart reading so many people who want to die, so hereâ€™s my story and how I am now. 

began self harming at 13 and I would cut myself every damn day for years. When I was 14 I got so fed up with the world and who I was that I started taking pills for relief. One day I swallowed as many as I physically could (think it was 100mg each) and closed my eyes to rest. Woke up throwing up and feeling so disgustingly sick and this sick lasted for weeks. I couldnâ€™t eat proper food and I couldnâ€™t hold too many liquids either. My liver was so fucked up for long. I couldnâ€™t even take one pill anymore without so much physical pain. 

I remember the day I tried to end it by cutting open my arms. It was a cool fall day, probably mid September or October. Nothing bad happened that day, I just was so fucking sick of it all. I grabbed the razor I usually cut myself with and just went as hard as I physically could down and all over my wrists. Holy shit the blood was terrifying. As soon as I saw the blood I immediately covered both of my arms up and did my best to stop the bleeding. The cuts actually werenâ€™t that deep and I didnâ€™t hit any veins so I was sure Iâ€™d be okay and just move on with my life. The scars were pink and very visible for years, and by that I mean everyone could look at them and see what I did till around my 18th birthday. In March of 2018 they were basically white and no longer really puffy so I decided that I would cover the one on my left wrist with a tattoo. That healed me emotionally so god dam much. 

I have a rose on my left wrist and the stem covers the scar so well that you canâ€™t even see it anymore. It just looks normal. After I got the tattoo I realized how free I felt; my past really was gone for good and I could move on. This year (literally on my 19th birthday) I got another one but it covers the deep purple scars I had on my upper arm. Itâ€™s a floral band wrapping around my upper arm completely and oh fuck did it hurt to get done. But I shit you not, I almost cried after getting it because I felt... itâ€™s indescribable. As for my body after the pill addiction and pill OD.. thatâ€™s a different story.

I have IBS now because I permanently fucked up my intestines that badly. Nobody in my family knows this is why I probably have it but thatâ€™s what a private meeting with my doctor concluded. My liver is healed and I can actually take 2 250mg pills for a headache, but thatâ€™s all I can handle without pain. 

I have a great job, amazing support system, amazing boyfriend, and even though life can be tough, I always remember Iâ€™m tougher. I survived two serious attempts and here I am at 19 having the time of my life. Five years ago I didnâ€™t even think recovery was possible and now I havenâ€™t cut myself in probably 9 months (it fuckin sucks kicking that habit), I graduated high school (NEVER planned on that), I have a great job that pays $17 an hour (and thatâ€™s just the minimum for my trade, Iâ€™m gonna keep going up) and life is just so great in general. Recovery is possible and itâ€™ll take years, Iâ€™m still getting better and trying to move on from it all, but it is worth it.
