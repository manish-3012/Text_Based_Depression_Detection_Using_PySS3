I'm out of optionsI don't know what to do anymore. I got out of a year long bout of depression and unemployment last year, only to get in the same kind of shitty situation in 2011. I'm not unemployed but I feel worthless and I hate my job so much. I had a good job but I got transferred in another place, with the same boss. It's my job to help people who have mental health problem but I'm going to be the one with a big mental health problem if nothing change. I have a hard time describing why I hate it so much. While I loved working in a psych ward, it's totally different where I am now, I don't feel any kind of support from other members of the team I work with. I don't know if the problem is caused by me or what? I need to get out of this situation, somehow I need to get back to the kind of job I loved so much when I starting doing this. I won't be able to live that way for long. Sometimes, I wish I could just live a normal life and not feel as if I'll be forever alone and/or ridden with social anxiety. During a few months, I fell almost normal but now that I feel so insecured about my self worth and my skills, I feel like a failure.

To add to this mess, my financial situation is baaaddddd, I have a hard time making all my payments even if I made debts refinancing in 2009. I'm considering things like replacing my car because it's the worst lemon car I've ever seen but I need to sell it before because I don't even have enough money to consider buying a low budget car.
