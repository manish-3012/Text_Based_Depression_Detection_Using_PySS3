I don't care about an edgy titleThe only posts that get attention are the edgy ones. Fuck that. 

I want to be gone. I have absolutely no fucking reason to stick around. Not one. 

I hate how I look. I want to fucking light myself on fire. I just want to be pretty. My life has no direction, I have no interest in anything for a job. I hate being bisexual. I don't see the point in anything, I'm constantly empty and never happy or satisfied with anything. Something is always missing. I'm lazy and a procrastinator who can't get shit done. I hate this world and the people in it. 

All I want for myself is a good career, to be a pretty girl, marry someone and have kids, and have a good bunch of friends. But that shit is never going to happen. Even if it does, I'd still feel empty as fuck inside.
