The worst feeling is when you want to kill yourself but donâ€™t have the means to do it.I canâ€™t buy a rope/gun/ rat poison because Iâ€™m fourteen and I canâ€™t go alone, I had one suicide attempt and the whole process is so tiring, Because I refused to say anything to the therapists I was threatened to go to a ward thing (I didnâ€™t, but itâ€™s still scary af) 

I cant say anything to anyone because there would be more consequences, Iâ€™m so annoyed of everything and everyone I just want to never wake up again.
