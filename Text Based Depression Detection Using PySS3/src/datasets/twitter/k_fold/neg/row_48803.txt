i feel forcedi feel like im forced to live for other people's happiness. i honestly don't care about other people's happiness when it comes to something like this... i'm struggling i want relief. i dont like being forced to cater to people. i think im done venting to people about being suicidal, it does nothing but prevent me anyway. that's all.
