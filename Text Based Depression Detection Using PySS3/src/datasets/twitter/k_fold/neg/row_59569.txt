SAFE vs. UNSAFE reasons to stay alive!?So I could really go for a few chugs of gasoline. But *at least for now* I think I'm alright.

Question: what are GOOD things to use as "reasons to not die", and what things are NOT good?

Here is a comprehensive list of reasons I will NOT active bass amplifier myself tomorrow:


Mom is possibly making cookies tomorrow.

I wanna see the end of clone wars.

New Metallica album may release within the next 365 days

I'm morbidly curious how this coronavirus thing will turn out


Hope you enjoyed my tier list. Discussion welcome.
