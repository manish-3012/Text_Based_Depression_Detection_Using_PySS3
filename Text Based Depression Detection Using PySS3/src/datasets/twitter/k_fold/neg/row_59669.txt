Have to get this off my chestHi there, this isn't an attention callout, I just need to get this out there because I can't tell anyone else basically and feel pretty desperate about it. Please don't judge based on my age.
I'm 16 and I've never been diagnosed with any mental disorder since my mother never allowed me to visit a psychologist. And I ain't that bih that'll self diagnose but I just need to vent about my plans for the future.
I've been fantasizing about death since I was like 14 i guess, because of certain reasons that I won't go into.
The only reason I keep going is because I've made a plan that as soon as I move into my own flat as an adult, I'm gonna end it without any interruption from my parents or family around me the first or 2nd week there.
I hate myself endlessly and would've ended it sooner, but I don't want my parents to live with the thought that I died in their house and I don't have any good private spot to kill myself at out of our home.
It's pretty sad that people try and do kill themselves because they wish for what I have, I have basically a perfect life, my parents are pretty rich, my family loves me, I have great friends who stand by me, I'm pretty apparently based on other's opinions, have ok grades and fuck-ton-of-time consuming hobby that I'm really successful at, I'm pretty funny and smart and I get everything I want, yet I can't feel fucking happy. So, one could say, everything is fine but I still wanna die. And/or I'm just too pathetic but that's nothing new. I still can't shake off the feeling that I should've accomplished more although I too know that's bs, I'm only 16 ffs. And also I've been struggling with eating since I was 13, so yeah. I enormously hate myself and the way I live.

Sorry I know this was long, I hope you stay safe tonight.
