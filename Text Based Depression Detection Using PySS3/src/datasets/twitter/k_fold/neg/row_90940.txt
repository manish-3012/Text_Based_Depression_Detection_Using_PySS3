Gf is feeling suicidal and I don't know what to doIt's all my fault, I know that fully well, we had some arguments in the last few days that hurt her pretty bad and made her feel suicidal again, after months she'd been fine. I'm in a completely different country right now, with neither the money nor the means to go back to her to help her. The only way we can talk is through messages which she won't read now and calls (she asked me to give her some space and time alone since I've been stressing her in the last days). Today everything seemed fine, but she later started writing about suicide. When I found out she first denied it, then confirmed it was indeed her (the messages were anonymous), tried to push me away so that I wouldn't feel bad if she did kill herself but failed at that. I may have gotten her to calm a bit down but I'm afraid she might still be feeling the same and I can't think of anything I can do (she lives alone hours away from her parents and friends) now that she closed the call, is there anything I can do?
