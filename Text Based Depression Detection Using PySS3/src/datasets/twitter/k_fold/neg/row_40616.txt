I could be a martyr, kindaI'm a little high on Xan right now sorry if I don't make sense. 

I'm a high school senior. My high school is notorious for its fucking creepy and terrible suicide pattern. 6 suicides in 12 years basically. One every other year for that time without fail. Some people call it The Curse. Whatever you call it, it's fucked up. Not a high pressure school but terrible with mental health care. No unit in health class or anything. This year we don't even have a guidance counselor. Every time someone commits suicide, the school barely does anything. They just show an anti-bullying video in class (why is bullying *always* the cop out explanation for teen suicides nowadays?) and that's it. Last time it happened, my sophomore year, some teachers even said we couldn't talk about it. We go to a small school of like 350 total so you kinda know everyone so it's crazy when someone does it. Well this year is "the year" and its morbid as fuck but people keep wondering who it will be. It's been consistently every other year all this time. I could do it. I could be the last maybe too. I leave a big note, saying they need stronger resources and mental health education. Send my note to the local newspaper get it on social media. Talk about all the suicides. Say it's a big part their fault for terrible resources and ed. I'm a really involved student. They wouldn't expect me to die. But leaving that note they'd read it. It would be published so they'd have to acknowledge it. They'd have to get a counselor, set up support groups whatever. They'd have to actually acknowledge my suicide and talk about it bc public would know all too. 

You can say I could do that now but they don't listen. They only listen once you're dead. A big statement to try to save others from suicide too. They don't deserve it but I do
