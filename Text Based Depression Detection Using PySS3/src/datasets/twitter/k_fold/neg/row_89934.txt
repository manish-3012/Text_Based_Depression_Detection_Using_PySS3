Contemplating doing it.I have wanted to end my life for some time. It started when my father killed himself back in 2011. This year has been particularly hard on me. I've never been this comfortable with taking my life. My fear of death has dwindled substantially. I don't see a point to keep struggling in an uphill battle. It's such a painful existence to deal with every day. People can be so cruel and vicious. I want it to end so badly but no matter how hard I try, I can't bring myself to do it.
