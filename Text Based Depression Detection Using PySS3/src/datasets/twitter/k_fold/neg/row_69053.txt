Being nice is dead in this worldI've been recently encountering people who have been total jerks to nice people. It's been giving me intrusive thoughts and making me very upset. I want to hurt them to teach them a lesson but that'll get me in trouble. I see everywhere that rude people be very successful. I feel like being nice in this world is dead. I can't live in a world where people are just jerks. It's been giving me anxiety and very bad intrusive thoughts. I don't know what to do and it's driving me mad.
