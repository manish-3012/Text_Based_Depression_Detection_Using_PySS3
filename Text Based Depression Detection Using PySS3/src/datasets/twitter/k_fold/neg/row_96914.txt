The end is soonIâ€™m so exhausted of trying to have a good life. Itâ€™s not happening. Everyday I constantly think about suicide and how I would do it. Only thing stopping me is the thought that I might not succeed and still be alive. Everyday I wake up depressed asf and angry at the world that Iâ€™m here. Iâ€™ve literally shut every single person out of my life cause people disgust me. All the fake love and caring they show you is a lie. No one gives a fuck really. I also have a lot of self hatred. I hate everything about me like literally everything from who I am on the inside to what I look like on the outside. Iâ€™ve told a couple people how I feel. Told my sister and she just redirects how sheâ€™s depressed to so itâ€™s not that bad. And told this girl at my work how I felt and she just acts like Iâ€™m supposed to be better after talking to her one time like I can just shut it off. Iâ€™ve been like this for a couple years and year after year it gets worse like a snowball effect. Itâ€™s to the point where I wake up depressed/suicidal and mad everyday and itâ€™s beating the fuck outta me. Iâ€™m either gonna blow my head off or do a suicide bag. I hope death finds me soon Iâ€™m done.
