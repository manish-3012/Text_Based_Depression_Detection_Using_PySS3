This is my third post to this subreddit.  It sucks.  I'm sick of being depressed... so I did something crazy (for me)I put [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9CbdSVyrC4) on my youtube channel.  It's embarrassing and I hate it and I hate me for doing it because I'll probably get more trolls telling me to just kill myself than anything.... but I really need help.  I can't afford a therapist, I don't want to be on medication.. I want to beat this.  I was happy once, I can be happy again.  Please help me.  Watch it.  Tell me what I'm doing wrong... why people don't like me.  Is it the way I look?  The way I talk?  My facial expressions?  Don't tell me I'm great or fine because I'm not.. if I was, I would have friends.  I just need people to want me around.

**EDIT** I did a [follow-up video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-Q1vQynROU&amp;feature=channel_video_title) this morning when I got up.  Thank you all for the kind words.  I suppose it's easier for me to talk to a camera than it is to people who are just waiting for you to shut the hell up so the video really doesn't express my awkwardness... I guess I just feel selfish talking about myself and I don't know what else to talk about so I don't talk at all.
