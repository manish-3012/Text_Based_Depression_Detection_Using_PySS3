HowI donâ€™t understand the purpose of life and why I should have to struggle to get nothing in return. The happiness and fulfillment I got from doing simple things I enjoyed like being with my family, playing video games, and skateboarding offer zero solace, or any sort of positive emotion. Every day is a struggle to get out of bed as I have little energy, and no motivation to do anything besides sleep. I fucking hate having to go to work just to make money that I wouldnâ€™t even be able to support myself with if I wasnâ€™t living with my mom. I joined the army after I graduated Highschool and I was honestly excited about it. As soon as I got to reception I started to regret it. Intense homesickness and inability to emotionally connect with anyone around me. I felt like an alien, emotionally isolated from everyone around me. I thought being in the army would help me, and I donâ€™t know if that was true or not because I quit 4 weeks into basic training. I got home and I felt like a total fucking embarrassment to myself, and my family. A pussy. Now Iâ€™m 19 about to be 20 and I have absolutely no idea what to do with myself. I canâ€™t get a girlfriend, nor have I ever had one. I canâ€™t hold a job because Iâ€™m so depressed and unmotivated. I donâ€™t know where to go, or what to do, or who to talk to. Iâ€™m ashamed to even type this. Please help
