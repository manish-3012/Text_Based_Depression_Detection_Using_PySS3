Why should I even bother anymoreHi, just got suspended a few hours from school and my just parents told me that they wonâ€™t care if I killed myself after I told them multiple times over the past few weeks that I was having suicidal thoughts and that Iâ€™m just saying it for attention. Iâ€™ve almost killed myself 6 times in the past year and it seems like everytime Iâ€™m about to do it. But then start thinking about the effect that it would cause my parents and how even in my death I would be a burden to them. However after what they have said today im not sure if I should even bother to continue, Iâ€™ve got a massive list of punishments and Iâ€™m not allowed to see my friends for the next 2 months or celebrate my birthday next week, so if itâ€™s not going to improve would it really just be easier to end it now.
