I am so lost, and evidentially a coward.   It's been rough, these last few years for me. No matter how hard I try to be happy, I end up feeling worse than before. I should really be doing schoolwork, I have so much to do. So much. It's my last year of high school. I helped my best friend as well as my boyfriend make it through their suicide attempts, years apart. I am such an idiot, talking to my recovering boyfriend about why he should live while I'm wanting to die myself. I got them both through though. Who can help me though? I don't think I really deserve to be saved, if I can't even muster up the courage to slit my wrists down the river. 







   My parents are getting a divorce, I'm expected to pay rent once my mom and I move out. I'm balancing 4 core subjects in school, I have no idea how I can manage to work 20 hours a week on top of that. No university for me anymore. Depression runs in my family, you know. I'm sure they'd understand, except I have no right to feel this way. My dad just lost his father and got diagnosed with type A diabetes. He's probably depressed, he isn't getting treatment. Why should I? I shouldn't be whining. Really. I used to love school, I still do, I guess. I just can't bring myself to do anything. Anything at all anymore. I might as well be dead, I can't even cry anymore, maybe killing myself would hurt so bad I could finally cry? Might feel a little more human. 






TL;DR guess I just needed to vent.
