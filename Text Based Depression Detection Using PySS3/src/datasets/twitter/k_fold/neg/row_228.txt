can't see myself living in the next few monthsI don't want to take my own life as it'll cause extreme misery to my family, parents in particular, but I also cannot imagine living through the next few months, much less years... I hate thinking this way but sometimes I just wished I could be knocked down by a car or contract a life-threatening illness, basically cease to exist. I feel as if I'm a failed person/adult, who never really grew up or matured as everyone else did. I'm way behind my peers in terms of career, socializing and life in general. I lack confidence in everything I do, even in simple basic things. I don't understand how this life works and I feel like I never will. And I know that it won't make a difference to the world if I wasn't here anyway, their lives would probably be better off without the burden and trouble that is me.
