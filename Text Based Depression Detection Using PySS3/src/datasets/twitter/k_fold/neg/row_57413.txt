feeling donehi. I've been wanting to die for awhile now, but lately I feel that it's the only path that makes sense. just moved into an apartment with the only people i would call "friends", but seems they value the friendship of my ex, who has claimed to want to be friends but leaves me out of everything, more. I just feel so alone.

I've been having a really hard time lately, and it just hurts so badly to feel "left out." I feel like I'm back in high school, but it's worse because I am not self aware and realizing this this may be a cycle that I will repeat forever until I work up the courage to die.

i know this post is very dumb but I just feel so incredibly alone. i don't know what to do. I don't have the motivation to do anything at all, and I'm a atuoid useless sack of shit. I don't know what I'll get out of this other than pity. I don't know. 

I just have absolutely no one to talk to. I'm so lonely, and so unhappy. the only friends I thought I had seem pretty done with me, too, and I can't blame them. but im still sad. just helps to put my pathetic feelings out there 

hopefully It'lll be done soon. don't want to care about hurting anyone anymore. just want to be done
