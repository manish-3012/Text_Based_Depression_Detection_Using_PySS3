I'm DoneI was diagnosed with gastric cancer when I was 15, after i graduated my highschool sweetheart proposed to me. At this time i was 18. We were engaged for 8 months until he called it off and stopped talking to me without any warning. Then my parents divorced and i was stuck living with my dad who took out his anger over my mom leaving him on me. I was physically and mentally abused for two years. He stopped paying for my college which forced me to get a job to pay my own way. Once I got a shitty paying job he took advantage and made me pay rent, my phone bill and groceries.
 
Then i was raped in the parking lot when I was leaving one of my classes.

Then i moved to Tennessee to get away from all of the stress...
 I'm 23 now, I still have cancer, my "best friend" hates me. I have no job and no money.. 

I'm done being sad.. I'm gonna see how long it takes my roommates to find me dead in my room..
