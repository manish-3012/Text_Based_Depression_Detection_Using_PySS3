The only two things keeping me alive are my cat and somebody ive never metIve had my cat all my life. I got her when she was 4 and i cant imagine nor remember life without her. She is now 14 and my greatest fear is losing her. She is the best friend I've ever had.

The other is a Danish guy i met online through a game. I wont mention names because he uses reddit. When we first talked, he was suicidal, and i did my best to help him out. We still talk every day nearly two years later. He's the best person I've met online and easily one of my best friends ever. We click and share so many interests. 

These are the only two people keeping me alive.

Life is terrible. The world is so cruel and monotonous. We lose so much and gain so little. If i lose either of these people, i can't continue. Both of them mean the world to me.
