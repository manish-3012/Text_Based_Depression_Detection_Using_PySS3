I don't have any hope leftI don't think things will get better and I feel like I'm being hit from all aspects of life. Each day feels so utterly pointless and also miserable. I really hate going to bed, I hate knowing that I'll wake up and have to go through it all again. 

I have no idea why I'm still here, I have no hope for the future. Everything about my immediate future and distant future feels me with, at best, indifference and at worst dread, stress or frustration.

WHY AM I STILL HERE?!
