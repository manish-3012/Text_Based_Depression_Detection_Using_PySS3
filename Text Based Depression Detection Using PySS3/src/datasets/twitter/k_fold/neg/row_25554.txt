I'm so scared I might kill myself somedayI don't understand why I feel this way. It's so difficult. I'm scared these feelings are going to be unbearable forever and I'll just do it. I've spent all day having severe suicidal thoughts and feeling awful like I want to hurt myself.

I wish I could just afford treatment. I have this feeling that I'm going to be hospitalized again someday, if I don't kill myself. But I just feel so unwell and unsure if the good days are worth the bad in the end.
