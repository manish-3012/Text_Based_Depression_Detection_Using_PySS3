16 yrs old- suicide is a very real option right nowI am 16 years old as the titles suggests and hate my life. I have been depressed on and off for the past three or so years, sometimes severely. I suffer from quite severe social anxiety too, and never ever go out of my house to meet up with the few friends I do have, and I do mean actually never. The last time I went to a location other than my home and school was over a year ago, can you see how my life is shit with literally 2 locations in it. Home, school, home, school. I have thought abstractly about suicide for a couple years more recently I have been contemplating it seriously, and devoting an unhealthy amount of time to thinking about it every day. I am in trouble at school for minor stupid shit and am having my balls busted over it. I am so sad and don't see any way out of this shitty life not can I see any semblance of an enjoyable future. Ahh, assessment week is next week, what fucking fun. I have a fairly reliable method, I have the means, and I plan to do it in school like maybe in the bathrooms or some corner corridor during a free period. I don't expect anyone would have read this or would be willing to offer any advice.
