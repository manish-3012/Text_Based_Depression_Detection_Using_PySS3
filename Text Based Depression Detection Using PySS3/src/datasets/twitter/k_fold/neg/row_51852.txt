I have no oneNo one wants me. My own family doesnâ€™t even want me. Maybe I could stand how worthless they tell me I am if I had even one single person in my life. How is it I canâ€™t keep a friend for more than 1 year? The friend Iâ€™ve had the longest has been 3 years that I maybe see once a year or so now. Am I really that insufferable? Am I that horrible to be around? How am I completely intolerable to anyone and everyone? 

I finally have my long-coveted apartment with my kitten. But itâ€™s not enough. 

People say they love me, they want me to trust them, they want me to open up and trust them and depend on them and then theyâ€™re gone. 

I canâ€™t take my life alone. I canâ€™t handle being left by another person. I canâ€™t handle another disappearance. 

Thatâ€™s all I guess.
