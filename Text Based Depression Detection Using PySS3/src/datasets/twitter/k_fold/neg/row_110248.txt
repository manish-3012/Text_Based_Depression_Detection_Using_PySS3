No one will give a shit if I leaveIts true. How can anyone convince me otherwise when I never see my biological father, my mom is a heroin/pill addict who destroyed my younger and got him on heroin after he developed schizophrenia?

Wtf kind of life is this shit? It was nevet ok and right now I'm just suffering completely isolated in the aftermath of everything.

Being in homeless shelters, watching so many animals abused, my brother abused, I was just completely ignored my entire life. I thought being in a relationship would make me feel better but guess I'm unlucky having guys who use me to jack off inside.

When does it get better??? Ita been 3 years since a real suicide attempt and life just looks bleak. I don't even know how I managed to get out of the noose when I was already starved for 3 days, no sleep and dizzy af. All my friends are gone, they are living happy with their families and new set of friends. No one wants to know me because I remind them that the world is actually disgusting, evil and unfair...well not for all of us...hence being unfair.

Why am I being forced to continus living like this? I'm too damaged, my outlook will never change I already got berrated way to much. Brainwashed, beaten, hated, ignored, abandoned and betrayed endlessly.

Things have to change at least mentally or else I'm going on a self destruction tour.
