Tried to end it Sunday nightAt first I just wanted to see if I could make myself pass out by hanging myself on a doorknob with a soft belt, by holding the end of it in one hand, for practice. I wanted to know what dying felt like. 
Then, I just decided I was going to do it all the way, so I tied the end on the doorknob. I made it very tight around my neck, and I was sitting there sort of hanging and starting to die for 20 seconds when I finally pussied out and got up. 
I couldn't stop thinking about my friends hearing what happened or my mom finding me. But the thoughts are coming back, and I made a document that has all of my account info. I think when I really do it then I'll quit from my job, and I'll be graduated from high school. Honestly I don't know what to think. I don't want to live anymore, I'm just waiting for the right time. School is a fucking drag and I feel like shit in every class, and my life at home is very stressful. I don't see the point in living through this if I'm not enjoying it. 

I just felt like I had to say this somewhere. I can't tell anyone. But I think I'm going to try again soon.
