I need to talkI don't know where to start, so fuck it, I'll start a while back. Without any specifics, my current life position as of July of this year had left me feeling completely apathetic towards life. A little angry (at my father and my almost-stepfather, specifically) but other than that, I was just going through the motions. A series of events culminated in me sitting on my couch with a loaded gun in my mouth, safety off. The only reason I'm still here is because I don't want to hurt others by killing myself, and am slightly afraid of Hell, but I just don't care about living/consciousness/whatever. I have no inherent value of my own life. I don't feel like this is a healthy way to live, give me some advice guys.
