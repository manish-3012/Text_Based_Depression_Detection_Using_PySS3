I'm ruining my life.This procrastination is going to end my life soon. I only have 1.5 month left to do the work of 2 years. I really can't see the rest of my life living under my mum house, and it will be the case if i can't have a good grad by the end of this year so I can have a scholarship to leave my abusive mum where I can't even have a shower longuer than 15 min...   
God my heart really beat fast and I don't know what to do by now.  
Why can't I be more intelligent, why did I procrastinat3 so much ??  
So mqny quzstion that will lead to my end if I can't get that scholarship. And I'm not feom the US if that matter.  
Fucking brain, don't you ever think about letting me down...  
Edit : I'm taking for the first time a shower with my headphones on,oh god why didn't I think of it before. My brain stoped spinning and i already feel better...  
EDIT2:  No way I'm going to end my life without trying. I'll study hard and devote all my strenght to studies. No way I'm letting my Nmum laugh hes ass off if I fail ( wich means no scholarship = still living with her ). I'm going to devote every single cellule in my brain for math and physique. IM NOT GOING FAIL.  
EDIT3: Cruel world is my savior.  
EDIT4: damn I just found I had recorded one time where my mum was **HARASSING ME** while I was playing league. God what is this power , REVANGE ALL THE WAY, I WONT FUCKING FAIL  
EDIT5: God this mother is insane , she didn't even let me organise my books in the other room. TIL that I will this place forever. Plv01, pls die to get that scholarship.
