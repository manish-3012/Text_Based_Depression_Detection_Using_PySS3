I don't want to move back home again.Hello.  


I may have to move back home to my narcissist mother, and for the past 5 years she has made my life a misery. I met someone, she's nice, caring and everything i could want in a woman, but my mother decides to make her feel like shit and almost make me feel bad for wanting to be with her. As such, this is affecting my mental health negatively.  


I have constant anxiety when I talk to her now but she doesn't care, she thinks anxiety isn't a real thing and i've been depressed so long because it feels she has massive control over me. All of my savings are in her house and while I am away, i'm worried about the consequences of ending my relationship with her.  


I nearly went for a job yesterday but she said she didn't think i'd be up to it because people would be nasty to me (it's a call centre job) and therefore i would mentally not be able to take it, and again she keeps saying ishould come home and stop wasting my time living somewhere else.  


Overall, along with a few other reasons i am feeling very very depressed, and i'm not sure what the light at the end of the tunnel is. I don't want to do anything drastic but I feel i could very easily be pushed into it if this continues. I feel so cornered and trapped and feel apart from my SO, i have no one to speak to because they will probably all take my mother's side.
