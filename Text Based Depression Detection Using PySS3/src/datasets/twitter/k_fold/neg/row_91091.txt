How can the topic of suicide be discussed if the media keeps putting a silence to it?1. I completely understand the studies of how suicide being spoken or shown on-screen can lead to more suicides.

2. But how does one discuss it, especially the media, so they can help others who are feeling suicidal? It seems like it's become a taboo subject. Isn't there a way the media can navigate around this?

3. A student jumped from the balcony today from my previous University. Subsequently passed away, but it was never mentioned, only implied that there was no threat to others and that the authorities were contacting the victim's family. It didn't even end up on the news that this happened.
