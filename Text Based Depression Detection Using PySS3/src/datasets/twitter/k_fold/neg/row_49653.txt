Struggling Against the UrgeI have struggled with depression for more than 15 years. I have often thought about suicide during that time, I have studied and searched out the best ways to do it and developed numerous plans. I usually just push the thoughts away and distract myself somehow, just find something to occupy my mind until the thoughts go away. Lately it has escalated and I find myself having to actively fight the urge to kill myself. I have a handgun next to my bed and I *really* want to shoot myself in the head and be done with it. My last objection to suicide is that I know it would hurt my wife but that barrier is deteriorating. We are growing further apart as I descend deeper into my depression. The worst part is that I am a counselor doing family therapy. I should know better and I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing while struggling so much with depression and suicidal thoughts. I just really want to die so I can stop everything, I am just so done.  
It is getting harder to keep myself from killing myself. I don't know if I should do something to fight back or to finally push myself over the edge. I am just so tired of fighting, I don't think I can do it anymore.
