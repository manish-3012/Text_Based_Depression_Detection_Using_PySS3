When your friend isn't very understandingMy friend said autism is an excuse not to work. He probably thinks the same way with depression and anxiety. Also thinks people should just get over it and thinks people with social anxiety just need to man up. The reason I don't work yet is because I've been having a hard time in life and I'm suicidal. It's not because of laziness that I don't work yet. It's because of all the emotions that I'm dealing with and I don't want to live so why even bother. That doesn't mean I'm not gonna try in the near future though. It's just what's the point when I'm not even happy? It's not gonna make me feel better. But I just wanted to say something because I feel like they just don't understand me.
