Probably goodbyeHi there
I wish I didn't have to make a separate post for this but idk what to do.
My parents are kicking me out on a few days.
I have no job,my family is mostly jank,I have no where to go, and horrible social anxiety (autism and whatnot,never posted about that online before but whatever).

Once it happens I'm probably just going to pack up some stuff,bring pills leave and die.

If that happens then goodbye.
