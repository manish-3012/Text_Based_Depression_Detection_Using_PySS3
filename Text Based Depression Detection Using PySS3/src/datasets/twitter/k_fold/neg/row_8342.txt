How do I reach outMy friend posted an article on my fb about suicide and told me to never say goodbye. She happened to do that on a day where my bipolar symptoms were acting up and it made me feel even more suicidal. I have another friend who I know also has mental illness problems and he is always there for me I know but idk how to tell him that I want to die. I mean he knows that I'm generally suicidal but I just want to talk to someone who loves me and I can't start the conversation cause idk what's going on in their lives and I don't want to burden them with my problems. I just want someone to love me the same way I love them. No one seems to remember that I exist. I just want a friend who really understands and a friend who will always respond. You guys always say to reach out and talk to someone so how do i do it. Cause I am one more step away from taking all my pills.
