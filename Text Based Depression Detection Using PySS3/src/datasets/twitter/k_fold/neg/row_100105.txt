Lonely and wanting it to endIâ€™m so sick and tired of feeling so lonely all the time. I feel disconnected and isolated from everyone I know. I get that people care about me  and me dying would hurt them but I canâ€™t stand the way I feel. Iâ€™m scared to end it at the same time but Iâ€™m tired of making my family so upset and on edge with me all the time. Iâ€™m sick of being a burden. Iâ€™m sick of being so lonely and depressed. Iâ€™m only 20 and I can barely handle life anymore. This pandemic has made my life unbearably miserable and lonely. Thatâ€™s my story. Thanks for reading.
