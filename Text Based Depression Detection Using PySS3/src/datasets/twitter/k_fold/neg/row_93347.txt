Is this a good idea ?I wanted to write a message to a friend explaining her why i have such a strange behavior. To make it short, i'm totally anti social, but i wasn't always like that. When i was a kid, i had plenty of friends, recording to my parents and my teachers, i was one of the kids in my school who attracted people the most, one of the most social kids. Now i'm an anti social wreck. After hanging out with macho dicks in middle school, i just stopped trying. I started to avoid relationships and people in general. I've been feeling really terrible lately and less than a month ago i posted a message here telling i was going to end it all. I didn't, i just threw up the pills, and got high and drunk. I met this friend last year when we were both 15 in high school. By the end of the year, we had talked about a lot things, but only a few times. We don't hang out anymore, but that's entirely because of me. Sometimes we talk a lot, mostly on the internet, but when i see her in school, i just smile and walk away. I know she must think i'm really fucking weird, so i just wanted to write her a message to apologize about my strange behavior and why i am like this. I don't know if she would care, cause maybe i'm just fucking paranoid and she doesn't give a shit.

So, should i do it, any advice ? Cause i want to be brutally honest, but i'm afraid.
