I told my parents about my depressionI told my parents that I believe I have depression. It didn't go well. My dad told me that I have to make a choice between the world and God, and that although he'd allow me to seek professional help, it wasn't going to work and that they'll just drug me up and that a therapist won't do much except sit around and listen to my problems. He told me the only solution is to do the best I can to ignore my feelings and follow Christ. That he knows for a fact God is real and if if it has to get worse for me to realize that so be it. He asked if I at least loved myself, I lied and told him a little and he said good or it would have been really serious. It hurt, the only thing keeping me going was my parents, me telling them was a last resort. He also said it was my fault that I feel this way and it was his fault for letting me do what I wanted to. My mom said "you're not gay, are you"? She also asked if I had suicidal thoughts and I lied and told her no. I thought I could rely on them in my time of need, and they've failed me. I dont know why I should keep going. I have nothing. I am so close to giving up.
