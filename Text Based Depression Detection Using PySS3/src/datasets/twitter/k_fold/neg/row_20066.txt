once attempted does visualization ever endAs a kid I made a couple decent attempts, foiled by too skilled driver and survival instinct; gave up trying after that, but the visualization of attempting and willingness to contemplate at any hard juncture just won't fade.   Even now, in a good place mentally, addressed most issues, relatively happy, I was just laying back, tracing the outlines of the ribs under my breast and locating the heart, wondering xxxxxx rules bah xxxxxxxxxxx or whether I should get up and check an anatomy guide first.   Then I come back, and I'm like @@@!@#$!@#!@#!.     

Anyway, am I stuck with this BS?   Is it typical?   I guess I've lived with it for 40 yrs, I can probably manage another 20 or so; but its really annoying!
