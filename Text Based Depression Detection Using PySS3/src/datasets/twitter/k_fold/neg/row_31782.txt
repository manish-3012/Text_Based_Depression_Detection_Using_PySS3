I feel unmotivated to continue living.I don't see a purpose for me in this world. I'm a 19 year old guy without no drive or direction. Let me list the reasons why I feel worthless:

- I have no skills that would land me a good job. I'm into history; general business; statistics; politics; and algebra. Those are the subjects I have always been good at in school and all of those skills either are useless. You need to be in a STEM field to make a good living nowadays and the best I am is STEM-lite. 
- All my friends have no real interest in me. My old HS friends are still loyal to me, but they are meeting other people and moving on, probably having more fun with them than they are with me. Everyone I try to meet never wants to do anything and still living at home is driving me insane. This is what is truly driving me insane. NO ONE FUCKING CARES ABOUT ME!!!!!
- Where I live, nothing goes on and I fucking suck at meeting people. Please, if you live in Maine, I'm begging you to at least talk with me! I'm so sorry for sounding desperate but I can't help it at this point. I feel like I'm about to crack any minute now due to all this fucking loneliness and self-worthlessness I feel constantly. 
- Every person my age is already building their future and growing as a person. They have moved out of the house or are in dorms having the time of their lives going to sporting events, hanging out with great people, doing things that they never thought possible. Yet here I am typing this fucking message on Easter Sunday all alone. FUCK MY LIFE THERE IS NO FUCKING PURPOSE FOR ME!!!!!
