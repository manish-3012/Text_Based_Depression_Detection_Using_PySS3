Ready to give upMy life had been consumed by depression for at least the last 3 years. It started off because I got medical discharged from the Marine Corps due to an injury. A few months later, my girlfriend of 3 years left me. That was the breaking point. I have never been the same since those two events. Things I use to love and do donâ€™t even interest me anymore. I have no interest in anything anymore. I enlisted into the Army and got in with a medical waiver thinking this would put me on a new path but it didnâ€™t change a thing. I also decided I wanted to take a few college classes to work on the degree Ive always wanted. Just found out today that I wasnâ€™t even accepted. My life is a failure. I have no friends, no one to talk to. Everyone just ignores me. Itâ€™s like I donâ€™t even exist. I feel dead on the inside. Iâ€™m tired of this life
