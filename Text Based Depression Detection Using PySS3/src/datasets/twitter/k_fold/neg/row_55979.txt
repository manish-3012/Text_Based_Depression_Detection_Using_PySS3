Almost 2 years of this.Almost 2 years, 2 years old being ignored, 2 years of being on the edge. What am I going to do.. Iâ€™m going to die alone anyways. Iâ€™m never going to achieve my dreams because Iâ€™m a just a nobody loser. A gun, a gun, god I would really like a gun right now. Something to end the pain, something to release the suffering. I could be in a better place. I could rest peacefully.
