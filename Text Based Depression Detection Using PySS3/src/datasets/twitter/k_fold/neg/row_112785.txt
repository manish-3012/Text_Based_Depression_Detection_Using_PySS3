I can't deal with being at home.Back at school I have been getting free counseling but when I come home I just get overcome with a sense of depression. My parents don't listen to me, and my sister is so manipulative and self centered. When I tried to talk about how messed up everything is, I don't get an apology or understanding. My mom just scoffs it off as "something I can talk about at therapy." I just finished up a rough semester, and I was diagnosed with PTSD. I don't know who to trust. I don't want to be a burden, or something to pity, or worst of all I don't want my anger to hurt people I care about. Christmas is just reminding me that I'm broken. I shouldn't be here and I don't know how I can cope with 2017.
