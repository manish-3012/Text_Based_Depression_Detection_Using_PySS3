I miss my gf that cheated on me and just feel suicidal all the timeItâ€™s been months and I still canâ€™t accept reality. Iâ€™ve resorted to drugs and drinking to deal with my pain and in an attempt to forget about it, but I still think about her every night and cry a lot for hours. 

Iâ€™ve seen many attractive girls but never loved someone like a loved her, I would have done anything in the world for her I loved her that much. I dreamed every night spending the rest of my life with her.. but she cheated on me with one of my best friends. I fell into a deep depression after that and started failing school, then this COVID happened and Iâ€™ve been numb ever since. I really donâ€™t wanna spend more time in this earth I know there is nobody out there for me.. she was like my soulmate the only girl I felt a real connection with I still canâ€™t believe she fucking cheated on me i would have rather never met her because of the pain she made me endure. 

I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna stay around longer I really canâ€™t take life anymore Iâ€™m just getting weaker and slowly draining 

Some songs that I enjoy and remind me of the good memories I had with her
