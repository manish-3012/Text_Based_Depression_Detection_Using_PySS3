this is hypocritical and contradicting of meonly bcus I would tell everyone else who was suicidal and wanted to die bcus of school that school is just short term and itâ€™s not worth it, and Iâ€™m right its not worth it to kill yourself over school.

now here I am always wanting to die because of school. Itâ€™s the only reason Iâ€™m anxious stressed all the time and it makes me physically sick to think or even go to school (thatâ€™s not a joke) I hate this I hate getting yelled at for not going to school when if I go I always feel like Iâ€™m going to faint throw up (one of those has happened many times). It hurts I donâ€™t want my mom to be sad
