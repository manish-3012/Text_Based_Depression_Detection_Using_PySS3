I've tried reaching out for help so many times, tried reaching out to be heard, listened to, I'm always ignored ignore this post like all others I don't fucking care everyone's a piece of shitBit agitated maybe. I try and try and try to reach out, I try to get therapy, I've tried for years to get a good therapist 8 yrs now, I've tried to make friends, I've tried to reach out here online, I've tried to reach out to my family nothing no one could care a single bit about my fate, about who I am, whatever. I am trapped. There's no one for me to reach out to. No one for me to talk to. Absolutely none there hasn't been for years but who fucking cares. Just want to die already a quick painless death, death sounds so much better than being alive, I could so easily kill myself if I had the means to right now at this moment. I wouldn't hesitate. Fuck everyone, I'm surrounded by assholes, such low lives.
