Thank you Google5 days ago I was going to commit suicide. 


I was fed up with everything, done, gone. I didn't want it to hurt, I didn't want to die slowly, I had no clue what to do. Obviously I turn to my web search.

I Googled suicide.

Keep it simple.

Not a single result was anywhere near how to do it, it was all designed to be an asshole about it. Fine, so I try again.

How to commit suicide. 

Just like last time, at the very top, you have the hotline number. After that you have an anti suicide ad, after that you have some promising links. *click* you read through, looking for something you can do. Nope, it's all about how killing yourself ruins everybody's lives.

Damn.

I wipe the tears. 

How funny, Google's trying to SAVE me. 

Fuck it, I'll try something else. 
I type in Bing.com, wipe away another tear, enter.

The very 1st result, best methods, success! I click on it, read through, and pick a method. 

I prepare everything PERFECTLY. There is no way to mistake this for anything but.




I couldn't do it.

I kept thinking of how much pain everyone will go through, how much my death would change people's lives.

I mattered.

I burst into tears, I went back to Google, typed in suicide, and called the number.

Thanks to Google, I am alive.

Thank you.
