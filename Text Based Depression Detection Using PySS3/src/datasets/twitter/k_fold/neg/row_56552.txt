I have been suicidal since 02MAY17Tonight I am 2 ambiens in and still can't sleep. Something happened today that is keeping me up. If anyone is willing to talk that would be great. I'm not looking for pity just someone to talk to. I understand and saw the resources but last time I called I was thrown into a hospital for two weeks. I am in the military so if anyone is willing to talk it would be great.
