I don't know how to helpI was just informed that my friend was sent to a mental hospital and has been put under a 72 hour suicide watch. I've thought about this for an hour or so and I have no idea how to respond. I texted her because I felt that something was off and her sister responded with the information. I've been looking for information on how to help but I can't really find anything that fits my situation. I don't know if I should text one of our close mutual friends because I'm unsure if anybody else is aware, I'm not sure If I should tell anybody at all because I've seen a few people saying that it'll betray their trust. I don't know. Please, someone give me some sort of guidance.
