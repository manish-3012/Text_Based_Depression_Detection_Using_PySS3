I feel like im just prolonging the inevitable.It just hit me how ive been depressed at least half of my life by now. im at a point where ive toon ill to work or study for years, no matter how much i want to.  It feels like im stuck in a sandpit, trying to get up but i cant. im full of bitterness and sadness and im so tired. angry at my parents for my childhood, angry at myself for not being able to let go. angry at people who dont deserve my anger, pushing them away and then hating myself for it. 

ive been doing "okay", almost "good". getting out of bed, doing things. trying to stay positive. trying to not to hate myself too much. but st the same time I have this anxiety and fear in the back of my head. like at one point im just gonna detonate. i feel like im trying to just keep myself busy so i wont have time to crash again.

what is really the.point? it all comes back to this. at least if i was dead i couldnt feel like this. the happiness never stays. some part of.my head is telling me to just kill myself before it gets even worse again. it always.comes back to this. i feel like im just a failure of a human being. i want it all to stop.
