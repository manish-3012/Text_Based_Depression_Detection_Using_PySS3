Mum has admitted she tried to kill herself last week, don't know what to doSo I'm in my first year at university that's about 2 hours away from home. My mum lives on her own and I have a sister who is 30 living near her but they don't see each other often.
Last summer me and my mum both had severe depression. Then she got medication and got better around Christmas time. I was going through a tough break up so I got worse and she helped me a lot during my month off from uni. Then I got help and now I'm feeling a lot better. Also living away from home has been amazing for me as my mum can be emotionally abusive.
I've come home this weekend to my mum being incredibly rude and cold towards me. She admitted she tried to kill herself last week because I wouldn't care if she died and no one would and it would be the best thing ever.
The only reason why I think she thinks this is because I'm having a good time at university, I've felt happiest than I have pretty much in forever (most likely also due to very strong antidepressants). I talk to her pretty much daily but it is a struggle being at uni, having a 20 hour week job, doing volunteering and being sociable, but we do talk a lot regular than most of my friends and their parents do. I literally view her as my best friend. The reason why I don't go home constantly is because there is nothing in my home city at all. I only go home to see her and all we do is watch tv together.
My mum is seriously struggling with money too. She's been too depressed to work and I'm currently lending her 1.5k and I just know she is going to ask for more.
What do I do? I've told my sister but she has a lot on and hasn't been able to reply to me yet. Who else can I talk to to help her? She literally has nobody else.

tl;dr mum tried to commit suicide and is saying I wouldn't care if she died, when I feel the complete opposite. What do I do? 

Sorry for bad format or anything, on my phone.
