I'm trappedI'm a disgusting slob and my husband is "type A" ex-military. We fight over me being lazy and not cleaning anything, not cooking good food, sleeping all the time and never taking care of myself or him or having good self-discipline. I want to change but I have tried so many times and I never make progress. I want to be better but it's been 10 years since we first started dating and I still can't meet his expectations. I have all these dreams and aspirations but I will never reach them if I don't get out of this mindset. Almost every night I just think about going to sleep and never waking back up. I would miss my dog and my mom would be totally destroyed but they would move on. My husband would be able to find someone that actually deserves him and I wouldn't be around to see it happen. I'm working on my career right now but it feels like I can't make progress fast enough and at the same time I feel overwhelmed with more responsibility. I just want to be done. I'm not strong enough or driven enough to do anything with myself. I couldn't bare not being with my husband because I love him so much and I'd ABSOLUTELY kill myself if I moved back in with my mom (who is living with my grandma, brother, sister-in-law, niece and nephew). He deserves better but I can't be that for him.
