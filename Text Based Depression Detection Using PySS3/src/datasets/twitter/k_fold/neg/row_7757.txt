ive picked a method, and a placeNow i just need to decide the date. I was considering making it look peaceful, trying out the ol' running car in a garage, but I've changed my mind. Now I just want results. I'm planning on taking either the Amtrak or Greyhound up to New Hampshire, and taking my life there. The nature looks so pretty and I want to see it for myself. Idk how it works, but I'll probably go off the trails, deep into the woods, and hang myself.  I'll aim for making it painless, but honestly at this point I'm just ready to go.
