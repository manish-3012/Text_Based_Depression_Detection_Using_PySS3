cowardthere isnt any hope for me. there really isnt. and i know it. im still too much of a coward to actually kill myself, all those times i said i would and i never have, obviously. i really just want to die. i cant bring myself to do it though. i dont want my family to care. they probably wont, anyway. but i dont want to die, and have them all be sad. i dont want to run away and die, and have them scared and hopeing i come back. ( same with my online friends, my irl friends dont give a shit. ) i wish i could just stop existing, and nobody would remember me. im seriously considering doing it. do i care about the consequences anymore? no. it might be selfish, but im done. im just done. there is no point in living anymore. i dont really care about anyones feelings. i just want to be gone and done.
