I feel like I have no future to live forWhile I know there's a lot of people who have lives much worse than mine,  I've been so depressed for most of my life for so many things I feel like I have nothing to live for as my 30th birthday is next month and while I'm not planning on hurting myself, there's days like today where I wish I fall asleep and never wake up. I really don't know of a quick way to explain why I feel the way I do without having to explain my life story.  Is the right forum to explain everything or should I try the depression forum?
