Can't live, don't want to dieI hope this doesn't come off poorly or bother anyone but I need help.

I don't want to make this too long but for short backstory I'm 21F, and I feel like no one cares if I live or die. I've got severe abandonment issues due to my mother dying when I was young, my father being distant my entire life, many of my friends leaving me with no warning, and my most recent ex cheating on me during my longest relationship. 

I don't want to try to drum up pity or anything, but it seems more and more lately like no one around me really wants me around. I'm an intense people pleaser, to the point where sometimes it feels like I live my life for other people. The problem is I want to live, and I want to want to live. But no one wants me here. How can I want to live when it feels like I have no love in my life?
