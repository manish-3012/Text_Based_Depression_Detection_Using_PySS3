Cruelty + EmptinessHere goes it. 
27 F. 


Iâ€™ve had issues with suicidal ideation for some time now. My life has become nothing but emotional abuse, unimaginable debt (over $550,000 JUST in student loans), career failure and abandonment.  My uncaring but controlling and horrible manipulative partner of quite some time has stripped me of nothing but raw, tender, unexposed resignation. To experience and express pure despair + loneliness + hurt, only to be met with cruel contempt and blame from those who said they loved you the most stings worse than a thousand knives hitting your body at once. Iâ€™ve been hurt so many times over and over and over. Iâ€™ve tried talking to family, my therapist, a couples counselor, old (quasi-) friends who I knew once upon a time but who are busy with their own lives now and cannot spare the time to hear me moan again. I hang out with my 3 cats but despite their best efforts there is only so much they can do beyond exhibiting their incomparable cuteness. Yes, Iâ€™ve been in regular therapy for years with so many different therapists and modalities including those who seemed to â€˜get itâ€™ and those who only crossed paths with me briefly. Iâ€™ve been on meds for the various diagnoses. Iâ€™ve tried advocating for myself and seeking support and help from any and all resources.  Iâ€™ve called the hotlines. Iâ€™ve texted chat lines. Iâ€™ve been to inpatient rehab. Ive done 12 steps. Iâ€™ve stayed at an inpatient dual diagnosis (psych/substance issues) facility for a short time. Iâ€™ve done online counseling, group therapy, workshops, retreats... 

From sobriety to academic achievement to maintaining my health... Iâ€™ve managed to completely undo whatever I may have attained at some distant point in the past. 

Put simply.... one cannot experience this type of pain for this long and just grin and bear it. Everyone has a breaking point. 

What happens when youâ€™ve â€œreached outâ€ and â€œasked for helpâ€ and taken EVERY step you are supposed to, yet here you are sitting in what amounts to the feeling one must feel as they scramble for air just before reaching the surface of the water with the sudden realization they arenâ€™t going to make it so their life/legacy/potential future... itâ€™s all over? 



Hey, just a month left to still qualify for the â€œ27 Club.â€ Thatâ€™s something I guess.
