Ugh.. not sure why or what to doI come home and everything feels so wrong my family, the apartment complex and me. I always get so depressed and even suicidal after a long time of not being suicidal, I mean I'm not scared of being suicidal I just know that's a bad sign. I also get urges to self harm and not allow myself to eat.. I fucking hate it like the destructive bullshit is making  me self destructive and I feel more fucked than I already am.
