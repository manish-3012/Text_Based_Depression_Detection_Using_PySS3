I'm so alone and just want someone to say something kindPlease help. At the moment I've gone through a complete feeling of loss of meaning which has been going on for 5 years, I'm current 18 now with zero friends, the last time I spoke to someone from school was 2 months. I used to have passions and be happy but I haven't felt it purely in years My long time girlfriend just ended our relationship over text with so much sadness between us and I'm still in love with her but she did it in the kindest way, she was just holding on because she knew my situation. I'm currently on summer break waiting upon my results that determine if I go to university and I don't feel too confident despite my best efforts. My mum has severe mental illness which leads her to kick me out the house for the most minute of reasons that can't be avoided or reasoned with. I've been homeless for a few months throughout the year.ive had a small part time job for over 3 years but it's not enough to support me and I feel like I don't belong in the company or anywhere.  If I don't find a decent job or go to uni I'm going to end up homeless with no friends and no family that cares. I've applied to so many jobs and got amazing feedback but someone else always gets the job and I'm so tired or trying. If you think there is someone that cares, there absolutely isn't. I'm totally alone and despite me trying to reach out nothing works. I fear for the worst outcome and I'm considering ending it which I've come so so very close to in the past. I'm so fucking desperate, any encouraging words please? I need any sort of comfort or just anyone to talk to. Someone please say something nice.
