My suicidal ex won't stop messaging me about how she's going to kill herself.Some of you may have seen my post from before where I went into detail about my suicidal girlfriend. Since then, we have gotten into a giant argument that ended up with me being arrested. After that fight, we broke up. This happened about a week ago and everyday since she has been texting me saying how she wants to kill herself and how it's all my fault. I broke up with her in hopes that we could both be independent and find help to become better, healthier people. While I am still trying to do those things, she is just making me feel a whole lot worse at every turn. She constantly blows my phone up with things like "hope you don't bring girls to my funeral" and "I'm gonna start writing suicide notes" and it has left me in the worst situation yet. I am trying so hard to focus my energy on bettering myself but it seems she only wants me to feel as worse as possible. All I want is for her not to kill herself. But I can't fall back into the trap that was our relationship. ANY advice is appreciated. She is trying to ruin my progress which I'm scared will lead to me becoming suicidal.
