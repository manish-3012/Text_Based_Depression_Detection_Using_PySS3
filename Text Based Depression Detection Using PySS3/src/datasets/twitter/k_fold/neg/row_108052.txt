Nothing leftI have been depressed my entire life. It has now cost me my marriage and my child. I have tried damn near every med out there done therapy tried every fix there is. NOTHING fucking works. Suicide hotlines a a joke. Monday is my go day. I will be able to be alone and can finally remove my useless existence. I feel the most amazing peace with this decision. More peace than I have felt ever
