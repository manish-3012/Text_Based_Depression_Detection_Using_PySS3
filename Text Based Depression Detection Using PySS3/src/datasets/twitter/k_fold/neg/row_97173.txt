Words don't help, but they're niceEvery once in a while, I find myself here, though I never post.

I think today might change though, I might hit submit.

**Publicly**, I desire to find someone that really, truly understands. Who has been through something similar and gotten through it.

**Secretly**, I wish someone would be able to actually have the means to remove me from my situation and help me become independent as my parents should have, but I know it's only a thing for me to daydream about while playing Solitaire(my thinking game), it's just too late for me now. 

Either way, **neither** of those things are going to happen.

It is also my desire to post a long detailed post about my life, but I know it wont be read. So I'll make a few bullet points instead.

* I am 22 years old.
* I was heavily abused through childhood. Physical, sexual, and neglect. From neighbors, family members, teachers, and fellow students. I am meek and submissive, a natural target. The first memory I have is of abuse, I woke up upside down having my head dunked in the toilet by my pre-school teacher because I was hard to wake up.
* I was pulled out of public school after 5th grade, I never received any real schooling at home. Yet through self study I passed the GED.
* I was forced to leave my parents house at 18 for being queer
* Because of this, I feel bitter when I see things like [this](http://kfor.com/2014/09/02/teen-records-familys-heartbreaking-reaction-to-his-coming-out-receives-shocking-support/), where was society when I needed help? Where are they now?
* I have been homeless/couch surfing since 18
* About a year ago, I was diagnosed with Dissociative Identity Disorder. That is, multiple personalities. It explains why I could never hold a job. Makes me blame myself less for being unable to keep jobs, but I feel much more out of control.
* I am married to a beautiful man who also has DiD.
* He finally lost his job two months ago, and he is now facing homelessness with me. I somehow feel responsible, like I am cursed.
* Because he only just lost his job, Food-stamps only gave us $11 for Feb, and this month doesn't start until the 7th. Hunger is a thing.
* We have already sold everything we own that's worth anything. 
* Shortly after I learned I had DiD, I applied for Disability, but have been denied twice and waiting for a court date, which would take another year that we don't have.
* I really have tried everything to earn and income and be independent. Different jobs, starting a business crafting, contacting homeless shelters/programs, sex work(*shudders*)
* We're going to be fucking homeless soon. I can't fucking handle that thought. I thought I was finally free of that. I'm fucking cursed.
* I feel like I keep getting denied for disability is because I am intelligent, and able to explain my disability. On paper, I don't *seem* that broken, clearly I must be faking it. Especially because I don't have a mile-long medical history. Which I could never have because I can't afford it. Because I can't work. Because I'm disabled.
* I'm just really afraid to spend another Florida summer homeless and hungry. I don't have the strength to watch my husband go through it either. I love him so much.


**I hate this society, no one wants us to die, but no one wants to help us live either.**

I think I'm going to suggest to my husband that we commit suicide together. *I know he'll say yes.*
