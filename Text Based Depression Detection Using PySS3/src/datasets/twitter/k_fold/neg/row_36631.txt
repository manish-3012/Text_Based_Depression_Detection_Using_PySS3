Does anyone have any sort of long term experience with anti anxiety medication?I just got prescribe one for an ass needed type of thing and something that Iâ€™m noticing is when I have panic attacks and I take it, Iâ€™m not anxious or panicky anymore but the desire to end my life increases so much. Is that normal? Does anyone else experience this?
