The worst panic attack I've ever had.Yesterday on a birthday party of 2 of my classmates I went for a walk because I wanted to smoke a cigarate and to not disturb others I decided to walk away. I had been walking for a minute or two already and then it kicked in. First of all was the chest. I felt like something heavy was put on my chest, then my heart went crazy and I already knew where it was going. Thoughts started running through my head and then I saw that that a car was aproaching. I started thinking about throwing myself under it. It was the most intence fight of my life. My emotions were telling me to go to the right and then jump meanwhile my rationality was doing everything in its power to stick to the left side. It lasted well over 20 seconds. When the car was already behind me I bursted into tears. I went to the closest tree to lean on it. For well over half an hour I was just staring at the sky thinking that I should think about something to change my situation but all I could think about was that I should think. After some time I decided that I'm in a good enough shape that I can go back to the restaurant and so I did. When I got to the restaurant I just sat in my chair and with my head in my hands waited for the party to be over. I'm scared that when the next time such thing happens my rationality will lose the fight.
