I'm so tired(please excuse my English, I'm Spanish) 

Well, I don't know what to do anymore
I've been trying to fight for myself for so long
But I'm weak
I just keep falling, I just don't feel like I'm worth fighting anymore 

Lately I've been having suicidal thoughts... 

I can't find the reasons to keep fighting
I'm a bother to everyone
I keep hurting everyone
I'm nothing but a mess

My mother literally just said to me, that she's dead for me, that she won't talk to me anymore because I keep making her life a living hell

I asked my dad for professional help, he said that I don't need it, that the only thing I need to do is stop being who I am.

And that's just the tip of the iceberg... 

Should I stop being at all? If I'm nothing but a bother what's the point of keep living?
