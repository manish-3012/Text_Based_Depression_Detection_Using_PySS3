I was right. It should have ended a long time ago.Every day that goes by, it just seems to re-affirm my suspicions.

I should have killed myself a long time ago.

A short while after that.

That time after that.

With each revolution of the hand, I find ways to ruin the memory of that person people were so attracted to.

Driving away friends, family, lovers, I fall deeper into that lonely abyss...

I'm nothing like the person I used to be. A bit more self-aware, sure, but so bitter, so angry, and just as depressed as before. Those fleeting periods of joy punctuate a smog of sadness and frustration.

I tried to seek help, sure.

Time and time again I have. Not even so much as a damn dent to show for it.

At least if I'd done it at any point prior to this, I'd have people to mourn my passing. My death would have had meaning, impact. I'd have left a legacy that wouldn't feel so shameful. People would still love me, they'd call themselves my friend, they'd mourn my passing. Now they'd be glad to have me gone, or worse - not care at all.

It's gotten so much worse. I've truly driven them all away this time. 

And I'm so bitterly aware of my emotions swinging even more violently across the spectrum. 

The bouts of anger are worse, I'm spiteful and disgusted by the world around me. I feel that sickening response growing harder to ignore. I just know it will end violently.

I hope so damned much that I find the courage this time to use that momentum to act and stop this dumbfuck from doing any more harm.
