I feel alone in this worldI feel alone in this world, and I wish I didnâ€™t feel like dying when I get panic attacks. Iâ€™m crying horribly right now, because I wish someone would care that Iâ€™m sad. I wish someone would give me encouraging words.

Why am I cursed to be a sensitive human? Why canâ€™t I be emotionless and not saddened by everything sad that happens to me?

Iâ€™m alone. Iâ€™ve always been alone. There isnâ€™t a single human on this earth who cares that Iâ€™m sad. I just want comfort.

It isnâ€™t fair that I am naturally a sensitive person in a cruel world. Why am I never good enough? Why am I sad, why am I not talented, why am I not pretty?

All I want right now is to be swallowed up whole. I donâ€™t binge eat, I donâ€™t drink, I donâ€™t do drugs, I donâ€™t self-harm I donâ€™t do anything thatâ€™s considered self-destructive. I donâ€™t have any outlet when I feel this way. Why am I cursed to not have an outlet? Why do I want to be numb and swallowed up whole, yet not have the guts to have an outlet like that?

Please. I just want encouraging words. I want a sign that someone out there cares about me.
