I am almost out of reasons to liveIf you want background information about me, read my previous posts.

I seriously have only 1 reason left to live, and it is completely fucking pathetic. It's that I haven't played Fallout 4. The fact that the only reason I haven't killed myself yet is that I haven't played a fucking video game makes me even more depressed about my life.

I am closer to the edge than I have ever been.
