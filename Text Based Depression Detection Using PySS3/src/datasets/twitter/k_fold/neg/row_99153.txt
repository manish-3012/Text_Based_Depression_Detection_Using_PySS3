There is no one to care about meThatâ€™s it. No one that cares if Iâ€™m home or if Iâ€™m ok. I just stay alone by myself, using drugs and trying to get an overdose. If I die today, nobody is going to call me tomorrow and think itâ€™s weird that I didnâ€™t answer. Itâ€™s going to take weeks for somebody to think something is wrong. I donâ€™t have friends. I donâ€™t remember the last time somebody talked to me.I have no memory of affection. I canâ€™t remember the last time someone cared about me or talked to me. Everyday Iâ€™m alone. I canâ€™t take this anymore. Iâ€™m such a disgrace. Not even my brothers talk to me.
