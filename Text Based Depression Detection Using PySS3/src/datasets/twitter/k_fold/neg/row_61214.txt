My life has already peakedI'm spent. I have no drive, no more energy. I don't want to get out of bed. I've achieved the limit of my potential. It seems that was getting into uni, at the time I had no clue I was incapable of actually doing anything with the course or the prospective degree. I used to be bright. I'm stupid now. Totally vacuous. People get out of depressed states of mind, out of terrible ruts, all the time. But I won't. I'm inferior to almost everyone who has ever lived now. The sense that my life is winding down is overwhelming. I love the people in my life but I've driven most of them away now. I no longer care who I hurt. The only thing left to do is drift off into a nice, eternity-long, sleep...
