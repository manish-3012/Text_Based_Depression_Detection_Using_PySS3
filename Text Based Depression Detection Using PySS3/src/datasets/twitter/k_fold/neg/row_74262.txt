Not sure I can make it through the next dayItâ€™s so difficult for me to be writing this, I recently went through a breakup this guy was the love of my life and the reason he broke up with me was cause Iâ€™m pregnant with his child. This has made it even more difficult I have paranoia as he was chatting up another girl online while we were together all this and being pregnant has caused me to seriously self harm and push him away Iâ€™ve pushed him away so much that thereâ€™s no point in me going on anymore, he doesnâ€™t want me he doesnâ€™t want our baby and I canâ€™t deal with all these different emotions coming together. I just want to go to sleep and my heart stop beating I canâ€™t bear feeling this way anymore.
