I hate myself.I feel like thereâ€™s no one I can properly talk to because Iâ€™m too immature with anything. I ruin things. I ruin relationships. I ruin everything. I ruin myself. 

I canâ€™t do anything right. I have no friends to share my problems with. The only person I have is my boyfriend but Iâ€™m too much of a rollercoaster and cannot get my head straight. All I do is just walk away and stay silent and get angry at myself. 

When I get angry at myself, I start saying the harshest words to myself. I want to die. Iâ€™ve been thinking either to jump out of my window or hang myself. I canâ€™t deal with myself anymore. Nobody can.
