fuck it i'm donei don't know what it is about the world or what i could possibly owe to it, everytime, every goddamn time, i lost my fiancÃ© of 5 years out of the fucking blues to a fucking car accident, she was the only thing that kept me going, i cared too fucking much for her, i overcame my fucking addiction and took over my depression with her but in a blink of an eye i no longer had her, the world showed me a middle finger for doing right , one day you're on top of the world and the next you're in the bottomless pit expecting to hit the bottom as hard as you can but it won't happen, no matter how much you struggle to fix it, there's a void that can't be filled, there's no reason for you to keep fixing it and overcome the problems, nobody cares about me nobody fucking even knows me, they just know a name and as much as i let them know, i let others in once and i saw them running away, nobody wants to fuck with a depressed sucidial guy, they treat you like a delicacy, just saying few shitty clichÃ©s and that's it, no it won't get fucking better, no it won't be easier due time and no way in the fucking hell will i manage to overcome and forget something that i cared so much about when there's not a goddamn person or a reason in fucking 8 years since i lost her, no amount of money or people gonna give me the comfort i once had because nobody ever really wants to know a broken good, they like the show that i'm putting but i'm tired of this show, I AM FUCKING TIRED
