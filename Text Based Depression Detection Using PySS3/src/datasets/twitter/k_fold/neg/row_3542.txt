Been going through a really hard time lately, just need to vent.I've struggled with alcoholism, depression, and poverty quite a bit in the past and now quite a bit in the present. At a certain point, I was blacking out on friends and acquaintance's couches from place to place, and for a while, I was basically homeless and basically wandering aimlessly. 

I stopped counting the exact days I've been sober a while ago, but it's been over 2 years. I've had trouble finding AA meetings in my area, and this is the closest area I've found on Reddit that applies to my problems and has people who've dealt with similar things that I've dealt with. 

I mostly became sober out of pure necessity, and even that was really hard. A big motivator for me is that I used to be a member of a very radical cult that I was recruited into when I was at the bottom of my luck. I saw horrible things there, I was treated horribly but other people managed to get treated much worse. I managed to escape, but it wasn't at all easy after that. 

For a time, I got a job, and an apartment but even that is gone now and the apartment likely won't be for long. I was a welder, but recently I was laid off due to cuts they had to make. The only reason I even have utilities is because my landlord has been very understanding, really has tolerated the above and beyond and I am very grateful towards him. 

Right now, I don't really even have any food, quite literally no food, and no money for food at that. I feel incredibly weak and numb, mostly I've drunk water. I was hungry for quite a bit the last time I was this low, but at least I had liquor which was better than nothing. 

I don't really have any friends, I lost quite a few friends

I don't feel suicidal as much as I do feel tired, hungry, and I haven't had the urge to drink this badly in months. At least then maybe I'd have a distraction. This was mostly just to vent, but I'd like someone to talk to as well.
