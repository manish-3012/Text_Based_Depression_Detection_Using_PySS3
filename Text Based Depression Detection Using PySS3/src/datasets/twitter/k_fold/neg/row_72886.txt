I think my time has come.Everyone around me has no idea. But it is time. I am ready. This is my first and my last post. Thank you all.

UPDATE: I am waiting until tomorrow. The support shown to me has made me give more time to consider. I'm still about 95% sure I'm going to do it, but that was 5% that wasn't there earlier.

UPDATE 2: At 7pm BST I will be taking my life. Thank you all for the kind messages. I am glad that in my last moments I was given some kindness. Again, thank you all, stay strong. Goodnight, I hope you're happy.
