Tired.I'm just tired of being alive. 
I love my daughter to pieces, and she'll have nothing without me, so that's why I stay. 
I just wish I didnt have to. 
I'm tired of going on every day, knowing my fate is to live miserably and then die. 
My life is a blur. 
I was gang raped and nobody fucking cares. 
My daughter is growing, and she's gonna feel my depression radiating. 
She'll catch on, and she'll feel similar as she gets older. 
Im tired.
