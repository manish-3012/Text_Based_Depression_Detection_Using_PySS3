Tired of being nothingI just don't care anymore.  I'm tired of days that turn into weeks that turn into months with nothing going on.  I've lost all hope and all motivation.  Watching people around me succeeding/living the life I want to live (a life which I feel I should point, out is far from extravagant), combined with my getting punished for attempting to do the same has stripped away any semblance of light left in my heart.  

The only reason I'm still here is I couldn't bear to put that level of heartbreak on my grandmother (I'm her only grandchild and we are very close), but once she is gone I have no reason to be here anymore.  There is no place for me in this world.  My existence was a mistake and it's time I got the hint.
