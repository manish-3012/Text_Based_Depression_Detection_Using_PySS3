Monday. I'm taking the $100 I have left and buy a firearm to end my life. Enough is enough. I've gone past the point of frustration and failure. I don't care anymore. I have it planned and I'm doing it. I'm just glad I've developed the bravery and mindset to do so. Forget this world and the people in it.
