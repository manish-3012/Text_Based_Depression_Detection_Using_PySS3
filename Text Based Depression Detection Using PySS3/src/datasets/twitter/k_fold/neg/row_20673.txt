I'm not okI haven't been OK in a good 2.5 years now. How long am I supposed to hold onto the idea that shit gets better. The only people in my immediate life that I am near, in person, are my coworkers. Family ditched me, wife left me, and my 3 best friends, too. I can't do this anymore. I can't keep waking up, trying to find a will to subject myself to the risk that I'll lose more in my life.

&amp;#x200B;

Most of what I lost was because I'm trans; some of it was because of the depression I suffered from having family leave me for being trans, and towards the end - I just started pushing people away in self defense because I guess... I figured it'd hurt less, if I pushed them out before they walked out. Y'know?

I find distractions over and over to carry me forward, but nothing sticks; and if I don't have one, I usually end up crying hysterically and reminisce on my life pre-transition. It's a horrible duality; I miss what I had before, but I couldn't not transition. I just can't 'not' be trans. I keep thinking this is some shit nightmare, and I'll eventually wake up - and my life will be as it was before. Mother who loved me, siblings who chatted with me often and we'd host hangouts, my wife and I still married. I'm so, so tired of losing; and even more tired of fighting.

I've had my method of leaving ready for about 6 months now; I was supposed to go on my 32nd bday. I dont know... I'm sorry; thank you for reading.
