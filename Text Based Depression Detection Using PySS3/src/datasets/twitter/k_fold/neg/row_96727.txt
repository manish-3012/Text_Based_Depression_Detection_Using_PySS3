I'm sincerely hesitatingYesterday I bought a rope with the correct length, toughness that doesn't scratch too much. I made the calculation for the fall that I must do it breaks my neck and there is not too much pain.
 I have the spot, and I'm currently hesitating.
 I have no energy whatsoever to do anything.
 I just don't see the point.
Yet I know my death would hurt some people that thinks that my survival is their personal affair and I really don't want them to feel bad.
 I've had a history with mental health, did my share of attempts and been ohspitalized for a while. I have a lot of people counting on me, more than ever and yet, I don't see any exits.
 My autism, ADHD, anxiety and depression are just too much to deal with when I must take studies, relationships,moral and energy into account.
 I feel so bad and weak and worthless. 
 I'm so fucking privilieged and yet I can't do shit. I don't know what to do.
 Since october I've been thinking of getting back to alcohol or move to hard drugs. 
 I've managed to diminish cutting and all but I can't do it anymore. I don't know what to do.

 Been in this state of breakdown, going up and down for 2 days now, I don't know what to do.

Thank you for reading this.
 Have a good day
