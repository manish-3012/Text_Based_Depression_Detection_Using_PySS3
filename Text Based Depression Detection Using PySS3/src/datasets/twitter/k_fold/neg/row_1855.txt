I reached out.I told someone I want to die. I've felt like this for over a year, daily, it hasn't let up. 

His response was to berate me because I haven't done something for him that he asked me to do. 

I'm that worthless. Planning to kill myself doesn't matter I just better be sure I do what I was told to do first.
