So I tempted death today.Walked up the highway 5 hours to the next town, semis passing me by mere inches, wearing nothing but sockless converse shoes, some athletic shorts and a tee shirt. My feet are covered in blisters. But I made a point. Iâ€™m not fucking around. I donâ€™t care if I live or die, and I would rather die than continue living with my mentally ill, emotionally neglectful and psychologically abusive parents. I am a 25 year old man, Iâ€™m damn near penniless and I cannot stand another day.
