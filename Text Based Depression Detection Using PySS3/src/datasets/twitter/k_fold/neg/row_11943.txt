Please help, I don't see a way out of this.I was abused by my dad (narcissist, drunkard, liar) and neglected by my mom [see: attachment disorganization].  I belonged to that madness when I was home but since I've moved out and don't belong to anyone.

It's like those needs I had as a kid (like contact comfort, a secure base) have resurfaced.  All I want is a mother figure, someone to nurture me.  I'm 23 and I daydream about getting taken care of like a child.  Nothing else matters to me, everything else is fading out.  I'm addicted to the very thought of it.  I'm fucking consumed by it.  I just want to attach to someone because I never really have before.  I've been stuck in this same thought for over 3 years now.

It's not socially appropriate of me to want that from someone.  I'm a 23 year old man.  How could anyone ever love me in a primary way?  I want to be dependent on someone.  There's no solution to this.  Why do I keep enduring this pain when I'll never get what I really need to heal?

It's like I took my mom's place in relation to my dad (this is where the pain all stems from).  I need someone to mother me and take that place back so I can be the kid in the family tree where I was meant to be.  That's what's wrong.  That's what I can't fix.
