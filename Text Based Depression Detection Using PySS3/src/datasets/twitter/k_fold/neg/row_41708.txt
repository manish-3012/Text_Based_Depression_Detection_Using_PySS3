Iam a failureSo, iam from a foreing country, sorry about my grammar.  
  
I have been diagnosed with severe depression since i was 21, i struggle with it ever since (and even before that). To make things worse iam unemployed for 6 years now, making ends meet with less than 10 dollars a month, luckily i live with my parents and iam not homeless yet.  
I cant find a job because iam "not experienced enough" (prior to this whole situation i have worked hard since i was 14, plenty of recommendations on my resume but i never worked in the same place for more than 2 years), now my father is also unemployed and the only ones bringing something to the house is my mother and my brother. I cant even afford my medication without struggling to pay for it the next month.  
  
I have a girlfriend for 2 years now, and i honestly cant understand why she is still here. University is taking all my energy, i walk day and night looking for a job, still... Nothing.  
All i can think is how to end this miserable life, or to waste it away going for crime and drug dealing. I cant afford to go out and have a beer with my friends, my GF has to pay for everything when she invites me out.  
  
I dont feel like a man at all. What are we supposed to do? All i can think is suicide. My parents cant afford to have a dead weight sucking all they have while giving nothing in return.  
  
Iam a failure, and i think i had enough.
