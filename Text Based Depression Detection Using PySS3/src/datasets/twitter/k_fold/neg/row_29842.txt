Too empathetic to dieSo I've had reoccurring bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 14. Have almost jumped off of buildings and out of moving cars only to stop myself because my mom would be wrecked.

Now I know that I'm my mom's greatest suffering because I'm gay. I constantly think about it these days. Just ending it. Tonight has been the most violent thoughts I've ever had, slicing my own throat. But then I thought it wouldn't be fair to my best friends.

It's like I'm too fucking empathetic to go about it. I'm too worried about the quality of life for those closest to me to do this one last favor for myself. I want it. I want everything to be over. The good, the bad. It's not worth it anymore. I just can't stop fucking worrying about how some few people will live after this.

I've been clinically diagnosed, should be on meds and in therapy but I don't have money for that. Plus I just don't fucking care
