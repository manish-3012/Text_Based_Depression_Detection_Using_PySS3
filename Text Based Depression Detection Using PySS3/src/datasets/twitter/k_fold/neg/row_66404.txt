wellp.. im thinking about doing it bc things went to shit and i dont think i can deal with this anymorei just got the results of one of my final exams (i've been super anxious about those) and it turns out i passed with the best grade... it was the first time in YEARS that i could honestly say i felt happy and proud of myself.. a few seconds after i found out i rushed to tell my dad because i just wanted him to be happy and proud of me too.. instead, he just got mad at me, told me to get away from him, and that made me feel like shit. i just went ahead and self harmed and cried, its 2am right now and I've never wanted to kill myself more than i do now... being put down about something that i so cared about just hurt too much.. ive been depressed and suicidal for years and i feel like this might as well be the one thing that pushes me over the edge
