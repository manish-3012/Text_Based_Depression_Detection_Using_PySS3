Why is it so hard to reach out?To tell someone that you attempted suicide a few weeks ago. Or that you're planning to try again. Why is help so hard? Why does reaching out feel like a huge crime, like being quiet is really the best way to be. I don't know what to do, or where to go. I don't even know why I'm saying this here. What can being here do? I don't know. I don't. know.
