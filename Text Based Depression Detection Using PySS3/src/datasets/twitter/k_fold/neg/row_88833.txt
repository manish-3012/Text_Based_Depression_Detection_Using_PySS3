Please don't say these thing to suicidal individualsI know and I've seen how people get annoyed when someone says these things to them. There are some sentences which make them feel worse because they've heard them too many times. When you say things like "Everything gets better", "Things only get better if you want them to", "You have so much to live for", "Life has so much to offer", "You're not alone", "Please don't kill yourself", "Get help" and etc, it makes them think you don't really care and just trying to feed them some positivity hoping they will feel better.
