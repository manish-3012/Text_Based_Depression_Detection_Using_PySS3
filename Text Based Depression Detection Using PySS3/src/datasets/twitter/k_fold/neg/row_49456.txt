Putting myself in a position where suicide is mere moments away brings me comfort.Maybe Iâ€™m having a super irritable day, which upset my girlfriend because Iâ€™m stand-off ish which upsets me, so I visualize step by step what it would be like slitting my wrists.

Maybe it was before then, when I was recently divorced and put an unloaded gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger, Iâ€™ve sense sold the gun.

Maybe it was when I used break open razors and slice at my arm because the pain felt relaxing. When my gone girlfriends cat scratches me sheâ€™s always surprised I donâ€™t scream in pain, little does she know cuts and slices, anything that draws blood feels comforting to me.


Maybe when I was 6 and I tried to make myself a suicide cocktail, obviously I didnâ€™t know what I was doing and was just medicine from the bathroom cabinet crushed into my own urine (fucked up ikr).

Had a tough conversation with a coworker and felt like screaming, just fantasized about putting a shotgun in my mouth and imagining the feeling of the back of my head blowing out all over the wall.

Iâ€™m probably not going to kill myself ever, Iâ€™d probably fuck that up to, but at least thinking about it gives me comfort.
