Iâ€™ve snappedIâ€™m writing my letters and Iâ€™m planning on ending it. I have lost my job, my car, my independence, my safety, everything in the past month. I have been trying to stay positive. I found a new job and have tried to get my anxiety under control, yet Iâ€™m more miserable than before. And I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t keep trying when every day is worse than the day before. 

Iâ€™m writing my letters and I guess I just wanted to tell someone. I canâ€™t tell anyone in real life obviously. I donâ€™t want to be stopped this time. Iâ€™ve tapped out. Everything in my life makes me miserable. I just canâ€™t do another day of misery.
