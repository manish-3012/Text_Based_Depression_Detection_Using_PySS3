Trying to get in contact with a suicidal friend of mine. How can I go about this?Sorry if this isnâ€™t the right place to ask, but Iâ€™m super worried. My best friend has attempted suicide before. I havenâ€™t been able to get in contact with her for over a week now, and this isnâ€™t like her. Iâ€™m terrified out of my fucking mind and getting so desperate. 

Is there a way I can contact someone, maybe the police, and ask them for a courtesy call (basically, have the police check on her well being)? I ask this because we donâ€™t live in the same town, and sheâ€™s quite far away. However, we are both in Texas, if that helps somehow.

There is no one of hers family or friend-wise that I can currently contact. Would the police be able to do something like this? I also donâ€™t know her exact address. Iâ€™m so scared and desperate right now ... any help would mean the absolute world to me.
