Bro I kinda wanna like... kill myselfI'm a graduating senior in college and I'm demoralized. I feel robbed as a student. I feel unprepared for the future. I'm struggling with the job search. My parents made this sound like it would be simple, but it's not. I had some hope watching this presidential primary, but now I have none, cuz it looks like the reactionary profit seeking soul crushing status quo is successfully guarding itself. Maybe the boomers were right and I shouldn't have went into debt over a worthless degree in which the job market is minimal. All my classmates have got their shit together and are much better, smarter and more talented than I could ever be. Why did I even consider choosing this path?

It's all my fault and I'm gonna end up broke and alone simply, cuz I was too fucking stupid and worthless to be successful. If I don't find a good paying job by the end of April, I'm probably just gonna kill myself before graduation. Why not? Suicide is the only true right I have
