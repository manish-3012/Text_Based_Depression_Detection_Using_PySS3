Thatâ€™s it. Iâ€™m done. Nothing in life brings me happinessIâ€™m a fat worthless fuck with no job and no talents. Iâ€™ve tried therapy and pills, but pills wonâ€™t make deserve to live, and Iâ€™ll never be anything but a miserable waste of skin. Iâ€™m giving myself one week, then Iâ€™m spending all of my money on cool shit, and then shooting myself in the head. Nothing will make be able to not fail at everything I try, so thereâ€™s really no point in living.
