My friend's friend hung herself, boyfriend just left me, don't feel too good.Last Monday my friend's best friend hung herself. I can't seem to get her out of my mind. Process of dying is frightening but the result is attractive.

Edit: I've been reading SW on and off for a few months. You are good people even if your dire efforts don't always work. Thank you.
