DisappointedBeen building businesses since i was 18 im 30 and not a single one of them have worked out. In debt, live at home with parents AGAIN, kinda just wanna die. cant find acceptance anywhere. cant find a meaning anymore, stress is really hitting home this time, and i have no one to speak with about it. i am the strong one that people look up to, and im hurting really bad. just dont know what to do anymore. trying to figure a way past this obstacle before i jump out the 11th floor of this hotel.
