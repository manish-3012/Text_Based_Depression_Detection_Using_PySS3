JealousIâ€™m jealous of people that went through with it. Some say that itâ€™s the cowards way out but you need to be very brave to actually do it. Latest Iâ€™ll do it is in 10 months and I still donâ€™t have a plan on how Iâ€™m gonna do it. Started a diary because it will be all thatâ€™s left of me after Iâ€™m gone. I wish killing yourself wasnâ€™t so hard.
