Tired of being enslaved by parentsIâ€™m tired of being a slave for them. They ruined my life and continue to do so while i do nothing...


I canâ€™t do anything, i would if i could, but they made sure iâ€™m caged well and isolated from the world

I only worry about their needs and wants and existing for others is hard because in every situation i have to think of whatâ€™s best for them wnd not me, if I donâ€™t put them first iâ€™m as good as dead...

Idk what to do!!! I want to die
