My mum tried to kill herself last nightShe took 9 sleeping pills and roughly 20 blood pressure pills last night around 12.30. 
This morning she called me into her room, groggy but awake and told me this. She just didn't want to wake up.

I've kept an eye on her all day, she's had a few naps and water and some food.

Nothing seems to matter anymore, life is so fragile. 

I'm sorry if this is worded weird I'm very dazed, I just wanted to let it out somewhere
