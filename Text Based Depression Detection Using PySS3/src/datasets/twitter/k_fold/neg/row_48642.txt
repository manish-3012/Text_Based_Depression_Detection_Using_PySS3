i am donei am a waste of air no matter how hard i try i always fall back into this loop...
so much pain. nobody to love me nobody to love. i keep failing God i keep being lazy i keep feeling like iâ€™m a girl and a boy at the same time i keep wanting to do everything bad i keep being alone and empty thats it i just want to fucking DIE I AM DONE. I want someone to beat me uo, to punch me hard, to make me bleed. i want to fucking pass out. 
i will NEVER FIND LOVE OR HAPPINESS. I am unloveable, i am unloveable. i kind of want someone to fuck me even if it hurts even if itâ€™s against my religion even if iâ€™m young i donâ€™t care, just fuck me up. i want to forget
