I live in the USI'm a conservative in most aspects, so take that into account in hearing what I have to say.

The US has done an absolutely horrible job at containing the virus. With countries like Japan, South Korea, and Canada getting hundreds of cases a day compared to our tens of thousands, it makes me realize that I need to die. I don't want to live in this hellscape of loosely but still enforced lockdown forever. I have no hope. When I do inevitably commit suicide, I'll make a Twitter and Facebook ad campaign that'll automatically upload my suicide video, catering to Maga hashtags, anti mask hashtags, and whatever else I can think of. I can only hope that people seeing my death will enable them to make the US better with Covid, and I hope to god that after (or maybe even before) I'm gone, they'll be a national 6 week fully enforced lockdown. I just can't take this anymore. Maybe I could even livestream it somewhere, and wait until I bring in enough viewers to do it.
