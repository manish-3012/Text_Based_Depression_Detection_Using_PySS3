Living for othersI feel like the only reason I'm alive is because other people are depending on me.  If I didn't have those people, I would have probably jumped in front of a train or blown my head off.  But now, I feel like I'm losing all meaning.  Even the thought of living for the people that say they care about me doesn't have the same weight.  I'm a 19 year old ugly loser with no meaning in life.  I just want to be happy, that's it.  I would chop off both my legs if I could just be happy, but it doesn't work like that.  My ex was right, I'm a loser that doesn't deserve anything I have.  I really would be better of dead.  I'm gonna go sit by the train tracks and decide if I want to live or not.
