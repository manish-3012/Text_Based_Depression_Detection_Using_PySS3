15 years of fighting and I'm doneI don't really suffer from severe depression but rather have a strange but debilitating form of OCD which is much more severe in terms of compulsions rather than obsessions, which seems to be extremely rare. I live in a third world country where there is no free access to mental help though luckily my parents were well of enough to pay for me for a short period once about 8 years ago but that didn't work and now I have no other option. I have been fighting this disease that's put me in a state of perpetual anxiety and confusion since I was 15 with no luck.

I spend literally 90% of my life trying to fight off compulsions and have never had any success at mitigating it. Every little spark of hope I've ever had has been extinguished. I've had nervous breakdowns before but this one is different. Now even after a few days when my emotional peak has subsided I feel like I can not go on. 15 fucking years of trying to fix myself and i'm still defective and useless. Can you believe over 15 years the longest period of stability I've ever had is 2 weeks? I have never had a good year or even a good couple of months in since I became an adolescent. The thing that infuriates me most is how my extended family and old classmates thinks I'm a lazy POS and disrespect me since I have no job despite being from relatively wealthy family in my country. I so wanted to prove them wrong. I used to listen a lot to the sam cooke song "a change is gonna come" and honestly believed the message of the chorus. That if I keep putting in the effort eventually I WILL BEAT THIS THING. After 15 years i can safely say that is utter bullshit. Fuck this, it's not worth it.

If i had one wish right now it would be that i were able to punch a stone wall as hard as possible without breaking my hand and just keep walloping the shit out of it taking out all my pain, frustration and anger. That would be better than the sweetest drug in the world.
