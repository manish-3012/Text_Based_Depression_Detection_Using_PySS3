My best friend committed suicide a few month ago and I am still struggling. HelpA few months ago my best friend committed suicide. I miss him more every day and my feeling are not getting any better. I barely eat and I barely sleep. It has been affecting my mental health a lot. Has anyone ever experienced a suicide of a best friend relative or someone else important to you? How did you handle it and how long until it gets easier?
