I want to kill myself.Honestly I don't know where to start or what I should bring up. Right now I feel worthless and it seems like 2020 would be a good year to finally end things. I'm tired of being a fuck up in the eyes of my family and would rather have them miss me forever than have them waste time and energy worrying about me for the rest of their lives. I've never told them about my failed suicide attempts in fear of being admitted and forgotten about. And no matter how many times people like to tell me and people like me otherwise with "Things will get better." or any other generic positive vibe response, I can't help but see false hope that's designed to prolong my suffering. I dont want to live on suffering when I know I can die in peace.

TLDR: I want to kill myself and tell everyone about it.
