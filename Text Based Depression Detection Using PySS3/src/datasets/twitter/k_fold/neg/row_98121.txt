Not being a means to an end = not having friendsWhy oh why did my parents have to have me. The kid that was literally an accident from the very get go. Playing video games and blasting music music loud enough to royally piss off my neighbors are legit the only pleasures that keep me from offing myself. I have no real talents, social skills, or friends, and in fact I don't want friends at all because everyone has thought they could use me as a means to their ends, I suppose parties drugs or more friends, and when people realize you're awkward and a loner, they assume there's good reason, realize you can't be used as a means to their ends, and BOOM no friends again!! WOOOHOO!!

Doesn't seem to make a difference if u act like a douche, nice as hell, or somewhere in between if ur pretty weird or ugly lookin, cuz you also gotta be funny or smart or witty or good at getting intoxicated; something, anything distinctively attractive/charismatic to others. Most people are a good combination of these things but I'm none of them, never truly have been, and I've never had a real friend in my life. I come off as awkward and in my own universe because that's about right considering the amount of rejection I've faced. 

I've never been given a reason for being dumped, people just seem to like pretending I dont exist instead and act like you're a sociopathic criminal if you do ask why they dumped u. I'm suddenly cool with being treated like a satanist, black hole person, or whatthefuckever because I've realized it's pointless connecting with others when you're completely worthless at fitting in anyway and constantly doomed to a cycle of getting dumped once people realize you're useless. 

Fuck my genetics and pretty much everyone out there, honestly. I gave up on this world years ago at this point, and day after day after day after night after day. I have absolutely no fucking clue how I manage to keep existing.
