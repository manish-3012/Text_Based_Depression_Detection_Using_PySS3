could you maybe stop pushing me to do sonething ill regret, especially among this time with hospitals being overwhelmed?@ my dad. I think I'm going to lose my phone, which I don't care about with social media, stupid iphone games, etc... but I am terrified of losing any and all resources that could actually help me. If my toxic family are the only people I have contact with and I dont have friends to lean on I'm scared. I got their email addresses, but my dad might be looking over my shoulder 24/7 even on my computer if my phone gets taken. My friends keep me alive when my dad acts as someone else put it "mayor of crazy town". I was just getting better before all this because kf the people who help me...
