i shouldnâ€™t be this miserable at 16i just want it all to stop. i just want everything to go blank. i only feel happiness when i lay in my bed and go into a different world in my head. i just want someone to tell me iâ€™m not awful and i donâ€™t deserve to die. that things wonâ€™t be this way forever. i reminisce about the past until iâ€™m sick. i spend every second crying and being alone. i dream about being happy with someone that doesnâ€™t want me anymore. i go through life in a terrorized haze.
