My best friend tried to end it all on Thursday night and i haven't stopped crying since.She was so close to dying. 
I knew her depression and BPD was bad but i thought she was getting ontop of it. I thought that she was improving. 

The fact that she thought this was the only way out of her problems breaks my heart.

My heart feels like it's been broken into tiny pieces

I feel so many awful emotions and i don't know what to do.

If she had killed herself, i would have joined her.
