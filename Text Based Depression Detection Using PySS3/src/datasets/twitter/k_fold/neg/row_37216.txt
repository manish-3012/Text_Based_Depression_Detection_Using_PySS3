I'd rather be dead than let bipolar control my lifeI can't do it anymore. I can't. I don't know what I'm supposed to feel like or be like. I don't know whats real. I don't and I can't live the rest of my life like this. I take my meds and I feel numb and I am nothing. I don't take my meds and I am fucking insane and I can't control my head and nothing makes sense. I don't know who I am. I don't understand what I am suppose to be like. I can't take another mental break down. I can't do it. I can't live like this anymore. Its not fair. Its not fucking fair. I wish I was dead. I am such a burden on my family. I either get straight A's and offered early acceptance to doctorate programs in biotechnology or I am fucked up and wasted. I can't do these ups and downs. I don't want be manic anymore. Why can't I be like normal people?
