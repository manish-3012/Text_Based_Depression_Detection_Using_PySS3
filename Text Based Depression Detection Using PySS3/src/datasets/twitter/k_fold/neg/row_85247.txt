I am SO SO ALONEI was always so social , I finished high school , 3 really good friends left forever abroad , 2 other close friends have girlfriends and better things to do , another doesn't care and the last one lives far away

This is bullshit , 2 years ago I would have fun all day long , it was heaven on Earth and 1 year now I am so fucking isolated , I can't take this anymore , I am so lonely , I never have a girl to really actually love me , life is bullshit , I have no future and no job , I am FUCKED and the worst thing is that NOONE FUCKING CARES

1 YEAR NOW I WAKE UP TO FEEL LIKE SHIT DO NOTHING AND SLEEP AGAIN

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK
