I canâ€™t do it. Itâ€™s over. Or at least it will be soonMy life sucks. I have severe clinical depression and Iâ€™m a lonely, worthless 18 year old. I never thought Iâ€™d make it to 18 and I know I wonâ€™t make it to May first which is when my insurance kicks in. So even if I wanted help I couldnâ€™t. No ones gonna care when I do it. Why would they. Iâ€™ve always thought about suicide but the fucking last straw is that the guy I love cheated on me with my fucking brother(Iâ€™m a guy). Itâ€™s like the worlds final fuck you before I go. I canâ€™t handle existing let alone the heart break on top of it. Itâ€™s all too much. So Iâ€™m gonna down the mix of chemicals and pills I have in my closet tonight. With a little bit of alcohol beforehand to take the buzz and pain away. Iâ€™ve always come here to find those I can relate to and Iâ€™m thankful for this sub. I have my goodbye letters in my phone so Iâ€™m pretty much ready to go. This is probably goodbye unless life tries to screw me over by making me survive this.
