Suicide AttemptI want to attempt suicide, but I'm conflicted on if I want it to succeed. If it succeeds, the pain will be over, but if it fails, I get a cool scar (that was a joke, scars are horrible). And then there's the problem of doing it. If I cut shallow, it's not really an attempt, but if it's deep, it hurts like crazy. And as another problem, if it's deep my parents would notice. I don't know what to do anymore.
