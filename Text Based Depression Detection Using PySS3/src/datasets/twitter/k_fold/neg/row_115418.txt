Hi everyone :)I just wanted to say, i attempted in june of 2018. and have been suicidal since, but lately things have been getting better. i keep a mood tracker now and my days have been getting better and im holding hope for the future. i understand how it looks in th emoment, because its most likely the worst pain youve felt yet and it feels neverending. but it ends, and you grow. &lt;3 thank u for reading my 2am sleep deprived thoughts uwu,,,,,
