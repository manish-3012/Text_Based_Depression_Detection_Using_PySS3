Everything has finally beaten meI have been living with depression and anxiety for as long as I can remember. I never felt like I was someone but looking back I didnâ€™t even know how to be someone. In the past 4 years since starting university my mental health has hit an all time low, I didnâ€™t make friends with many people really and I struggled to trust the handful I did have. I ended up dissociating myself from everything and anyone, now there is nothing left. I have tried to get help through the NHS here in the UK but it has mostly made me feel worse. I donâ€™t have any close friends or family, although people say that they are there for me I canâ€™t tell them how I feel without fear of exposing myself and being judged for it. 

Right now my body is empty of life and my mind doesnâ€™t feel able to keep going anymore.
