i am so embarassingly alone.its almost comical how little i matter. like i cant even tell myself killing myself would bother anyone, i don't even have that. i am a fucking loser.

in movies, when someone makes a suicide threat, they get a whole harem of people running to check on them. i cant even get a text back when i tell someone im suicidal lol. 

i want to do it today. i hate dirt and mess, i don't want my body to decay for weeks here, but thats what would happen. nobody is checking on me, nobody is worried about me.

like a fucking idiot i pretend like people care about me, i exagerrate my place in everyone's life, i lie to people and say 'yeah i got invited to this thing by this person' or 'yeah this guy really likes me and cares about me' even when i know its not true, but i lie to myself and others that people care about me and want me around lol.

its so fucking pathetic, im so embarassing. i am the girl that begs people to care about me, that lets herself be beaten and screamed at and insulted and ignored because im too much of a pathetic idiot to get anything better.

im scared when i do it that ill go to hell but can it be wose than this? am i not already in hell?

what can be worse than living in a world where everyone has love and people to be with and im here alone. i cry and cry all day and all night, and nobody hears. nobody is coming to help me, nobody wants to. i am alone. i dont have any purpose or meaning. all im doing here is bothering people. i need to go
