I have no futureI can't sleep, it's four in the morning, I'm going to be up until 6am again tonight. I can't sleep like a normal person does. My whole life is so fucking depressing. I'm laying in my dad's basement, we're running out of money for food again, we probably won't make rent this month, but I'm too fucking inept to get a job. Any interaction with people or stress I just break down because I'm a fucking loser. My dad wants to kick me out but there's literally no where for me to go. The rest of my family hates me, probably more than my dad does. I have no money, no skills or motivation. I got fucked over by my dad and I can't get financial aid because his job pays under the table and he doesn't file taxes so my college wouldn't believe that I needed financial aid. But even if I was at college I'd fucking fail out because I have no motivation to go to class. I just spend all my time in bed wanting to die. What the fuck do I do, there's literally no solution for me other than kill myself. Every day I stay alive we get closer to being evicted, then my dad is just going to tell me to fuck off, and I'll live on the streets. God I want to fucking shoot myself so bad, how did everything get this bad? I wish I had some kind of fucking future but it's all just worse and worse every day. I have nothing going for me, I do nothing, I'm just a waste of space and money. Everyone hates me because I'm terrible. I wish I had the courage to shoot myself but I can't even do that right.
