I donâ€™t even knowHello everyone,

Itâ€™s funny how I was trying to encourage people to live here few years back and now Iâ€™m the one posting. 

Itâ€™s interesting because I have the best family, the best friends, multiple romantic interests and overall a well privileged life.

However, I myself am incompetent for here (as in life). I was preeeeetty sure that I had BPD, and it sucks that Iâ€™m actually happy to be diagnosed with â€œeither BPD either low level bipolar disorderâ€

All I know is that I feel like a 5 year old trapped in my body.

I finished my college degree this year, and was able to enroll for my Masterâ€™s. I think everything started with this, as I found out that Iâ€™m not interested with it at all after multiple failed suicide attempts of 2017-2018 as â€œI wasnâ€™t able to pursue my dreamsâ€

Ok Iâ€™m not happy with my education, this happens to a lot people right? I donâ€™t have a plan B. Nothing has ever interested me in my life. I always sweat when people ask what my hobbies or interests are. I have none. 

Thatâ€™s fine as well right, because only a minority love their job. We all just get by. Except Iâ€™ve never worked a day in my life and it scares me to a point where I have my anxiety attack right when I start thinking about it. 

Please call it like it is, Iâ€™m a spoiled piece of shit, and Iâ€™m aware.

Never been able to check mails or letters. Never been able to handle bureaucracy. Iâ€™m getting into deeper and deeper shit, disappointing everyone around me as it continues. The only feedback I get is that â€œwhy are you so incompetent lmaoâ€ and I ASK THE SAME QUESTION, but at the same time the situations I get into are rare cases and even professional advisors go â€œwowâ€.

I hate myself since when, 2015? And itâ€™s not a physical thing at all, even though I have weight issues. I just hate how Iâ€™m not made to live this life. This is not a â€œIâ€™m a quicky girlllâ€ thing, this is just me being a piece of garbage. I used to describe myself as â€œgarbageâ€ back when I attempted, and itâ€™s all back. 

Iâ€™m just at a point where I canâ€™t take my mind off of my issues. I was able to play make believe for 2 years but itâ€™s not working anymore. I thought having the lowest point in life would be significant as in â€œit can only go upâ€ but Iâ€™m finding out that lowest point can manifest in many forms. Iâ€™m at my lowest point now for many, many things. It will never get better. 

It sucks how, just a week ago, my bad thoughts came back and I was able to say â€œit will devastate too many people, youâ€™re gonna RUIN LIVESâ€ but now Iâ€™m like â€œthis is for their best interestâ€ again. I know how broken everyone were back when I attempted in 2017-2018. I still have nightmares about it. But, I donâ€™t care? As in it will be better in the future to stop investing to a literal mess. 

Quarantine didnâ€™t help I think. I got extremely nostalgic and still today Iâ€™m watching, listening, seeing everything that reminds me of the simpler times. Alcohol addiction doesnâ€™t help. 

I just suck.
