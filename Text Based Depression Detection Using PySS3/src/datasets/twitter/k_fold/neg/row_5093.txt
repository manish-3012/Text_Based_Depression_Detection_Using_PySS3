I destroyed my entire life, so let me know what's left.I don't see any reason to continue. 

I cheated on her. The only girl to ever mean anything in the world to me. I just wanted one last thing before I settled down so young and married her. But now it's over. I told her. I don't even know why. I could've been perfectly content never mentioning it to her. She wants us to carry on like nothing happened. She forgave me. But I can't live with the pain and the shame. I did a horrible thing, and it's more than worth ending it for.
