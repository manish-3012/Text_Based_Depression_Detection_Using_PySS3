How can one beat a spinal injury?I have always been mentallys trong, nothing fazed me, always successful...then my spine snapped and I'm half handicapped now, can't do anything much but feel pain and regret.

You cannot beat something like that I am powerless, the only thing I could do to overpower it is to take my own life.
