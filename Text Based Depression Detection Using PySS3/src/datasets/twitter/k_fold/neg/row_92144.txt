I am an embarrassmentChances are I am going to be kicked out one of the world's top 10 universities. I already took a year off to get medical attention for my severe sleep problems and chronic headaches, but I couldn't find a solution. I am on benzodiazepinas and they have no effect. I just feel like a useless parasite in a foreign country.
