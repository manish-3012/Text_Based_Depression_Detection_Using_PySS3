Venting: Why do i feel like i've been lied to?So listen up. I was the guy who had a friend with tendencies of him killing himself. I'm uncertain how he feels like now, he's talking normally now, so at least that thing ended somewhat. HOWEVER my family has been not in the best mood for couple of months. See, both of my grandmas have a serious health issue. One of them having alzheimers, and the other seriously struck by a stroke 2 years ago, can't move or talk the same since then. I found out some shocking (to me) informations. My dad didn't talkto her mom for over years, he still refuses to talk about their "bad blood" from those times. Turns out, her fucking fake husband used to beat the shit out of her and was drinking all the time before she had the stroke. But my dad was angry at her too for some reason, so i had to figure out what happened and why. Also, my parents are christians too. My dad had a confession of taking a lot of drugs back then, even until his early christian days. But clues of drug paraphernalia and even finding a box of weed makes me think that never really ended. They still talk about how weed can be helpful and shit, but seems off now that they are christians. But whatever. Thing is, i feel like my family lies an awful lot, expects an awful lot out of me, and judge me for the smallest things. Like what the fuck did i do? they even shout at me if i didn't brush my teeth yet like it's a crime or smth. Mom is always harshly critizizing me too, but when i tell her, she just says oh it was a joke. Yeah right. I had a lot of nightmares too recently. The fact of my 2 grandmas in critical condition, weird conspiracies, overall bad mood from online school, and random weird shit makes me cry like almost everyday. It's ok, call me a crybaby. I'm slowly losing it. I even took some xans to make at least fall asleep. Life has been shit in 2020, but at least i was happy around my birthday. I'm open to converse with people in the comments.
