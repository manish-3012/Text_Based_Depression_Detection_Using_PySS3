Idk what to do anymoreI'm just so tired of feeling this way. I've been unhappy with myself for a long time now but recently it has just gotten worse. I think the only reason I hadn't killed myself yet is because I know my mom would be upset. 

I've been depressed for a while but recently me and my boyfriend of 2.5 years broke up and my grandpa passed away all in 48 hours. It all just kind of sent me over the edge. I feel absolutely worthless. And I know I bother my friends with my constant sadness.  I'm just rambling on right now but idk what to do. I'm so done. I hate myself so much.
