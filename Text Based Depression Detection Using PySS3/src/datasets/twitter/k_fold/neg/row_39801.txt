A lifetime of pain, I'm ready to get REAL help. New England, PLEASE help. I've struggled with depression ever since I can remember.  During high school, I was committed to a youth psychiatric ward on several occasions. A couple times my father (a doctor) convinced the psychiatrist on duty at the hospital not to have me committed. During college I drank and I did just about any drug I could find, just to feel myself float away.  
Now I'm sobering up, and I feel like I'm in high school again.  I feel like I'm losing my mind, I HATE MYSELF (for reasons I can't even put into words), I just want to die. I know it's a bitch way out and I won't do it, but the impulse, the strange fury in my chest, is still there.  I don't feel safe.  The switch flips without warning. one moment I'm fine, happy even, the next I've completely lost it.  
I see a therapist and I'm on Effexor and Lithium Carbonate, but I don't feel like I have any coping skills. I've tried DBT (due to my family dynamic, several therapists have told me I have borderline personality disorder), but I need something else. 
I was thinking of having myself committed for observation.  But I'm not from the area and don't know where I should go.  I don't want to be shut in a room and ignored, that'd be a waste of time. And when I was in high school, I feel that my problems were overlooked because they didn't seem as serious as those of the other kids in the ward. Also, in high school, my goal was not to get better, but to get released before any of the kids at school noticed I was gone. 
I live in Boston would really appreciate any information on treatment centers in New England. (I AM WILLING TO TRAVEL)
I'm done feeling like this, and I finally feel ready to buck up and do something about it. 
Thanks!
