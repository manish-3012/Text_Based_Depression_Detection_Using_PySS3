Ive never put so much thought into killing myself beforeIve attempted before, but right now ive been planning my suicide so much, finding the perfect spot, thinking about who I want to send letters to, and what I would say (I havent written any yet). Planning what I want to leave behind and things like that. I dont have a date yet, I just want everything planned perfectly so that when im ready I can just end it
