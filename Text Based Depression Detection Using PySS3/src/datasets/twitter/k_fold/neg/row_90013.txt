An interesting titleThis fucking sucks, I don't want to die, I truly don't. But, this world and environment is toxic and inhumane. Good people get put in situations that they don't deserve, and bad people get to live and love. If anyone that knows me sees this, congratulations, you were a dick to me, but I don't blame you, I love everything with a soul. I suggest everyone else do the same.
