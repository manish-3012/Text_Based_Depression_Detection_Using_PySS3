This is it, I guess.Does anyone else feel like every hour feels like 5 days? Does anyone else feel like youâ€™re just slowly rotting from the inside out because all youâ€™re doing is the same thing day in day out waiting for the inevitable time where you end it for good?

I think this is it. I think this is going to be my last week. I would say Iâ€™m going to make the most of it, but I donâ€™t have the energy to. I donâ€™t even have the energy to hang myself lmao. 

I got a referral through - in a week. Thatâ€™s it, thatâ€™s the sign I needed. Itâ€™s my fault cause I didnâ€™t answer when they called yesterday, so theyâ€™ve had to book it in for a week.

But the way I see it - thatâ€™s the sign that I needed. I needed to know that itâ€™s my fault, that itâ€™s not worth waiting for. That itâ€™s not urgent anymore and that Iâ€™ll soon be part of a statistic. But thatâ€™s ok, I just needed it.

Iâ€™m going to spend a nice day with my siblings and my other half, make it a good one.

Good luck guys.
