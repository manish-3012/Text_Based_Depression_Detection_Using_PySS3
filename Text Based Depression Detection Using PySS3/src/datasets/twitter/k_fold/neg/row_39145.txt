I'm privileged as fuck and still want to die every dayI don't want to outlive my mother. I'm 24 and every year I get older all I can think about is the inevitable decay. I don't want to outlive anyone as in the youngest in my family. I don't have any reason to be depressed, just got a job that pays well, wonderful family, living with a family member who helped me after graduating college, and here I am. Fuck anyone who ever destroyed my mind about getting older. Stop telling people youth is wasted on the young. Stop telling people time goes faster when you're getting older. Every day of my life I've been in constant anxiety about the passage of time. And ask I can think about when I think about getting older is my family dying off one by one. I recently became an atheist and I truly cannot handle the thought of death being the end but it's the only think I believe anymore. My mom deserves a heaven and a place to be rewarded for all the shit she's been through and I don't think she ever will. And I can't live with that
