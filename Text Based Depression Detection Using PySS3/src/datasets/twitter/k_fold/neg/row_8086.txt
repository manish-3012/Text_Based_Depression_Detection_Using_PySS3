Everything hurtsIm probably not as suicidal like many other poor souls here. But being alive hurts too much for me to take much longer.

I constantly struggle with my family relations which at this point is practically non existent since i got kicked out. My father died of cancer last year, and my mother and I dont get along.

I loved my ex with all my heart but she hurt me so much that the pain is still here 10 months later and I still have trouble trusting people. 

Even though i fell in love with someone else I was afraid she would leave me too, which probably will happen tomorrow. 

My refuge has been weed, and alot of it... like 5g a week. Only then I feel happy and my life and work is just to get to that point of the week when I can smoke again. My studies are going down the drain which is one reason my mom hates me since i got a 130+ IQ. 

But im so tired, and it hurts so much. Everyday I walk with a huge burden on my chest, nausea and my heart can't stop bleeding. I dont want to go on anymore.
