I'm sorry I even let you down ....I'm sorry sister....I couldn't be here with you...
I'm sorry I'm such a fucking dirtbag....I'm sorry I let you down I couldn't make you proud of me
I'm sorry I failed you...I couldn't be the positive reliable stable person you wanted me to be....I'm so fucking sorry for every bad word I said toward you
You saved me a lot of times and I think about the good times we had together....it makes me cry to see you care for me....did I deserve it?
I know you'll miss me a lot
I know I might fuck up your entire life ...I'm sorry
I'm just wasting away....like a rotting meat...
I'm so fucking sorry I never tried to do something for you
Or work hard for you
I am never a hard worker to begin with
I'm just a lazy depressed asshole who really is addicted to some shit and mentally damaged...
You always love living ...you always never give up
But I know deep down you too are sensitive just like me
I'm afraid I might put too much pressure on your shoulders you might not bear it anymore
I'm afraid you might follow my dark path 
I'm afraid I might be responsible for hurting you....I can't bear it...please forgive me....
