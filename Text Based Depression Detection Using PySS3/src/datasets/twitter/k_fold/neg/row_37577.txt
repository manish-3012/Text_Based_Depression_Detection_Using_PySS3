I just don't have any hope anymoreOk so like this is going to sound dumb.
I've had a shitty life (ain't we all?) so I get fixated on relationships. And the relationships I've had have been awful. Like, abusive or the other guy's been a drug addict (not judging, but equally not healthy) or like whatever.
Generally speaking if I like a man, it ends bad. The only time I was in love - and I remember this vividly - he cringed away from me when I told him I loved him. I never slept with him because he had a boyfriend and that was wrong. But the emotional stuff was worse.
I could type at length at the many "false starts" I've had since then. But this was a guy who called me handsome and kissed me on the cheek. I literally - literally - can't remember when a man was nice to me like that. He just... well, I don't know. For once I thought it was a man who didn't want to just use me, fuck me whatever. Like I got kissed on the cheek. I've never had that; a man has never kissed me without like trying to put something in me.
I really thought there was something there. But he just wants to be friends. And that's ok, like I'm not mad or anything - that's his prerogative. But I feel so lonely and for the first time in a long time I want to kill myself.
