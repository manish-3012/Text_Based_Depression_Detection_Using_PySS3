Struggling with suicidal thoughts due to lack of attractiveness, and loneliness.Hello. I am a young American caucasian male. I have been wanting to get into dating again. Have had two relation ships, none of which worked out.) I am not a virgin, but hardly have sex. I am afraid I will end up alone , because I have a slightly below average penis (5.5 Inch's in length erect, have not measured girth I suspect it's thin though. ) I am also of a bad height 5'8. I don't know how attractive my face is. I know personality matters, but If I don't have good looks I can't even get in the door. I don't want to die alone, only for someone to find my body because of an unpaid bill. The only reason I don't commit suicide is because of friends, family, and some goals I have not achieved. I don't feel like a man, and know I will be tired of living once my goals are achieved.  I want to have a reason to live, or some kind of way to assure I will not die alone, or that I am wrong about being un dateable. I don't hate women, and realize that just because they are not attracted to me, does not mean they hate me. Attraction is not a choice, and if they don't reciprocate my feelings it's pointless. Still I am afraid of ending up completely alone due to forces outside anyone's control. My current plan is to live for the sake of family, friends, and goals. Once I accomplish all my goals, and if my one friend commits suicide, I might due so to
; however, I plan to live for at least 4 more decades.
