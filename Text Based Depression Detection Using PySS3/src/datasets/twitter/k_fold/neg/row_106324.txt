I am so tired.Exhausted from trying to be happy, to be enough. I canâ€™t remember a time when Iâ€™ve been happy or felt that I was worth anything. Every year on my birthday itâ€™s a complete shock to me that I havenâ€™t successfully killed myself yet. Iâ€™m not smart, funny, pretty or anything that people want around. Iâ€™m the pity friend. Iâ€™ve never been anyoneâ€™s first choice, not even my parents. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore. I donâ€™t want to be here. I just want to give up and go to sleep forever because it just seems so much better than being worthless.
