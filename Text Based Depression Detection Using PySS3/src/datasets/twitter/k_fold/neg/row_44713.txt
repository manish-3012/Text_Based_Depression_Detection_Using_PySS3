Title.17 Spanish here.
I want to kill myself but I can't. Everyday I always find a reminder of how useless I am, I can't even do the simplest tasks, I always find a way to screw it up...
I feel like I'm just waiting to have nothing left to end it all. I will start college this fall, and will fail of it because there's no way for me to pass any of the exams. No one gives a fuck about me, except one person, but what's that anyways? I know she will kill herself too, I know her stuff, I tried everything to change her mind without success, without any change, I guess I can't do anything good... Who cares anyways? Everyone I love either suicides or disappears, it happened before, and it will happen again. I guess I got used to it, but this makes me feel guilty if I ever tried something, I mean she's unstable and that would only add pain (I think). Family? I have, but after a week or two, my disappearance would only do good, they just love me for being family, If they met me in other way, they would all hate me, and I don't blame them, since I HATE myself too.
I can't even sh properly, I'm kind of scared for blades so I just punch the walls but it makes a lot of sound so I can only do it alone, something that rarely happens...
Won't continue because no one would read this anyways, like, why giving a fuck anyways? If you did, ig I'm pleased you did, won't add all my stuff because it even hurts me to write it. Idk why I am even writing this xd
