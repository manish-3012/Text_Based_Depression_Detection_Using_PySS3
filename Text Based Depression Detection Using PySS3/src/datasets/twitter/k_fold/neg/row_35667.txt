Why canâ€™t I have any stability in my life? It makes me want to end my life.I donâ€™t get it. I feel good one day and shit the next. Then good, then shit, then good, then shit and the cycle continues.

I just want fucking stability. I want to feel good. I donâ€™t wanna overthink.

Iâ€™m tired of having friends and thinking if they hate me or if Iâ€™m annoying. This is what causes most of my instability. I just fucking hate it. 

It makes me want to not have friends. I just want to fucking die man. 

Iâ€™m tired of texting this girl and thinking she hates me. Why canâ€™t I just not give a shit. Why do I have to fucking care?

Iâ€™m so tired of this. Iâ€™m so close to just ending it. I donâ€™t see the point of all this bs anymore. Why canâ€™t I just either have stability or just die. What do fuck do I have to do to just be stable?
