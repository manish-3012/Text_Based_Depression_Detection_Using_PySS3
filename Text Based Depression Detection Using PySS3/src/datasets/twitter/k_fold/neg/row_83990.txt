I want to fuck right off this mortal coil, but something is holding me back. I need to find what it is and eliminate it.I have been living with crushing depression interspersed with short bursts of mania (on average there was probably a 1/3 duty cycle between mania and depression respectively) since I was about 6 or 7. This is making my life a living hell because I can't bring myself to do any of the things necessary to fix myself or my situation. I wouldn't know where to even start and at this point it's far less effort to just off myself and be done with it.
