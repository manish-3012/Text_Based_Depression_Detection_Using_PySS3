This wasn't supposed to happenNone of it.
I was supposed to be a righteous G-d-lover, but I m shredded and barely believe in anything anymore.....

I was supposed to be headed for heaven, but I believe I m going to hell becos this life feels like hell.....

I was supposed to b smart &amp; work toward some kind of professorship, instead I've been passive-aggressively trying to end it by partying my time away for 6 years, little to show for those 6 yrs. B.A. in Art.....

I was supposed to be married, which I did to get away from the uncertainties my family likes to cultivate, but I ditched my husb after 6.5 yrs for a fling.....

I was supposed to be healthy, but I've got type 1 diabetes from age 15 &amp; a nicoteine habit the past 5 yrs. More passive-aggressive dethwish.....

I was supposed to be a woman, but I struggle with transgendered feelings. I don't want to be a man, I hate men's fashion, but my life is a physical hell because I do seem to automatically expect to be treated male.....

I was supposed to be a victor, an overcomer, that is what my stepdad told me, but he also ate my whole freedom up from a young age by demanding I have a job (for him) from age 10.....

I feel like whatever I do, I always quit, whatever good momentum I work up in my new life learning graphic design, I always end up sleeping two days in a row away out of sheer depression.....

I was supposed to accomplish something somehow, instead I feel like if I continue forward by transitioning that I will be a sellout to the gender that I resent for taking my freedoms, and if I continue on as a woman I will become more and more isolated by my depression until I have no choice but to mercifully end my own suffering. 

Anyone been there?
