I donâ€™t know. Thereâ€™s nothingFuck. Iâ€™m all alone.  No one will ever love me. I have no support. 

I swear to god if one more fucking person tells me Iâ€™ll find someone, Iâ€™m going to implode. No one knows what itâ€™s like being alone. Not really. Everyone who says that â€œIâ€™ll find someoneâ€ has never been single for more than a Few weeks. Until they decide they want to get into the pool again. Iâ€™ve been single my entire life. Iâ€™m not even allowed in the pool. Everyone goes for my friends. Hell I donâ€™t even have friends anymore more and my family hates me.  I hate Christmas. Everyone has someone that loves them. Their friends,family, SO. And every year, despite my best efforts, I get shooed away, laughed off, etc. I canâ€™t blame them that do it. It still takes it tole. Iâ€™ve got nothing else to give. Iâ€™m out of gas and my legs are broken. Iâ€™ve got nothing to live for. If Iâ€™m lucky, I wonâ€™t wake up. They wonâ€™t even know my name.
