MiserableReddit is lowkey where I dump all my depressing thoughts. I don't know if this is getting my stress our or making me think more about it. But I don't think people like me when I rant because I have a lot of anxiety. I don't even want to bring up my misery to my friends or family. There's not a day where I don't have shitty thoughts about ending my life. Not that I actually want to do it but always on the back of my mind. There are times I feel happy but just like now I can't sleep bc of my depression. Like its freaking 1 am rn but I'm like suicidal thoughts. Idk but I really hope that I feel better in the future. Like I'm just depending on my happiness in the future. What if I can't be happy in the future? What's left of me?
