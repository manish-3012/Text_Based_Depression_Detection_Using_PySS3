Iâ€™m on the edgeIâ€™m really starting to get serious about it. I have a plan. I was fine just last week and then all of a sudden everything rapidly deteriorated. Everything just got so much worse. Is God pushing me to do this? Is this meant to be? Is it destiny? I donâ€™t even care who I hurt anymore. Theyâ€™ll be fine without me. I just want to be gone.
