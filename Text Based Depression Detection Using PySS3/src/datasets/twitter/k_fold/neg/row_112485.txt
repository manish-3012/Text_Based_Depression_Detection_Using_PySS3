I honestly, can not wait till the day that I finally crash mentally and grab those razor blades in my cabinet and feel the sweet release of life finally.I just hate living every day. Putting on a fake face and doing daily routines just to try to blend in with the outside world all in the hopes of finally finding something that can bring me light in my dark world. But we all know that won't happen don't we. :'(
