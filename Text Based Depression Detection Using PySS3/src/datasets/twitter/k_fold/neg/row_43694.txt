I feel like im falling into a horrible mental state and dont know how to stop itLet me start with saying I HATE MY JOB.

Before Power, I was a confident, happy, social, recent college grad. In just 3 months after getting the job I feel like a shell of myself. I am always unhappy, all I want to do is sleep and call out of work. I am starting to shun my support system and literally everything feels overwhelming when before I felt as if I could conquer the world.

My self esteem has not been this low since middle school, I feel like I can do nothing right and honestly the idea of a car crash seems more and more appealing everyday. 

I try to stay positive and grateful, but the things I care about are starting to loose their importance. My concentration on anything sucks. 

fuck, I would quit this job if I had the energy to look for another one but in a fucked up way this job is also the only thing helping me stay a float.

I dont know why im here, but say whatever you think I need to hear. Or advise me. Or just read this and maybe feel better about your life.
