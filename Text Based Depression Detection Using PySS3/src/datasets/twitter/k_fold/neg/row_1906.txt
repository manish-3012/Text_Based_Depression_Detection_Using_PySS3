Feel like my education was a waste and I'll never amount to anythingFamily has always and still tells me to do work I'm passionate about and what makes me happy. I've always wanted to work in film/TV/video, but I majored in Visual Communications because "doesn't matter what degree you have, get any degree". I didn't want to go to a four year university but my parents gave the ultimatum of college or we kick you out of the house. I learned things like video broadcasting, photoshop, illustrator, graphic design, etc. Just had a job interview at my workplace that I've been at for 3 years as a Customer Service Assistant for a promotion to graphic artist. It didnt go well because they kept comparing me to the other applicants how they had a "graphic design" degree and I had a "visual communications" degree from a school out of state. Then after the interview I overheard the manager talking smack about my portfolio and I broke down into tears. I seriously wish I could juat stop existing. All I ever cared about was working in a creative field and no one seems to think I'm good enough for anything. My whole life has been focused on art because it's what I love doing, but now I have nothing else to fall back on and I just want to end my existance.
