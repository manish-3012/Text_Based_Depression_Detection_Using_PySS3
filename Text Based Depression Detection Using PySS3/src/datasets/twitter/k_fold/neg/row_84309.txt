Try and try and try to reach out just to get ghosted, try to see a therapist just to see a literal douchebag instead, family doesn't care about me...finally doing it Wednesday I can't continueYou can look at my post history. I've made so many posts. People say I can write to them. Then always I get ghosted. Either that or they say things that are infuriatingly unhelpful. I tried to see a therapist for help, went through emergency counseling, was put w a guy who was the douchiest piece of shit, I almost lunged at him during therapy. He actually quoted Maynard James Keenan from Tool, pretended the quote was his own, and then acted like he said something profound. And he told me that talk therapy won't help. He also cussed like it was nothing. I mean how trashy is that? And then I try to reach out to my family, nothing. Nothing nothing nothing from everywhere just silence and indifference. I don't feel like I have a choice anymore. I'm dying Wednesday. I have it all planned out. Fuck this life and fuck everyone everyone can go fuck themselves. I am so alone.
