Lost...Tbh, I'm not sure what I'm doing anymore.

I try so hard to be a good person, I am self aware and practice self improvement when it is brought to me.

I work my ass off to provide and maintain a high quality of life. I go above and beyond.

I keep being shown how undesirable I am. Why? What am I doing that is so upsetting? Why does it seem like people punish me for how they feel? How I make them feel.

Maybe I'm delusional. If the majority of people in my life act the same around me... It must be me. I must deserve everything I get. 

I'm just an asshole. I'm a white male who has no health issues and has everything handed to him. I'm narrow minded and selfish. I'm a cheap bastard who doesn't help people in need. I'm judgemental and jealous. I'm materialistic and I objectify people. The list goes on.

It's pretty clear I'm tolerated at best. I'm used when needed. I'm tossed aside when finished. I'm a dirty rag used to clean up a mess. I just want to be thrown out already.
