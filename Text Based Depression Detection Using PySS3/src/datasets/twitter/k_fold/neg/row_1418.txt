I want to cry so muchI told myself i would stop all of it, i would turn over a new leaf, and my cousin came in with some alcohol, i havent been sober in a week or so. ofcourse, i went the whole day without buying any alcohol, without tempting myself with anything else i was supposed to give up on, and he comes in with some for me, and wants to get a bottle for us this week. Ofcourse i took the little he gave me, and i stared at it and the tears started to come, and i smelled it and started laughing like a school girl and took a sip. I dont really have any friends to talk to about this. The one friend i talk to has me blocked so we only see each other once a week and talk/hangout. I feel so guilty, people care and i just waste my life. My other friend is slightly racist/toxic. I dont really go to him for much but he's been the only person im talking to. The guilt feels awful, before i didnt care what people thought because fuck em, now some of them are being so nice to me
