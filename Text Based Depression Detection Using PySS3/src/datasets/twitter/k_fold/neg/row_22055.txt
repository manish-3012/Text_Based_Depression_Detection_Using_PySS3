you know what's funnyI was in the hospital a week ago coz I had done something "stupid". My liver enzymes were abnormally high-- 9,000. The normal level would be around 50.

So, I ask the doctor all subtle if I was gonna die. like, for sure going to die.

he responds and says that that's what they're there for. to make sure I don't. so I probably wasn't going to.

and, that just made it hurt more. coz I wanted to die. I want to die. 

now here I am in bed, crying a few minutes ago and feeling bad coz every time I get like this which is several times a die, I end up pouring it all out on this one friend who shouldn't have to deal with this shit. I just got diagnosed with major depression and borderline personality disorder and everything's overwhelming and my fiancee a giant fucking asshole who doesn't care and blocked me. I don't know how to react around my father and brother who are happy I'm alive so I just end up acting as if I'm ok and as if nothing's bothering me. I'm worried I'm manipulating this one friend coz he does like me and I guess I do like him or I can see myself liking him in that way in the future if I make it to that point which I don't really anyway. I don't think I'll ever get better and I always feel bad coz everything's getting poured to him and it isn't right. if I bottle it up it'll end up just as bad and I do not feel comfortable at all telling other people coz I can't face to face and online, they can't even reply or reply right away which makes me feel worse but I don't want to bother them too coz they have no obligation to me and I'll just scare them away. 

I just want to die. I'm a bother and I can't function anymore anyway.
