29.12.2018I am a train headed for a wreck.
I need this rain to subside,if am to live
But all I see is darker clouds emerging from the horizon and water floods higher and higher,up my neck.
No sun in this weather,so no rainbow for me to take a final glimpse of,as I prepare to meet Hades.
Feet trapped in the mud below,can't even feel my toes.
The cloying smell of defeat in my nose
As I take my last breaths.
I'll soon be getting an earful of this drowning music that awaits me.
I wish it was ocean water instead-
I am a train headed for a wreck.
