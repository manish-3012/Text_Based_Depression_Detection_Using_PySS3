I'm sick and pathetic. Need an escape NOWI have a long and fucked up life story. I won't bore you with the facts but I need an escape from life. I don't care about anything anymore. I just need anything. Drugs, pills, self harm, alcohol... I fucking can't take it anymore I'm begging for release when can I just DIE ALREADY
