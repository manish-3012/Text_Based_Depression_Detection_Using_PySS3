Why should I not?Well I guess I don't really have to explain what my intentions are but I guess I can give you guys a background. I live in a perfect house with a perfect family, non- abusive parents, nice siblings, in the middle to higher class and go to a private Christian School. Yep, doesn't sound like I should be on here. So go ahead and Down vote me telling me that there are more suffering people on here and that I shouldn't even complain. I get it, it's happened before.  It's just that I'm not happy with my life. I know that I have a mental illness called sensory processing disorder -ya I know it's impossible to diagnose yourself-well that's exactly what my parents say and I'm just doing this for attention. I want to go get help and talk to a psychologist but I'm only 16, my parents have to get me one. I have no money to pay for one. They are never home and just once I would like to have a normal conversation before being interrupted by their work phone. I literally have no friends at school so I'm alone on this one, and to top it all off our school "winterball" is coming up and everyone around me is getting asked. Ive never had a boyfriensd or even a person attracted to my fat ugly face so I probably will be alone my entire life.Before you go off telling me it's just teenage girl hormones I've been alone since 3rd grade when my only friend left to find someone better. Well this is getting pretty long and probably half the people have stopped reading this rant. So I'm just going to stop. Thanks to anyone who read to the end, I guess I just needed to get this out, it didn't really help though....

edit: thank you guys so much I never thought anyone would respond to this. I feel so much better and even though I'm not the most popular girl in school I really don't care anymore (besides they are really annoying anyway). So you guys are amazing and I finally got through to my mom and we are trying to find a good counselor for me. Again, thank you.
