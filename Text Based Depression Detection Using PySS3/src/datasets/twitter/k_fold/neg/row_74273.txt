Feel like I'm going crazyI'm trying to talk to anyone, no one responds. I just want to be liked, to not feel lonely for once. It's not worth it anymore. I'm better off dead. I've been there for some of my friends every step of the way. Now they're just ignoring me. I hope someone can convince me why I shouldnt stop. Life is not worth all alone
