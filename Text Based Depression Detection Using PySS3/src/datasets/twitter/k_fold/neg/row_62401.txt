Being the complete failure that I am, should I just end it all?Let me just start by saying that I am a complete failure in that I am not good at anything at all. I have no talent no skill no nothing.

I thought I could be a computer programmer but I completely failed at that for about 3-4 years straight now and then I moved onto studying foreign languages and again I completely failed at that too just like everything else.

I don't have any friends anymore they abandoned me some time ago which I am not really surprised at. I hate my job, I hate myself and all of my life.

I feel like theres nothing to get up for in the morning anymore and that I might aswell just end it. I have been on meds before and I have seen help but I found myself lying to people in order to cover up what a massive loser I am.

I also go from being okay for a while to suicidal level depression up and down like a rollercoaster making it difficult in many ways.

Should I just do it?
