I'm done with life. Going to kill myself tonight before my partner gets home.I'm 34, female. Been struggling with depression my entire life. Last year my mother died of cancer. My life fell apart after that. I was a grad student finishing my master's, I had a great partner, a great social circle; life was great. But then I got kicked out of school due to health related issues from depression. Now I'm losing my partner and I don't feel like my social circle gives a fuck about my current difficulties. To top it off, my father is disappointed in me because I got kicked out of school. I feel like I have no one to support me and no reason to live.

I've lost so much in my life. I'm so tired. I can't do this anymore. I just want to end it all. I could use words of encouragement and support right now. Pls no vapid stuff like "hugs" or "it well get better". That doesn't mean shit to me.

Thanks all.
