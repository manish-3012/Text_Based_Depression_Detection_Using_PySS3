I survivedThis isn't going to be long.  I want to be heard.
I survived slitting my wrists recently there is nothing easy of good about it.  Please,  if you are reading this GET HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT. It is painful and I can't move my right arm as much as I used to be able to. There is nothing "romantic, cool or trendy" PLEASE DONT DO ANYTHING BAD TO YOU.
