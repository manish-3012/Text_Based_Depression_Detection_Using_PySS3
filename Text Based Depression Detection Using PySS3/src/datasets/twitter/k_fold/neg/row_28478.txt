SuicideHello all,

I have been going through an incredibly difficult life patch, where I feel as though no one in my life values me. I feel as though my friendships are trivial, three ended in the last week, and that nothing I do is making sense. I'm lost. I feel unloved, unwanted, but deep down I feel as though I deserve it. I'm an angry person, I'm not kind, I bark at total strangers. I call my friends liars. I've pushed my family away. Why am I doing this? I'm in so much pain, but that doesn't negate my behavior. Anyways, I've always dealt with these issues and have pondered suicide but never went through with it (right now I'm not either), but my reasoning was never because I didn't want my family hurt or something like that. No, I don't want to kill myself because I'm afraid the people in my life will be shocked for a day or two, but then they'll really start to think that she deserved her pain. She brought this on herself. Does anyone else understand this feeling or have advice on how I can correct this. 

All help is appreciated in these trying times.
