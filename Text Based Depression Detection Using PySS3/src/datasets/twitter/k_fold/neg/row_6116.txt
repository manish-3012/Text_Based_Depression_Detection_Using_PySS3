being trans is too much for meI can't take this all the time. I'm constantly feeling like shit about the way I look, sound and act. I look like a fucking creep, and I'll never be a real girl. I'm just going to continue to be an unattractive dude for the rest of my whole life.  

And I can't go crying to my friends or family anymore. My family is openly opposed to me being transgender, and will just tell me that I have no reason to be depressed anyways. My friends are getting annoyed because I have to text them every night complaining about my situation.
  
And my fucking voice is so low that I can't even do some kind of falsetto or anything, much less a convincing female voice.  

I'm pretty sure that if I died, only a few friends and my siblings would be sad. It's hard to imagine anybody else caring. My friends have been the last thing keeping me alive, and I've been abusing the ability to text them whenever I feel shitty. I guess that just shows what a fucking worthless friend I am, huh.  

I hurt so bad every day, and I don't know what I'm going to do next. After school is out maybe I might kill myself so people aren't affected as much during the school year...
