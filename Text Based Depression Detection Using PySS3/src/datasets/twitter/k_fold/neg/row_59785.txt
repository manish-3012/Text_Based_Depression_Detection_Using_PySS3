The sun is beginning to peek through the clouds... Sorry for the long post.Hi.  Some of you know me here and some don't yet.  That's okay, I'm pretty active here and elsewhere on Reddit. Just looking for friends. :)

I've suffered from pretty severe depression and high anxiety for most of my life, with suicidal thoughts a regular occurrence.  I attempted suicide back in March when my employers threatened to fire me and then really lost my job in July.  I was unemployed for almost ten weeks before finding a new job.

Those ten weeks were absolute hell--I toyed with the idea of suicide every day, but could never quite work up the courage to attempt again...just in case I actually *succeeded*, ironically enough.  Two weeks ago, I actually bought a rope from Home Depot to fashion a noose to potentially hang myself.  It was a Plan B, as I saw it.

Then I walked into a telemarketing firm and was hired on the spot.  So I now have a steady job, 8-3pm, Monday through Friday.  Seven hours at nine dollars an hour, plus five dollars in cash for every sale (which I'm rather good at, I've discovered--$55 in my second week, in only four days from my first sale on Tuesday).  $1200 a month isn't too shabby at all, plus tips! :)

So, things aren't as dire as they were two weeks ago.  I was down to just over 5K in my bank account, dwindling fast and was getting more and more scared...  So that's going to slowly improve again.  I am now also seeing a therapist weekly (she even comes to my apartment!) and am very appreciative of that.  My family is supportive and trying their hardest to help me in any way they can to fight the depression and anxiety I have, so that's nice.

Thanks for reading.
