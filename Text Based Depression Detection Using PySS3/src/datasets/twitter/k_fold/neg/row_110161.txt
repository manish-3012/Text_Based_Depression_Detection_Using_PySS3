Yo... just another person wanting to end their life...Thinking of ending it... Ironically, the thing that really makes me want to end it the most is the thought that the people who know me would want me to kill myself. I'm a horrible person and I don't deserve to live. The world would be better off if I were dead.

I bet you, reading this, want me dead too. You're probably thinking "this guy seems like an asshole, good riddance." And if you are, eh, that's fair I deserve it. Time to do the only good thing ever in my life and finally stop wasting valuable resources...

Not sure why I am even posting this... sorry to bother you all..
