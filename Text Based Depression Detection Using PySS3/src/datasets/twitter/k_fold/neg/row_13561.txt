LocationI've never wanted to do it at my home because of my fear of traumatizing a family member. I always, and I mean always, said I would do it at some shitty motel.  Let the staff find me and just leave a good tip lol

However, now I'm scared. I feel sooo heavy. Like no matter what I do I'm going to get stuck...feeling like this. I just don't want to be alone. I want to be able to at least see them. I wouldn't call myself superstitious. Maybe it's the dehydration or the malnutrition, or just my heart giving up...but I just feel like I'm leaving a really hideous, disgusting stain kn my family. I feel like I'm just going to be a bad, hurtful memory that never goes away, and I don't want that for them. 

I had a thought about doing it in the garage. I wasn't sure if there were any exposed beams, so I got someone with the key to go in with me under false pretenses. I saw exposed beams. A few minutes later, after the first person left, I got another family member to give me their keys so that I  could "go get Halloween decorations" I just stared at them. Those keys were like a gateway to peace. 
My mom asked me to do something, I can't remember what, but it took long enough to distract me. At least for tonight? 
After finding those beams, it feels certain that's where I die. I just want to stay close to them.

I wish I could feel less pain. I wish I could keep living for them as I have the last decade.  I would never want any of them to feel what I am feeling now. I sincerely hope they understand.
