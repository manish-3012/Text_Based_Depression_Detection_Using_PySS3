Am I suicidal for not caring whether I live or die?Someone redirected me to this subreddit after my last post on NoStupidQuestions. I said in that post that I'm not depressed but I wouldn't mind dying any time. I wouldn't actively pursue that but I guess that makes me suicidal by reddit's guidelines. Do you guys think I need more help? Like is there something wrong with me
