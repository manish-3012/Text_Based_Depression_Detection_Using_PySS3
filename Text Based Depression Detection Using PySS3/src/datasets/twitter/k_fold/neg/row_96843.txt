Might as well just get it over with it...Due to this bullshit virus I've lost my job. The only thing that ever kept me going in life. Now all I do is have to fight my own brain 24/7 without any breaks and I am quite honestly fucking sick of it...

Life is shit, nothing will ever change that. So why bother. Might as well join the 27 club ðŸ‘Œ
