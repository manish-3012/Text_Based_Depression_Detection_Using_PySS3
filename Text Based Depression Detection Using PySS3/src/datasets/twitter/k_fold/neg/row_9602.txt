No idea wtf to do!I have every reason to at least try to keep living but I just dont want to. 

I have a great job, a wife, two beautiful children and somehow I still can't shake the feeling that I dont belong here, that I dont matter, that death would be so much more easier than the mundane bullshit of living. I love my family but I think they deserve better than me. I would end it all but i can't do that to my girls, I can't let them grow with that hurt. I just needed to write something.
