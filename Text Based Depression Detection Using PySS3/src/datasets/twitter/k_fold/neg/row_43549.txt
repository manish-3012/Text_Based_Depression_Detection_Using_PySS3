Help me narrow down a reason to live?Hi, I am:

Canadian, a 24 year old male.

Working full time + occasional overtime in a skilled position, for $17/hour.

Owner of a car.

Barely affording to live in my parent's basement (rent is $400/month). My expenses outweigh my income. I will never live on my own, never retire, and never be able to support a family.

I hate my parents. I love my younger brother but my parents are censoring what I can talk with him about so our relationship is slowly deteriorating. 

I play drums in a band, we are going into the studio to record our debut album this fall.

Problem is my financial situation has gotten to a point where I'm sliding down the slippery slope into debt simply buying drum sticks each month, and forget about buying any new cymbals or hardware when I need it. 

I feel like I spend all of my time at work, I can't practice drumming nearly enough and when I can I don't have the energy because I've been working all day.

In my time on Earth, I've been used for my body and my labour. I feel as though I'm not allowed to grow and use my mind as a male human, or at the very least that it's extremely frowned upon.

I feel like I have nothing to contribute to this place, on a good day I just go about my work and pray for nukes to fall from the sky.

Why should I stay alive?
