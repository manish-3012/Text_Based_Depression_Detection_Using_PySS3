Just done with everythingTW for brief mentions of sexual and physical abuse.

Every time I think I'm turning a corner and getting my life on track something comes along to set me back again. Every time I think I've got a plan or I'm going to be okay the world just sort of proves it doesn't care. 

I've grown up in an abusive household. I got away for a few years but I've ended up back in the same place. I ended up in some damaging relationships. I feel like I always end up attracting trouble. I'm starting to wonder if it's just my fault or if I'm just the type of person who attracts bad luck or if it's just something I'm doing wrong. 

I just keep wishing I could go back in time and make better choices and undo some of the stuff that happened to me because I think there are some traumas I'll never recover from. I was involved with mental health services for a few years as a teenager. I tried to get some more help now as an adult but they told me they can't help me with sexual abuse trauma - they told me to go speak to a charity that deals with that. The charity hasn't called me back. I chased that up a few weeks ago. It's been about six months since I made the first call. I emailed too. Heard nothing back. Mental health services say they won't engage with me until I've got therapy for trauma from this charity. So I'm stuck. 

I'm just so unhappy and I'm back in a place I was in when I was a child. I always thought by my 20s I'd be living along and away from abuse and I'd be happy but I'm just not. I'm ridiculously sensitive to everything at the moment and I just wish I was dead. I've made attempts before and I've been thinking about it more and more. I'm just numb to it all now and I have this weight in my chest that won't go away. It's like I've been carrying this around with me all my life and now it's just too heavy.
