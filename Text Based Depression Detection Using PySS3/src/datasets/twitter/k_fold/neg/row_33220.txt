No Job. No Friends and my SO is depressed.I have been dealing with this for quite sometime, and it was a little better before my SO started dealing with this. He has begun to shut me off, and if I ask for love or care, he shames me by saying that I am asking for too much and he cannot provide anything, which I understand but it hurts.

I have had three anxiety attacks in the past two days and I cannot take another right now. I am crying while typing this and also ideating suicide. My ex treated me the same way and my SO knows how traumatizing this is for me. I wish the earth would just swallow me whole right now and I have an intense pain in my chest.
