I fell like a waste.A waste of time, waste of money, waste of energy. I don't have dreams, places that i wish to go, nothing. I fell like a pain for my friends and family, and feel like the life of EVERYONE will be infinitely better without me. Recently, i started thinking about suicide again, and...idk...i wanna do it, but if don't work, everything will be...worse i guess....
