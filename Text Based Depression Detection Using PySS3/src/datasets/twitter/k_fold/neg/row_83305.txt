I'm tired...Think I'm tired of being alone, of being alive, idk, I just lately felt so depressed and I have been thinking about to "do it" but I'm a coward, I can't, think that I just need someone by my side, a friend, anybody, I always end up alone, I'm tired of everything, I'm so stressed, I don't even know what the hell I'm supposed to do with my life...
