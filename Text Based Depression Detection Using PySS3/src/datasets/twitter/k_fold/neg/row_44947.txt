Binge Drinking, and Dont want to get out of bedI'm writing this from my bed, i faked sick from work yesterday and today and have just been laying here drinking sleeping drinking sleeping, i just feel like life is meaningless, why do i keep trying to provide for myself, i feel like im missing something, i dont believe in god, but i believe in good. and i just feel like im the only one of the people in my life who understands what it is to not judge and be patient about small things that dont matter, but my patience is running thin, and no one seems to notice that ive been struggling. i dont know how many people will see this, i just need someone to tell me something nice. i just want to know that people aren't as judgmental as the people are around me. im tired of feeling this way, im so tired of feeling this way. i hope someone sees this that feels how i feel. some hope would do me good.

im 21, male, in az
