How do I ask for help?My Mom lost two brothers to suicide well before I was born. Suicide has always been a tough topic of conversation in my family, because their deaths devastated her beyond explanation. I've been struggling with chronic depression for the past three years, and I recently attempted suicide, but wasn't able to follow through with it because of her. If my mom had never told me about her brothers and the way their deaths crushed her, I probably wouldn't be here typing this. That said, I have no clue how to bring up my struggles with my parents. I want to talk to them, because having my parents supporting me through this time would help a lot. I just don't know how to. I know she's going to cry; I know they'll worry about me a lot more when I'm away from home at college and work. I worry that me telling them, instead of never mentioning this, will make their lives rough, put stress on their marriage, etc. I can't count the number of sacrifices they've made for me over the years, and I'm sure there are many that they never mentioned. Every time I've ever talked with them about emotional discussions, I end up getting really emotional. I'm really bad at talking about sensitive things because of that. I don't think I'd be able to get everything across in words, so I was thinking about writing a letter, and making sure that I'm here when they read it. I just don't know what to do.
