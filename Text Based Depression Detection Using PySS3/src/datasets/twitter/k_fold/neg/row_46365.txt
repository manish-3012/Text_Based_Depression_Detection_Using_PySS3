If I was never born everything in the world will be a A-OKI wish I was never born so everyone could grow old and be humble and not have to worry about climate change and upcoming War. Absolutely everything would be sunshine and rainbows if I never existed, and also, no one would have anything to worry about. There would be absolutely no pain and no suffering if my parents just decided not to have kids.
