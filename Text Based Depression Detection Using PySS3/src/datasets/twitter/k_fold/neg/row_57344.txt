how can I go on like this?At the start of the year I had to finally admit that my depressive state and anxiety got the better of me and basically had to quit my job and move back home. In addition I was really unhappy with my current career and wanted a change anyway. I'm now in therapy for the last three months and it definitely helped in getting some perspective on things but also unearthed so much that I had repressed for the most part during the last years. The biggest thing is that I'm a 28 year old friendless virgin loser who never experienced anything and probably never will. I never managed to make new friends during college and was totally isolated at my first job at the other end of the country. In the last few weeks that thought won't leave my head and it kinda physically hurts to think that I will never experience a warm body laying next to me in bed, sharing experiences and thoughts. What makes it even worse is the fact that I met this girl at the only social outlet I have (sport meetup). Talking to girls or people in general was never my problem but anything beyond this seems impossbile for me. I feel like the donkey chasing the carrot. 
I just want what normal people have. Friends, relationships. Profound human interaction. I just feel like I wasted my whole life and I can never make up for what I missed.

How can I be okay with this missing in my life which seems such a basic human need ? I don't know that I can... Not any longer. Right now it physically hurts, so much that I don't know how long I can endure this.
