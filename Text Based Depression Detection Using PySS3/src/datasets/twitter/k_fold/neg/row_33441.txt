I too wasted all of my 20â€™sI should have either let loose and have wild fun or really hunker down and study to accomplish something. Iâ€™ve done neither, and seeing people who have done at least one of the two, god forbid both, crushes me because it reminds me of how much Iâ€™ve missed out on. I just feel like my life was lived in waste and donâ€™t want to keep going because I havenâ€™t enjoyed a single second of it and probably wonâ€™t in the future, because my life is just filled with envy and regret everywhere I look.
