Still aliveThree days ago, I would have taken the great jump.
Nothing was keeping me alive.
When I have those suicidal tendencies, important things fade away gradually.
Goals/dreams, passions, studies, work, family/friends.
Slowly, through the years, goals and dreams went away, studies... work...

And three days ago, not even my close ones were a reason to keep me alive.
Why stay alive, when anyways... after a couple of months of crying, I would be lost and forgotten again? 
Iâ€™m just another human being...

Why keep on living, when all I go through is suffering? Why not take a look at the void? Contemplate it? Taste it?

Thatâ€™s what I was thinking, looking at the ceiling from my bathroom floor. 
I felt numb. 
I have been feeling numb for days. But this time, it was different.
I didnâ€™t care anymore.
Nothing mattered to me anymore. 
My parents were gone on a vacation, I wasnâ€™t seeing my friends since a certain time, now. My best friend would text me everyday, but... 
...I just wanted to matter to someone.
I was ready to kill myself. 

But I didnâ€™t. I cried, instead. For what felt like hours. I was in so much pain, I didnâ€™t stop. I couldnâ€™t stop.
I havenâ€™t cried this much in a long time.
The pain was unbearable...
I prayed for the first time in forever to any God out there that would just stop this pain. And then, I took a bath, and fell asleep.
Almost as if I came out like a new person, I woke up and felt... okay. And... slowly, my brain has been restructuring itself and gave me new feelings, a new breath of life. 
Iâ€™m not saying I am healed. Iâ€™m going to be careful with this, but it feels a bit better. 
Hold on, anyone reading this. You can do this.
