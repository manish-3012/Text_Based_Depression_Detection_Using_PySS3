I'm gonna go visit my mom one last time and then I think I'll end it.It's my senior year of high school and I was going to go see my mom over spring break before I die. I've been working so hard my whole life to make something of myself but I'm slowly coming to the realization that I have no future beyond high school. I got into some colleges but they're all so expensive and with my mental state I fear I'll just end up dropping out. 

I leave to go visit my mom in a few days and when I come back I think I'm gonna do it. Living has become a chore and I can't recall a single day where I haven't thought about dying. I can't keep going on like this. I don't know why I'm posting this. I just feel very alone. 


Edit: thanks for all the support everyone, I'm still really unsure of the future but your responses have made me at least want to consider the options I do have. I never even considered that I don't have to go to college because the idea has been pounded into my head for so long. I have a lot to think about. I'll be talking with my mom over spring break and I guess I'll be keeping you all posted as time progresses. &lt;3
