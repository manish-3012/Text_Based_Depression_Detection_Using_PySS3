I'm signing off. goodbye reddit, everyone who read my stories, thanks for the good times.I'm past the breaking point. PTSD from the war and incredible loneliness have broken me. I know i write funny things on this website but I'm just a man with a lot of scar tissue and no friends left to comfort him. goodbye everyone! thanks for the laughs. I'm afraid of dying but i'm much more afraid of living- time to leave. life was beautiful once.
