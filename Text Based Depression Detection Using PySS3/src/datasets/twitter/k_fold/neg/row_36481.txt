i can't deal with not being allowed my own existencei'm tired, i'm drained. i'm just here to be hated, just because i'm being myself. i'm non-binary, which means i don't deserve the most basic respect. i don't deserve to exist. i'm erased. if i tell people to stop erasing me they insult me. according to them i'm just looking for attention even though for someone with social anxiety disorder attention isn't that nice but those people wouldn't know. i'm just trying to be special they say even though i'm just a normal goddamn person trying to live my life peacefully, but i don't deserve peace. i'm not allowed to be mad for constantly being erased, constantly misgendered. because then no one is gonna take me seriously right? i just have to swallow all the pain and dysphoria this causes me, bottle it up and finally break down alone in my room just so i don't burden anyone else with my pure existence. i deserve being willingly called something i'm not despite better knowledge, despite knowing the pain it causes a trans person. even if openly stated, people still willingly ignore my identity and try to push me into something because i cannot exist. i have to live with and ignore all the hate and transphobia against me, against us. and i need to shut the fuck up about it because we might actually make a cis person reflect on their bullshit. i can't deal with being silence. i can't deal with not being allowed to exist. all i wanted was to be treated like an actual human being, for once
