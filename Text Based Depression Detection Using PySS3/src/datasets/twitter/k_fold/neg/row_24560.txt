Thinking of ending it all. I'm in a hopeless situation.Simply put I'm in an impossible situation.  It's been going on for a year now.  We've been perennially short staffed at work and the answer has always been to pull me off my job to cover.  Every time I've voiced that I'm overworked I'm made to be out the bad guy.  Now they're trying to force me into an evening and weekend rotation and even graveyard, when I was hired I took a strictly day position.  I'm physically incapable of staying up that late.  And falling asleep on the job is a fireable offense.  Other people have the same concerns who are being forced into this.  

 My wife and I made major life decisions based on that and they don't seem to care that I'm incapable of working nights. I can't quit because we can't make it just on my wife's income.  So at this point what do I do?  At least without my bills my wife will be free to go on.  I won't have to deal with the stress of failing my family on the home front, or financially.  I won't have to work for a place that doesn't appreciate the job I do.  I'm trying to just have a stable situation for my family. I took a job based on that, and a new person in charge doesn't care or want to honor that.  I can't do this anymore and I'm close to ending it all Monday.  At least I won't be a burden anymore and won't have to meet insane demands.
