Information regarding nooses and the type of rope?Hey there folks. 30 year old sexless guy here. Or well, soon to be. I'm 28 but that doesn't really matter anymore.y depression stems from lack of any sexual contact. It's been 11 years since I last had sex and it's still a memory I remember. Faintly, but it's there. The last time I had sex I was in high school. My twenties have come and are now leaving. With them, no hugs, not a kiss, no sex, no skin to skin contact with women. I've tried. I dressed well, I took care of myself, worked out, tried approaching but women just never saw me as anything more than just a friend. I have plenty of friends who are women, unfortunatly none of them have found me appealing. That's my sob story but that's not why I'm here. 

I'd like to know the type of rope I should use for a typical hangmans knot. I'm 6'2" and weight 160lbs. I'm planning on buying the rope tommorow at lowes or Home Depot or just about any tool or construction store. I'm just curious what kind of type would be a best for me. I don't want to suffer through asphyxiation and would prefer to have it done quickly and painlessly. If anyone can give me some info on strength of rope along with length I would need along with some slack to give me a jolt upwards. I'd be greatly appreciative.
