I feel like Iâ€™ve already sabotaged my own dreams and thereâ€™s no point in living out the rest of my pathetic life.Hey there. Iâ€™m 22. Iâ€™m married. I have had depression and anxiety since I was 14. Every November it gets almost unbearable as itâ€™s the anniversary of my first suicide attempt when I was 15. Iâ€™ve let depression run my life and Iâ€™ve lived in fear. Iâ€™ve blown my aspirations and dreams (donâ€™t really want to go into specifics, but there isnâ€™t really anyway around it). I donâ€™t feel like there is any other reason left for me to be alive. Iâ€™m sick of playing the game and faking it. I literally hope I get killed in a car wreck every time I drive anywhere. The only reason I donâ€™t act on it is because I know my husband would blame himself and I love him way too much to leave him with that burden. My future is pretty much what I never wanted for myself. Iâ€™ve had counseling. Iâ€™ve been on meds. It all just makes me feel numb and dead. Sometimes I like the pain better.
