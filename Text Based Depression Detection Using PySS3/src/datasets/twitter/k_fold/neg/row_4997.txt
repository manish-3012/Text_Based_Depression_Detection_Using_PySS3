I can't do it anymore. I guess I'm just posting here so that at least someone in the world will notice when I'm gone.My reasons don't entirely matter to a stranger, but the condensed version goes

* Born fucked up to a fucked up family
* Fuck up everyone's life by being born
* Be physically and psychologically abused
* Be bullied though literally every school I've attended
* Change countries
* Internationally fuck up more lives and get bullied
* Still being abused
* Move out of home at 16
* Be bullied still, less abused, know stuff is wrong with me but not all of what
* Can't work or feel safe around people
* Be kicked out for being fucked up and not understanding (not wanting to socialise)
* Live in sharehouse, stop going to school
* Starve most nights because of anxiety and living with 7+ people at a time
* Realise I'm trans after considering the way I've felt since I was a kid
* Payments get cut off because of my absence from school
* Finally move out to new place with partner
* Goes ok
* Come out as trans
* Be diagnosed with autism
* Finally starting to understand who I am
* Go to online school
* Struggling because I can't stay focused
* Forget to eat or shower, can't make phone calls or leave house on my own
* Totally dependant on partner, who I love
* But he didn't believe me anymore
* And he wasn't attracted to me being trans
* And he was sick of taking care of me
* And started to psychologically abuse me again, much like parent life
* And make comments like "Stop crying, it doesn't fix anything" while going through the hardest time of my life and already suicidal
* Tell him to stop or leave
* He puts my stuff in different room
* He ignores me
* I'm alone
* Enter dissociative state (Which I'm still in)
* Attempt suicide
* He tries to stop me
* End up in hospital
* Feel trapped and scared (see: anxiety)
* Get out
* Nothing feels better
* He's shouting at me more
* He tells me he doesn't care if I starve
* Confirms we're no longer together
* Yells at me for being a problem
* Inspection coming up
* No energy (see: traumatic event and autism)
* Cleans own room regardless, nearly have a shutdown
* Get yelled at for not cleaning kitchen, when I had just fucking cleaned my own room all day
* Garbage angrily stacked up at my door
* Thinking about how I'm alone in the world and I have nothing left
* Won't even get any Christmas presents
* At least if I die I'm not wasting anyone's money, since nobody is getting me anything.


Anyway, life is shit, from beginning to end, but at the end realise that that "shit" was all I have and now I have nothing

No will to live

No desire to push through anymore

I quit.
