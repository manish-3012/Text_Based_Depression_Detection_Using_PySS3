I donâ€™t want to dieI just had an MRI that definitely destroyed my inner ears. A car sounds like a motor freeway. I was at a meeting today and had to leave because peopleâ€™s voices hurt my forehead. The MRI was a week ago, so there is still hope. Itâ€™s easy to say I want to kill my self, but itâ€™s really hard to do. I love so many family and friends. I want to see my children again. I am so sick.
