Too awkward and too tired to live anymore. Considering ending it all.Hello.
I'll try to share my life story (I'm 19 y/o now).
I've always been shy and awkward in my life. I've had a depression since I was 6 or 7 y/o. When I wasn't in school, I lied down on my bed or played stupid games on my PC. I'm from average family in a poor country. I thought that I'm sad because I didn't have money and girlfriend. So I thought that when I grow up I will make money and everything is gonna be ok. So I lived for the future. I didn't celebrated anything. Maybe the only positive thing I did was to study programming.
Now I'm in college 1st year. But I do nothing. I don't study anything. I'm still depressed. Before 1 month I decided that my problem was not having a girl in my life. So I tried something new. I had my first serious date and kiss with a girl just before 2-3 weeks... It was awkward most of the time but I gave everything I could and maybe succeeded. But it doesn't matter. I'm still depressed. I can barely go to the supermarket to buy something to eat. Most of the time I just browse the web about suicide information. This life is not for me. I can't do anything right. I'm too awkward to do any job, even programming. I actually have money at the moment, but I do nothing with them. Nothing makes me happy. I want everything to end now. If I had a shotgun I'd probably have killed myself hundred of times. Parties are not fun for me. Meetings with more than 2 people is also not fun for me. When I go out it's most of the times me and one other person.
When I was in 10th grade I started to fake confidence, thinking it would make me confident. Well it didn't help.
The question I have is can a usual plastic bag over head with alcohol or some sleeping pills do the job? Every other method seems too horrific to me. I share this because it makes me feel a little bit better, don't know why. And also for some advices about the plastic bag. Thank you.
