escape.my meds aren't working anymore

my health is in decline

i dont sleep. i eat very little.

i dont want to live in society.

i've trudged in and out of it

the pain and what i witnessed and learned

so early and the others that did not know

i hate that i see this cult when im out in the world

everywhere in plain sight
