Losing motivation.After 1 suicide attempt and three years of trying countless medecations and therapists, along with other types of therapies such as neurofeedback, I just canâ€™t keep trying anymore. Nothings changed and it just isnâ€™t worth it anymore. Why keep up the same amount of effort if itâ€™s only caused more harm than good. Plus, with my entire city in quarantine, that even slight glimmer of chance to improve is halted for what could be weeks to months to years. Iâ€™m like a pipe full of pressure with no release valve, and nothing brings enjoyment or release anymore. It just isnâ€™t worth it. Hope is fading faster than before.
