I donâ€™t know if this is suicidal but I want to run away to the woods with nothing and let nature take its courseI suppose I feel passively suicidal. I want to remove myself from society and from existence but Iâ€™m too scared to do it myself. 

I want to take couple of my belongings and walk to the nearest forest and just exist in nature until I run out of energy. 

Then that way the couple people that care about me donâ€™t have to find my body, I can just slip away.
