i want someone to know that iâ€™m not okay but iâ€™m too scared to say somethingi just got off the phone with my therapist, and i told her what was bothering me. i didnâ€™t tell her how awful i feel though and how iâ€™m not sure if i can even keep myself safe. i want so badly for someone to just know that iâ€™m not okay without me having to say it because the second i say something it becomes real and iâ€™m so scared of that. immediately after i hung up i broke down crying. i am so, so tired. i cant keep doing this
