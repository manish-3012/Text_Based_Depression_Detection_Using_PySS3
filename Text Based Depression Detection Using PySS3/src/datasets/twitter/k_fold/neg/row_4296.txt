No one cares Iâ€™ve realizedI have many reasons to kill myself. Trauma, abuse, mistakes, a lack of support and love. I just texted the girl I like that I wanted to kill myself and all she texted back was â€œdo you want to chat or text???â€ and is on twitter having fun with friends including friends that bullied me and started this nervous breakdown 2 years ago. I think Iâ€™ll finally do it tonight. Iâ€™ve posted that so many times now but tomorrow I really want to do it in the morning. Iâ€™m so tired. Iâ€™m going to die a girl who has never been kissed or loved and whoâ€™s sex experience has only been sexual abuse by a relative, never achieving my life long goals career wise, but you know I donâ€™t really care at this point? Iâ€™ll be dead. Dead people donâ€™t care about those things. I just wanted to post this to feel less alone right now.
