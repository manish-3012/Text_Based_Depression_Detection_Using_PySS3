Same Old Same OldF (21) Iâ€™m slowly losing my way. Iâ€™m 95% sure I live with narcissists. My friends NEVER let me express myself, I could be having a mental breakdown and no one in my life seems to care. I try to explain thereâ€™s something wrong Iâ€™m angry for no reason and I have built up rage and I donâ€™t know why. After explaining Iâ€™m either belittled, ignored, bullied, or told I need a kick in the ass. No one really treats me with care and compassion yet I do everyday. Every time I tell my friends about whatâ€™s going on just to vent Iâ€™m snapped at or told to move out of my house, I want to but I financially canâ€™t and Iâ€™ve been homeless before and crashed on couches and that was not fun. Iâ€™m trying not to go back down the path of alcohol and substance abuse but day by day it gets more difficult and with no family or friends to talk to Iâ€™m really thinking about giving up.
