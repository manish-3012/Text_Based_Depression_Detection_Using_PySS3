Depression has been hitting me so hard the past few days.For the past few days depression has hit me so hard all I done was sleep and cry. Today is another day of it hitting me so hard that it will be the same way. Where I will just sleep the rest of the day away and can't get out of bed. I got a dental appointment tomorrow but I will probably just end up not going because of depression. I really need to go because my tooth is hurting very badly but yet I am in this depressed funk that I can't shake. I tried a few days ago of walking last week and it felt great to walk but then over the weekend depression just hit me so hard.

I am so tired of living life and fighting every moment to breathe. today I am ending it. i can't take anymore
