UPDATE (ONE LAST TRY AT "HOPE" ....)I have come to the realization that I will just have to "stick it out" until I literally can't.  There's definitely no "easy way" out of this life: if you take your own life, either you'll be strangled, or torn/burned/dissolved apart, or decapitated in the most horrible way (and that's every known suicide method, in summary).  Why do all that, I decided, when I could be the only member of the "world's most exclusive club"?  I could even "fall in love" with that person I knew would reject me, if I wanted to -- and so can you (observing, instead, how beautiful they are, in themselves -- without being "attracted").  You may not see things this way, and that's fine too -- you have to be "you" and there is nothing wrong with you for "wanting out" (this place is, indeed, every horror you've seen on a daily basis since the very beginning) -- but there's a whole other facet to this dark, bland, colorless, world to explore, before finally "hanging it up."  Why not?  Yes, most people will "push you around" when they can, they will say nasty things about you, and so on and so forth, but they won't experience any of the good times you'll _still_ allow yourself to have, either (despite their criticisms -- even if you do "go off the deep end," sometimes).  People will, however, always be attracted to your kindness and good qualities, if you don't hide them -- that's what I've found anyways.  I've decided to try "living my life," once again, because I simply got tired of being "imprisoned" by fear and hopelessness.  This might all sound clichÃ©, but just see what happens when you try it ....
