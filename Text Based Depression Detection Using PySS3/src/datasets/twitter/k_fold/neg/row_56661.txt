i long for death, my life is ruined.I am ugly, poor, sheltered, boring and alone. Only thing i had going for me were my grades, it was the only thing that gave me hope, that made me think i could get away from this life. But i wasn't ready for engineering and i knew it.  
But my parents were sick of me and kicked me out, sent me to uni and forgot about me. I couldn't do it, failed all my exams. 4 years later and i'm barely halfway done with my studies, and i can't find the strenght to keep going. I'll never find a good job, i'll never find a girl, i'll never have a family, i'll always be ugly, poor, sheltered, boring and alone. Even if i'll graduate it will be years from now. It will be years before my first paycheck, years before my own car, years before i can get good clothes, a good body, but i can't wait, the loneliness is killing me now.
  
I really want to end it all right now
