[TW: Sexual harassment] My trauma becoming something iâ€™m intoMy grandfather touched my private parts and would often ask me to get naked for him when I was little. 

I was r*ped when I was 16 by my friend. 

I was sexually harassed by my ex at 19 when I was too drunk. 

I was groped and r*ped multiple times when I was a sex worker and before you even askâ€” I had to do it cause Iâ€™m from a 3rd world country and it was the easiest way to provide support for myself to get through college.  

Iâ€™ve been suicidal since because of these experiences and I wanna kill myself even more now when these eventually ended up turning me on. 

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m into hardcore, painful, and (seemingly) forced sex now. Iâ€™m extremely disgusted at myself. Itâ€™s ironic how I feel for it now after all the trauma. 

I donâ€™t understand myself and I want to die.
