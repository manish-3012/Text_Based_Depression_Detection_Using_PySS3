The littlest things are enough these daysSince Monday I've thought about ending my life at least twice, i went to the psych ward about 4 or 5 years ago when my father passed away (i was 13) and moms past 2 boyfriends have made life at home way more strict. And no matter how much I do right, i get told off for the smallest things. These in turn become huge fights between everyone and we go to bed mad. This ends up making me think about all the other bad things going on in my life


1. Aspurgers syndrome: lesser form of autism but i still get the same social stigma from peers. 
2.I'm that one kid that's even though I've gone to this school my entire life, I'm still yet to socialize and find my "clique"
3.Never been in a relationship, last time i felt love was 7th grade (currently a junior)
4. My only "friends" are a bunch of people i met online who run a server on a video game. And because I can only talk to them online, my moms boyfriend can cut me off from them by shutting off the internet access to my computer whenever he damn well pleases.
