I donâ€™t know how to keep goingI feel like some days are extremely easy, and then just for no reason I feel like absolute garbage and like thereâ€™s no hope for me. I donâ€™t see anything getting better for me. Iâ€™m not smart, Iâ€™m not exceptionally pretty, Iâ€™m not motivated. Iâ€™ve had these thoughts since I was 11 and itâ€™s never gotten better. Every time I think Iâ€™ve overcome this, it comes back and I feel like Iâ€™m drowning in these thoughts. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever be better. I donâ€™t have insurance for a therapist, every time Iâ€™ve tried to reach out to someone in my life Iâ€™m not taken seriously or Iâ€™m too afraid to be a burden on them. Thereâ€™s no one to help me. Iâ€™m alone. I wish I had the courage to just end this already
