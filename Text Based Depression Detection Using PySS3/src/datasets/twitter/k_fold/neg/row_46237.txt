I have a plan, I thinkI just realized that I have 3 months of painkillers at home that I never took because of the side effects. This should be enough, I hope. Or... i'm going to "lose" my prescription and get another pack, so I can go through it. It shouldn't be suspicious since i use them occasionally and travel a lot, and never requested a replacement in my life. I don't have a date, because i want to say goodbye to my boyfriend first. And I'm scared to ruin his life with this, but i don't have any other choice. I'm going to write two letters, one for him and one explaining why i took this decision to avoid any kind of speculation. It won't fix things for him but he can still hope. I'm so fucked up that i worry what people are going to think of me when i'll be dead. 

He isn't aware of my ideation, only that i'm depressed.

I'm tired. I don't want to live anymore, it's just plain torture. Chronic pain is hell. I tried everything was available to me, but it didn't work.

 There is nothing for me in this life, just misery and pain and illness. I don't want to live like that, this is not life. I won't be able to get a job, i won't be able to graduate as i wanted, i won't be able to do anything, all of that because i'm sick. Wish i was normal. People like me get treated like trash by everyone. 

I swear that i tried to have a better life. I got nothing out of it, just illusions and more misery and pain. Life isn't for me and I accept that.
