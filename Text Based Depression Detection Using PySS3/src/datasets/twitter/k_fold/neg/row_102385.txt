Feeling like I should have killed myself years agoI had major depression couple years ago. I seriously thought about and almost killed myself. I didn't, depression went away and my life got better. That was untill couple weeks ago where early sign of depression showed back up. I feel constantly hyper anxious, experiencing break downs sevral times a day, feel stuck, hate most aspects of my life. It comes down to the fact that I never asked to be born and don't want to live anymore. I don't think it's selfish for me to want to die. People that say they care offer no support so they are the selfish ones. I don't want to be part of this world. For most of my life it has offered me nothing good and living ain't worth it
