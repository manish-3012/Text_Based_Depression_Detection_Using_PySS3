Iâ€™m drunk and a useless shell of a person.I have no talents or skills. Iâ€™m good looking but super awkward and canâ€™t pick anyone up and suck at dating. I was awful at school and have no real skills or a useful degree. Thereâ€™ no point to my existence. I donâ€™t contribute anything. Iâ€™m just an anxious mess no mater how my therapy or help I get.
