I was born too early, I guessThis will be very frank and maybe a little graphic. I'm a trans woman and being in my body is so horrific. I can and will reshape my genitals to look like something more acceptable, but I'll never have a uterus or ovaries. My body will never function the way it should and will always have this harrowing legacy. Maybe trans women in the future will be able to get organs grown from their own stem cells and have kids and just generally live an ordinary life, but that won't be possible in my lifetime. I'm going to be stuck with this for the rest of my life. I can't cope knowing there's never going to be an end to this misery.
