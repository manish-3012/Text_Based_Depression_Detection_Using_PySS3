How much Prozac does it take to off yourself?Okay, letâ€™s say this is a hypothetical situation for obvious reasons. In this hypothetical, how many 20mg capsules of prozac/ fluoxetine would someone who weighs 140 lbs have to take to ensure death? Iâ€™m not worried about if itâ€™ll be painful or know me out, I just want a number and the odds of it killing me. I assume a nearly-full bottle would be enough. To give you a little extra information, Iâ€™m in my late teens and have a semi-high tolerance for antidepressants and drugs in general.
