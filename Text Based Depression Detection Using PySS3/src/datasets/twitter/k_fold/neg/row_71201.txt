I got a plan.There isn't much to talk about anymore, I feel nothing I am just empty. From a mother that was too cruel and naive to bring me back when I had freedom to a place where I abandoned all hope, next year like this December I will be an adult and by my countries law I cant leave it, ofc I cant they get paid to trap us here.
 

From a pathetic family that gave up their freedoms for this. I really tired, I really did, I thought of all paths and all tired to proactively get out of this mess, unfortunately they were all dead ends. I cant take being threaten and beaten for being sad and anxious from my parents to them withdrawing me from school to be privately tutored under their supervision. Looking back at this pitiful life, its as if fate pulled a cruel joke I was so in reach but yet I was dragged away.

I dont want to feel like this anymore, and I don't want to talk. Now when i exhaust my 5 days of medicine and would have to go get it refilled, ill get a part of the local cyanide and ballidona plants outside, make me a quite delicious pot of jasmine tea with them, and chung 50 D3 vitamin pills with some pain killers. I hope thats enough.

I know it may seem that I made my mind, but I really don't want to do this, I want to enjoy life, I love being alive, I love the smell of flowers, a good comedy and an appetising meal. I just can't finds way out anymore. If I cant live free then whats the point of living anymore.
