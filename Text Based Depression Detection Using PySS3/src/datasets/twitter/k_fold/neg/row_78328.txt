In less than 24 I will be dead and nobody around me suspects a thing.28 November 2017, the date of my suicide, is almost here. I have chosen my method, worked out my logistics and tied up loose ends.

Life just wasn't for me. I tried education and college but dropped out in my final year. After I was no longer a student, I guess I lost my sense of identity. In college I mattered. I was somebody and I had a purpose: to finish exams and get a degree. 

Now as a dropout, my options are limited and there is no path available to me that truth excites me. I can't work a dead-end job going nowhere and not making a difference. I thought about the military as that would give me a purpose and I would feel like I was part of something more but now I don't feel the same. 

Suicide seems like the next logical option. I know my friends and family will be shocked and unable to see why I choose to do this. I wish I could explain to them in person exactly why and answer their questions but unfortunately that's not possible. 

I hope any of you who read this and feel similar to me find your purpose and live a long and happy life but for me that's not the case. Goodbye.
