I feel like a failure.My own mom is afraid of me. She says she doesnâ€™t know what to do with me or how to act with me. When your own mom is at a loss for what to do with you, shouldnâ€™t you just die?

I have no friends. I have coworkers who would hate to have to do my job if I died. I donâ€™t have a relationship. I donâ€™t have kids. I donâ€™t have siblings. I donâ€™t have any family whoâ€™d miss me. I have a dog but as my mom reminds me, she takes better care of him than I do.

Iâ€™m sorry that I canâ€™t just let go of my anger. Iâ€™m sorry that Iâ€™m not happy with my life but I canâ€™t bring myself to care enough to fix it. I hate my job. I hate my life. And itâ€™s been like that for years. Not just after my last breakup.

And yes, I do need to quit being so stupid and give up the idea that he and I will ever fix things. But that idea is what gets me through things and Iâ€™m scared to death of what will happen if I give it up.

Iâ€™m sick of being told itâ€™s because Iâ€™m spoiled, because Iâ€™m a brat. Iâ€™m sorry that my dad passing suddenly made you have to deal with this. Iâ€™m sorry that I canâ€™t fake it and pretend everything is ok. I had to step into what my dad used to do because heaven forbid my momâ€™s daily life change. But I canâ€™t say anything about it because if I do, she just starts crying and blaming me.

I wish I had been the one who died instead of my dad. Then everyone would have been happier it seems.
