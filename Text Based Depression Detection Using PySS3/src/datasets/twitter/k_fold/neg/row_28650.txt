When emotions break the facade of not caring is when it hurts the mostSo, I might be a little older than some of you, 33, and my life sucks. If you knew me in person you wouldn't believe that I could feel this way but its true.

Happiness can often times be having someone to share your life with, your goals, fears, aspirations. I haven't had anyone like that for almost 8 years.

The real kicker is, I'm attractive, wealthy, smart, funny etc. All these great qualities, but they mean nothing if you are utterly alone. When I try to open up to a couple friends they obviously want nothing more than the conversation to end instead of trying to help.

I'm gay, i'm single, no kids no relationships no one to really care too much if i'm here or not. 

I am so happy when it gets dark, at that point i feel its ok to take a sleeping pill and go to bed, even if its just 9pm, Ill sit in bed as long as I can feign sleep and stay in that state where waking emotions have not fully taken grasp. Once I am awake all I want is to sleep where my mind is turned off and there isn't pain. I do not even have the ability to watch a movie without feeling like shit and having to turn it off.

Its almost 2:30 pm and all i can think about is that in 6 hours it will be late enough to take another sleeping pill, even though I just got out of bed 90 minutes ago. This is my life, sit up in my million dollar condo sleeping as much as i can, sleeping pain away and increasing despair with each day of inn-action.

Its' been going on so long I don't even know how to get out of the spiral, I've crossed the event horizon, now i'm spinning down towards a singularity which hopefully will have less pain than the rest of the trip.

I wish I had good advice, but i'm a cautionary tale about how things don't replace people, and no matter what you have, if you don't have someone there its pointless..
