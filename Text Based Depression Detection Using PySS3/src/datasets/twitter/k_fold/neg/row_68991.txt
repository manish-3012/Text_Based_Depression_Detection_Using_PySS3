I have the pills in my hand, Iâ€™ve pushed everyone away but Iâ€™m scaredI donâ€™t know what to do anymore. My ex-bf said he wanted to get back together but he has to work his life out first, and Iâ€™m left waiting for him. So I pushed him away, and my family, and everyone. Iâ€™m just a coward who keeps chickening out.
