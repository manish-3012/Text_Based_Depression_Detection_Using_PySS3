I'm losing control and my depression is winning. I'm such a coward and a burden.I can't control my feelings anymore, my chest feels heavy and I can hardly breath, my depression is getting the better of me and it's starting to get much worse as the thoughts of killing myself are starting to come back again after almost a year of peace. 

I should be happy ! I have friends, I have family, I have a job and I'm healthy, I even have a person that I love, whom may not love me the same way but I know cares deeply for me as we spend lots of nights together as friends and sometimes even more, but here I am, sitting in his bed as he's on the PC and I can't stopping myself from thinking : what if I just go upstairs and kill myself ? Would the other people here notice in the house? How long would it take him to notice I was gone? Would he care? Would anyone care?

I tried to run away from this feeling, I moved countries and tried new things which was great at first, but now I am back home because my depression just got worse then before.

I thought coming home would make me feel better, everyone was so happy to see me, my friends even talked about how I was the glue to the group, how everyone is so happy to have me back but here I am , thinking about all the ways I could kill myself.

I feel so terrible for feeling this way, why should I, have any right to feel depressed and sad? So many people love me that are willing to help me but I just can't, I can't speak my mind, I can't tell them, I can't disappoint them. 

Killing myself seems so easy, then everything would just be over, I wouldn't have to deal with anything , everything would just be gone. 

I'd be gone. 

Maybe I'm just a coward, a coward that should just kill herself so no one has to deal with this bullshit that goes through my head, if I kill myself I won't be a burden to anyone anymore, I won't be in the way of anyone anymore. 

I'd be the coward that finally let go and made everyone's life easier.
