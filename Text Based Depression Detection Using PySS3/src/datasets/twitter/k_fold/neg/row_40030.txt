I set a date for kill myself, am so tired of this lifeIt's been two years since I do nothing and sit at my computer to watch videos and play video game. In early 2016 I was taking a lot of drugs which ended with me dropping out of my last year of high school due to Social Anxiety, dp/dr and more. I can't take it anymore every time I tried to get back up I fell back down. My life is just full of lies. That's why I decided the day of my 18 birthday 03/09/2018 I'll kill myself if nothing as change.
