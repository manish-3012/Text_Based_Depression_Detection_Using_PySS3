Am alone foreverI have realized that no matter what nothing will make me happy and I think I should face the music and just end the suffering... I literally am just staying alive so I donâ€™t make certain people sad.. is it fair that they get to sleep at night, cause Iâ€™m alive, and I must stay restless and in discontent... I donâ€™t feel that, that is fair.. why is it so wrong if I just do something for myself??
