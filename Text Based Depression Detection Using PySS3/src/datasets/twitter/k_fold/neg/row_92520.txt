I think I am starting to slip againNovember 2018 I wanted to kill myself because I got dumped by my girlfriend and failed college. Now over a year of working on helpdesk in a hospital I felt good. But lately there is starting to be that little voice saying that I am not good enough that I shall die alone. I hate that my hair is starting to recede in 21 years of age I hate that one of my eyes is slightly smaller.
