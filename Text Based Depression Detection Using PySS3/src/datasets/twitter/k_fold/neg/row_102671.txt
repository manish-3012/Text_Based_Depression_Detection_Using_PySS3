I'm at rock bottom and don't see myself getting betterThis year has been horrendous for me. 
Alongside my depression and anxiety issues that I've had since I was a teenager, I've had such a rough time since being back home from uni that it's reached the point that I don't think I can carry on much longer.
I fell behind with work at uni so much that I only handed it one piece of work for the whole year. Being my final year there, this resulted in me having to drop out to save face, hoping that I could go back next September (2018) in hopes of trying that year again.
So, I come back home and soon enough, depression starts to hit as I realise my friends are all either going back to uni, or are going for the first time, while I'm stuck at a dead end. This also begun my lack of passion for what I wanted to do at uni and puts my desire to go back into jeopardy.
Then comes working. I find a job and the first couple of shifts go pretty well. Awkward and that, but I seem to be doing fine. Then, come Sunday, I come down with really really bad depression and suicidal thoughts. I tried to let these pass as I head into work but then I have a very severe panic attack right at work. 
This isn't the first time I've had a panic attack at work, I had another one last year which caused me to hop to another job and my mood to go down. 
I get sent home and face a berating by my mother who basically says that I don't contribute anything and I have to grow up. This just amplified the suicidal thoughts.
Now, it's Tuesday and I'm off for a couple of days. I'm doing everything in my power to not just go over to the train tracks and just wait for my death. I have no passion to carry on living anymore. And I'm scared of that.
