EverytimeI try to take a step forward thereâ€™s millions of reasons and people trying to push me back.

Iâ€™m not even sad.

I just wish Iâ€™d go to sleep tonight and never wake up.

I just felt like i was part of a play anyways..

And I think itâ€™s time my role as the background character should stop writing itself.
