How do I just pause my life for a minute?Hereâ€™s a story about me, Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a couple years now, and I donâ€™t really know why, everything is fine in my life with the exception of school, Iâ€™m basically a mid 50â€™s student but I study every night, my note books are full, and I pay attention in class, in my school Iâ€™m known as the dumb one because I say dumb things and just never say anything smart I always try to put a smile on my face and say something funny and Iâ€™m pretty sure people think Iâ€™m one of the happiest people ever. Little do they know Iâ€™ve been depressed since I could remember and just canâ€™t seem to have fun anymore, no one knows this about me and Iâ€™ve never told anyone about my feelings. And The only girl Iâ€™ve ever had feelings for doesnâ€™t like me back. Anyways Iâ€™ve tried to end my life a few times but the guilt of putting my family through that has stopped me, and also Mac miller has played a very important role in my depression, he gives me something to relate to like in his song weekend where he says he fell asleep and forgot to die, I canâ€™t count all the times I had a bottle of pills in my hand ready to end it but I fell asleep instead. Anyways back to the story, I really donâ€™t wanna live rn but I donâ€™t wanna kill my self I just wanna take a break from life and maybe resume it in a few days even though this is unrealistic I just wish there was a way to do this, anyways I think Iâ€™m gonna end it within the month, I donâ€™t have anyone close enough to talk to about this and life just doesnâ€™t interest me anymore.
