It's never going to get better.I've battled with anxiety and depression for years. Sometimes I can deal and convince myself that things will change. But the work it takes has wore me down.

The time lost to depressive episodes has gutted my chances of having a life worth living. Now I'm just dragging other people down by being here.

Everyone that cares about me deserves a version of me that no longer exists. I'm good at the fascade, but I don't really have the hope that I portray. I do it for them, not myself. I lie about how I'm feeling so I don't burden them with the guilt and shame that I feel constantly.

It sucks to realize I'll never be better. That the mental illness I have has ruined any chance of the life I want. That the image of me they are left with won't align with my suicide. It won't make sense to them and that hurts too. Knowing that they won't understand how it ended this way, when I seemed happy.

I wish I could push everyone away. Make them absolutely loathe the thought of me to the point that they'll feel joy/relief when I'm gone.

I hate this feeling. I hate that my own mind is constantly berating my failures and mistakes. I hate that that same mind is responsible for my lack of success. It's a cycle that I just can't keep repeating.
