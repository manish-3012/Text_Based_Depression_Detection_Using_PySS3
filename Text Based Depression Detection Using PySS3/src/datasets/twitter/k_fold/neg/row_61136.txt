Too Far Gone...I believe I've been struggling with depression for a little while now, but I wouldn't know considering I never went to go see anyone about it.

I guess it was because it never got in the way of work, or school, or my social life, it was just the in between that was always so miserable. I don't really want to say why, but to put it short, I was obsessed with far unreachable goal.

I was so obsessed in fact that I thought I'd rather kill myself than not achieve the goal I had set out for myself. But like I said, this goal truly was unreachable. No "believe and you will accomplish" was going to somehow fix this issue. The impossibility was equivalent to wanting to hold the hand of a loved one who had passed away long ago.

I've known for a while that if you begin to have serious suicidal thoughts, then that's the sign to go seek professional help. Its the sign that says "I don't care if you're embarrassed, get help. Now." But of course, that's exactly what I was.

Embarrassed? Ashamed? Not quite sure, but the important thing is that I didn't listen to the signs. I didn't get the help that I needed when I could, and now... Well, its pretty much destroyed me now.

I have no confidence, no self esteem, self worth is a joke for me.

And now, starting my first week of college life, overwhelmed by anxiety and stress, I can't support myself. I can't convince myself that in just a couple weeks I'll be able to handle this stuff. And since I am so busy, I can't schedule myself an appointment with a professional.

I have long since put that unattainable goal from earlier to rest, and I haven't seriously thought of suicide since.

Until now...

I feel completely hopeless. I am mentally incapable of getting through this. I am trapped, and the only way out seems to be the path I have wanted to take so long.

I think my time may be coming very soon
