I give up. Ending it all. Time to check outJust got the eviction notice on my door. If I donâ€™t have $3900 by tomorrow morning the sheriff is coming to evict me. I give up. Every time I try to do right it always backfires. Iâ€™m tired of being strong tired of having hope. 
I simply have no more energy for life anymore. 

When they come to evict me tomorrow they will find me dead. Iâ€™ve made up my mind. This is my last hurrah. Iâ€™ve let everyone down in my family. Will be leaving them a note so they donâ€™t blame themselves. 


I simply can not live another day. Glad I was able to let it out here anonymously.

Time to go.
