Attempt #11I went with opioids and benzos in a pretty heavy dose. I just canâ€™t do this shit anymore. I canâ€™t seem to get any momentum going with positive things and the negative stuff feels like a never-ending landslide. 

Honestly, the reason Iâ€™ve held on so long is that I still had some kind of hope things would get better with therapy and medication, but itâ€™s been 16 years of trying different meds and nothing works for me. I have chronic pain, depression, anxiety, and a nasty case of PTSD from abuse I suffered in my last marriage and while I was growing up. 

My parents disowned me, I havenâ€™t had friends since junior high, and I honestly hate the guy staring back at me in the mirror. I hope you guys are stronger than I am. 

In case I donâ€™t see you, good afternoon, good evening...and goodbye.
