I need to change.i never used to think of suicide as even an option and i wish i could go back to rhat mindset. i hate these late nights crying because i feel so worthless. feeling anxious all the time. i just need a reason to stay here. I guess id like to know, if anyone of you have reasons for not commiting suicide, and what keeps you motivated?
