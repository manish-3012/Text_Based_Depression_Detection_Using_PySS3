my shitty but not so shit lifeThought I was doing fine for a while but I guess not cause here I am. I feel like I have no reason to be suicidal because my life is comfortable. I have close friends, great family, and a lot to look forward to into the future but I feel so empty inside. When Iâ€™m alone I can feel my heart just breaking and this overwhelming sense of sadness wash over me. It sounds weird but I feel like Iâ€™m drowning inside of myself and every time I want to reach out I chicken out the last minute because I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone. Iâ€™m so tired of feeling so hollow inside and I know that thereâ€™s only so much more I can take. Iâ€™m sick of this.
