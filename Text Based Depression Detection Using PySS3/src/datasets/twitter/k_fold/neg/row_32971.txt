I let my ego ruin my lifeI use to be an accounting major at my school. I was doing really well, had plenty of experience and would've had a great job lined up. However, I was afraid that I wouldn't get a job at one of the Big 4. 

 I happened to attend one of the top engineering schools in the nation. After hearing about engineers talk about their futures and a handful of girls bringing up and showing off their engineering boyfriends. I switched into Chemical Engineering, and my GPA went down. Some classes were difficult, a few I had to retake, but I did well enough in others that my gpa was a 3.0 upon graduation and I even had an internship.  However, it has been 6 months since I graduated and nothing. I tried everything to improve my interview skills, resume, and hit up friends/family/members/family-friends, but sadly none of them work with companies who use a ton of chemical engineers.  I then realize that engineering is flooded, I like many others fell for the hype. I know I am a little socially awkward but I'm not horrific, I have had a couple girlfriends and hooked up with a couple more. Maybe part of me wants to think that I am just really bad at interviews and that 

I just realized had I not let me ego get the best of me I would've been at least a couple years into an accounting job even if it was at a mid-tier or local company. Sure I wouldn't be making 65k/year but at least I would be making something, my most recent ex-girlfriend would still be with me and I would be happy instead of rotting away like a NEET in my parents basement because no company thus far wants my skills. Even Lab Tech positions are sticking their noses up. I have enough in my savings and the loans aren't too bad, thank god for community college, and I have a part-time job but if things are too bad then I am screwed.
