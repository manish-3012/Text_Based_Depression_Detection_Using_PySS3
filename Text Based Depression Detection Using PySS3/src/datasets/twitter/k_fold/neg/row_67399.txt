No one understands that you want to die, especially when they are the ones making you want to end it all.When I say "I want to die" everyone pretends I'm kidding and yells at me, and the people who yell at me know I'll end it all just to be out of misery. Everyone hates me, and they do some of the meanest things to me, and those things always stick with me. I've been thrown down stairs, called stupid, ugly, and fat, and I've received death threats but so much more happens. No one knows what I go through, and no one cares about the cuts all up and down my arms. Someone stole my binder, and they read all of my suicidal notes and that's why everyone yells at me, and if I went to sleep and never woke up no one would care. My two only friends backstabbed me yesterday, but I'm kind of glad because they were rude to me. I want to get a small building and put all my stuff in it, then set it on fire with me in it so I can go and everything I own can go with me. I kind of just want to hang myself too with my favorite belt. I don't know if I'll die anytime soon, but one thing is for sure, it will constantly be on my mind. 

I know this doesn't make a lot of sense, but I had to post this to get some stuff off my chest.
