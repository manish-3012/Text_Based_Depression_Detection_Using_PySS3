People will be happier if I'm gone even if they won't admit itMy mom.  She works minimum wage jobs that require a lot of labour in order to raise me. I treat my mom very poorly because I am still traumatized from her abuse when I was young. I am extremely hostile towards her and constantly raise my voice. She lets my dad (they are divorced) live with us because she's scared of him tracking us down and hurting us. If I'm gone, she won't have to work anymore. She can finally leave my dad. There won't be anything tying them together. My dad is abusive and alcoholic.

My ex. Despite her leaving me and blocking me, I keep sending her cards and flowers. If you look at my history, you'll know why I can't get over her. She's probably extremely annoyed at me for doing it but I can't help it. If I'm gone, she won't have to deal with me sending her stuff anymore. She'll be free from me at last.

My only two friends (?). I'm not even sure if it's right for me to call them friends. I constantly vent to them about my problems and somedays I can see they are clearly annoyed. I don't blame them. They are trying to help me, but I'm just a handful. If I'm gone, sure they would have lost a friend, but they have others aside from me. They'll continue on with life and be successful people. I truly believe that.

Yeah maybe those 4 people will initially be sad, but when they get over my death, they'll be happier and that's what I want. I want those 4 to be happy and with me being alive, it only causes them pain.
