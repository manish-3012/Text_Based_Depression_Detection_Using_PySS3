Does therapy help (UK)I might go the doctors if I figure out what to say with the hope of being referred to a therapist  (I think it's free here but what's the hope a doctor even refers me and doesn't just say ahh exercise and diet you'll be fine)

I've never been in therapy before and some success stories might ease my mind a little. Because right now all I can think is how stupid I am going to feel and what a POS the therapist might think I am etc...

I just want to be normal
