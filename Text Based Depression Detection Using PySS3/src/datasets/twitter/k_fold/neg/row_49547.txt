Iâ€™ve had such heavy suicidal thoughts lately and itâ€™s because I know Iâ€™ll die aloneIâ€™m 20 but Iâ€™ve had such horrible experiences with girls and Iâ€™ve lost a lot of my friends I hate myself so much and I wanna just die but Iâ€™m too scared to kill myself. When I was younger I thought I would be happy with who I was when I was 20 but I never thought Iâ€™d be this much of a loser. Iâ€™m not a good person I donâ€™t contribute anything and Iâ€™ll never find love so why even live anymore?
