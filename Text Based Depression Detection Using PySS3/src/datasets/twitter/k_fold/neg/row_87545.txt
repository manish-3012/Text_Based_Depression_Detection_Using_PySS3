Why shouldn't I kill myself?I live in a third world shithole which I can't escape.    
Am poor.  
My face has been getting fucked up by acne for seven years now  
Because of the first two statements, I can't afford acne medication  
The last two fuck me up so badly that I am 19 and have never kissed a girl (face is repulsive) and I don't even want to leave the house, which makes me miss uni classes, fucking me up even more. Important to keep in mind, if I don't do well in uni I'll have to work for a fucking dollar/hour (minimum wage around here).  
What else... needless to say I have no friends either, I avoid people as my face is like a meth addict's (never done drugs). My god, I am such a fucking loser. And I say god ironically because let's face it, there is no such thing.  
What else... I think that's enough.
