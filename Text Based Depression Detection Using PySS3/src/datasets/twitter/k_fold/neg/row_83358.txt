I just need someone to talk to for a momentHi kind-hearted people of this subreddit, I come in the hope of some words of positivity here. This is the loneliest halloween Iâ€™ve ever experienced in my life. I donâ€™t want to sound like a pity party, but i just really donâ€™t have anyone else right now. My girlfriend and I have gotten into an argument three days ago and since then she has not responded to a single text iâ€™ve sent her. Sheâ€™s now blocked me on text and snapchat. Iâ€™ve been trying to say whatever i can to her, telling her im ready to listen to her and have a productive conversation, but she continues to read my texts and ignore me. Today, i texted her happy halloween and to have a good day and that i missed her. She didnâ€™t even open it this time. She just got done telling me how she loved me and missed me the same day she stopped talking to me.

Sheâ€™s at a party tonight, and Iâ€™ve been alone this halloween and I canâ€™t sleep. My mind is racing thinking about what could happen and wondering if she is okay. We have an amazing connection otherwise, and I dont understand why sheâ€™s doing this now â€” genetically stubborn to an extreme. But at this point is just feels like cruel punishment, and I canâ€™t take it anymore Iâ€™ve cried myself to sleep the past two nights and i donâ€™t know how iâ€™m gonna make it through another one. Thanks if anyone takes the time to read this, I appreciate you so much.
