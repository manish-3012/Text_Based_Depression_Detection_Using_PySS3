I'm pretty sure my friend just killed herself.She's the only person I would talk to on a regular basis. I wasn't talking to her much over winter break though, not really sure why. She's had a history of depression before, and I was usually able to talk her out of killing herself. Tonight she was very firm in saying goodbye, and she didn't want to discuss at all. I tried talking her out of it for a few minutes, but now she isn't responding. Hasn't responded since about 30 minutes ago.

For some reason, I don't feel anything. It's like I'm denying this is actually happening. I'm having the feeling it's only going to get worse from here. I've had a history of mild depression myself, but it hasn't flared up in about a year. I came close to killing myself a few times, and I DO NOT want to go back to feeling that way.

I guess what I'm accomplishing by posting this is having someone to vent to, since she was the only person I talked to, and I don't have close enough relationships with my other friends to talk to them about this. If any of you have had this same situation, please tell me how it turns out.

TL;DR: Close friend killed herself, I feel like things will only get worse.
