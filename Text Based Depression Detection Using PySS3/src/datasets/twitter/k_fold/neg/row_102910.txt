I want to dieI have a headache from crying so hard.
I have no friends. I don't know how to make friends. I'm in love with my ex boyfriend who I will never be with. I called everyone I know tonight asking if they would just hangout with me. Everyone said no. I could kill myself now and in a couple months no one would care.
