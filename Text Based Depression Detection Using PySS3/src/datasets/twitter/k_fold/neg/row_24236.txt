Don't really know why I'm posting here.It's a throwaway account. I am really  struggling. I know all the theory  and all the things to do/say. But right now I don't care. I am totally alone, and recently had my only friend tell me they loved me and then cut me out. This was on top of my ongoing problems. So i don't have anyone to turn to, no one to just talk about nothing with. I have been having vivid memories of previous trauma, and I'm waiting to be able to see my psych. But thats 2 weeks away. It has been a steady downhill for months. I know these feelings aren't wholly mine. But I feel like giving in to them because I truely don't care about anything anymore. Im sick of the cycle of numbness and intense feelings. Im sick of feelings of being abandoned, used and tossed aside. I have quit my studies, and taken leave from my work. I feel guilty as so many don't have work now. Part of me wants to leave everything behind, but I know that  if i left it would just be an easy excuse to cover the intent. I don't want to wake up anymore. I mostly just don't want to continue, but occasionally I activly want to  finish it. I'm self destructive at the best of times. It has just been too much at once. But i am sick of going from one fight to the next. I don't remember the last time I was happy for longer than my distraction lasted. I have been severely neglecting my physical health lately, i don't drink alcohol, but i have essentially been living on coffee. I havent slept more than 2 or 3 hours in months, even before the coffee. Part of me is hoping that something health wise will give soon, and the decision will be out of my hands. That will be easier on those around me.
