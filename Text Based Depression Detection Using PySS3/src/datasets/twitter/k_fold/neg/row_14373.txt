There is Always Hope. My friend created this FB page this month for people to share their stories so that they may begin to cope with their depression.Hello all. My friend lost her father to suicide over a year ago. She was the one who found him afterwards. After that day, she has gone through a lot of depression and just this month, she got inspired to not only start to change her outlook on life, but also to help other who have also been suffering from depression. I encourage you to not only post here on reddit, but also on this FB page if you have a FB account. The more places, the more support. 

I recommend watching the video she made. It's very touching.
