There's no reason to live life when you're severely socially anxiousHumans are social animals, we NEED to socialize, we need friends and relationships. I'm 18, have 3 friends who don't really care about me, I've never had a relationship and I completely wasted away my teen years. I have zero memories because I was too scared to do anything, I am completely useless because i  skipped out on all life experiences. And because I didn't get fucked over genetically enough, i'm also trans! Which is fantastic because transitioning is a totally doable process when you can't even fucking buy groceries without almost dying. I can't get any profesional help because, again, that's a social interaction and a VERY difficult one at that.

I don't even want to get better, it's not like I even enjoy living. All I do is sleep, cut myself and watch youtube, ocassionally drink. I'm studying IT and I fucking hate it and i'm horrible at it, so I also fucked up my future career. Just fuck it, I dug myself into a hole and there's no way to get out of it.
