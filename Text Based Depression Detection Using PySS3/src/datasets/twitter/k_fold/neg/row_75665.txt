I need some help talking to a very good friend who's having a really hard timeHi sw,

You guys have helped me out before but this time, it's not me.

I'll tl;dr first: I'm useless socially, not in a great mental place myself and I'm scared I'll say the wrong things and make it worse. Please help me help her.

She's been through a lot of shit. Be it down right evil S.O's, addiction, anxiety and depression or just stressful situations she hasn't had the easiest of rides...

I found out yesterday that she's been cutting again and apparently it's been going on for over 2 weeks - I'm distraught. I don't want her (or anyone really) to be in pain. It fucking sucks, I know - I've been there and done that.

I don't even know what to say here, Reddit. I don't want to say too much about her because, as I'm sure you understand, it's not something you'd want the world knowing but at the same time, it's pretty hard to give advice when you don't know the situation.

There is a mutual friend who lives 20 minutes away from her and, along with the ambos ofc, has been designed as the emergency contact.

Apologies for the messy and probably largely nonsensical writing, I may be a little bit drunk...
