Too much PainI'm having suicide thoughts and can't stop crying. My boyfriend is going through some shit. I'm trying to help him but he is verbally and emotionally taking it out on me. I guess he realized that and told me to leave him alone. That triggered me to start crying and then the kill yourself thoughts started. They won't stop or go away. I think I kept to much bottled up inside and its all coming out. Just in typing this, I have to stop and keep crying. I can't handle all of these feelings at once. It's smothering me.
