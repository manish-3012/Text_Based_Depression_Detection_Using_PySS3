I was unsuccessful but I should probably wait until no one is home.I dont want everyone else in my house to hear a gunshot and the bottle of xanax has done nothing.  
I really tried to be a good person. I really wanted to live up their expectations but I'm not enough and the few things that have stopped me from attempting in the past are not enough anymore. 

O have to find way to do it right because a failed Ttempt that was cIght by others will only try to stop me.. I'm only wanted when I'm of value to someone else buy the rest of the Tim's I'm just worthless shit. 

I thought i could handle this life for the sake of my step son nut really he has enough parents and it wont mTter in the long run. 

People will. Be sad and I hate that but I can no longer deal with the suffering of life just to stop the hurt of another.

No one has such consideration for me. I will probably make or though the might sp at least I cam start giving away all my things so that my family wont have to deal with that. Perhaps I'll go ahead and find a funnel place and make arrangements.
