Iâ€™m doneI took my relationship for granted, Iâ€™ve taken everything for granted. Now sheâ€™s gone, I have no one. Whatâ€™s the point, maybe I can finally be at peace. The only thing thatâ€™s stopping me is my family. I donâ€™t want them to go through this pain. But I donâ€™t want to either. They donâ€™t understand, no one understands. Iâ€™m just done with this shit. Fuck life, it sucks. Fuck work. Fuck corona. Fuck our president. And most of all, fuck me. I might just do it tonight fuck it.
