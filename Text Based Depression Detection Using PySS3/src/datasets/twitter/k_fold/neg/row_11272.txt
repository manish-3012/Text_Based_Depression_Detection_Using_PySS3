Iâ€™ve planned to kill myself on my birthday in one month todayI got one month left to live, as Iâ€™ve planned it. 

Iâ€™ve totally given up life, I donâ€™t necessarily want to die, but I donâ€™t see the point in living either. I somehow wish I could go on, but itâ€™s impossible, there seems to be no help for me. Iâ€™ve had thoughts about killing myself often for as long as I can remember. Iâ€™m on and off depression, having about no friends, my parents donâ€™t talk to me about anything, no other family left. Iâ€™m unable to get a life, this year was the year I should fix it, Iâ€™ve failed, totally. 

By age 27 I think everything is too late, Iâ€™ve stagnated for too long. Iâ€™m sick of it all, I have no energy to go on, I donâ€™t know how to get further and get my life on track. It seems Iâ€™ll never get use of my education which I spent my best years to get. It seems Iâ€™ll never get a job, even how hard I worked. It seems Iâ€™ll never get friends, Iâ€™m staying alone every day, every night, been doing since forever. My looks, if I ever had anything to write home about, fades, my hair is beyond repair, my face is loosing its contours. This is totally pointless, I feel totally wasted, Iâ€™m just exhausted. Iâ€™m just disappointing myself. Iâ€™m done, Iâ€™m ready.

I gave myself this year, I couldnâ€™t make it, Iâ€™m out.
