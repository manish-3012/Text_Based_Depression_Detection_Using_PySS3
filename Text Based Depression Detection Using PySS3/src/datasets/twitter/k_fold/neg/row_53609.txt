It's not that I want to die. I just can't cope with feeling like this anymore.I'm autistic, I feel so isolated and alone, and frankly the only outlet I have for social interaction is online. 

Talking and reaching out through a screen isn't enough, but then again, as an autistic 31 year old virgin I'm familiar with not being enough. I'm tired of feeling like the lesser of all my peers. I'm tired of being unwanted. I'm tired of not fitting the narrow definition of what a heterosexual white man should be. I'm supposed to be entitled and live a blessed life, and yet I can't get a job, I can't make friends, I've never been in a relationship, and I see no way to fix any of this.

I feel like the world has no place for me, and of course it has no incentive to make one. People say suicide is never the answer, but I feel like they mean that for people with potential. I don't have any potential, I can't change my reality. My life is a story of continued isolation and the words "it gets better" only seem to apply to the fact that at least I'm not bullied on a daily basis anymore. Of course if exclusion is a type of bullying than experience tells me all I have to do is leave my house and try to connect with a group or an individual to be bullied again.

I don't see any point in continuing. It won't get better and people in better situations than me have ended themselves, so why can't it? Why do I have to continue to feel this way? It hurts so fucking bad and not a single person really cares. No one will ever care about me, and I will never be given the opportunity to care about someone else. I'm just not good enough.
