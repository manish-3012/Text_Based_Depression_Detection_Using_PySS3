I've been having some serious suicidal thoughts for the first time in months, and I've forgotten how to handle themI really need someone to talk to, and I'd greatly appreciate someone to listen and maybe help me calm down.

I haven't felt *this* bad in a few months and I can't remember how I used to deal with feeling like this every day. I'm genuinely scared that I'm going to kill myself...
