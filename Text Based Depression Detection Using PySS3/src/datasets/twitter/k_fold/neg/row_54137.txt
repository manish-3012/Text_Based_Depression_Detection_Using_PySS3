20M Can't hold a job. Been 5150ed. Failed out of University.I just stopped showing up to my dishwashing job the three days ago. I missed one day before that. I've spent the last two days holed up in a closet in my fathers home watching crap youtube and some miyazaki films. 

Twice I've attempted my method the past two days. I'm going to try again tonight. 

I was 5150ed (sent to a psychiatric hospital for seven days) three months ago when I told my university roommates I was suicidal because I had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and on Abilify and was failing out of university. I'm off all meds now, and I'm being told by my therapist in my hometown that I'm not bipolar. I believe her, I think university was just a shock to my smart but lazy ways. 

I was very socially isolated in high school. I took a gap year where I worked one odd job and volunteered a little at the local humane society. Otherwise I was mostly on youtube and browsing porn. 

I know I'm just using suicide as an excuse to not man up and just be a grown-up. It's despicable. I'm ungrateful. I'm killing myself because I'm a shitty person.
