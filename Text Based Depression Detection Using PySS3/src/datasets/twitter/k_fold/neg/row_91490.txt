I just want out and to get it over withSo a few years ago, the love of my life commuted suicide. Gun to head with suicide note and all. I could have spent the rest of my life with this girl. She had an extremely rough life and was the sweetest and most beautiful person inside and out. But the pain was just too much. Today I understand more of why she did it because I'm feeling the same way. The only thing holding me back is I don't want anyone who knows me to go through any emotional pain, which is impossible when it comes to losing someone you care for. But life is just too much. No one is genuine anymore, people lie and stab each other in the back. We rape the world around us by killing the land we live on. The world is just a horrible place and I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I want out. Now. I want to be with my love again. I miss her so damn much. She understood me, she was there for me. She was everything. Nothing matters to me except her. I have no motivation for anything. I wake up hating my life and fall asleep hating my life. Yeah it's all mind set blah blah, I've heard it before but it just doesn't work. The bad just out weighs the good heavily and I'm done with it all. We are so selfish. All we do is consume and consume without thinking of the consequences. I guess what I'm trying to get at is this is a way of me finally putting my thoughts into words for once. It's not a "if I commit suicide" its "when I commit suicide"
