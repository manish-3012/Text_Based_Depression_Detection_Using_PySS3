So now I'm sick.I posted last night before doing the deed. Somehow I still woke up this morning. I dreamed that I was a kid again. i thought for a long time and decided that even if I die it doesn't necessarily mean that my suffering will end. I can't change who I am and as much as I want to pretend like the manic depressive bipolar person living inside of me isn't real - I can't. I don't know if this is my second chance or if this is my punishment, but I've decided not to try again. Thanks for helping me realize that guys.
