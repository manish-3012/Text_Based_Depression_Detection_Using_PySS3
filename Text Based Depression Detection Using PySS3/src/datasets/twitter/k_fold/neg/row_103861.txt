I'm at a pretty low place right now[23 M] I lost my job last week, I've known for months that the store would be closing and was looking around for something else, something more exciting. I stuck around with the promise of a pay rise and some added benefits if I stayed until the end and so I did. In the end I didn't get anything that was promised except what was legally owed to me and that was a bummer. I genuinely wanted to help the guy even without a bonus but he ended up making the last few months a complete nightmare. 

To add salt to the wound, I'm getting kicked out of my apartment because the landlord has sold the apartment which I only found out a couple of weeks before I lost my job which my roommates neglected to pass on this information from over a month ago. Lucky for them the happy couple have already found somewhere to live and moved out last night without a goodbye while I was out all day. Today I move in with my mother who seems inconvenienced by this and has already tried to pawn me off to someone else. Thanks mum.

My mother came to me about a month ago because she had been hit by her boyfriend and I was the only person she wanted to confide into. I told her to end it, not to give him another chance or any sympathy. He needed to go. My father was rotten to me and my parents fought a lot over the way I was treated which sometimes resulted to violence. I left my family when I was 10 because she wouldn't take me and leave or if we did she would always go running back. Unfortunately history repeats itself and I find out that my advice had fallen on deaf ears. She's still with her deadbeat boyfriend (not my father).

And finally, my boyfriend of nearly 4 years got a scholarship to study over in Vancouver for his masters degree and last night was his last night with me before he left. We had a great day of visiting old friends together and drinking until the early hours of the morning. I spent most of this morning packing my room around him and crying while he was asleep. It's tough because I haven't told him that I'm not coping well and everything is falling apart and I've never felt so lonely. I don't think we're going to last very long in this now long distance relationship. He's cheated before as a result of my pushing away when things get difficult for me and I can't help but do it again after growing so close together again. 

I'm not the type to share the weight of my problems with anyone else, but I think I've finally collapsed under the weight of my unfortunate life. The hole in my heart is too big. I've been depressed since before i can remember and have pushed every single person away in my life. I finally have nobody I truly trust or can talk to.

I remember when I was 16 that my father tried to kill himself when everyone had left him. I couldn't bare to let people think that I was hurting myself over him and started to plan the long game. The goal was always to push everyone away until nobody cared and then get lost so everybody would forget me and never find my remains.

Instead of trying to fix things these past months I've been crippled by the thought of walking into the sea with a backpack full of bricks. I hear that's the most peaceful way. I don't want to but I really feel lonely today and that's all I can think about. I wish I never let things get so bad. 

I won't, don't worry but it's just getting to me...
