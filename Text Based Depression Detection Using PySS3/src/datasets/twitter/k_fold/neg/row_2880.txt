My mother is psychologically abusive.I have a post on r/advice from about a month ago if you want to see more details, click on my account. Idk I have so much to live for and everyone says Iâ€™m smart and I have a decent amount of friends. She just makes me feel horrible. I donâ€™t know if I want to hurt myself. Iâ€™m scared of not waking up tomorrow and i hate the thought of dying but I just want it to stop.
