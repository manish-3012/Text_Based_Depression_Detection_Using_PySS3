Give the suicide hotline a chanceFrom using the search bar I've seen only people shitting on the suicide hotline which is understandable.  Any type of public service can be extremely hit or miss and if you're to the point of calling them I can imagine you get pretty pissed at a shitty experience.  

I went in with no idea of what to say or expect.  I kind of just started talking and answering the person's questions.  She really calmed me down and helped me sort through my thoughts and figure out what do about my problem.  Depression doesn't make me suicidal but the sudden anger that completely overpowered my depression drove me to think that death was the only way out.  I couldn't see straight and had no mood change after working out for 2 hours.  The suicide hotline calmed me down and helped me think straight.  I've withheld my problems from people for as long as I've had them until I broke.  I used the hotline as a temporary crutch and it helped.  If you feel like shit and can't go on, just give it a chance.  Sometimes you just need someone to talk to.
