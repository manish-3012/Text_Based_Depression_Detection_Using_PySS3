Really numb right nowMy day has been ok but the past few hours Iâ€™ve really been really numb on Tuesday I attempted to hang myself itâ€™s so annoying that it didnâ€™t work why canâ€™t I just be dead? Itâ€™s like life doesnâ€™t want me but death doesnâ€™t either Iâ€™m thinking about running away when my parents and sister are asleep and killing myself either tonight or tomorrow morning hopefully Iâ€™ll get kidnapped and murdered before I make it the bridge where I plan to end my life so then it wouldnâ€™t even be a suicide im trying to think positive I just canâ€™t I just feel like death is the only option I need help I donâ€™t know how to stop myself from doing it please someone give me advice on how to change my mind itâ€™s like Iâ€™m arguing with myself I want to die but I also donâ€™t want to hurt people I love
