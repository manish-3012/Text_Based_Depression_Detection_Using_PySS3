My dream was crushedI wanted to help people, I wanted to be a hero, someone strong enough to protect those I cared about, but in the end, I failed...

In the end, I became a burden for so many people... Sometimes I want to scream and punch the wall until I break it...

Even with the pills taking away the lack of sleep... My soul is still in pain.
