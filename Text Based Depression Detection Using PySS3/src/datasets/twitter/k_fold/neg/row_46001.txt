For the days when everything feels like nothing...Usually, I'd try turning my thoughts into something a bit more interesting. A poem, a story, a song. Anything. Just something more intriguing than reality and the way everything is. I try to go in depth and describe things as vividly as possible.

Today though?  
Today's poem is a short one.  
It's one without an exact ending. At least not yet.

"Drown"

Roaring waves.  
The foamy, silky wrath of the sea caressing the muted, golden, lonely sands.  
Gloomy skies.  
The distant rumbling of a thunderstorm.  
Grim wishes.  
Emerald green waters, echoing the voice of death.

Silent footsteps.  
Daydreams about getting caught up in the riptide.
