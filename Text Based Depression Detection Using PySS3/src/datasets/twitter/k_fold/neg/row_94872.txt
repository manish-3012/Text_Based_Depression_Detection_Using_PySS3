How do I tell my parents I need to go to the ER??My mom is out of town, so it would actually just be my dad. I get scared talking to my parents, and having to explain myself right now feels like more than a lot to handle. Iâ€™m 18, so I guess I could technically go myself, but im scared and plus I donâ€™t know all the info Iâ€™ll need bc Iâ€™m on my parentsâ€™ insurance still and so  donâ€™t handle that info
