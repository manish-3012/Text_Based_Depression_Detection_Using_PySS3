Pretty sure tonight is the nightSo I'm pretty sure I'm going to end it all tonight.  I made an attempt a few days ago and it didn't work.  I'm going to overdose and slit my wrists in the bathroom tonight once my roommate and suit mates are asleep.  I've thought about reaching out to someone, but I can't talk to my family (they don't take mental health seriously at all).  I've briefly debated calling a hotline but I've just heard horror stories.  The more I debate it the more I know this is what should happen.  I've said goodbye to everyone.  I've written up my will.  I've made all the preparations so everything will go smoothly.  I'm not writing this for attention, or to get replies like 'don't do this.'  'you have so much to live for.'  or any other shit like that.  I'm calm.  I actually hope no one comments on this at all.  I just figured I'd at least 'say my plan out loud'.  Typing it out makes it more real to me... idk why.  I'm just fucking tired.  My life has absolutely put me through the ringer and I'm ready to fall asleep and not wake up.  But yeah, I guess that's all.  So here ends what many people will think of as yet another selfish, shallow, meaningless cry for attention.  Maybe it is a cry for attention... either way... this is my plan.
