I still want to dieMy life isnâ€™t that hard. My parents still support me financially. Iâ€™m in college and am engaged. But i always want to be alone and when Iâ€™m alone, I want to just not be alive. What do I do? I go to therapy ~weekly but it doesnâ€™t really help. I am miserable, but canâ€™t get myself to do anything to change that.
