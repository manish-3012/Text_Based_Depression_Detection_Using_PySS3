Slow Suicide for this WussI have a whole heap of mental illnesses and I can't get behind the idea of this being my quality of life. Everyone just keeps telling me to "wait it out," but the problem is that I always end up suicidal again and I'm sick of the rollercoaster. Unfortunately, I'm lucky enough to have friends and family who love me, and they're the only things that have kept me on this earth for as long as I have. I don't have the heart to end my own pain and cause them so much more, so I've decided to let my eating disorder kill me. It will take time, of course, but I'm a patient person and it already almost took my life once before. I'm not too far away from that weight now. Thank you for all being here and posting your stories, thoughts, and feelings. This subreddit always makes me feel less alone.
