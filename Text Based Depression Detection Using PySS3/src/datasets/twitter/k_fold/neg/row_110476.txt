Bye.It hurts cutting, it hurts washing them, it hurts getting into bed. It hurts but itâ€™s so satisfying, itâ€™s like punishing myself for ever living. My life isnâ€™t bad, but I just do it.  Itâ€™s addicting.

Iâ€™ve tried to cut a vein in the past, Iâ€™m aware of what will happen but still. I know I shouldnâ€™t be thinking this, I know Iâ€™m sick. Iâ€™ve heard it all before, I know but I canâ€™t control it. I have a demon in my head that insults me everyday. Itâ€™s not my fault Iâ€™m always irritated, itâ€™s not my fault that Iâ€™m clingy, ITS NOT MY FAULT.

Iâ€™m not good enough...my art is not good enough, my life is a living hell. All I wanna do is curl up and die. You know Iâ€™ve said so many times before, that Iâ€™ll leave this place when Iâ€™m 18. Cut out all contact and start all over, but I donâ€™t think I can wait. I wanna be free forever, no more of this bullshit, I tried so many times to kill myself but Iâ€™m so scared too I canâ€™t move. Not this time, goodbye
