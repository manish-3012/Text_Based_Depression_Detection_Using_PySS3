My friend told me to come hereI have seasonal depression. No matter how many people try to help me, it doesn't get better. I have a boyfriend who also gets depression, and I'm afraid of triggering it with mine. I feel like if I killed myself, nobody would care after a week or two. I just make people upset with my depression.
