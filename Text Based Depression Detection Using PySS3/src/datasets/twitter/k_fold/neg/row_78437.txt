My dad gave me the silent treatmentItâ€™s the second to last week of school and I donâ€™t want to go to the last day of school. A little more info about me is that I hate school and people A LOT. 

I was arguing with my dad and out of anger, I said that I would be okay if school burst on fire and everyone else did inside as well. Of course I was just saying this just to express how I felt about school and maybe open up to my parents about my true self.

My dad stopped talking and gave me the silent treatment. I hate the silent treatment. I later stopped talking and decided to tell my dad to pick me up after school cause I have art club today. 

He still didnâ€™t say anything.

Before I could get off the car though, my dad said that he wouldnâ€™t pick me up since the school will be gone, why do so? He said he would also call the police too if I really wanted to. I told him that i just said it to show how much I hated school, I wouldnâ€™t really burn the school. He still didnâ€™t listen and just drove off.

Now I have extreme anxiety and suicidal thoughts. I shaking because I feel like my dad will never talk to me again and that everyone hates me because I canâ€™t keep my stupid mouth shut.

I might kill myself over this, I know itâ€™s a stupid reason but I canâ€™t deal with anything anymore. Iâ€™m done with the acting of a happy 14 year old. Iâ€™m too much of a pussy to kill myself but today might be the day I grow up and take responsibility of the mistake my parents decided to make.
