I'm done with it allI no longer want to be here I no longer want to feel this pain. I'm done with it all I've got no one left they all lied and turned on me. And especially her the only one I trusted turned it to be the biggest liar of them all. So I'm out done with it all. It's not right what they all have done to me. You don't make someone believe in you and turn on them in they're time of need. And you don't tell them you love them while you cheat. She's killed me took what I had left and destroyed me.
