I'm still aliveYou probably don't know and probably don't care, but i talked about running away and killing myself, it didn't work and I got caught skipping school by my friends dad. It was a very depressing day. Anxiety, anger, and depression is all still as bad, if not, definitely worse. Oh well. Just though I had to update for the couple of people that cares enough to respond
