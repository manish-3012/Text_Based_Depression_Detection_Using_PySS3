Extreme self disgust and shameI've done awful things that I cannot live with. I cannot understand how I managed to justify my actions to myself at the time, but now I feel that I do not deserve to live. I spend every minute terrified of the potential consequences of my actions. I feel constant shame and I know I deserve all of it. 

I want to be able to tell someone but I'm sure I would instantly regret it. It's too unspeakable and I would be burdening them. I've thought about this constantly for over a month and I believe the best thing to do is to carry on as though everything is normal and hope it goes away. But I can't hide how I'm feeling. I've cried to my sister many times and been unable to tell her why. I'm not an emotional person so she's knows something is deeply wrong. I'm scared my family will think I'm depressed and give me sympathy I don't deserve.

Sometimes I feel that killing myself would help. If I could, I'd stop myself from having been born.
