The long con. Looks like I'm in it until the bitter end.When I was 15, after 15 years of mental, physical, and sexual abuse from my mother, I was pulled out of school. I quickly lost the few friends I had, my mother made sure to see to that. I was completely and utterly alone, and my mother was thrilled about it.

I had no ambitions in life. I had no one to care, to offer kind words of encouragement. I grew fascinated with doomsday scenarios, and convinced myself in a mentally-unstable delusion that the world would end in 2012. I was happy about it.

I decided to essentially throw what little life I could have had away. I ate until I was a fatass. I didn't take care of my teeth. I let my health slip away, piece by piece. I made the declaration to myself that I would die by 2012. If not by the world's hand, by my own.

Well, it turns out I was too much of a pussy to end my life on my own. But I still decided to let my health decline, willingly. On purpose. Yet here I am, three years later. My life started to look up. I made friends. Moved out of that house. Met someone who loved me.

And my life is still in utter shambles. My SO is a debt-ridden college student. I'm too anxious to leave the house. I have no money to my name. SO has no money to theirs. My teeth are rotting out of my head, abscessed, and I'm damn sure they'll be the death of me soon enough. Sometimes I think "hey! maybe I do want to live out my life with this person." And I'm faced with the bitter reality that I'm fucking stuck here. Stuck. I have no money, money that I essentially need to live past 30 at this point.

I could work harder. I could better myself. But it's clear that I am stuck here forever. Stuck here to the end. I could put myself into debt for my health, but why? To burden the person I love? To extend this miserable life? I just wish I didn't have glimpses of hope to make me regret my life choices.
