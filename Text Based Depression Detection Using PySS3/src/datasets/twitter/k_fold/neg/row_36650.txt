I don't know what else to do.I'm not normal or good enough to live. I fuck up relationships and make things worse. 

I have anger issues and self confidence problems. What the fuck do I have to live for when I am about to go to college but I don't even think I will succeed at all. I just want to die because it feels like the only good thing I will do in this world. 

What's the actual goddamn point of living if I just wreck every single relationship I have, family or romantic. My family are better off without me. My romantic partner deserves better and is probably going to dump me soon so I just feel like hurting myself physically like I did to myself mentally all these years. 

I can't have normal relationships anyway because I'm an ugly useless shit head. It's stupid. It's so stupid.. I am stupid for posting this thinking I'm even slightly important. I'm not. I'm a fucking useless unimportant worthless loser. My parents regretted me anyways. 

Fuck this life.. Give it to someone better...

But then again.

I'm too cowardly to go through with it, so I should probably get help with that.. to actually go through with it..

Or just go back to thinking about it because I have such mood swings that in the next hour I can feel so much better but that's almost a lie as I still feel negatively about myself. 

It feels like my life has always been a fucking mess. I am a mess. I have no idea how to be normal and that is killing my will to live. So fucked up. Me that is.
