I've decided that I will end my life and I think I'm at peace with it...which frightens me.(First post ever. It's kind of long. Looking for support because I know I will end it, I'm just waiting for the right time I guess...)

Just turned 25 (female). Been in a good job since I was 19 and haven't stopped working. I've always been a diligent hardworking strong leader and have been Managing for about 3 years due to my skills. I have an identical twin sis who I love and adore her dearly. And two loving patents who have supported me all through my life. My story isn't as bad as most people that post here. To be honest, I lived a pretty damn good life. I was always the 'strong one' , the 'tough one' despite me being the youngest twin (..by 8 minutes..) and I just rolled with those titles thinking that's what everyone wants. Inside I never truly felt those things but for some reason eeeeeveryone saw it. I think I used to be confident in myself and held my head high. But when I think back on it I believe I must have been faking it so hard.

Then my father wanted to open his own business (in the same field I was already Managing for the past 2.5 yrs) so naturally I said 'go for it pops, I'm strong I can lead this new business to success and the whole family will benefit'. I crashed after only 1 year. And I sort of knew I was heading into depression. My bf loved me but I suddenly couldn't find joy in that relationship anymore, I suddenly couldn't find joy in anything. All I wanted to do was eat and sleep, hoping to sleep forever. I ended the relationship after realizing I was becoming severely depressed (thoughts and planning of my suicide were very prominent) and didn't want to drag that poor guy down with me (he deserves so much more than a miserable drag such as myself). 

I was overworked. Long weeks with little to no days off. Running a business is hard, really hard when everyone is looking at you for answers and you don't have any. Really hard when you can't stop and take not even a 5 min break to eat and people are staring at you because they need their break after clocking in only 2 hrs ago. I put on a mask instead. I faked my way for another year. I pretended to be strong physically but inside I was drowning. I made up the answers that I thought people needed from me. Parents ask for my advice on how to run things so I tell them but they always end up doing it 'their way' and fuck things up. Everyone would question me "well how come you don't have the answers " and I just wouldn't know what to say. 

I was all out. Burned out. My brain felt like mush. I began just going with the motions. I was an empty vessel. I had no opinion, no care. I showered less and less. Stopped caring about my looks. I ate whatever the fuck I wanted because who gives a shit? I certainly don't. Stopped wearing making and didn't go out at all...well I kind of couldn't anyways....I was at work all day and would normally crash afterwards from mental and physical exhaustion. I finally told my family I was giving up on life. I told them I have no care for my well being. I admitted that I have made plans for my suicide and have written my suicide note. They were devastating and said I need help. 

All of a.sudden work got really bad. 8 ppl quitting in 5 days. I took it personally. I thought it was my fault since I am the Manager. My grandfather died....this is my first grandparent to go. It really hurt. And I got into my first car accident which totalled my car that I fully paid off 2 years ago and I kept it in pristine condition. I called my parents immidiately and they were already telling me that I need to stop coming to work. They knew I needed help now with everything and they knew I wouldn't do anything if I kept having to come to work. God I love my parents. I'm so lucky.....why do I want to throw all this away??

I've been going to my doc now and she's prescribing various meds. None seem to give me any energy to get off the couch. I'm even worse now with my suicidal thoughts. Every night is a struggle to not get out of bed and go commit the act. I cry myself to sleep thinking about the pain I would be causing on my sweet loving sister, my other half, my best friend. It takes every fiber of my being to hold myself back but I'm tired. And I think I'm okay with it. It makes me happy knowing that I will be free soon. To ignore those thoughts of others people's pain and focus on my own current pain. I have no reason to keep going. I feel so useless and worthless. It's pointless to keep going because I just don't care....I don't want to get better. I just want to cease being here and be free.

Sorry it is so long.  Had to get it out. Currently putting some additions on my suicide note. I know it's going to happen. I feel it so close. Chest feels so heavy thinking about it. Makes me feel happy and sad all in one.....sorry jess, mom, dad.
