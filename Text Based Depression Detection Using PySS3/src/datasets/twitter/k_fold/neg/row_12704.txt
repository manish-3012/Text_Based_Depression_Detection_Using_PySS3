nonstop cycleI feel worthless everyday. My parents arenâ€™t supportive. No one near me understands depression or severe anxiety. My dad told me to â€œjust stop worryingâ€. Iâ€™m going to college. My classes are so difficult. I canâ€™t focus. I failed 4 tests and I want to kill myself. Iâ€™m wasting time. Wasting money. Iâ€™m not good at anything. Iâ€™ve gained so much weight. My boyfriend doesnâ€™t know I want to kill myself tonight. The last time I told him I wanted to die, he told me to never say that again. I know he loves me. He doesnâ€™t want me to die. I canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m in debt. Always worried about my account being negative. If I donâ€™t pass my classes this semester I will be disqualified for financial aid. Which means I wonâ€™t be able to finish college. Which means Iâ€™ll be stuck at my dead-end minimum wage job that treats us like shit. My parents will remind me again how much of a disappointment I am. My mother will insult me again like she always does. Im lost. I donâ€™t have friends. I isolate myself and sometimes that makes people not like me. I stopped taking care of myself. So now Iâ€™m fat. Iâ€™m broke. Iâ€™m depressed. I cried on my way home today. I just want to end it all. I donâ€™t know how to do it. I just donâ€™t want it to hurt.
