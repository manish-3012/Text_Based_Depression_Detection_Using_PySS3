Wait the police, REALLY?So basically I was talking to someone about how much I want to kill myself on a sort of forum, then the guy told me some crap like ''try this or try that'' so I just stopped aswering, then I forgot about all that for a few days until the damn cops showed up at my house at 3 am ready to break down the window to get in because ''someone'' wanted to kill himself... what. the. fuck?!? HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP??? now if there is one thing that it did, its that I won't EVER talk about my problems to anyone anymore. GREAT JOB, you're happy now?!? Because I know that now I have to deal with paranoia on top of all my other damn problems...
