Nothing worksWhen I finally got diagnosed with depression I got on meds but now after 3 years I still don't feel good and also I'm stupid it's like my brain died, I used to be pretty smart but now I'm thinking extremely slow and my memory is non existent and I'm unable to make a short conversation about anything. I hate what they did to me and I'm scared I'll never get my brain back while I'm still feeling suicidal. I hate these drugs i wish I'd never started taking them they didn't help only made it worse and recently I've been feeling worse and worse and I lost hope and I'm so stressed out I have to strength to cope with anything
