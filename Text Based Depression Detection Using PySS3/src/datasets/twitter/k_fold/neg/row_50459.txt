Can't do this anymoreI have decided that in one hour I will rid myself of all this misery.  I am tired of feeling bad and having no where to turn or no one to talk to.  At this point I have no friends or family because now that I have nothing to give, I've been dropped.  I'm tired of calling the hotlines and being put on hold for long periods just to have someone rush me off the phone because the fact that I called was a big deal and difficult for me.  Its not temporary as it has been 30 years of feeling this way.  Its just me everyday, no one calls or checks on me so no one will miss me.  I just don't see an end to this misery.  Tried meds and therapy but resources are limited and its difficult to get recurrent appointments.  Even went so far as to call some places as I considered voluntary commitment but beds were full.  To me this just says there is only one solution to my problem. Sorry I posted this here just needed to vent one last time
