life is over for mei am a environmental chemistry student and a 5th year. I hope to graduate this spring. But I am suicidal because i feel like i failed in life. Before entering college i wanted to be a pharmacist, but i realized it was too hard. But I still continued by major and i do not like it. Right now my gpa is really shitty. I just want to find a job even if it's not related to my major but i don't know how. I feel like I cannot compete with everybody because i Have nothing no experience, no good gpa. I feel like i let my family down and I am so devastated with that. I want to be a nurse but i feel so hopeless.
