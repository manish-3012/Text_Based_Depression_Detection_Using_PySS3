I need some advice for my friend.Context: I have a friend that is in rough shape. I wont go too much into detail, but she had depression for 3 years now, starting from the point she was raped by her uncle I believe. I would be there to help her, but I live across borders from her (I'm in Canada, and her in USA) so I cant really do anything to help her besides be active on Discord for her to talk to. I was planning a trip to where she lives (Got address from one of her friends.) And visiting her after I get out of Secondary. I called the cops before (Kinda  a big mistake) sent her areas she can go to get help, but nothing seemed to have work. Her depression is triggered by so many unfortunate events, but after that, she gets better, then repeat. She has a atrong mentality, but shes going to eventually hit a breaking point. What can I do. Note: I am not suicidal in the slightest, and Ill admit if I need help, but my focus is on my friend.
