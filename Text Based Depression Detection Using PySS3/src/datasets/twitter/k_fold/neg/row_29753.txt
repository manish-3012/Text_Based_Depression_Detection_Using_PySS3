iâ€™m tired of livingi know i canâ€™t kill myself even tho i want to so badly. iâ€™m 16 and i have my mom and dad who love me. if i killed myself theyâ€™d be devastated and i canâ€™t do that to them. iâ€™m their only child and i feel so selfish every time i think of killing myself. and that makes me hate myself even more. 

i donâ€™t know what to do. every time i try to talk to my therapist about this she laughed at me. or made me feel even more bad about myself. 

i feel like iâ€™m stuck i just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore
