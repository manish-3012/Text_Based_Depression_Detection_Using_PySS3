I just feel trappedI'm 24 and live with my sister who is just using me for money. I work a fast food job and bring home
About 630$ every 2 weeks but am forced to pay 500$ a month for rent even though she makes more than enough to cover her own utilities. I'm also forced to babysit my nephews and nieces everyday who are just terrible they can literally get away with murder, it's like talking to a brick wall with them. My only escape is drinking, I drink mostly everyday to try to at least forget my situation. Honestly the only reason I'm still alive is that I keep telling myself that I can get a better job and get out of here but with the Corona going on people aren't really hiring so I'm just stuck here doing the same thing everyday. If I don't get my shit together by the time I'm 26 I'll probably just drink myself to death, I can see it coming I mean haven't even started a career, I have no savings, no car, and social life. All I have is a drinking problem, debt, a muliputive sister, and a GED.
