Planning My Death at 28I've had recurring depression and suicidal thoughts since I was a teenager. Now at 28 I've recently started antidepressants, and things seemed to get better until recently. What probably triggered the depression this time was a rough year with a bad breakup, getting laid off, and the difficulty and rejection job-hunting. I got help, got anti-depressants, got a new job where I make more than I did before, and my friend who was allergic to her kitten asked me to adopt him and I adore him. Things were looking up, but the past few weeks, the old feelings have come back with a vengeance. I'm having a hard time getting out of bed, cry all the time, have lost all interest in my creative outlets, and have self-doubts in my new job, wondering if I'm cut out for it. 

This isn't the first time I've planned my death. I have a will written up that I want to get official and get a lawyer. I have life insurance policies both through work and independently. I want to die before my loved ones, before my mom, before my sisters, before my friends. I know that is beyond selfish and makes me a bad friend, sister, and daughter, but I can't bear the thought of losing them and am more content with the idea of dying and leaving them with money to live better lives. Most of their stress is financial, like how my mom works three jobs. I don't have a method planned, I just know it can't be obvious suicide, because then it would be pointless.

I have it in my will I want a bio urn, I want to become a red crepe myrtle tree. I want to go back to the earth and make new life with my death. I want a celebration of life where my family and friends plant my tree. I have a playlist of music including Halestorm's "Here's To Us." I know on a rational level this is morbid, but wanted to write it and vent my feelings.
