broken spiriti feel like my spirit is broken. i never knew what that really meant but now that iâ€™m feeling it iâ€™m sure i have a broken spirit. i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve ever been so depressed in my life in such an un-escapable way. i have not been able to escape this feeling of heavy and dark sadness for about a month and i feel like iâ€™m literally suffocating. itâ€™s non stop.i will feel a bit of happiness for a second with my cat at times but the darkness very quickly diminishes that . i donâ€™t care to change it anymore. i can feel it in my chest the most and all the way down my legs and to my fingertips. i donâ€™t know how else to explain it but that. i feel it everywhere all the time. itâ€™s so heavy and i canâ€™t eat or catch my breath. being around people and talking is absolutely dreadful. eating is disgusting and i nearly gag just trying to eat a bowl of oatmeal. i canâ€™t live like this anymore but i donâ€™t want to change it. the only way i want to change it is just to end my life because i canâ€™t be bothered to try again.there is only so much i can take.and this sadness is too much and i canâ€™t bear to feel it much longer it seriously physically is painful and no way to live. i feel like to be able to fix this i would actually  need to be hospitalized and i will not do that. i feel unsafe driving. i dissociate all the time and that combined with obsessive thoughts of how to violently hurt myself makes me think it doesnâ€™t matter because none of this is real anyways and iâ€™m just in a dream and iâ€™m just watching myself go through the motions but iâ€™m
not even living anymore. this is unbearable .
