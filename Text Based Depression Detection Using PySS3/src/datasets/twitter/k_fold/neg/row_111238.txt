Need advice for rebuilding life.Long story short: 29 year old woman living in a "big city" environment with partner of past 5 years (and only partner ever). He wants to break it off and that means I will lose him, my job and place to live. I can't go back to my Mother's as she doesn't want me there and sister is pregnant in a small house with baby due soon.
I made the mistake of telling him I wanted to kill myself when he told me he wanted the breakup, now he and his co-workers think I'm a manipulative bitch even though suicide was my plan for when life got too tough anyway. I'm still here as promises have been extracted from me not to go through with it so I need help to try and salvage some kind of life where I can work, pay my bills and let him get on with the life he wants without me.
