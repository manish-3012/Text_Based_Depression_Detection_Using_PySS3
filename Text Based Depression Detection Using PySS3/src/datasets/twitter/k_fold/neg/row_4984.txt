Itâ€™s all so emptyLove or no love Iâ€™ll still feel fucked up. Maybe I shouldâ€™ve said something sooner? Even then I still wonâ€™t be worth anyoneâ€™s time. Doesnâ€™t matter how much I write, or cry, or plead. It wonâ€™t change anything.   I canâ€™t stop regretting the fact that I shouldâ€™ve killed myself sooner. Living just to watch myself waste the best years of my life. Just to throw it all away. Iâ€™m so tired of occupying space in this world. I feel like words wonâ€™t help, it doesnâ€™t matter what anyone says to me. I still want to be dead. Just give me a hand full of pills, take me to a tall building and Iâ€™ll jump. Give me rope and Iâ€™ll tie a knot. The truth is there isnâ€™t anything out there... and it just gets worse for me from here. Iâ€™ll never be anything...
