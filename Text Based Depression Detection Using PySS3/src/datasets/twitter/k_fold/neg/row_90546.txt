Maybe it's time to be done...I can't do this anymore, I'm fat as fuck, don't have any real friends and my life is falling apart.  5 years ago I lost a lot of weight and thought that my life had found a purpose... but know I'm ugly again, and my dream university has turned out to be just more depressing for me...

I love writing and watching Movies, but my passion is slowly disappearing. I hoped one day to make my own film and be in Hollywood... but I'm too fat for that, I don't have any money or will to live.

I love my family, but they are going through a rough time (My mom is bipolar) and I'm sure I will be just a bargain... I have plans with so called friends (We planed a trip through europe), but I don't want to do anything. I'm just a fat, ugly, stupid asshole. I'm not even sure my psiquiatrists and psychologist can work with me anymore...

I never had a girlfriend and no one will be able to love me. I'm turning 20 years old next week and I'm fucking tired... I don't want to go anymore....

I wish Thanos would have fucking snapped me out of existence...
