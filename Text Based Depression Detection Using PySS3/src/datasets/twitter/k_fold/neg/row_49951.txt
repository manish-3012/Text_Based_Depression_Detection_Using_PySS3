Need help for a Suicidal friend in VancouverIm in another country. Idk what to do. He hasn't been himself. I believe he's originally from BC but yesterday he drove to Vancouver because he was "bored". He's in a hotel room rn, doesn't sleep much. Ive just told him to call a friend. Waiting for a response to confirm he is. What can I do?
