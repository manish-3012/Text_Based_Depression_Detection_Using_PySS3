This is my storyIâ€™m a fucking simple boy that came from a poor family. I have a lot of bad experiences growing up. I experienced spending the night on the streets with only a box as my bed. My parents are always fighting. We donâ€™t have much. There are times where we donâ€™t eat. For 17 years now Iâ€™m very happy that Iâ€™ve defied some of my lifeâ€™s misfortunes. ALL BY MYSELF. All I want is for me to finish college and hope for a good life after graduation. Right now I was able to get a scholarship in a prominent university in our country. I am often the misunderstood child in our class. Maybe because I am different. I am always alone. What I hate the most is how my parents act like they are doing everything for us when they actually do nothing. My father keeps on telling us how exhausted he is on his job. HOW THE FUCK WOULD HE BE EXHAUSTED IF HEâ€™S FUCKING JOBLESS AND USELESS. The job he is pertaining to is his responsibilities at home like doing fucking dishes, doing the laundry, and fixing stuff for maintenance. My mother, on the other hand, feels so entitled with all of my hard work that she want the money that I get from my scholarship. HOW THE FUCK WOULD I STUDY IF I DONâ€™T HAVE MONEY FOR SCHOOL. I really hate how I am doing everything for myself and still get them as my parents because they are really shitty. I am already against everything and the problems that they give me are so burdensome. I donâ€™t even have good friends to talk to and if I can only kill myself painlessly, I already did.
