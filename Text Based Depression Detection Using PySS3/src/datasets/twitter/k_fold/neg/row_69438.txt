Chances are you scrolled past a post of someone who is no longer here.Well, if you clicked this post. It's literally about to be me. 

I've had my suicide letter written for about a month now. 
I really think I just need to do this now.! Live a happy life! Dont let anyone bring you down! Live the best life you can. Good will come eventually. Small steps of progress before you can get that happy outcome. Living in the moment can be fun, but sometimes living after the moment can be hard.
Even if we dont get along, I still wish you have a successful life. I could never wish a bad life upon someone. 

I'm trying to boost your mood up and boost your motivation because I dont want anyone to be sad for my suffer. 

I love you all! Even if I dont know you. I still love you. â¤
