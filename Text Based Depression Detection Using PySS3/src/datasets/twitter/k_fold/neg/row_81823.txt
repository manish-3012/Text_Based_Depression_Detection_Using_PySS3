I'm just sad and lost, and the severity of this has been increasing over the yearstheres so many things I want to do with my life but I dont think I'll ever be able to do them. I want to be a record producer but know literally nothing about it, and at twenty years old its probably too late to learn enough to be successful. I'm still trying though. I want to travel but I don't have a job, I don't even drive. I just feel this cloak of darkeness surrounding me and it comes and goes but lately I can't shake it. I don't know what to do anymore. I hate being like this, I feel weak and powerless. I've stopped caring about asinine things because I don't even want to be here. I don't even want to be here anymore. Its so exhausting just to live. I hate college, I hate my life, and I've been starting to hate myself. I don't know how to change it. i feel like I'm watching my life pass me by - thats how detached from reality I am. And I'm scared. scared that in another three years, I'll still be in the same place both physically and emotionally. The thought terrifies me. I'm 20, I can't imagine being 25, let alone 30. I can't continue like this, I don't know what to do
