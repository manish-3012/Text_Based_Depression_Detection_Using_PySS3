My note, sort of.New account because I don't want the friends linked to my old one to see this for obvious reasons.

I have just been writing down my thoughts the past months/weeks, I call it the logical choice, thought it would be of help to someone to post it here (I guess).

&amp;#x200B;

//note

In this document I will simply be writing down my reasoning and thought patterns on this subject.

&amp;#x200B;

Although, should such a fate be in my future, I hereby shall write an unofficial short statement:

\- My remains shall be buried properly in a location my relatives see as fit, do not mistake this as me caring about my remains, this will just bring my relatives closure.

\- All of my belongings shall be equally distributed amongst my brother and sister, besides the following items:

	\- \[private item #1\]

	\- \[private item #2\]

	\- \[private item #3\]

&amp;#x200B;

Suicide is broadly seen as a selfish choice, although in some cultures it is seen as a way of redeeming your family's honor if you have brought shame upon them,

if one takes their relatives and other close ones out of the equasion, suicide can be seen as a logical choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Your own lifeform seizing to exist will have no impact on the universe, since energy cannot be destroyed, it will simply transfer somewhere else.

A human lifespan is so insignificant in comparison to the universe, we might aswell never have existed in the first place, in 100 years your impact on those close to you will have faded too.

&amp;#x200B;

Animals are not aware of their own mortality, thus they don't have to deceive themselves into believing a purpose which only serves to distract them from the fact that death is inevitable and that their life is completely insignificant in the grand scheme of the universe.

&amp;#x200B;

I find myself not capable of following the logic of other suicidal people, all of them put so much emotion and irrational thoughts into this final decision.

Unlike these people I do not feel joy or sadness thinking about this particular subject, as the name of this document says, I simply find it a logical choice if you do not consider other people their feelings.

&amp;#x200B;

I have overcome all hardships life has offered me so far, and have lived through many moments of joy in between, I just came to the conlusion that my life is trivial and does not matter in the grand scheme of all things, and I came to the conclusion that simply waiting for death to come and fade slowly into nothingness is simply illogical.

Instead why not choose for a quick and easy way out, while your body is still in (semi-)decent shape, and you do not have any real physical complaints (besides scars, open tissue with dead nerve endings, ...).

&amp;#x200B;

My emotions have been flatlined by psychiatric medication, so I could behave normally in a way that others deem so, which has made my life extremely boring, I feel neutral about practically everything.

I do not have any desire to do anything, nothing peaks my interest, even our primal behavior of finding mates/procreation does not interest me anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

People would obviously make the arguement in my place "well just stop taking them", but then comes life with daily paranoia, visual &amp; auditory distortions and anger triggered by the most random events.

&amp;#x200B;

In short:

I do not see the purpose of living a life being incapable of enjoying it, or the life of a social reject.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you want from me?

Why don't you run from me?

What are you wondering?

What do you know?

Why aren't you scared of me?

Why do you care for me?

When we all fall asleep, where do we go?

&amp;#x200B;

Update on my personal feelings/thoughts:

&amp;#x200B;

I stopped taking my medication, since I feel it does nothing for me but keep me from feeling anything at all, I haven't slept properly in weeks, my thoughts keep getting darker and darker again, the sounds I keep hearing keep getting more frequent, waking up to my own voice shouting at me has also happened a few times now, I feel like everybody is talking behind my back, can't go outside alone without having the feeling somebody is looking at me, I find myself looking over my shoulder every 30 seconds or so.

I keep thinking my neighbors are home, yet they arent, it keeps getting harder to find joy in anything, I cannot find myself capable of finding a partner, since I am too emotionally unstable and my thoughts fuck me up every time somebody tries to get close to me, I don't want to get close to anyone, because I know I'll end up hurting them and/or end up pushing everybody away because they would be better off psychologically without me, yet I feel starved of love.

I just want someone I can love eternally who won't betray me, but I don't think it would matter even if I let them get close, since as previously mentioned I would just end up hurting them.

Fighting for the only people that ever truly cared about me has left me with countless scars on my hands, back, face, chest and knees, and it is hard for me to find somebody who even accepts what I did in the past to get by.

Yet against all odds I found somebody who is quite the opposite of me, and still understands me, a girl simple in nature who is sweet, kind, smart, all good perks a person could ever have, but I don't see/talk to her as often anymore.

Talking to her clears my head of bad thoughts as long as I'm around her and makes sleeping easier, my deepest wish is to just hold her in my arms, our fingers locked together, kiss her and just drift away, but she probably just sees me as another friend, which is probably for the best.

I don't know how long I can keep going with this joyless, loveless and meaningless life while my mind keeps drifting further away.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't cried in years now, not even at funerals, close friends dying, family members litteraly drinking themselves to death and I still can't, I feel like doing so, but I can't.

&amp;#x200B;

Even though my body is in a trash state, and has had to endure years of substance abuse, I still hope that atleast some of my organs can still be useful as donations.

I do not hold grudges towards anybody and nobody should think its "their fault", some of you probably saw this coming though, I do want to thank the following people for making a difference in my life:

\- \[Best friend\]

\- \[Sister\]

\- \[Brother\]

\- \[Childhood friend #1\]

\- \[Childhood friend #2\]

&amp;#x200B;

I keep seeing people on suicide threads that try to make it out as if "this is just a dark period in your life, things will get better, etc" and all that other bullshit, it never gets better, they try to apply some logic that worked in their life to yours, my feelings of indifference towards the subject have moved to a final breath of relief.

&amp;#x200B;

Hey \[girl mentioned in the section about personal feelings\], thanks for brightening my last weeks, it's probably better that I don't write anything directed towards you, since you had no idea about my feelings towards you and how you helped me, anyway, just know that I love you and because you love the show, I couldn't not include this:

See you space cowboy.

Sorry for the screams at night, if you even heard them at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Please forget about me,

Bye.
