Life InsuranceWelp, my life insurance was part of a suicide bet I had no control of and since then a group of people have been trying to break me down and force me to kill myself. I heard about gamblers doing it for â€œmore excitementâ€ but as the target and while seeing all the gaslighting and targeting itâ€™s truly depressing.
They have been trying to make me so chemically frustrated lately that I will finally take my own life. I have been a sexual target for years now and they somehow made sadistic rape legal. I am not hopeless but I look around and see no hope. I didnâ€™t deserve this and since 2015 Iâ€™ve been fighting to live. The things I know now though about the technology that had been invented go enslave and break people in, itâ€™s a bottomless pit of sadnesS with no bottom. I donâ€™t really remember what itâ€™s like to not hate everyone around me and I canâ€™t wait for the day I am not so full of rage I want to explode but itâ€™s now going on year 4.....I think I can I think I can....
