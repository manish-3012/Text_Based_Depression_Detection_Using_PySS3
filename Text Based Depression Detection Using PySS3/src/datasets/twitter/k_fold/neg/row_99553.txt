Just someone to talk to.hi, im 17, not suicidal all though i have thought about it. im sure people have it much worse than i do but im handling this very badly.
my life sucks right now, im doing IB (international Baccalaureate) and this course right here really knows how to piss you off. i have a maths coursework subject to think about and the title was supposed to be in last friday, i have my extended essay (4000 word essay) title which was supposed to be in last monday. i have friends, none really close though, and i have a girlfriend who i really care about, and we both know this wont last forever as we then need to go to uni and chances are we wont be close to each other so we are realistic about things. but i am SO scared about loosing her, shes a solid 8.5, im a 7 at best. shes so important to me, shes someone i can always talk to, she helps me with my work, doing most of it for me actually and im scared if i lose her shit will only go down the drain. 
im not asking for people to tell me things like "you can make it without her" bullshit thats not why im here, im here because i want someone to talk to, a friend, who can help me and maybe i can help them in some ways if they need help too.
i know there is no structure to how i just wrote that but i cant be bothered to just go over it and fix it.

thanks reddit
