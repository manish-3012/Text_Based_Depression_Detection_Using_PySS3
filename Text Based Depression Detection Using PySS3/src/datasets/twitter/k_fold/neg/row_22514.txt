To anyone I've spoken to and will speak to.I may not be able to help you, but I can assure you I will try my hardest and won't just give up. I may not be able to change things for you, but I'll do my best to be a friend, or just a listening ear when you need it. I won't always be online, but I will always reply as soon as I can. I will always be here for you, for years to come. If you message me 5 months later, I will remember you, I will be glad to hear from you, and I'll do all I can to make you feel okay, or at least a slither of a margin better. If I've spoken to you in the past, I hope I helped in some way. And if not, I'm so beyond sorry and I hope you found peace in whatever decision you went with in the end. I care about all of you immensely, and I haven't forgot about anybody. Please stay safe, you deserve it. I love you all.
