I donâ€™t know what to doIm 16
Iâ€™ve had depression for a long time, since around 6th grade. My parents have tried to â€œhelp meâ€ but whatever they do it feels like they do it for themselves and not for me. The therapy was about family dynamic  or some other bullshit like that. Iâ€™m seriously contemplating suicide and have no clue what to do. I donâ€™t want to die but I feel like I have no other option. Everything I do feels like iâ€™m doing it wrong, all my friends basically ditched me and I have nothing to look forward to. I have no ideas on how to cope or help myself, I donâ€™t feel like I can ask my parents either. Everyday I just feel so alone. This year what really made me even more depressed is quiting a sport I loved doing because I felt like I was falling behind. I loved that sport with every bone in my body and fucked it all up because of how I was feeling at the time. Itâ€™s not a sport I can get back into either, A few weeks out of it and you loose everything you worked towards. Iâ€™m not sure where to start but I just need someone to help me. This is a throwaway.
