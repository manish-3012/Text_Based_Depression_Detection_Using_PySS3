Iâ€™m happy???They see me as a happy person, but deep down iâ€™m locked in a cage of despair. I canâ€™t tell anybody  about my situation even to my family or close friends.Itâ€™s so hard going through this alone, no one will care when you say you have this such feeling. They just think that youâ€™re making this shit out. It sucks to feel that you are fighting alone, bacause in the first place what caused this feeling is being alone itself, the feeling of there is no one you could run to..
