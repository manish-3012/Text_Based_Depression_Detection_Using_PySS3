Please, I just need motivation. I just need that final push over the edge. The straw that breaks the camel's back.I don't know why I'm such a fucking pussy at this, the deed should have been done years ago but I'm an idiot who can't seem to figure it out. I just need to somehow find the balls. Like why can I get right up to the edge of a high building but pussy out before actually jumping?!? It's so goddamn simple but I still can't go through with it.

I don't want to be here any more! I want to leave. I hate it here. I hate the people and they hate me. I hate how nothing's ahead for me except more failure and trauma. I hate how I'm unlovable and have no qualities that would make someone even pretend to care about me. I hate how I'm disposable. I hate how other people can at least charm or manipulate others into liking them but I can't even do that.

I'm so fucking sick and tired of being alone and scared shitless and constantly in danger and helpless to do anything about it. I'm so fucking sick and tired of the worry and the pain and the nausea and the crippling anxiety and the night terrors and the fight to survive physically and emotionally. I'm so fucking sick of being used and made a laughingstock and a scapegoat and target practice for other sick depraved individuals. I'm so sick of hating and being hated. I'm so tired of it *never* ending.

I didn't even make the decision to be here but somehow I'm the selfish person for wanting to leave.

What can I tell myself so that I *don't* chicken out this time?

I'm so fucking done.

Please.
