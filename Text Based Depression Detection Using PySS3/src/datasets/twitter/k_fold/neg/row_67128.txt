I promised i'd give help one more tryEarlier today i stood with a rope in my hands intending to end it. When i was about to tie the knot a huge amount of guilt hit me, so i decided i'd give help one more try. I put the rope away and went to the ER to get myself put in hospital and they just told me off and Said "go see your GP tomorrow". Now i am sitting here even more depressed and i still feel as just as guilty for my baby boy. I can't shake the thought of ending it tonight or tomorrow morning. Not sure what to do right now.
