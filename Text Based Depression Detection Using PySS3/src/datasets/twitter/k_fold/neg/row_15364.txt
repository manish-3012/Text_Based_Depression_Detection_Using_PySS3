Nothing to look forward toI have nothing to look forward to, no one I want to talk to, ever (except psychiatrist), no one I have any emotional attachment or any kind of dependancy on, no one depends on me, I donâ€™t want to be here, Iâ€™m waiting for the right time. When I manage to extricate myself out of a couple of friendships and get my shit together, and people can roam free again so they will be distracted, I want to disappear forever. Iâ€™m sorry, Doc, I just canâ€™t stay.
