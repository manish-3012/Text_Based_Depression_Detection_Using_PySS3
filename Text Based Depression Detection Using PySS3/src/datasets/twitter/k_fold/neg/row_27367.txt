Short and simple, I'm doing it tonight.I'm 22 and am disabled with schizo-affective and a panic disorder and irritable bowel syndrome (yes I'm being treated). And all my friends are doing so well and I'm just stuck here pulling in 600 a month. I want to work or go to school but I'm terrified of having stomach pain or a panic attack at work, plus my anti-psychotics make me tired all the time.




Tonight I'm going to hang myself because I'll never be able to hold down a job or go to college and I'm sick of being a loser.
