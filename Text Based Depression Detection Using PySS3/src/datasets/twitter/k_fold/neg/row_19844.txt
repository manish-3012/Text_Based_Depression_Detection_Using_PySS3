Before doing this, I want to say goodbye and...
I love you, mom, you too, dad. Y'all were incredible parents and friends to me. Caroline, I know you will cry when you read this but hey, I'm now in a better place, right? You know I had no choice, I tried everything I could but it seemed useless, the disorder is growing up faster than I thought and it won't stop. My mind had betrayed me again. I really want to hurt nobody. It's doing it again, it tells me to kill people, do illegal acts, but no anymore....
I'm trash. For some time I thought I could go out there killing random people before shooting my head up. It was a horrendous twisted mind-set going on through, you know it baby, but now i won't do it.  nobody deserves to be killed by a stupid suicide dumbfuck for nothing. 
I would give EVERYTHING to be normal and live happy but can't, I'm mental illness and have no total control of my acts, its so sad one day I could care of everybody and smile and the next one think like a serial murder. 

I'm right now really under the thought that nobodie has to pay for my pain, but just me. Im the only person who can stop this

I'm posting this here because I hope people who has this problem too just kill themselves. Don't screw up people lives, please. At least no innocent ones.

Goodbye everybody. Enjoy life!
