I cant take it anymoreTheres never any end to the pain and every time you think you can finally relax and be happy it all comes back twice as powerful

Im tired and exhausted and beaten and broken. Its taken everything I had just to make it this far and it cost me every part of me that i liked. I dont feel I dont sleep Im never happy and when I am its never for long

The people I trust most in the world couldnt care less and I cant even blame them because they shouldnt have to deal with me or my issues but it hurts anyway. And I hate that it hurts because I should accept it by now but part of me still feels like I deserve some kind of happiness even though I know I dont

I see no way out anymore. This is all going to go on forever until the day I lose even the pretense of love and hope and I just want to not suffer anymore

Ive never felt so bad before
