Dammed if I do, Dammed if I don'tI'm going to start researching a suicide plan. It's gonna be either pills or jumping. I can't do this anymore.
I feel like I can't win. If I die, my family will never get over it, but if I don't, I'm going to be fucking miserable for the rest of my existence.

Why the fuck was I ever born? I'm sucha fuck up,
