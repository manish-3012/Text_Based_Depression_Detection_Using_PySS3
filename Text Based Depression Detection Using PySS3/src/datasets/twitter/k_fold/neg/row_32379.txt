TodayIs the final knife in my back. I'm so tired..just let me pass away in peace. I'm tired of "fam", "job", "friends". I have nothing. I don't even want to live. Why me? Why am I still here? I won't make it pass my next birthday. I'll be better off dead, and I'm sure plenty of people will be happy once I'm gone. Just a pile of crap anyways. So fucking tired of life.
