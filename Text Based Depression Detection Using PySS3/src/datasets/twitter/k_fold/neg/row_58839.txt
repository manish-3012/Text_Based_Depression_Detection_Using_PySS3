Lost more than I thought possible since my failed OD 2wks ago- not failing TodayAround 3 years a close friend jumped from one of the highest easily accessible places in the county. worked for years at stage lighting and rigging, taking so risks I shouldve been gone years ago and my brain knows that - today is peaceful- relaxing, calm, like I've found what I needed; just another jump, bit without  my harness crushing my balls. 

Haven't drank, haven't taken any meds, I am sober and calm. Years of being an alcoholic id rather my folks know I made this decisiom  with a clear mind

personal belongings distribute to fam/friends/needy. All debts bank accounts loans creditcsrds go to my seperated wife, shes nok  on them and a bunch of debt probably amounts to how much the NHS paid to sort  the brain damage she caused while teaching me a lesson
