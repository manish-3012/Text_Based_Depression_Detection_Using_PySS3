I'm tideI don't feel like I have anybody to relay heartfelt thoughts to so I guess the void of Reddit is the place.
I'm tired..tide..whatever you wanna call it..
I'm tired of being the only one to rely on,
I'm tired of nobody trying to understand my feelings even when I verbally express them as best I can..
I'm tired of feeling not good enough for my friends, for relationships, for my job, for my life.
I'm tired of feeling Up and happy and then the crash of feeling low and then being lonely after. I know life is about ups and downs but I'm tired of being there for loved ones when they're down and they're nowhere when I'm the same..I'm tired of being scared for my sister's health, I'm tired of feeling like I'm the only man in my family when there are 3 other's older than me to carry weight...
Most of all Reddit..I'm tired of the internet being my only net between my current life and potential suicide..I want someone I love to be the difference instead..
I'm still here, I'll still be here..
But I'm very..very tired..ðŸ˜ž
