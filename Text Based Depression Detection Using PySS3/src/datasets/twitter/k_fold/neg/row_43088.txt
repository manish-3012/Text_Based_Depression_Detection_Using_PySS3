I figured it out... it was my meds all along!A while back, I got suicidal thoughts. The kind that I acted on. Luckily, I got interrupted by my phone ringing. The physical pain I felt afterwards broke me of the spiral I was going down on.
 
At the same time, I ran out of meds and money to refill them.
 
My black thoughts were starting to go away a few days after I was off my meds. That got me to research what I was putting in my body. A common side effect of Clonazepam is increased suicidal ideation and depression.
 
Iâ€™m not taking those meds anymore. I feel better in my head vis-a-vis the suicidal ideas. My PTSD has came back in full force though... I guess I will need to talk with my doctor about it. 
 
For anyone who is currently taking meds and are still feeling these dark feelings, look them up. Ask your doctor about the side effects and know that there is a light to be found even in the darkest times.
