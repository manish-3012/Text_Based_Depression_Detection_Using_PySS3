I am here. Please message me if you need to talk, vent, or find help. You are not alone and my inbox is always open.I have suffered from depression my entire life and recently recovered though still fighting the last of my eating disorder. I promise you it does get better. I am here all night and day every day if you need someone. Please be safe and know you are loved- by me if no one else.
