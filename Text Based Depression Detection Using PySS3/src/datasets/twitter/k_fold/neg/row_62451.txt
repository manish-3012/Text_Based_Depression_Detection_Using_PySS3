Helping others, but not myself (also some advice for helping others)4 of my friends have come to me about depression and suicide in the past. Not for a particular reason beside that they trust me. All of which Iâ€™ve been able to help to different extents. Iâ€™m really am happy I was able to help them, and it gives me a sense of pride. But now I feel like Iâ€™m backed into a corner. I feel/donâ€™t want to be vulnerable in front of them now. I usually can keep things inside and deal with them myself, and have gotten better. But recently itâ€™s become everyday that Iâ€™m just depressed. I know I just need to reach out and say it directly but itâ€™s so difficult after feeling like you needed to be peoples support. I donâ€™t trust my parents enough to tell them either (I wonâ€™t get into that). 

I did tell a friend that â€œIâ€™m just tired of lifeâ€. And they went, â€œyea that feeling sucksâ€. 

I want to say this, and this might just be me personally. I Donâ€™t want you to tell me you understand this pain. Because when I tell you I have this pain inside and itâ€™s giving me suicidal thoughts, and you say, yea It sucks having that feeling, it makes me feel like Iâ€™m dumb for having suicidal thoughts because of that. I know this might just be me or a select few of people .And I know I should just say it out right, Iâ€™m trying to build up my courage to do that. 

I want to also leave some advice for helping people dealing with suicide, and depression. from the little experiences I have 

First, people donâ€™t need a reason to be depressed. A friend was very hesitant to reach out to me because she had very severe depression, and didnâ€™t have a real root cause to the depression, and was living a good life. Donâ€™t think you need a reason. Depression is a chemical in balance in the brain that can be caused by outside factors, as well as just randomly.

Secondly, donâ€™t assume you know the pain. You might be able to empathize with someoneâ€™s feelings, but you never can truly understand how theyâ€™re feeling. They might be in a situation where you could handle it on your own with no problems. But for them it could feel like (or even be) the end for them. When consoling someone I donâ€™t like to tell them I understand their pain, but rather itâ€™s ok they feel that way. There pain is ok to have. And then go from there. Usually tell them theyâ€™re loved, wanted, and needed. 

Note: I do know some people want to be told someone else understands their pain. Iâ€™m just saying when someone comes to you, to immediately opt for the â€œI understand your painâ€. 

Thank you for reading, to whomever wants to read a random teenagers rant
