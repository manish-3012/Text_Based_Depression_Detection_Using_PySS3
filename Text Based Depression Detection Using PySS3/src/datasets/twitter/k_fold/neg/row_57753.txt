I'm so fucking hollow inside, I just want to spend my life alone.I haven't had any kind of meaningful relationship with another person in over a year. I feel so empty. I don't even want to try to connect because I don't have the motivation to fall in love or to even have a close friendship with anyone. I've been ignoring my friends, drinking, and lying in bed hoping my heart will stop beating. I've made over 5 attempts to talk to someone new and each time I've never even gotten a hello back. I'm not a danger to myself, I just want to live a little longer and get a little more comfortable with myself so I'll stop craving unconditional care from someone. I want to take care of myself and just be alone. I can't stand the people around me. I love my friends but lately I can't stand seeing them. I hate myself and I'm projecting that hatred outward towards everything around me. My grades are in the shit. I'm amazed I even wake up to go to class. I'd like to lie in bed for my entire life and forget about the world.

Worst of all is that I have no sex drive. I'm not even attracted to people anymore. I'd rather stare at the ground or at my phone than someone of the opposite sex. I told my closest friend this and she thinks I might be asexual. I don't know, I'm just so hollow.
