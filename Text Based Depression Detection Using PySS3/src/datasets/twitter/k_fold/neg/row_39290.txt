i dont even knowsometimes i just want to die. i feel like i wont really do great or fun things in my life. i feel worthless and i dont think i will miss anything.
my life is good but i am not afraid to lose it.
this year i will graduate from high school. maybe. i always get bad grades no matter how much homework i do. nothing works, i cant remember anything need to learn for school. because of that i get those bad grades and i probably will fail my school exams. if that happens i have nowwhere to go, i wont be able to get the job i want. so whats the point of staying alive. 
is this normal? i dont know why i have this but im not in a rush to make it stop or anything.
