I cannot take another day of this uglinessI just cannot do this anymore. Why do I have to be so goddamn ugly? Why did I deserve to be this pathetic subhuman with zero physical appealing? Why me? Why? Please spare me of this insurmountable pain, I beg you world. I cannot go to work every day and see her pretending I don't care, knowing she couldn't think less of me for being this monster. I am worthless at her eyes and to everybody I start having feelings for. I am tired, tired of seeing so much beauty in other's faces and then looking myself in the mirror and wanting to vomit. Tired of hearing them talk about how handsome someone is, of seeing them flirting while I am left in constant sorrow. Tired of "friends" showing me their tinder matches while I don't have a single random match ever. Tired of hearing of their past relationships and lovers when I have never had even a single kiss.

I am tired of their unconscious pity towards me, sick of this loneliness. Tired of knowing no pill or therapy will ever change the way the world perceives me. Tired of the hate and rage I feel against myself, tired of knowing I will never know what is to be loved. Tired of this sick joke nature played on me...so much beauty, so close, but forever out of my reach.

I am tired of this life.
