Been daydreaming about suicide whole day againDays like that have been so frequent recently. I feel like i can't anything about it. I just get stuck and can't seem to bring myself to do anything productive. I just think about what impact my actions could make, how would people react and what's the best way to end it. My conclusins so far have been that i will be forgotten sooner or later, the world is gonna keep on turning and that the best way to end my life would be to hang myself or jump from high building. But i totally hate feeling like this and not being able to think about anything else. I wish it could just leave me forever but it keeps coming back. It's the feeling where i wanna cry so badly but no tear will ever show up. Even when things were going much better than nowadays i always had thoughts like this but now when loads of stuff is going bad it's even worse. I just really needed to get this off my chest
