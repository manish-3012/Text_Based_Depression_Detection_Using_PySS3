I'm ready. Let's get a do-overI am just done at this point. I havent felt good in over 10 years due to sexual abuse, constant bullying, and all my Dreams and goals going down the drain. I am religious and hope to God reincarnation is real. I want to get a do-over and just be born into a better life.
I am done with the struggle I have to go through every day thanks to my illnesses and diagnoses. I have been contemplating suicide for 10 years and now I just feel like "Whatever... Let's just do it already"
I am at the point of my life where death itself doesnt scare me, but what truly terrifies me is that I feel so fucking good thinking about suicide. It's really gone that far.
But, I might just try holding on a little bit longer Because I have a surgery I want to do that will hopefully help me. But if it doesnt, I'm done. Then I'm setting a time, place and method. Cant stand life anymore at that point. 
Just feel like life is way too rigged against people like me. Actually it's rigged even against people that were born into fortune. And if life is hard for even them, then it is fucking impossible for "us"
Thank you world, may you fuck yourself very hard.
