I loved and enjoyed lifeBut I cant take the pain anymore. 

20 years of breathing isnt that bad im not ungrateful. Maybe i didnt live a happy life but i lived an easy life for sure.

The world wasnt painfree but there was music,chocolate,beer,pizza,sleeping,friendships helped me to enjoy existence. 

I will kill myself tomorrow and i feel good about it. I can finally get rid of the depression nonsense. It really sucks when you can see beauties in life and cant feel/have any of it. 
 
Finally:After ive read topics on this subreddit i can honestly say i feel your pain even though i cant know completely what youve been through. And i love you, stop going hard on yourself and if you have hope -even if a tiny bit- go live your life before it gets imposibble.
