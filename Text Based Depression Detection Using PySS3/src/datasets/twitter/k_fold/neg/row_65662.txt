Today was a difficult day hope it is better tomorrowI finally had the courage to forgive my sexual abuser in a letter. Finally did it after the girl I was having dates with who is btw a psychologist said I am too shaped by the trauma and that it creates a weird dynamic. I decided to end things last Friday and today wrote a letter to my abuser to forgive her what she has done. Contemplating suicide but not making a plan yet. Donâ€™t know if I am just emotional because I forgive my abuser or if I am sad about the girl  I donâ€™t think I really want her back but I want her support in a weird way. Will have to figure it out maybe it is a combination of both. 

Really Weird that after this letter I became suicidal.  Dreading the night that is going to come because I will overthink and it will lead me to scary places. 

Hopefully tomorrow will be better.
