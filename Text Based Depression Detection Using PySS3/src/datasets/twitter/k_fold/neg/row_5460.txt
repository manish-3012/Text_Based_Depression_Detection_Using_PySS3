Its timeThis has been a long time coming and Im ready. I lost my career a few years ago and all my savings with it. I have tried to find other work but no one seems to want to hire an older man. My wife and I have not been intimate for quite awhile and I miss her but she doesnt seem to care. I have two kids and its obvious my son doesnt need me anymore. We used to be so tight and did so many things together. I understand tho. He is 18 and has his own life.

My daughter is 12 and is a typical pre teen. She doesnt seem to like me very much tho. Ive tried, no one and I mean no one can say that I havent. 
I am a burden and I know this. I can see it in their faces, esp my wife and my sons.
Ive accepted that this is how my life will be if I hang around, but instead I have made a plan that will insure my death and their profit. It wont look like suicide.

I dont drink or stay out or do stupid shit to my family. Ive always tried to be a good husband and father but the odds are so stacked against me this is really the only way out for me.

Not really sure why Im posting, anyway, ive talked to some nice people on reddit and I wish you guys the best
