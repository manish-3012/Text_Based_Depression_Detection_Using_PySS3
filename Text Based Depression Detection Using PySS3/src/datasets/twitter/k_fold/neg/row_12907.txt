I'm scared at how matter of fact my tendencies have becomeI've been chronically depressed for close to a decade now, and since i got into college it's gotten much worse slowly. At first it was a relapse into harming tendencies, but it happened so rarely i convinced myself it wasn't worth addressing. I hate myself so much and it keeps getting worse. I see the work of others and i can't hope to compare, people who are younger than me blow my mediocre stuff out of the water. i don't have imposter syndrome,I am an imposter. I get by with good enough grades to make it seem like im fine. I'm going to be a senior this year, and the only thing i've been planning on for the past four years is how to kill myself before i graduate because i know i'm not good enough to make it outside of school. i've never had a job, don't have any work good enough to put out there, haven't networked, and im just so tired. I don't want to try, and theres no reason for it. I have so much, a supportive family, good friends, talented teachers and peers that are encouraging and always reaching out, and it just doesn't fucking matter. even when i'm happy the pit is still there under it all reminding me that it's fleeting and that when im alone again it's all i have.
