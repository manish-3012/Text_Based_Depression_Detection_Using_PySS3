Itâ€™s hard to stay standingFor some context, Iâ€™ve been a goalkeeper for soccer for about 11 years. Iâ€™ve also suffered from depression for at least 3 years. At this point, Iâ€™m going into high school and play club. But now, I just feel like dropping. It might also have some burn out to help but I just feel like a failure. Iâ€™ve carried games, and have completely ruined others. But at this point, I just question whether or not I should keep going. Iâ€™m on a C team and cannot grip the ball nor am I making the simple saves or decisions. Iâ€™m just a idiot who cannot do the simple things. Yeah I can make a flying upper corner save, but a also canâ€™t even catch a ball hit right at me. At this point, I just have failed. I just want to end it all. End the looks of disappointment. End the pressure to be the best goalie. I canâ€™t just quit either. Then Iâ€™ll be a failure to me, my family, and teams eyes. Seen as someone who couldnâ€™t just push through it. Weak. A disappointment. Let alone the fact I do not get along with my teammates. Could I just take my life and just end all my suffering. Just escape the voices in my head of being a disappointment. Iâ€™ve tried seeking help. I donâ€™t want my parents to worry so I say â€œIâ€™m fine.â€ I have a therapist but that hasnâ€™t helped much. I say it has but it hasnâ€™t. Plus i have summer coming up. I dread summer because then all I have is time alone with my brain. Then I just criticize my laziness of not spending all available hours practicing or just being a straight up idiot. I donâ€™t know any way forward for me. I see no future for myself. Iâ€™m lost and donâ€™t know what to do.
