DreamsBasically, my brain is in a weird state. I walk bummed up all day, unless I have people around me, then I don't think about myself, but almost every night when I fall asleep, I dream about these veeeery happy moments. For example just sitting in a forest on a warm, sunny day, throwbacks to days when I was little and cheery. Then I wake up. Realising it was just a dream. It makes me so sad that I feel the best during my sleep. Am I the only one?
