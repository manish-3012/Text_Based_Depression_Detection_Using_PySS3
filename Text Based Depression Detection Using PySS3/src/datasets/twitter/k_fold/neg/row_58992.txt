Leaving my hometown for the last timeToday is my final day ever at home. I plan to end it on the 6th of January, if I can even make it until then. I'm standing at my doorway as I depart just taking in all the good memories I had here. My parents jackets are sitting across from each other at the dining room table and the Christmas tree is lit up. I'm going to miss this place and I'm so scared for my mom. She can't lose me but I'm too selfish to stick around. Idk anymore.
