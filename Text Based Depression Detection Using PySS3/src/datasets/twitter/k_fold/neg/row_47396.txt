SuicidalAbout a month ago I got into a really dark place, still here, And Iâ€™m realising  that Iâ€™ve been suicidal for way longer than just that period of time. I just now, one month ago, thought of it as depression before that I just figured everyone felt suicidal every once in a while. But not every day. It wasnâ€™t really like â€œI want to dieâ€ thoughts but I just kinda thought what if, and that I kinda wanted to know, kinda wanted to die. Also anxiety is bad. Idk if this is really relevant but I just figured Iâ€™d share. Also hurting myself is now a thing.
