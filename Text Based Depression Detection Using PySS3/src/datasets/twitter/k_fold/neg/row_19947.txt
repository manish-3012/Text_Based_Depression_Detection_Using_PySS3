I am just lost and hurtI am 17 and the last two weeks have been the worst of my life. I know it is stupid and everyone keeps saying it will get better but I just donâ€™t think it will. My girlfriend of almost 2 years broke up with me. The thing is I did everything with her there was never a weekend I didnâ€™t see her and I started to leave my friends behind. She is really good friends with all of my friends at least my old friends. I feel so lonely not a single one has asked me how I have been they have not invited me to anything. I just keep feeling this pain of everything I have no reason to do school I just sit all day and cry I just want everything to end I hate the pain the pain that wonâ€™t stop. I know this is stupid I just want someone to tell me how to stop the pain.
