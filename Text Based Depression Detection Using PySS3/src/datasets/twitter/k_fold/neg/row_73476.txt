Iâ€™m doneIâ€™m so tired of everything. Of the constant pain and rejection of society. Nobody would ever want to be with me. I was a fool to think this could be different.
My best friend died two weeks ago.
I canâ€™t deal with much of whatâ€™s going on.
I hate who I am. I hate l living. Thereâ€™s nothing tying me up yo this horrible life. And I know people could benefit from my death much greatly than my useless and pathetic existence.
I will spend another Christmas alone.

Itâ€™s time I fulfill all of my plans already. I donâ€™t know when or how but am experienced with failed attempts. Now I know where to not mistakes. I donâ€™t want to open my eyes ever again. 
Please kill me, I would give anything for someone to shoot me in the head. I hate everything.
I just want to die.
