I feel weird posting on here when Iâ€™m so private about my feelingsHere goes... for about 10 years Iâ€™ve had mild anxiety, mostly when doing something or going somewhere unfamiliar. However for the last few months itâ€™s been getting worse and worse, I never want to go anywhere, Iâ€™ve started getting anxious when being at work when Iâ€™ve been there for almost 5 years and never had a problem before.

I keep feeling like I want to just die, I donâ€™t think I would actually commit suicide because I feel awful doing that to my family, but I donâ€™t see what I have to live for. 

Iâ€™m now a 32yo female living at home with my parents and sister and the only thing in my life I enjoy is shutting myself away in my room and playing a game or watching tv. 
I had a partner of 9 years who I just didnâ€™t want to be with and so I ended the relationship last year and Iâ€™ve come to realise that I donâ€™t want the â€˜normalâ€™ things in life. I donâ€™t want a partner, I donâ€™t want children, I donâ€™t want to have to go into work everyday, I donâ€™t want to go out drinking and dancing and all that crap, I used to be working towards saving towards getting a place of my own but I donâ€™t even want that anymore. 

I canâ€™t not work for the rest of my life but itâ€™s getting harder to go in everyday and if I keep not going then I will lose my job which terrifies me, but I LOATHE having to be there against my wishes everyday feeling sick and anxious and on edge.

Like I said the only thing I enjoy in my life is being on my own playing a game or watching something, but everyone tells me thatâ€™s not living or itâ€™s no way to live, well why not when itâ€™s the only time I feel content. I guess Iâ€™m starting to think that theyâ€™re right and Iâ€™m just wasting my life but the alternative is a life I donâ€™t want. I feel like Iâ€™m just existing - not living, and itâ€™s a struggle to keep going, I canâ€™t see what I want for the future or possibly imagine what it will look like.
