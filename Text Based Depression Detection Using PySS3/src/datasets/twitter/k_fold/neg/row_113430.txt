I'm not going to do it now, but I'm worried I will later? Help?so basically I'm a lame ass teenage girl. I'm a little overweight and nothing I do can help me just lose it to the point where I can begin to feel comfortable with my body. I don't really have any friends. My girlfriend dumped me because long distance was too much for her and she's super happy and successful and moving on in life. I'm here stuck in my tiny hometown, and I can't even get things I want from my tiny town. 
I like acting. I like being in musicals and we're about to do my favorite musical here: The Addams Family. I really want to play Wednesday in it and it's my dream role - and I'm finally the right age for a role I like, but I'm so afraid I won't get it. 
I've done all of this prepping and it's kind of my last hope. 
I've lost everything that's given me a reason to look forward to the future. 
I don't feel like I have anything left. And please don't tell me that "there will be something soon" because I've been in a situation where it's "there will be something soon" since April and I'm just done waiting. I'm really done.
Sorry guys.
