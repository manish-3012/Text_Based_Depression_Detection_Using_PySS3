What's on your bucket list?I think about suicide from time to time, but I'm too scared to go through with it. I was thinking about a pseudo bucket list. One last hurrah before I resign myself to seemingly endless decades of depression and monotony.

What's on your list? All I got so far is to try hard drugs and pay for prostitutes overseas (illegal in most states in the US).

Maybe travel Europe since I do like Roman history...

Thanks for reading.
