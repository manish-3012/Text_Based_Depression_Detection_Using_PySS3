Are any of you trained to talk to a gay 18 yr old kid?  I'm over my head and need help. I and other redditors have been talking to him without much luck. None of us are trained and we need someone that knows what they're doing. In my comment history you'll find more on this. He's atheist, gay, lives in the kind of town that isn't very accepting, and he needs someone more qualified than I to talk to. This is not going very well so far. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you

Edit: I know a lot of you will be sure to suggest the suicide hotline but I've spoken with them and He will have to call them. They will not text message him (he refuses to speak to anyone). He sounds very depressed and needs a pro to help him soon.
