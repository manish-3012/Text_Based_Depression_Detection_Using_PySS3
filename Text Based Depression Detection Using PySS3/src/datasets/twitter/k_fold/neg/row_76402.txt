i need to talkhello,

&amp;#x200B;

i need to talk. english is not my mother tong, but i'll try to say few things that i have in me. i need to write it down somewhere, because i am alone, i don't have anyone to tell that to and even if i had someone to talk to i would not i think. i am in pieces. it's been few years since my life does not look like a real life. i struggle with keeping a job, struggle with the girls, i lost all my friends because they tried to help me when my breackdown happened but i kept doing stupid shit and nonsensical stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm 31. I had an almost perfect life until i was 25. i mean i had everything, money and friends and most of the time was with a girl and a normal mental health. but i felt sometimes a bit unconfortable, like i was alone even surrounded by friends or family. then it happened that my dad felt sick, mental illness, nothing we can do. he becam stupid, or let's say debilitated. doctors said he had between 5-10 years to live. ok... hard. then the same year, my grandpa died. i loved him. same year, break up with my long relationship girl. hard too. i became to get down, i was in my last year of master. 5th year. then my mom left my dad, my sister couldnt handle she converted to islam, she had problems for a few years couldnt find her place in life, struggled in school so religion helped her immensely. but for me it was way too radical, she just wanted to be full islamic like kind but religious, with veil and all that. no way to talk to her like a normal person since she had no education and converted to a sect, or a religion whatever. i lost her.

&amp;#x200B;

it was too much for me. i couldnt pass my exams in the second semester. i just did not attend.

then all the shit began. my best friends did pass and were graduated. they moved from the city, went on with their life. got a job and all. i stayed there. my brother couldn't handle all the shit that happened this year either. in september, when school begins again. i came back to my parents house and saw him in his bed at like noon. i said wtf are you doing, you don't have school? he said bullshit like heyy in a few days. ok, i am the elder, man move your fucking ass. he is 5 years younger than me. i said ok now go to school, what stops you to do so? he said i am a bit fucked, and anyway noone gives a fuck.. my dad sick and mom gave up. so since i had always been the successful one and i am kinda protective and strict with my brother and my sister, for their own good, i said ok bro. now i find you a school at the city i study in. you are gonna live with me.

i did so. i did find an appartment for 2 people and did call schools, withing the week. he was now at school again. i could start my schoolyear again.

&amp;#x200B;

that's where everything hit me in the face. i started school, but had no motivation since it was only few exams to pass my last year. and i had only few friends there anymore. i should say that i was very social, like almost i had loneliness anxiety. i could stay alone, but only few hours a day i needed to see people, hang out and go out, drink, dance, chat, have fun. it was less like that. and me, i was feeling more and more like i wanted to be alone. like i was in my problems and it was not worth hanging with people anymore because you know, i have enough problems i need to chill. was not a good sign.

begining of the year i had for 2 months the most beautiful girl i had in my life, still now, she is still wtf too much wow for everyone. she is a doctor, blond, best body, best smile, kind and sweet and not a bitch at all. like the best girlfriend. no idea how i got her, but i had the chance that she really liked me...... i fucked up. i should have said that i started to take cocaine at the end of the last year, when i couldnt pass my exams.

every friend of mine at tried, i was the last to try because i did not give a fuck. then when i was really down i said fuck it, ok let me put my nose in it. it was like nothing, couldnt feel something special. but my friend was laughing like he said, yeah it does nothing special, no immediate effect. you'll just be more talkative, more relaxed, more confident, and you'll not even know it. so it was a good night, i did like it. so i continued

to come back to the girl. i had time during the summer to take a lot of cocaine, because it did kill totaly my anxiety, it made me relax and feeling so good with myself. it was the best feeling. my best medicine.

so the girl, one day i got really drunk and on coke, during the day, then coke began to disapear so i was only super drunk and started to lose my memories. i met people, did chat and got drinks with them. only knew few of them before. good mood. then no coke, descent, super drunk. i said yes she is my girlfriend. they said wtf no no way she is just way too perfect. look at the messages, yes she is, but i can't feel in love. she is so sweet, but i can't feel anything. we talk, and too drunk at one point i say ok guys call her and tell her that it's over. wtf the guys i don't know laugh a lot, really jealous and being huge douchebags they call her. say something like yeah yeah ok he wants this story to be over. OK

she is not stupid, any excuse i could tell her the next day couldnt save me. it was over. that's it. i could see her few times in the next days but only to talk she was strict on the this is over, you deserve all my attention but not my love anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

ok at that point. i was in pieces. no girlfriend, because i did a lot of crap. couldn't save money, because a lot of drugs. no motivation, because my year seemed easy as i had to pass few exams. seemed like a waste of time. plus all the shit i had to endure the last year. and at this point remember i was living with my brother, since i took him with me to put him in school again.

&amp;#x200B;

one or two months after that. i had time to be doing nothing -i had nothing to do before the second semester- just doing drugs, playing video games, and seeing friends. less and less as i told you as for first time in my life i needed to see noone, and be totally alone at home. i didn't know why, i did know later. so after a couple of months, i met at a party a cool girl. small, dark hair, super cute face. younger than me, like i was 23 or something she was 13. we did make up this night. but nothing else. then one of her friend and the girlfriend of a friend of mine told me hey man, you should really invite her for a drink or a meal, she is the best girl ever and i am sure she likes you.. ok i was in shambles kind of. i said hm ok why not, later.

one month went way, then i decided to invite her. was good. we started to date. long story short, but important: we stayed together two years. and she did have an incredible courage to suffer all the shit that i threw at her.

&amp;#x200B;

so it's the last thing i want to share with you. i had this girl. i couldn't feel anything, couldn't fall in love. same problem as the previous. i knew i liked her very much and felt good in her company. that's all. i didn't know i had mental problems at the time. 

so the year continued. i had this girl. it was cool. but i was going deeper and deeper in drugs. in alcohol, and cocaine. and in doing nothing constructive. it was reallt strange because it was the begining of the state i am in now. the begining of the end, of all the end and the shit i suffer now for 6-7 years.

&amp;#x200B;

i did drive head ahead in drugs. i felt out of place, totally. couldn't handle seeing my good friends having a cool life, a cool job, and a project. i was there, just dead inside and waiting. i was healing myself with drugs. i did not know i was sick. my girl helped me understand i needed to see a doctor. i went, ok.. big breackdown. you need to stop alcholol and drugs, take medicines, and you'll get better. ok.

&amp;#x200B;

but no, i could not, i just took the medicines, and did drink a lot on it. i was getting crazy.

and now we can fastforward to now.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

i will just say that i could not make it go better. it's over with this girl. i couldn't pass my exams. i tried 3 years in a row. i just did not attend the exams. i was too down, too druged, too drunk, or just not there.

i am now 31, i still don't have my master degree. i had like 5 exams to pass. i have my bachelor, but did 2 years of studies more for nothing. actually 4 years because of the first 2 years, then the 2 next years i tried. it kills me to think about it.

&amp;#x200B;

it killed me to break up with the girl. just killed me. i had physical pain just by mental disease. it was harder and stronger and more painful than a toothpain. i wanted to die, i was hitting every wall i could. i was screaming, crying. just dying.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

anyway i loose my mind. i cannot concentrate that much. whatever

&amp;#x200B;

i am now totally dead inside. i have no family left, just my brother and a grandma. i did not talk to my other grandparents, my mother, my cousins, and other family members for 7 years.

i have not a single friend left. everyone tried to save me. it failed. but when i did make a progress, then it came back 2 times worse. everyone let me.

&amp;#x200B;

i am now totally alone. i can't keep a job. i tried 10 different medications. had 2 months in an hospital. read philosophy, psychology, theology, whatever it does not help me feel complete.

&amp;#x200B;

i am under cocaine. it's the 12th of the month i have almost no money left. last week i ended up a the hospital, overdose. 7 grams in a day. everyday for 10 days. i tought my heart would explode. 

i can't stop cocaine. now i am totally addicted. it's not even a medication anymore. it's just pure drug. i try to feel something, to get high. but i am too much used to it, i need huge quantities. bullshit

&amp;#x200B;

i can't handle it anymore. 2 weeks ago, for the second time, i did swallow all my medicines, 3 boxes. i somehow woke up the next morning. i was pissed and reliefed at the same time.

&amp;#x200B;

today i did write an email to a rehab/psychiatric center. i can't manage this life alone anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

i needed to talk.
