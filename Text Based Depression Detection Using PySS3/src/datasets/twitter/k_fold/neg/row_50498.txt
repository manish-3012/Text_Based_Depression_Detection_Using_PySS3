Odd that I'm going to the internet, but here I am.I'm posting under my username, not a throwaway.  So have some belief that I am not joking.  I lost my wife and career almost a year ago today.  pathetic, I know, with a year gone I should have easily gotten something going.  

Thing is guys, I'm fucking tired.  Really, really tired.  I just can't sleep, and I.....fucking need a rest.  Or a break.  Also, don't tell me to call 911, that would be a slap on the wrist and what I am looking at is a more systemic solution to the problems.

Also, people who say "ah, you will hurt people"  fuck off now.  I'm old, I'm tired, and everyone that I know has had to deal with tragedy, and they are old too and can fucking deal with it.  

its just the internet, I know, but is there any reason you all can give me not to just fucking take a nap?
