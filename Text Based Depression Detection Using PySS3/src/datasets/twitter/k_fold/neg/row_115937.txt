I'm afraid the ER won't believe meI've been planning to end it and have all the details worked out. I'm planning for tomorrow. But I've been thinking about maybe showing up to the ER instead just to see if I can be helped at all; I figure I have nothing left to lose, literally.   Even if it is just for a day

The thing is that the thought of going to the ER even if it's for a day calmed me down a small bit but now I feel like they won't believe me if i go because i don't look like I'm panicking. I just feel like I'm a problem nobody wants to deal with and I'm 50/50 about wanting to live but it's like i ran out of options at this point and not even the emergency option is an option
