Drug induced paranoia has brought on suicidal thoughtsAfter smoking weed, I thought i realized that the world was poitneless and there was no reason for anything in it.  nothing we do has any person because it all ends. so then i started to feel suicidal. it feels like nothing has any purpose and everything is fake.  i also worry that when this trip is over, i will still know deep down that this worl dis fake and nothing matters and i will then still be suicidial forever on from this moment, since i realized the wolrd was nothing.  please help.  this is not a joke.
