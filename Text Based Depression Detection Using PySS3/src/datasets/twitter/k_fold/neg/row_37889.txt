super poweranyone seen the show â€œafter lifeâ€ ? 
where the main character Tony describes the fact he hasnâ€™t killed himself yet as a super power? because now anything he does is bonus time he almost didnâ€™t have. 
i see life like that now. iâ€™m alive when i shouldnâ€™t be so who gives a fuck if i drop acid and shoplift a tesco thereâ€™s literally nothing i canâ€™t do.
itâ€™s fucking scary and weird but if i can get any fun out of this time i might as well
