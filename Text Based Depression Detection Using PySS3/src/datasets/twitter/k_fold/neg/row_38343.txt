Hello, end of tetherTwo years of divorce fighting.  Â£65k of fees and debt; literally to the life-ruining stage of things.  A great new girlfriend, whose life I feel like I'm ruining.  More games from my ex, less time to see my daughter, and the end of my career.

What does it take?  My parents are worried to the point it's affecting them.  My girlfriend is burned out and worried; again, to the stage that it's affecting her, and I don't want to ruin her life.  I don't have many friends.  My daughter's young enough to forget.

Today, I switched thought processes.  Most of the time I thought "you feel shit, but it'll get better; and you don't want to kill yourself, so that's a good sign."  

Now, it's more "you really want to escape and kill yourself, so all you need to do is come to terms with ending your life and get on with it."

It's cathartic typing it.  Thank you if you read, and all the best.
