I want this to end so badlyI'm inferior in too many ways... I've made too many mistakes... billions of people die helplessly, why should I not be one...

I want this to end so badly... why did it ever begin...

In 24 hours I have no choice but to change my life. I have no choice but to be a completely different person. Or I must choose suicide.
