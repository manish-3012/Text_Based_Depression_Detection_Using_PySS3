Some thoughtsI'll delete this post. I spent today deleting my social media. In some cases going post by post. I've always hated social media. I joined it begrudgingly...... All except for Myspace. I was one of the first couple hundred folks to join that. There's my claim to fame. Fucking sad.

Does anyone here think, or wonder if we care too much about what other people think? My friends would tell me no. They're always like you're the dude who doesn't give a fuck, but that's not really true. It took me a long fucking time to delete my social media, and I wouldn't consider myself very active. But there were tens of thousands of posts of every variety. It was disgusting to read, well, pretty much all of it. Including the shit on reddit. Then I considered how much wasted time, energy, and life went into creating well-thought out responses to complete strangers. Goddamn. That energy could have gone somewhere more useful.  


Sometimes I wonder if I'm trying to rid myself of excuses for suicide. I've never had much money, but once upon a very recent time I came into a lot of it. Essentially, I gave it away. After that I quit what was once my dream job.  It seems as though I'm trying to fuck up my health, which I've preserved incredibly well over the years....... Today I shaved my head, which I'll regret if I live long, because I look like a fucking neo-nazi when I'm bald.

I don't want to die. I don't think. I have a fantastic life to the eye that doesn't know any better. People really fucking look up to me for some goddamn reason. I know I could do the world a lot of good if I could just bottle up and sell these good intentions.

Anyway, I've been going through this shit for decades, and at this point I won't even leave a handsome corpse. My heart dies for all the people going through what I can only imagine is similar shit to my own. 

Goddamn, folks. I hope tomorrow you all wake up with a clarity of purpose, and the boundless energy of a toddler on Mountain Dew.
