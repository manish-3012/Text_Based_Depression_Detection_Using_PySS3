I just cut myself for the first time since 2010Does anyone do this as a means to punish themselves? I can't believe I did it. I'm 28 years old and I cut myself. I'm such a child and failure.

I don't know why I have to be so fucking broken. Sometimes I am okay, and even recently I felt like maybe my life would change. I've made some major life decisions recently that at the time I thought could improve my life. But now here I am alone, hissing at fresh cuts in my left arm, drinking whiskey so I can try to not feel every fucking awful feeling in the world at once, thank you very much.

I'm just so tired. I honestly would just kill myself if I didn't have a family that would be devastated if I do that. I already ruin enough friendships and people's lives as it is. Killing myself would be the ultimate offense to the few who actually love me. So I can't do it. Ever.

But Why do I have to suffer? Why do I have to be so alone? Did I do something I  a past life to deserve this? I just wish there was a place I could go where there would hold and hug me. 

Why am I still here. Why? Ugh.
