I don't know how to make it to the FallAfter sleeping 12 hours straight each night, I awake to yet again be in my parents' house. I hate every waking moment, and nothing brings me any pleasure. The best I can do is distract myself.

I miss my University and seeing people I actually liked. While I still hated every waking moment there, at least I was around people who seemed to care. I had a therapist who was helping, but I can't access them anymore.

My mother continues to berate and yell at my father and he continues to take the abuse, unwilling to stand up to her. Today she decided to turn her wrath to me.

I keep trying to tell myself that my life is worth living, but these two weeks I've spent at home have completely destroyed any progress I made over the last year at University. My tuition is paid for by the state scholarship I earned, I'm a straight A student, I'm a calculus tutor, and I hold a position as an assistant in a renowned Chemistry lab. My future is set if I can continue like this. But even with it all, I'm unhappy and I'd throw it all away if I knew I could stop feeling like this.

All of my work to get better just gone, all because of my mother. I just want to get away but I feel trapped here. I wish I could go to my grandparents, but they live 2,000 miles away, and I don't want to risk contracting COVID-19 and transmitting it to them.

I just don't know how to make it through the rest of Spring and Summer with a person who makes my life hell.
