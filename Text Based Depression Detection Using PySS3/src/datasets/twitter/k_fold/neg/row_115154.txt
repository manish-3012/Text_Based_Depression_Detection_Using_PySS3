The Last Straw...I think i officially given up on my life. Been suicidal for 4 years and depressed, itâ€™s literally killing me from the inside out. Everyone around me is fake and I donâ€™t have any real solid friends. I literally just want to off my self and I shouldâ€™ve done it way sooner. Nobody cares about me or take the time out to make sure iâ€™m good. Maybe iâ€™m just expecting a lot out of people, but you gotta understand how hard it is to be literally a reject and being lonely.  Thereâ€™s no hope or future for me so donâ€™t tell me i shouldnâ€™t give up because thereâ€™s a ray of light ahead of me. I feel mistreated, a shadow, and a nobody. Itâ€™s all fun and games until you start experiencing mental health yourself, then youâ€™ll understand my pain. My mom hardly checks on my mental health and mostly itâ€™s my fault for not telling her things. I know, as her son i should be more open to her, but she doesnâ€™t understand mental health or the things i go through. She will just yell and lecture, she will just try to tell me my lifeâ€™s great and iâ€™m a complainer. Therapy isnâ€™t also a option because i thought about, and it is expensive. I donâ€™t wanna pay loads of money for someone to just tell me itâ€™ll be fine or some bullshit saying. What is there to look forward in life? Each and everyday brings more pain anyways, whatâ€™s the point of living ? high school is shit alongside with everyone that is in it. everyone is just a poser that dick ride each other for attention. Never have i ever been so alone and empty, which just makes me pissed off and annoyed with everyone. literally cut off everyone in my life, now iâ€™m down to a little to no friends. iâ€™ve posted a couple times on this subreddit, but hardly anyone payed to mind to the post. It sucks man, having no one that cares about you, it just makes you question your existence on this world.  iâ€™m just a failure to everyone, i never do things right. i wish i can be loved but i know thatâ€™s never gonna happen. i just wanna love someone and be able to call them mine..  iâ€™m done here. you guys can choose to respond or not, but iâ€™m officially over everything. iâ€™m done pretending this is all okay when itâ€™s not. all i ask is to read this and try to put some perspective on what iâ€™m going through and how serious it is.
