it's my 19th brithday and I want to die ...seriously, I feel so horrible atm, I just feel like I've missed a lot in teenage hood, I, omg when I think myself as a 16 yr old or 17 I always was relaxed cause I knew I had time still, now I don't, I'm just not ready for adult hood, omg what do I do, my bio age is by far \~4 years less than my current age, do you think changing my age legally 1 year or so could help, I'm just not ready, I keep thinking I'm almost 20 and I want to throw up, I want to die, innocence and youth will never come back why is this world so cruel, been crying for almost an hour. I don't know how to cope with aging, 

which is funny cause when I was younger I also thought I'm all grown up and old, I always hated aging, but now, it really is late, I can't be a teen anymore, I'm miserable, I'd do anything to be 13 14 15 16 17 or even 18 again, anything. I prayed a lot to god, so maybe one day I woke up in my older body, I don't know anymore ....
