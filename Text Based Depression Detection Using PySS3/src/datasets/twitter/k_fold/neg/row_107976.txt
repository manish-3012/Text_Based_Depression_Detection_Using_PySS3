To the only person that ever mattered to me.You're better off without me.
Now I understand why you wanted to break up and ask for a divorce before.
You wanted a life by yourself and I am pulling you down with me.

I know I can no longer live without you. But I know you would.
I guess that's one of the reason why I always wanted to teach you things.
Your family would be happy that I am gone, maybe now you can find someone better suited.

I am sorry I always try not to look at you when I am upset
But the reason is because I always believed not to look at loved one when I am upset
Since that would associate my feelings of resentment towards them.

The world is like this regardless whether I am in it or not.
I am sorry that I showed you my perspective of it.
You wished you had stayed blissfully unaware.

I thought it was for the better.
Now I know that all I do is hurt you.

I am glad to have found you, but I understand if you no longer want to be with me.
I never deserved you.

I hope you will find happiness in the future.
