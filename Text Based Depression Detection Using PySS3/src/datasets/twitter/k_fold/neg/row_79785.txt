I am in this weird state where I am really calm but feel like suicide is a way out of the problems I have in life.I am really just tired of being betrayed, lied to, and put down by people. Mostly my mother really. She tells me I am pathetic and when I talk she tells me to be quiet or to shut up.

My fiance also left me about a year ago and stole almost all of my money which is why I had to move in with my parents.

I have not been able to pull myself out of this depression even with 8 months of seeing a psychologist.

Please refrain from the "don't do it, you have so much to live for!" posts as they literally do not help at all on a psychological level. Also, please refrain from any manipulation attempts by using strategies like giving me or affirming to me that suicide is an option. I am just looking for somebody to talk to that has hopefully been through issues with abusive parents and relationships and found a way to build a positive environment for themselves. I feel beaten down that I can barely get out of bed in the morning let alone hold a job so I do not have the money to just get up and leave which I wish I could do.

I want to climb out of this whole but I feel myself sinking deeper and deeper every day with every time I am told I am something and negative encounter.

Anybody know what I am talking about/been in my shoes?

Update: I have realized that I just simply need to get out. Out of my head, out of this house, out of my current mindset and just go. I do not know where but I am going to embark on an adventure with my dog and I in an RV trailer and see the U.S. and maybe some of south America. I have been far too focused on money and all the negative things in my life and I need to get on opposite side of things.

Peace and love!
