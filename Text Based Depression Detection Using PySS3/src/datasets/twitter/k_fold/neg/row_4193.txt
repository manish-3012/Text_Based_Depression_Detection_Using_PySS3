Situation, thoughtsI recently graduated university, psychology degree in May. I'm 24 and I've struggled with suicidal thoughts seriously since I was about 18.

I applied to grad school but wasn't accepted. I work in retail, \~10-20 hours a week. I also work in a research lab \~5 hours a week. I get tired pretty easily. I'm feeling pretty useless from not being able to work much and not starting school this August.

I've been dealing with some paranoia and hearing voices since February, convinced my professors were out to get me... I was being watched, etc. Most of it is much better but now I'm feeling run down. I live with ptsd symptoms from childhood abuse. also basically living in a house with someone who reminds me of my childhood abuse. 

I do see a psychiatrist. working on my anxiety right now with a new med. I also see a therapist but not getting very far when I have frequent suicidal thoughts..

I think that sums up my life. I'm always researching suicide methods. I found one recently and have really taken to it. I'm planning it for the first day I'm home alone after I have all the tools. It'll be about 2-2.5 weeks, not by choice.

I don't know what I expect to get from posting. At this point every time I think of my plan I feel very focused and I am having a lot of anxiety with changing my mind because I really feel like I need to do this. It's a good time. I don't have to go through more, I can check out. I'm so ready and excited and nervous and I can't tell anyone (not even therapist) my plans 100% but I just need to get it out

thank you
