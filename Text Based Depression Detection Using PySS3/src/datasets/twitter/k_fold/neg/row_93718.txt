never ever ignore an over thinker.why? you must ask. iâ€™m an overthinker. iâ€™m a fucking overthinker and i overthink a lot of things i have no control over. the hardest part for me is when i get ignored by my friends. theyâ€™re the reason iâ€™m still alive and they simply, simply go and ignore me like i never ever fucking mattered to them and i donâ€™t even matter to anyone so if youâ€™re reading this, please never ever ignore or hurt an overthinker. because i spent hours of my day thinking what i did wrong. i try to overthink positive but yk suicidal thoughts and fucking overthinking donâ€™t mix well. i donâ€™t know if you can hear the hurt in my words but it hurts so goddamn much and i hate seeing myself in this much pain, all i want is to make people happy and i, i try my hardest to be the best fucking person anyone could ever ask for, and they have the audacity to go and ignore me and forget the fucking fact that iâ€™m an overthinker. yeah itâ€™s my fault i know that. i didnâ€™t ask to be an overthinker but it just did. i mean one thing leads to another. first i get anxiety attacks, slip into a depressive phase and have my manic episodes. and nobody, nobody knows the hurt i go through. i wish it would all end. and thatâ€™s why you never ignore or hurt an overthinker.
