miserable ranti know that ill never be happy and ill never have this depression weighing over me because that is just me and who I am and how my brain works im 16 and i know my life wonâ€™t get better than it is now and it isnâ€™t even great right now. I love my family and value them so much and i donâ€™t want to grow away from them and be on my own I just know that Iâ€™ll never not be miserable i donâ€™t necessarily want to kill myself anymore and I realize I would never want to inflict that on my parents I absolutely hate being this miserable and despising my life this much Iâ€™m so hopeless and useless
