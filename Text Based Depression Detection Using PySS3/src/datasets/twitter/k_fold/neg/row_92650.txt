45 minutesI donâ€™t know how to do things. I donâ€™t know how to think. My memory is so garbage. Iâ€™m indifferent to whether Iâ€™m dead or alive. Whatever. Iâ€™m eating a decent cheese burger right now. In idk 40 minutes Iâ€™ll take 12g if caffeine, and every other pill I can find. If I survive the almost certain cardiac arrest then Iâ€™ll decide to live. Maybe.
