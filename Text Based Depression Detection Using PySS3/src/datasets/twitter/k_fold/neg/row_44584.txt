I can't do this anymore.I get to the point of getting so stressed out that I blow up. Then I crash down pretty hard. Then I feel really bad. 

I just don't bring anything to the table anymore. 

I am alone. It hurts when I come home and there is no one there. Not even a pet. 

I cry myself to sleep every night. 

I just can't do this anymore.
