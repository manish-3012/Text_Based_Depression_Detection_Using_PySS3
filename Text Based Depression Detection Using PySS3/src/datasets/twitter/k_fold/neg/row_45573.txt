No EnergyI've had clinical depression since I was 12 and struggled with overwhelming anxiety and feeling inadequate. I took magic mushrooms which helped a lot for a few years but suicide ideation has came back. I'm very high functioning and manged to get a degree from a very well respected university while working 30 hours a week.   


I'm not someone who acts on impulse, I've thought about it and weighed up the options. its also not something I would do all of a sudden and certainly not any time soon but I do think about it literaly every few minutes.   


I just can't see my life getting any better. Never had a partner, teeth are really bad etc.  I really hate my job and put zero effort into it. I make a lot of mistakes and just can't find the energy to care. 

I go to work with trousers that have tears around the pockets etc because I don't give a shit anymore. 

I smoked weed for a long time (currently not smoking due covid) to help, mostly with sleep, with the symptoms. Right now its 5am and I have work at 9.   


I feel like i've failed to meet expectations in every situation and don't have the energy to keep going.
