really canâ€™t get it out of my mindmy family doesnâ€™t know what Iâ€™m dealing with. i canâ€™t stop thinking about it. they donâ€™t know that the words they say are really fucking offensive since i was a kid. i canâ€™t talk back because it would be â€˜disrespectfulâ€™ idk wtd 

itâ€™s 4 days straight now that Iâ€™ve been crying every night just to fall asleep.
