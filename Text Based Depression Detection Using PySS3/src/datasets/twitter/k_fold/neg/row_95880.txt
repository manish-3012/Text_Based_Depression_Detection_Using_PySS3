i fucked upi accidentally sexually assaulted one of my very good friends. i was in a terrie headspace and i went to go kiss her; she resisted physically and verbally and eventually gave in. the entire time i kept asking myself why i was doing this and kept apologizing to her, but i kept going. oh god, i wish i didnâ€™t keep going. i started kissing her neck and her thighs and pulled down her shirt. i realized what i had done and left, profusely apologizing.

she wants nothing to do with me now and i understand that, but i canâ€™t grt rid of the guilt. i feel like everyone hates me now (with due reason) and iâ€™ve been going back and forth through intense crying fits and wanting to kill myself. i never have enough energy to carry it out, but im thoroughly convinced that it could happen by accident and i wouldnâ€™t stop it. yesterday i was taking off my sweatshirt and it tugged on my neck, constricting airflow very momentarily, and something in my mind just told me to keep going. i felt so at peace. iâ€™m so scared of myself and what i have become every time i tell someone what i did in an attempt to figure out how to help myself i know they are judging me and distancing themselves from me because im absolutely fucking horrendous

iâ€™ve been going to class less and less and crying more and more and i dont know what to do with myself

i think suicide has been a long time coming. i used to strangle myself with scarves when i was like 7 or 8 whenever i disappointed my parents because i felt like a disaster. maybe iâ€™ll be at peace. maybe sheâ€™ll be at peace too. she wonâ€™t see me walking around anymore. sheâ€™ll be comfortable. i want her to be comfortable. i just want her to be fucking happy. she deserves the whole world. she deserves the sun, the moon, and the stars. she doesnâ€™t deserve the pain i caused her. so maybe if i donâ€™t exist anymore, her pain will go away too.
