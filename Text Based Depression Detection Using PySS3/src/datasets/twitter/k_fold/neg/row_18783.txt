Advice pleaseMy thoughts are so loud. I would go into detail but there's so much and you don't know me so what's the fucking point? I am suicidal. Have been forever. Sick of it. I want to die but I'm a coward. I'm creeping closer and closer to the edge. It's hard to describe how bad it is, but it's bad.

Should I submit myself into a mental hospital? Serious answers and advice only please. I'm serious. I need help.
