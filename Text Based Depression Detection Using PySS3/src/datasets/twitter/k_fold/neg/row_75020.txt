I am a monsterSo today I've been told that my friends/roommates have been planning behind my back to move out because of me. I have bpd and that leads to a lot of bad shit.

I've been doing everything right but its never enough. Im going to call the hotline after this. I am going to be friendless and alone once again. 

It doesn't seem to stop. I was abused I left and now I am on my own. I am a fucking monster
