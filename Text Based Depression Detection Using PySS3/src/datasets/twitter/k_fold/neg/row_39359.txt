I donâ€™t know if anyone will see this, but I donâ€™t know what to do. PleaseItâ€™s 3 AM where I live, and Iâ€™m wide awake. I feel paralyzed. My body is shaking, like if one cold chill was running around it non stop. 
Itâ€™s better than before, when I was convulsing and violently trembling from the hours of 9-12. 

Someone I have a complicated history with came to me with some very sensitive information on Snapchat, and she never comes to me for help, so I just did my best to support her and listen to her. But the toll the conversation took on me and will take on me is immeasurable. I donâ€™t know what to do. 

She told me a lot. And I think I have really bad obsession issues with her, so the whole conversation really shook my world regarding its contents. I was violently shaking the whole time, and I got really sick. I tried hugging big stuffed animals, covering myself with layers, taking sleepy medicine to calm myself? It didnâ€™t work in that way, but we eventually both fell asleep. 
I woke up shortly after. 

Thereâ€™s just no hope for me. I canâ€™t go back to sleep. Iâ€™m stuck now. I donâ€™t know what to do. I feel like I have to end it all entirely to get rid of this pain, but I know in my brain that I shouldnâ€™t. But itâ€™s not like I could get up to go do it either. I just need help. I really need help, please? Someone say something to me or something I donâ€™t know. Itâ€™s been over a month since my last therapy session, and my therapist cancelled last Wednesdayâ€™s session, and now Iâ€™m not going to have one until another month from now. 

I just have a lot of holes in my roof, and itâ€™s pouring right now. Does that make sense? So many things have built up to last night and right now and I canâ€™t handle it. No one is awake for me. No one ever is, and they usually arenâ€™t here for me when theyâ€™re awake. Iâ€™ve never been on this sub before so Iâ€™m sorry if Iâ€™m breaking the rules I just need something
