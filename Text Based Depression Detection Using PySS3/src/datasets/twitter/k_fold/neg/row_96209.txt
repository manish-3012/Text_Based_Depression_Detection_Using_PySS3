Why is life so unfair ?Seeing all the posts people are making on this website makes me think about how life is so fucking unfair.
I see the messages of all these people who are struggling, who are suicidal and those people seem great, cool. They shouldn't fucking struggle like this, people like this should have the right to be happy. They seem so intelligent are so aware of things, they are kind of people i wanna be friends with. Since i was 12 i could never find a male friend that wasn't a macho dick. I'm surrounded by stupid sheep, people who are a total copy of one another, and here i can't find a message of a redneck asshole. Guess we are too much aware of the pain in this life while all the sheep don't think about that kind of things.
