Sometimes, it IS too late.I hate that: "it's never too late" as though they have felt like a ghost their entire lives. It can in fact be too late when it began with deep trauma and shame, wrapped in more shame, tucked inside a pocket of shame, shame-glossed and sprinkled with more shame and tied up in a tight, blood-red bow of shame. If you opened that present, it would be rotting death at the centre - which is why I suppose no one would dare touch any of the layers.

You say you care, but you watched me starve myself, you watched me drop out of school over and over, you knew I was drinking too much and when I asked for help, you offered me more alcohol, you didn't care how embarrassing, stupid and unaware I was because it allowed you to compare yourself to me and feel superior. You enjoyed my entrenched push-over behaviour and how easily you could influence and control me. Maybe you were the one who made your kids see their rapist over and over?

It doesn't matter what they say now. It IS too late. So much could have gone right - if society wasn't taught to be so fucking cruel to children - but it went far in the opposite direction and there's nothing I can do now about about feeling like the embodiment of the grimy, seedy, dirty, repulsive part of the world that everyone else tries to avoid. It's been so hammered in for so long I can't imagine a scenario anymore where I could even hear the phrase "you are a person" and accept it as a compliment. This self-hatred isn't something I can 'unlearn' or ease down, it's hardwired into me at this point. It's like a slime that's been glossed over my skeleton and then soaked in. 

How else are you supposed to get over that?  How are you supposed to feel good about yourself when everyone else your age isn't so developmentally stunted like you are?
