Iâ€™m ready pretty much ready to go.All thatâ€™s left is convincing my ex to take my tickets to hella mega tour so they donâ€™t go to waste (I know heâ€™d love it, and even moreso that he doesnâ€™t have to go with me). He hung up the phone today without saying he loves me (itâ€™s a complicated relationship). He hasnâ€™t said it in a long time. I think heâ€™s over me now, so he wonâ€™t be sad. 

Iâ€™m ready to go now.
