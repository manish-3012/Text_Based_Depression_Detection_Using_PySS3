I (M20) think that my best friend (M21) may be suicidal. I cannot visit him due underlying health conditions. I've tried ringing/knocking on the door but he does not answer. What do I do?Good evening folks,

I have reason to believe that my best friend, that I have known since we were three years old, is suicidal. I won't dig into details but I want to know how to protect him and make sure that he knows I care. So what do I do? And how do I tell him I care without seeing him (lockdown) and make sure I don't lose him? I've already lost a cousin to suicide and I know the pain. How do I keep him with us?

Any advice much appreciated. :)
