Do not institutionalize me. Just give me the SIMPLE accomodations, you stupid doctor.This much is true. **If I do not have two *men* in the room, I will be delivered the wrong diagnosis.**

And this much is true. **If I am institutionalized, I will suicide.** Try and stop me.

And I have tried and I have tried and I have tried. But the disgusted doctor keeps several layers of removal between me and him, and I cannot convince three layers of removal that I warrant two men in a room.

Or if I do, I risk the institutionalization suicide.

Every doctor ever has hidden behind his tiny receptionist women. The nature of a tiny receptionist woman is that I cannot demonstrate that I need these accommodations because it's gross to demonstrate to tiny receptionist women.

And even if I did, they represent three layers of removal from the doctor, and this is the progression: 1) there's this guy 2) there's this fuckup 3) there's this addict.

I don't even use drugs anymore. But I'll get that call days later from a tiny receptionist woman with the address of an addict house. I can't get mad at her. He has weaponized her against me.

I can't tell my mother what is going on because she will institutionalize me. If I make any intelligent argument, she defaults to the gaslight: "did you take your medicine today?"

She has no pill in mind. Just a vague idea that something should render me less persuasive, less unfair, more stupid, and that I should be taking it. I cannot push the point or she will institutionalization-suicide me.

Oh my God I am trying to exist. I hope I can get my doctor appointment pushed forward, but I run the risk of the unpointing recusal or the institutionalization suicide with any excuse I give.

But I have been thrown out of another bar. It is so hard to exist in places.

I am trying to exist. I am trying to exist. I am trying to exist. I am trying to exist. I am trying to exist.
