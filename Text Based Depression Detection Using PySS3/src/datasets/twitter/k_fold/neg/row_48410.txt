I will die this monthIâ€™ve stopped taking my allowed dosage of meds and am saving them up until the end of this month so I can hopefully OD. My birthday is coming up soon so Iâ€™d like to spend it with loved ones one last time. Already written a letter as well. Iâ€™ve lost my battle with chronic pain, I canâ€™t take anymore of this. Itâ€™s driving me crazy so I have to kill myself before I hurt anyone else. Just venting. Bye reddit.
