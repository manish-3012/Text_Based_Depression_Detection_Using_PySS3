I'm fed up with expectation and goalsI'm fucking done and what to just live life for a change instead of constant reminder of how good my fucking perfect my cousins and how I have to be like them. I just want to fucking live my life for a day, I haven't been happy in the last 5 years , struggling to do well and constantly succeed. I know many friends envy my achievements, but deep fucking down I'm dead and I know that someday or the other I'm going to just kill myself. Life is not worth living anymore, it just fucking isn't. Im fed up with my parents treating me like a fucking investment. Im fucking tired of my parents forcing me to do things in a certain way I want out quickly. I don't even fucking now why im writing this. Fuck this shit.
