Death is the best option.Long story short, I feel like the best thing that can happen for me is suicide. I want to take my own life. I dont feel that anything in this disgusting filthy world is deserving of taking my life. I cant live like this. Wake up stupid fuckn sheep, you are slaves to your government. I wish I lived in nature like the tribe people. They live and work for themselves, not no fuckd up system whose main job is to enslave. A quick painless death will be the best. I only feel sad that my mom has to suffer. She's the only one that really cares for me, and she's already lost one son. She's a great woman, she didn't deserve the life she had and still has. With fucked up kids and a fucked up family. Fuck life, this shit aint cute. Fuck you if you want to be a happy little ignorant shit, wake to the reality of this disgusting world. You've all allowed this to happen.
