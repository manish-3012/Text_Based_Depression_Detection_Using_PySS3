All I ever think about is killing myselfIâ€™m constantly suicidal. Every second of every day I wish I was dead. I contemplate all the ways Iâ€™d love to kill myself continuously. My big problem is that nothing is wrong in my life.

I have amazing friends, a loving family whom Iâ€™m close with, a very nice apartment where I live with 2 roommates who I get along with, a dog and a cat who I love dearly, and best of all, I have a perfect fiancÃ©. 

I feel like Iâ€™m doing everything right and everything wrong all at the same time. I go to therapy and see a psychiatrist, and am still making plans in the future like Iâ€™m going to be around. On the flip side, I can barely leave my bed most days, I donâ€™t reach out to my friends anymore, and ignore most texts/phone calls that come my way. I am absolutely crippled and debilitated by depression. I tried to call the suicide hotline last night, but pussied out and hung up while I was on hold.

My bills are starting to stack up because Iâ€™m too depressed and anxious to go into work. I have no idea how Iâ€™m supposed to live my life like a person when all I want to do is commit suicide.

What do you do to get better when pretty much nothing in your life can even improve? I couldnâ€™t ask for more. Iâ€™m grateful for what I have. But Iâ€™m so damn suicidal.
