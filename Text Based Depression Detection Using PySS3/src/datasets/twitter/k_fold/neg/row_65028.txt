I want to die, butIâ€™m 18 and living with my brother and Iâ€™ve been feeling so tired and numb for maybe 4 years due to a mix of a bunch of family dying, self hate, and bullying while I was in school. I want to die so badly but Iâ€™m really scared about what itâ€™s gonna be like. I have a bunch of pills that I can take but Iâ€™m so scared to take them. I want to try therapy but I donâ€™t think it works and Iâ€™m afraid of telling my brother about it so he can take me. Iâ€™ve tried to talk to friends but I always get the same repetitive answers that do nothing for me. Any advice?
