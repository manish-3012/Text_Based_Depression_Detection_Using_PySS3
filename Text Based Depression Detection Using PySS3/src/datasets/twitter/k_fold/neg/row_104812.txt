I'm struggling with potent thoughts. I... can someone just reply with a word, or something that might keep me grounded. I'm reaching out. Please.As on the tin...

There's someone I could talk to. But she's busy and a long, long way away. And I don't want to worry her or bother her.

I was diagnosed as Bipolar a few years ago... but I've never really felt it fit as a diagnosis. It was very rushed after a suicide attempt and the psych I'm seeing now isn't too sure of it. Which is interesting.

All I know is that something's... wrong with my wiring. I've had brutal and crippling depression over the years but... this it's more like I wrestle with suicidal thoughts on an immensely frequent basis. I don't really live for anything or anyone and I'd die for less. I have this heart that wants to give SO much, but it's slipping. I feel like everyday I hold on is a waste. Even when I'm happy, I'm often thinking - "This would be a really great day to off myself." It's weird. 

This is one of those... I'm analysing everything I am, that I've said or done recently and in the past, worrying about how things land... 

And I know... that this will pass, even if it does get me one day. But... for this moment in time. I'm reaching out.
