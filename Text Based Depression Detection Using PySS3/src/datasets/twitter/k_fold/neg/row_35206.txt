Id rather live 1 year of happiness than 50 years of agonyIm 20. I just wanted to live a normal life. Everyday is a pain to go through. Nothing brings me joy, I have zero energy left. My wish is to go to sleep and wake up to live a normal life. My life feels unreal. I can't process that there is no hope of something happening to save me and that I will never be happy in this life
