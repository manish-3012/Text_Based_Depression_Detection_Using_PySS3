How am I supposed to do this? Is it even fair to bring another life into this world?Iâ€™m probably different from most of you posting here. Iâ€™m a 30 something female. I havenâ€™t been suicidal since my early 20â€™s. I thought shit would get better by now.

I stopped drinking because I wanted to try and get pregnant. Not being able to drink is absolute torture. I canâ€™t face the day without a few beers or bottle of wine waiting for me. Iâ€™ve been in hysterical tears every day without booze. How can I go nine months without it let alone the rest of my life?

My husband wonâ€™t help me. He continues to do shit like smoke cigarettes which is killing our chance of having a baby. Iâ€™ve been fucking up our birth control for years and nothing has happened. I donâ€™t even feel bad about it. Iâ€™m so fucking angry that he canâ€™t even give me a baby. Without a baby I have no reason to live. Reddit loves the child free crowd, well fucking whatever, my life is meaningless without a biological child of my own. His fucking sister I just found out is fertile as all hell and had multiple abortions. Wtf? Why donâ€™t I get that? I wish my mother had aborted me. I wouldnâ€™t have to kill myself then.

I just want to buy a fuck ton of booze and drink myself to death. A fucking alcoholic. Who would have thought. I wanted a baby and I got addiction instead. A sick part of me wants to hurt my husband as much as he has hurt me by never giving me a baby. 

Iâ€™m so fucking tired of life. Iâ€™m tired of crying every time I see a beer bottle. Iâ€™m tired of crying every time I see a pregnant woman. Iâ€™m just tired. I want to sleep forever.
