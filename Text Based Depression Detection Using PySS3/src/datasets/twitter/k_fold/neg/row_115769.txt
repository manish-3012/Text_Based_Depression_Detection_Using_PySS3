Hey SW. Help me come up with a plan so I don't kill myself when I turn 30.I've had this ongoing fantasy for a few years now that I should kill myself on or around my 30th birthday. It boils down to this:

- I've had depression on and off since I was about 6 and have felt like a piece of shit for most of my life.
- I have extremely high expectations for myself that I'm never able to fulfill - career-wise, hobby-wise, interacting with people-wise, anything-wise. I spend most days feeling like I'm on the brink of catastrophic failure (even though my rational mind knows this isn't true).
- I've never had a relationship last for more than a few weeks, and I'm still a virgin. This adds to my feelings of failure, especially considering once I pass the 30 threshold with my virginity intact I'll be a living, breathing internet meme - the last fucking thing I want for my life.

My 30th birthday is almost exactly 10 months from now, and I recently started considering methods, which alarms me. I ABSOLUTELY do NOT want to end my life this way, but my brain is trying to convince me that this is a very logical and tidy solution to my problemsâ€” it restores all the control in my life that I feel I lack.

I already plan to attend a fan conference out of town during my birthday week, so I will be around other people and will not be sitting alone at home. But there will be alcohol and drugs available, and simply acknowledging my birthday might be too much.

Please toss out any ideas you can think of. I appreciate it!
