Living with an abusive parentDoes anyone have any tips for living with an abusive mother when you canâ€™t move out? I really canâ€™t take it anymore and can genuinely feel myself crumble as each day goes by. 
She makes it her duty to mentally hurt me as much as she can to make herself feel better and it triggers me so much that I canâ€™t help but fall back into destructive behavior. Talking to her is useless as well because sheâ€™s way too narcissistic and egocentric to care. Any recommendations? Sorry for being annoying, hope you had a great day if youâ€™re reading this :)
