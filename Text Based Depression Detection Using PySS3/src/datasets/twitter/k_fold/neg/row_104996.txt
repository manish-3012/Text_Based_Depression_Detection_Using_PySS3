Feeling like I'm at an all time low and ruining my relationship because of itHi reddit,
I'm having a very hard time. I'm 19, my parents never got along. When I was in school I was molested by other students, and I had a few other cases on the side. I can't remember too many times where I got beat by my parents, unless spanking counts, then a lot. It effected me a lot growing up, but I eventually felt that I got over it about 6 months or so after moving out of my house at 17. I held a stable job until I eventually took it over. Now I have the responsibility of owning the place with a friend of mine. It's a lot of stress but it's worth it all the way. My mom did a lot to support me, while my dad was being his usual antisocial I don't give a fuck self. He used to verbally abuse my mom a LOT and it really hurt me to have to hear it and listen to her cry in her room. Now my stress level is much higher because of my job, but not only that, my grandmother is dying in the hospital, my grandfather guilt trips me for random crap on a semi daily basis, my dad has physically abused my mom and tried to starve my cat to death since I've gone and now he refuses to sign divorce papers and is fucking some other girl and has moved out of the house and refuses to support me or my mom in any way, so I'm stuck supporting her. I don't expect support financially but as family being nice to each other helps... because of all this my stress level is to the roof. My relationship with my boyfriend had been pretty good for a while but he is autistic and can't handle my breakdowns so often times I'm up in my room crying my eyes out while he's downstairs playing games or sometimes working, and I know it stresses him out and he can't deal with it but knowing he's totally ignoring me hurts so much. I don't want to bother him, but I want him to support me emotionally. He had been doing his best and I have to give him credit, but the other night he came upstairs after I'd cried my eyes out for hours and he gave me a hug and told me he loved me and I went off on him telling him he should have come up sooner and that I was distraught, and I shouldn't have because I know he tries his best... he said he's couldn't take it anymore and that one of the biggest reasons he says with me is because he can't take the thought of me killing myself and that he often thinks things like this wouldn't be his problem if he just broke up with me... he was in the heat of the moment but it really hurt... I've been dwelling on what he said for a day and and half now, barely able to sleep. I've cried more than I thought I could and even resorted to self harm. I never have cut,  for I have a fear of sharp objects, but I have bit myself and punched/slapped myself for emotional relief. This time half of my forearm is covered in red swelling teeth and slap marks and will soon turn to bruises, probably pretty bad ones too. I didn't know what to turn to... I made a mistake... all of this is making everything worse I don't feel like there's a way out of this mess. I've felt suicidal for the last 2 weeks and I'm really being pushed close to the edge. Is there any advice anyone can give me?
