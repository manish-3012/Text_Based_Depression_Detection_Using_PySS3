I think I'm gonna do itI've been fighting with myself for three years now... It was only okay for about a month, now it's all falling apart again. I want to die so bad. I want to end this as soon as I can, but I'm such a coward. I've been thinking about it for a long time. Now I think I should try to kill myself next week, when my parents aren't home. I hate myself. It can't get better for me. I have nothing to live for. Everything is pointless and meaningless. I don't have any future. Only a few people will miss me, but I'm sure they'll get over it.
