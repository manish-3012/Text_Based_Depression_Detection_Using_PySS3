i have no optionssorry for constantly whining on here, i have nowhere else to express these feelings other than my therapist. i can't get my work done for my classes, and i hate being in college. i hate living at home with nothing to do, so dropping out won't help. i hate working, so regardless of whether or not i finish my education, supporting myself will just end in me becoming unhappier with each passing day. therapy doesn't help. i hate how i feel about myself when i take meds. i'm out of options and i really wish i wasn't such a pussy and could just kill myself and be done with it; this whining gets me nowhere, the only way i can move forward is to die.
