I'm only 13 and attempted suicide twice.When I was nine I fell into a huge depression and tried to end it. Of course, it didn't work, but no one found out. Soon after my parents realised I was depressed and got me meds. 

After two years I got really depressed again. In sixth grade I bought a noose from some kid. One of my friends found out, reported me, and I got sent to a hospital for a week. After that I discovered I was trans, and I was all happy.

It has been another two years, and the feeling is coming back. My grades are shit, I feel so overwhelmed, and I am currently getting a wave of texts from my mom who's still pestering me about my grades. I'm scared to go home.
