I wish there was a way to know if people would care if I diedI don't feel like I matter enough that it would impact anyone. Family, friends, coworkers... Idk. I'm alone all the time. I keep seeing these suicide prevention articles like "imagine your brother/mom/dad/friend found you." Not really relevant, it'd take days for anyone to even notice something happened because I don't really have a relationship with the people I live with and no one ever initiates conversation with me. 

The biggest thing stopping me from doing something is 1. the thought of traumatizing the person who ended up finding my body, and 2. if I didn't succeed, I wouldn't want to end up with some sort of permanent injury/illness.

tl;dr I could die tomorrow and it'd take days for anyone to notice, let alone care that I was gone
