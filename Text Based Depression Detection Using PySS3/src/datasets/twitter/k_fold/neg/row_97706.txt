I have no ideaThings just keep getting on worse and worse, it has been like this for all my life and I'm just a kid... if my early life is this bad how the hell can I have any hope for the future? I wanted to be an actor or a model, I can't because im so fucking ugly and repulsive... I wanted to be a doctor or something in the area of medicine, I can't because I'm dumb af and was ""blessed"" with bad teachers who didn't teach at all (and I know this because most of my older classmates ended up also not knowing math...). I'm ugly, broke, talentless, I have no skills or whatsover, I'm dumb, I have no artistic/creative skills... This is just 10% or less of my pain but it still hurts so much....

You've already cut my legs, from an early age, why do you keep on coming again and AGAIN AND AGAIN TO CUT ME MORE. STOP, I'VE HAD ENOUGH, LIFE, PLEASE JUST STOP, STOP THE PAIN IM TIRED OF SUFFERING SO MUCH.
