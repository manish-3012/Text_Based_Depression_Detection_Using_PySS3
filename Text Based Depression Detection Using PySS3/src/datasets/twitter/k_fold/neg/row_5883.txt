Pharmacist and Psych almost killed me - cautionary story.I finally submitted to the litany of people telling me to go on medication, so I was put on a combo of Resperidone and Wellbutrin to prevent my suicide that I desperately did NOT want to do. I would take these pills as directed (if you try them, then do it right), but 3 weeks in when I was having them filled out at the pharmacy, they ran out of my Wellbutrin due to a regional shortage!

The pharma called my Psychiatrist to see if I could take the x2 quick release ones instead, and they mutually agreed it would suffice until mine were available. They told me to take a double dose for the day I missed, but I double dosed a pill that is already double the strength....

That evening I was trying to eat ramen with my gf, and my soul shattered into a million pieces and I thought I instantly needed to kill myself - like right fucking now. The pain felt like a combo of my parents dying, being sentenced to prison, and being diagnosed with HIV and paralysis, all at once. I fell into a fetal position crying with snot and spit all over my face, in a restaurant. 

If my gf didn't drive me, I would have driven my car into a building at 150km/h to die, or slit my wrists in the tub. I thought of suicide-by-cop as well.... Anything. 

The hospital was disgusted by the incompetence of the pharma and psych, and their now under investigation. My arms are sliced open from cutting, and a year and half later, I'm getting my scars covered with tattoos tomorrow.

TLDR, take pills if you have run out of options - they've saved millions of lives. But 
only if you trust your doctors and always stand up for yourself if you're skeptical. A wrong combo can be fatal if you're not around an immediate support system like I was. Don't be ashamed or hide your pain, tell the world and help WILL find you eventually.
