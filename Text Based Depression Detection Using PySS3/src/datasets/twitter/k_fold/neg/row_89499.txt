I can't imagine the future anymorePeople always say things like "you still have so much ahead of you" or "your life is just starting," but I can't shake the feeling that my life is over. I can't picture a life being successful or even happy. I've disappointed and hurt everyone around me.

Whenever I try to make goals, I either make them either wildly unrealistic so I can't possibly accomplish them, or ridiculously easy so there's no point. On the off chance I ever make a valid goal, it feels so unattainable and I never manage to stick to it.
