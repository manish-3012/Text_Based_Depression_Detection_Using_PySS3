CollegeI have always been a good student, but I just find it so difficult to find the motivation.  I keep trying in hopes that maybe one day I won't feel like my death is inevitable, and if I do come out of it then I want the opportunity at a normal life. However, I just bombed an exam (for the first time so far) and its made me so upset.    I know its likely because my study habits and ability to focus have just dropped off.  I'm just tired of being alone and forgotten.  Even if I get great grades, then I might never get a job because I'm so bad at interviews.  Whats the point of living if you have no one to share life with and if you don't find any joy in most things anymore.

The only reason I don't do it right now is because I'm a coward and I still don't want my family (who has already lost a child) to go through the pain.  Even though I know its selfish, I can't help but dream that I'll just die one day from some freak accident, so that my miserable, worthless existence can just end.
