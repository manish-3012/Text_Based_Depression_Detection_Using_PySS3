I don't want to kill myself but I can't get rid of this feelingsI've been wanting to kill myself for a while now. Yesterday we buried my great grandma and I saw people breaking into tears that I've never seen before in that position. My family usually don't show emotions and seeing them crying like there was no tomorrow broke my heart even more. I don't want to do that to them. They don't deserve that.

I'm being treated with a psychiatrist and psychologist for a couple of mental illnesses but I haven't mentioned the fact that I want to commit suicide. To no one, actually. Yesterday I almost broke but like any other day, I just kept hiding my emotions because I feel that if I talk I won't be able to keep on going. Should I talk to my psychiatrist or psychologist? Both?

Thanks for reading. I think I messed up writing and may be confusing but I can't read it again. Gotta keep going.
