I just want to die already.If you're reading this feel free to comment or not comment. 

I have been suffering from major depression and anxiety for the past 2 years. To be honest I never thought I would ever be the one to call a hotline or write up a post on reddit, let alone open up to someone face to face. I used the term suffering because I truly live in absolute misery each and every day for the past 2 years. Every day is a battle with my mental illnesses and a struggle to not succumb to the idea that suicide will put an end to my tireless sense of hopelessness.

Rewind 3 years ago, I was in my last year of high school. Everything was great. I was fun, I liked to party, very good looking, a star athlete, muscular (went from 120lbs to 175lbs lean), dedicated and consistent with my training and nutrition, I had goals and purpose, I was strongly opinionated, passionate, strong-minded, etc. Never had a girlfriend until this point but had many friends, female and male.

The summer after I graduated I met a girl in college and fell in love, something I never believed in. We dated for a few months before she started to show her insecurities (due to her being burned in the past). She didn't like me hanging out with my girl friends, etc. It slowly got worse and worse until I had no contact with any other girls in my life other than my sister and my mother. Naturally, I figured it can't be a double standard so I told her she cant do the things I'm not allowed to do either. This escalated over our relationship to the point where we were fighting everyday. 8 months into the relationship my mother got cancer and passed away. I was devastated and getting more and more angry at the world. The relationship kept my mind "occupied" as I dealt with this heavy-hitting loss. My grades were still in the 80s and I was still doing everything I loved to do. After a year of dating, we both couldn't stay in the relationship any longer and decided to end it. I found out that she was basically getting a hookup ready for when we broke up 2 weeks in advance while we were still together. The day after we broke up, she invited my ex best girl friend's boyfriend over and they hooked up. My friend took her boyfriend's side like a retard and I was furious at my ex so I cut all ties. That's when the weight of the loss of my mother came crashing down on me. It felt like I lost everything even though I hadn't. The effects of the breakup slowly diminished while the effects of the death slowly got heavier. In the first 2 weeks I lost 10 lbs because I stopped eating, caring, etc. I was paralyzed in my bed and had to drop my entire semester after being 3/4 done. A month later I went on vacation with my friends with all the money I had to try to feel better and I did for maybe a week after I returned. I was starting to eat properly again and go to the gym and show up to hockey. On my way to the gym one day, my car slid off the road and I totalled my first car just like that. It felt like I couldn't have anything good stay in my life. I then returned to school and was doing fine. My dad called me at school saying my grandmother passed away and my grandfather is also in the hospital. I had to study for an exam that night and my mind wasn't there at all. I went to the hospital the next day to see my grandfather only to find out that he passed away while on my way there. The exact same situation happened to me when I was 9 years old with my other grandfather. I now have one grandmother left who lives abroad. I fell back down into my state of sadness and the whole in my chest felt so big that I thought people could see through me like I didn't exist. I was half done and had to drop this semester too. Everything was hitting me at once. I lost all joy in going to the gym, playing hockey, I stopped caring about school, etc. Within a month I lost another 25 lbs. All of my qualities listed earlier, now gone.

Now, 20 years old, I have a new girlfriend and we went through some difficult times because of my insecurities that carried over from being burned and a relationship that forced my reciprocation of unhealthy qualities. Long story short, we reached a stable point but still have some ups and downs. 

The underlying issue throughout all of this is that no matter what, no matter how happy I can get for a brief amount of time, I am or end up being depressed and anxious as if nothing changed. I am weak-minded, I have no purpose or motivation, my grades are terrible, I don't care about school, I don't work out anymore and I feel weak and skinny, I don't have a job anymore, i don't enjoy playing hockey, not outgoing anymore, don't party, stay home a lot, my family practically lives separate lives under the same roof etc. The thing is I feel so shitty about my life and myself that its like I'm too far gone to recover even though they can all be regained. I simply don't have the frame of mind to get myself out of this no matter what I do (I tried therapy, pills, you name it). Every single day I feel like giving up on life but I simply cant bring myself to do it to myself. I am so far deep down the dark tunnel of depression that the "light" at the end just isn't bright enough to be visible. 

That's all Ive got in my head right now but I could be missing plenty.
Thanks for reading if you did.
