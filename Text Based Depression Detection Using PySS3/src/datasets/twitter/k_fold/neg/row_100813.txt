Privileged yet miserable 18 year old hereSenior in High School, kissless virgin. I live in a relatively privileged city which recently got voted as "one of the best towns to live in the U.S.", but I hate literally everybody here. Girls typically cling to the Asshole jocks as per the usual high school stereotype and meanwhile I'm still spending weekends alone at age 18. I have very few friends and my parents(particularly my mother) constantly bitches and gripes at me for things that make absolutely no sense or just don't matter at all. I do everything they ask, I get good grades, I'm athletic and I stay out of trouble, so what the fuck gives? Clearly I am some sort of a failure and needless say, I feel alone. Anybody know how to get handguns when you're only 18? I could of course just hang myself as well, but I have no clue how to tie a noose or where it would take place.
