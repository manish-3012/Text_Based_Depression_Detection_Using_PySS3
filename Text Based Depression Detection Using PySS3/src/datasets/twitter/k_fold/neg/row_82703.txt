Iâ€™m mentally exhausted. I canâ€™t cope with all of this school work. I canâ€™t focus at home. My teacher wants to have a mandatory meeting at 9 am and I know I wonâ€™t be up for it. Everything is so hard.I spent over 6 hours trying to do three assignments. I still have over 10 to do. Things keep stacking up and I canâ€™t cope with it. I canâ€™t sleep at night anymore and Iâ€™ve been having constant nightmares. Out of nowhere my period comes, which is odd when Iâ€™m on birth control. I donâ€™t have any tampons for it and my mom wonâ€™t get me any. The pain is unbearable. I canâ€™t focus because of it either. I just want to sleep and not wake up. I know others have it worse and I tell myself that but I feel like everything is crumbling down around me.
