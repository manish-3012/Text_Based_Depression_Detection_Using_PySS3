Last week I felt amazingly motivated, but it's gone againA few unfortunate chain of events later, and I'm back. Back to where I started. The self image that was so motivated to fly has disappeared and left me alone with my pitch black thoughts.

And still, my mother refuses to acknowledge my work.

And still, I'm the lazy burden of the family.

And still, I'm considered the failure.

I've given it 150% of my effort, but if we lose everything despite that and I can't survive on my own, I'm ending it. It's too difficult to crawl back up from a mile deep trench. There's nowhere to go.
