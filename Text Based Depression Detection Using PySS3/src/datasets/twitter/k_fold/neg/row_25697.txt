Iâ€™m just hopeless, and suicide is the only solution to end my suffering.Iâ€™ve been extremely suicidal on and off for a pretty long time now. Iâ€™ve been depressed for around 6 years. 

Iâ€™ve made a few failed attempts.

I donâ€™t want to live anymore. The fear of not knowing exactly what will happen once I finally end my life is something I worry about. It wonâ€™t hold me back from doing it when Iâ€™ve finally had enough, but itâ€™s something Iâ€™m constantly thinking about. Death seems peaceful, and Iâ€™m constantly wondering what it would be like to finally end the sadness and end the ability to feel pain. Death seems desirable in that aspect. 

I worry about my family and friends. How theyâ€™ll feel, but hurting them isnâ€™t enough to stay alive. Theyâ€™d be sad once I finally do it, but at the same time, they werenâ€™t there to support me when they knew how bad I was struggling. Maybe theyâ€™ll say I was selfish to end my life, but they were selfish by not supporting me when all I needed was support and love. Theyâ€™ll be okay. Life isnâ€™t worth living if youâ€™re not living for yourself. Iâ€™m not living for myself. 

Trust me, I didnâ€™t want to go down this path. I tried getting help for my depression. I tried everything I could. Many things helped temporarily, but in the end Iâ€™m still finding myself in this hole that I canâ€™t get out of. Iâ€™m still completely miserable. My friends and family donâ€™t care enough to be there for me. Iâ€™m hopeless. This has been going on for far too long. I donâ€™t know how much longer I can take this until I just go through with my plan. 

Last night my boyfriend and I got into it, and I spent the night crying, as usual. I always cry at night, and itâ€™s not usually about him, but he made me feel particularly unloved and uncared for last night. He knows my depression. Heâ€™s been around to see my dark sides. When I feel hopeless, suicidal, sad, he doesnâ€™t really know how to support me in the right way. I already wanted to end my life because of all the pain I feel on a daily basis, but maybe last night pushed me closer towards being ready to do it. 

My entire mentality lately is that we all die in the end. Iâ€™ve been suffering for a long time, and nothing has gotten better. Nothing worked. I donâ€™t understand the point in living when all I do is feel pain and suffer, just to die in the end. Why not just skip to the part where I die, instead of going through a life of suffering. 

Iâ€™m completely hopeless. 

I canâ€™t find one reason why I should live, and that says a lot. 

I have a million reasons to end my life. 

I just canâ€™t take this anymore.
