Fuck It. This may be the last night of my life...The last few weeks have been hell, i lost my fiance, but she is taking time to think about "us". i really cant lose her, and if i do im fucked.
I went to a mental hospital for trying to off myself, by laying on a train track. i lost all hope, and trust in my family, im failing school again, even though i was an A+ Student. 

And, i have no friends and i really gave up everything for my fiance... and shes having surgery soon and her family doesnt really want me there for it... and i have taken more care of her than they ever have.

I know some people love me, i love them too, but, i cant deal with it anymore, im thinking i might just, smoke some of my last weed, numb myself out, and slit my wrists. not sure yet... i miss my old life. i miss her...

And im pretty sure she misses me... but just, god fucking damn it fuck this...
