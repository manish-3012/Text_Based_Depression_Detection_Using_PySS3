And we come full circle.Forgive me for the perhaps overly poetic title. I've always kind of considered myself a poet despite the fact that I'm a typical redditor that pisses on the ambition of humanities majors. What a dick I am. Looks like my STEM degree isn't helping me now though...

In all seriousness I'm a waste of human life. I'm going to finish this last 200 milometers of vodka and see if I have the strength to end it with this knife. Kind of funny the way everything works out. This knife should have belonged to a women who people liked. Who some people most assuredly loved. I wound up with it because she was a kind and generous person. That was almost a decade ago. She really was just a friend and has been dead for quite a while.The world would have been a better place if I had died and she had lived. What a bitch of a life this is.

Thanks you to everyone who spends time on this sub trying to provide a guiding light to the lost. You're all wonderful people. I hope you keep fighting.
