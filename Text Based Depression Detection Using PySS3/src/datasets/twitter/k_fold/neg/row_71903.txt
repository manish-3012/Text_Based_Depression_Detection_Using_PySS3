Itâ€™s too hardThis is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. Itâ€™s this fucking sickness god itâ€™s horrible itâ€™s so goddamn horrible and I donâ€™t why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesnâ€™t care about me and didnâ€™t care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I donâ€™t blame her Iâ€™m pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I donâ€™t blame her either. 
To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isnâ€™t just my problem my trauma itâ€™s this sickness Iâ€™ve been carrying from before I even met her. And Iâ€™m tired because Iâ€™m a good person I know itâ€™s wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesnâ€™t listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didnâ€™t even tell my brother the whole truth. They canâ€™t keep hiding it and brushing it off. Itâ€™s not helping!
