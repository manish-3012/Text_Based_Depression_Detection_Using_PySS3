HelpI don't know if I want to die. I just don't feel like I want to exist anymore. I just feel like every problem I have and manage to solve to a degree, manages to spawn more problems. I can't leave my family behind; I've tried it once before and I know that the consequences would destroy them if I did anything stupid. But I just feel angry, hollow, and empty all at the same time. I seem to attract people with the same mindset, so going to them for help just results in multiple people with the same dilemma. I don't know what to do. I can't talk to my family because it would hurt them, and I want to end it but that would hurt them too. I know I'm loved, and I love them, but the void in my mind is forever there, when I'm alone, when I'm at work, and whenever I close my eyes. I don't know what to do.
