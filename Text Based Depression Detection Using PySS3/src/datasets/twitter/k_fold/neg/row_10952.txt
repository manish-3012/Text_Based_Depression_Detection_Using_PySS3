Struggling to push these thoughts away.My last attempt was around 4 years ago. I've handled the daily suicidal thoughts pretty well since then, I usually have the resilience to push them away as nonsense. I have Asperger's and don't make friends easily, and the ones I did have I ended up pushing away and removing 2 days ago. Most of them weren't even guilty but I had to remove the entire group due to negativity... Since then I'm back to self harming and I just don't have the strength to cope with these thoughts. 

I think I'm safe? Usually when I'm about to make an attempt I get this serene almost bliss like feeling wash over me as if I've just found the answer, and I haven't had that yet... That's usually when things go bad. 

I don't even know why I'm typing this out, I think I just need to tell someone, or know that someone has read it or something. I don't know. I tried to fill the void with my wife and kids but it isn't working... It just makes me feel worse because those things are supposed to matter right? Like it makes me an even shittier person because they don't. 

On second thought, maybe I'm not as safe as I thought, I've already started rationalising... Gonna get off the computer so I am not on my own I think that's the way for me to stay safe right now...
