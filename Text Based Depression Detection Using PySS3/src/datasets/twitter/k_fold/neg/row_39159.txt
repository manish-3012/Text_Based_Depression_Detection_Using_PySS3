Why shouldn't ISo a year or so ago I posted on here (http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1p8imb/why_shouldnt_i/) with a post of the same name.  Here I am a year later and still alive, but the situation is worsened.  I got fired from my job a few weeks ago for cause.  At this point the only reason I haven't already offed myself is my brother.  He would will he hurt when I do this, and I consider it a when not an if.  One of the reasons I have made it this far is my job.  I have always thought that at least I had some value to society from  being a contributing factor through my work.  Well now my boss has decided that contribution is no longer valid. When I posted previously the only people that will miss me will be my brother, my work, and my tenant.  The work is no longer an issue and they have declared me as worthless.  My brother will miss me, but as a practical matter I have little if any influence on his day to day life is negligible at best.  So why shouldn't I put a gun under my chin and aim well back and pull the trigger?
