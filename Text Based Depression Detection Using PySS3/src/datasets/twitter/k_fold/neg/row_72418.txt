Another attemptLast night was my eighth attempt in 4 years.. 

Eight. Times. In. Four. Years.

I have medication. 

I have therapy. 

I have a supportive partner. 

I have an exercise and eating plan I stick to daily.

I have hobbies; I paint, I bake, I sew, I send people love filled messages when they feel low and I listen to their pain when they need an ear.

My first day at an â€˜Intensive Mental Rehabilitation Programmeâ€™ started for me yesterday- one Iâ€™ve been on a waiting list for since last year March.

I have things in place to help nurse me back to a stable position in life to have my son back, to give him a real chance at life with me daily rather than fortnightly on the weekends.

I am trying.

Am I happy to still be alive? Am I happy that the car swerved around me? Am I happy that I could have killed somebody else during my selfish desire to end it all instantly?? The answer to all of the above is no.

Iâ€™m lucky that nobody was hurt, Iâ€™m lucky that the man who pulled over understood the situation and helped me home. 

But I am not happy to be here.

When you feel like youâ€™re beating the monster remember this; it never sleeps. It never rests. It is vigilant. It will find your weak spots and it will use them against you if youâ€™re not careful. 

Stay aware.
