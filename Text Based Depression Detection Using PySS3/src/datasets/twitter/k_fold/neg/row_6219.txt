Thoughts please ?I'm 21
I want to have the option to impulsively kill myself when I get in a certain state of mind. I think like this occasionally.

Theres alot of stress pushed back in my mind involving my studies and morality about our purpose here and how I owe it to the world to live a certain  way.
When I start to really think about life it seems hard to do what I know is right.
I can hear myself burying down the right decisions and it's easy. 
I know I'm a piece of shit, theres so much I should and shouldnt be doing.
It feels too late to change.
It feels too easy to just "get by" like I believe most people might.
Knowing "everything works out in the end is exactly the problem"
I think it might be honourable to kill myself rather than have my life piss by repeating itself meaninglessly.
It really feels all or nothing sometimes.

Does anybody here think like this and could share their thoughts ?
