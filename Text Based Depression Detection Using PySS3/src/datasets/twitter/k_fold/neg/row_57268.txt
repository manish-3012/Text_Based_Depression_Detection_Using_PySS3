I'm close to breaking down and I don't know what to do.The pain of it all. It's just too much man. I'm only 22 years old and my life is a complete fucking train wreck and its only getting worse. I thought therapy would help, or meds. I even found what I want to do with my life after years of just dropping out of various colleges and jobs. I thought "My life is complete shit but at least I've finally find a "calling", and soon I'll be too busy to worry about any of this." But its getting worse. I have no motivation.

This mental pain is worse then any physical pain I've ever experienced because there is nothing I can do about it. Nothing no doctor can do about it. All this weight on my shoulders and nobody can help me because these are my problems. I should have gone through with killing myself back in August. I can't take another day, let alone another week or year!

I know posting on here won't help at all. It never does. But I had to get this out someway. I'm sorry for the long text and forgive me If none of this makes sense. I'm just so tired man. I need to stop existing. I need this all to stop.
