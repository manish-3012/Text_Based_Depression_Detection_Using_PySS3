I want to diePeople say I am great, the best, smart, extra or whatever. I hate myself, and almost everyone. No love was ever returned. My family is great, but be it selfish or not i do want someone more in my life. Not eaven a girlfriend, just a real friend. I found out that the girl I liked and tought she liked me back, didnt and it was all a game played on me by her friends and my "friends", i only found out after one of them broke out and said what was going on.
