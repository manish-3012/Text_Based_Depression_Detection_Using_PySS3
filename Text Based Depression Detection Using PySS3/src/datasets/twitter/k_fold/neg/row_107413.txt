I've been thinking pretty heavily the past few daysI was let go from a job I moved halfway across the country for on Friday. 

I was just offered a delivery driver position at Jimmy John's, which I will absolutely be taking, because I need money, I just didn't think it would end up this way.

I'm almost 25. I should have some idea of what I want to do but I don't. I'm a failure. A loser. I'm a waste of life and I want it to be over. We can finally close this pathetic story. The only concern I have is debt. I can't leave my family with that.
