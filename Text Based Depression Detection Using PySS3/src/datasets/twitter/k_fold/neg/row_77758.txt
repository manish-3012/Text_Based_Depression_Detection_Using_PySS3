i dont want to keep doing this.my life is only going to get worse from here. i always heard that one day it will get better. it has not gotten any better. i work very hard for a company that only wants me to do the hardest work while all of my managers rake in the real money. no one wants to lend a hand or help, i am a bitch for being born. i have a very unique position and they have not ever put anyone through the amount of struggle that they put me through. co-workers even call me the company bitch. My life away from work is not much better. i have never truly been in a relationship. i only meet older women never younger. i have had sex twice but never with someone who cared for me. i get way too attached always thinking sex and love are related. when i go home to be alone i get into fights with my brother over nothing. my mom told me that she wishes i was not born. the last girl i had relations with told me she wishes she never met me because i was trying to talk to her. so i stopped talking to either of them imminently. i just want someone to be nice to me and stop wishing me off of this planet. i have gone into isolation and i want to disappear even further from existence. no matter what i am everyones little bitch. just a constant joke, i guess i could give them the punch line they want.
