Today is my birthday and iâ€™m more depressed than everIâ€™ve had a whooping 4 people tell me happy birthday today. Only 1 of my â€œfriendsâ€ told me happy birthday. The other 3 were family members. No iâ€™m not posting this for sympathy or for someone to tell me happy birthday. guess iâ€™m doing this to vent since i have no one i can vent to but reddit. 

Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression for 4 years now after my ex left me because â€œshe didnâ€™t feel the sameâ€. Iâ€™m so down lately because Iâ€™m tired of being alone. Iâ€™m so lonely itâ€™s just old at this point. All my friends have girlfriends, getting engaged, and having kids. Then Iâ€™m over here with nobody in my life doing the same shit every single day, work, the gym, sleep. Itâ€™s really getting to me because I feel so lame and unwanted. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m unattractive or have a shitty personality but I guess girls see me differently.
