A different kind of suicideI think I've reached a limit. I hate college, and admittedly I could have done better, but I try. I do. I had hopes on doing things right, but my parents have put constants threads on the way, I'm being set for failure and I'm being told I either do this or I won't amount to anything in life.

I have decided I will study. I will have the best grades possible. In ten days I have exams. My mental health is already on the limit and the world is burning anyway so what the hell, I'm going to do a non-stop study until the exams, and I won't even care about the results. I will not eat, not sleep until I'm done. If it takes me four, five, ten days, it doesn't matter. Because of them, I had already spent days without eating or drinking any water so it won't be a new experience. If I die I hope they find my body idgaf. I don't know why in life people need to be pushed so much. I'm not trying to provoque these kinds of conflicts, but whatever, I will do it. I will either pass the exams perfectly or die. Because if I don't pass them I will kill myself anyway.
