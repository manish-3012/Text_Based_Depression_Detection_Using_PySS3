Seriously considering attempting suicide since SaturdayI've been thinking on ending it all again after i've recevied some horrible news and how hard is been to get work (make a favour to yourselves and never make college out of something you don't like, no matter the circumstances). I've got a gun/crossbow but i'm afraid of using it and failing miserably, like i always did in life.
