ISO Angel of MercyAs the title says, I am looking for someone to help me pass on. I was recently diagnosed with two diseases and my quality of life has not been good for a while now. Iâ€™ve lost 30 pounds and Iâ€™m not getting any better. I canâ€™t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. These diseases are killing me and I would prefer to â€œGOâ€ on my own terms. I read somewhere that the best way to go is to administer a lethal dose of morphine and that sounds so peaceful and painless. Two very unfamiliar feelings as of lately. I just want the pain to stop. Iâ€™m tired of crying and all of the misery. If you can help, I would be eternally grateful. Even if you have a better idea that I am not thinking of, that would be appreciated as well. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
