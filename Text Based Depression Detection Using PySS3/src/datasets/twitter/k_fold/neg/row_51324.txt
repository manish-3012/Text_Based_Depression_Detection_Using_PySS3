What the fuckI just went across the country to get my brain mapped by a top specialist, to be told theres nothing wrong with me. He literally told me that it was all in my head, and that I thought too negatively. He told me i should just change the way i see the world. My dad spent thousands of dollars on nothing. I feel like ive tried everything, and i still feel this way. I cant think straight, im living in a fog, i get headaches, my back always hurts, and because of this ive isolated myself from everyone and lost all of my personality in the process. But its "all in my head". Ive never wanted to kill myself more than now, and i think i will. I am helpless as it seems and will never be able to live the life i want. I think i might just be a soul in the wrong body. I cant take this anymore. Theres so much awfulness all around and i cant do anything about it. Im just a useless being on a quest of nothingness. Im sorry if what i said made you sad. If this is really all from my thought process then theres nothing I can do and ive got to go.
