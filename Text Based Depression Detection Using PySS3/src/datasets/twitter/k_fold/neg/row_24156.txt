IB and highschool is going to kill me.To preface I have had issues with depression anxiety and add since I was 9. Up until 8th grade I was homeschooled and when I was plopped into middle School, it was hell. I have a weird compulsory need to take all the hardest classes so when I got into highschool I had a new thing coming. I have considered suicide every year prior to this one. I'm a junior now and the load of work I have I think it's literally going to kill me if I don't end it sooner. I'm getting 3 hours of sleep a night doing the week so I have no time to do things I want. I feel like the stress will make me vomit at any second or the anxiety will cause my heart to fail. I want to blow my head off. I'm in full IB and AP classes and my insufferable ADD makes getting my tasks done nearly impossible.
