I guess I'm scared?It's weird. I've felt so much the last couple of month. Pure hatred to myself. Lots of guilt. I've been so close to ending everything so many times. 
But now. I just feel nothing. It's scary. I should be happy. My future looks brighter now. But I'm not. I'm just empty. 
I'm scared that this is it. That now is the time for me. That this person i am right now, will do something stupid, and just end everything I have worked my way through. Aren't I supposed to feel stronger now? What doesn't kill you makes you stronger? 
I don't know. I just feel kinda scared. I just don't know anymore. I guess this is it.
