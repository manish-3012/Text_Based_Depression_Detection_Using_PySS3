I'm done.It's all falling apart. I quit my last job because it was making my extremely unhappy and depressed. I never wanted to work there in the first place but my narcissistic father forced me and always threatened to kick me out of the house if I ever left. I was so terrified of telling him the truth that I resigned and pretended to go to work for 2 months just sitting in my car at night in cold parking lots all alone for hours and at the same time burning through all my savings. I finally had to break the news and it didn't go down very well, he treats me like I've committed a terrible crime and looks at me in disgust ever since. I got a new job which I like but I am struggling to pay my bills and debt (in the thousands due only next month) so I've been saving every cent I can to make those payments and just 2 days ago my mother who is an addicted gambler stole the money she knows I've been saving for my bills and gambled it all and now I'm not going to make it... I haven't eaten anything since. I've got no one to turn to at all. I tried. I'm sick of fighting this uphill battle it's time for me to just let go and face the inevitable. I'm going to die, goodbye world.
