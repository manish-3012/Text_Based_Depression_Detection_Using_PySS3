I'm never gonna get a girlfriend. Don't even tell me it doesn't matter because it does.I've got a decent face but I'm too fucking short. I'm 18 and I'm only 5'6". I don't understand why I'm so short both of my parents are average height for their respective genders. Maybe it's because I hit puberty really late at almost 16 years old? I hope so because if I don't grow any taller I'm gonna fucking kill myself. There's no hope for me with women unless I get extremely lucky. I'm not an incel or anything, I don't have anything against women but I really don't think I stand a chance with any of them at my height. If I can't find love which is literally the purpose of life than what is the point in living? Everyone will recieve love while I'll just be a fucking loser. I almost got lucky and found a girl who clearly was into me but then the pandemic happened and I never got her number or anything, not even her name.
