Going to try again soon.Next time I am alone at home I'm going to kill myself. I think I have everything prepared and I know what I need to do. It'll hopefully be mainly painless and quick. I just can't bear living anymore. I've signed up for all my organs and anything useful in by body to be given to people that need them most. I just want my death to be quick. I don't want any more pain in my life.
