I'm done with myselfWaking up is painful. Dreams feel like the only time where I feel anything other than emptiness and sadness.

I quit my good job 5 months ago on whim that I needed some time to myself. It did nothing but give me more time to think about and realize how worthless and pointless I am to the world.

I don't know how to ask for help. Every time I encounter someone I smile and say hello and go through the rounds. I can't express this any other way, but I'm literally incapable of acting anything other than "happy" while screaming on the inside around others.

I never asked to be born, I feel powerless in the direction my life will take, and I'd rather just end it than play in the "pretend" society full of petty bullshit.

There are days where I wake up and feel perfectly fine, almost euphoric amounts of happiness and it's wonderful, then by the end of the day its gone and I feel worse than before because I can't control the bouts of happiness or why they even come about.

I have a decent amount saved up, and I plan to use it up before I off myself. I just needed a place to say this without a filter.

Also, happy fuckin birthday to me, 25 years of pointless existence fueled by materialistic brainwashing. The only joy I can take in today is knowing that this will be the last birthday I see, and finally end the painful day to day torture of being awake.
