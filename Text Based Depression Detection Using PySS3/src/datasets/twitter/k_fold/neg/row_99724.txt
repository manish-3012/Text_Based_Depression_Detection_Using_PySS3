I would like to be helped(I apologise for clunky grammar and various mistakes in advance)


But can I be helped? This subreddit is dedicated to helping suicidal people. And by "helping" you mean "preventing people from killing themselves". Now I would really like to be helped, I do want to continue go on living, but I don't see a realistic outcome when I'm still alive and not in pain.


So what kind of help can be of use?


1) I might share my story (oh, what a wall of text that's going to be), but will sharing help me? I don't see how. I shared my story before with others. It never helped.


2) I might receive some advice, but you see I fancy myself a rather smart man. Can this advice contain some truth I haven't already thought of (or heard from shrinks or other people)? I want this truth to be there, but I sincerely doubt it.


3) As unlikely as it might be, I might find here some kind and caring person for me to weep on their shoulder. But will that be anything but a temporary reprieve? Again I honestly don't see how.


I am genuinly trying to find some other way how I can be helped by this subreddit, but I fail. Suicide is not a passionate impulse for me, but a premeditated mecry kill. And given that I might as well have only a couple of days to live (unless I chicken out) I suppose that in my case there is nothing in the power of this subreddit to do to help me. In some other cases you were really able to help some people, but for someone like me it looks like it's impossible. And that's really sad (if you ask me). Well, just an interesting observation I guess.


I've been suicidal for many years now, but have always able to fixate myself on some goal to work towards. But recently all goals lost all meaning, the pain intensified. I would've gotten through that, but at the same time I saw with the utmost clarity that the reason for my failings in life were my personal flaws. I've been trying many years to fix them and to no avail. (yes, without context you can't really make sense of what's written above, I undersand) Theoretically after additional many years of efforts I might (only might mind you) be able to finally "become a normal boy", but for the love of God I can't find a reason why I shouldn't just end it here and now and spare myself the suffering.


And I apologise for incoherence in my ramblings. I have never been able to pour my thoughts on paper clear enough.
