Iâ€™m a burden on everyone.Iâ€™m a burden to everyone. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve ever been. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to end it but itâ€™s on my mind all the time. I wish I could just fade out of existence, like I was never here. Just be erased from peopleâ€™s memories. Everything about me just fading away into nothing so no one has to deal with me. 

The cliff too walks are so nice here but all I can think about is how if I jumped that would be a good thing. But then Iâ€™d be a burden anyway because dying isnâ€™t cheap is it?
