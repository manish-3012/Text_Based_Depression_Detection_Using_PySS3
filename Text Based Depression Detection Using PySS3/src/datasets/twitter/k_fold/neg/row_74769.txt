I just want someone to make me feel like I shouldn'tI'm emotionally unstable and my boyfriend has panic attacks whenever I talk about my feelings so... I don't. I'm so sad and all I want is to feel cared for. I don't wanna do this anymore. If you have any spare kindness in you I would appreciate you leaving some here for me. Sorry.
