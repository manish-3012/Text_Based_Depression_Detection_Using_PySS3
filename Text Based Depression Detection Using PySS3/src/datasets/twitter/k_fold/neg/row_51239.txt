How can people want to live in a world like this?There is no feasible way someone can be aware of the issues that plague the world and actively want to live. I try to find a silver lining everyday, but I never find rest. I want to be sober but I cannot bear a sober existence. I just want it to end. Whether it be climate, the evils of capitalism, the lack of empathy many people have, the overall chaos innate to the universe, or any number of issues that seem insurmountable. I find no joy in anything anymore. I sleep my days away in the hope that I will wake to a brighter world or never wake at all. I know that people care about me, Iâ€™m not ignorant of that, but I canâ€™t live with this idea that we will all suffer and that suffering wonâ€™t end. Whatâ€™s the point of â€œrolling with punchesâ€ when the punches never end?
