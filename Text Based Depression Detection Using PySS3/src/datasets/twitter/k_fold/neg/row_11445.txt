No FutureTo whoever listens,

I couldn't be bothered to write a note, so this post will probably be my goodbye. I am 16 years old and a year ago my best friend killed herself. Since then, I've fallen into a whirlpool of depression. My grades have slipped so far that college seems out of the question. My dad is borderline abusive -- he refuses to let me take antidepressants because i should "suck it up" and my mom sides with him no matter what. To top it off, last week my only other friend in the world got into a car accident and is in a coma. Apparently he's brain dead. I visited him today to tell him goodbye and that we'll be in the same boat soon. Right now my parents are out with work friends and I have an entire bottle of sleeping pills that I stile ready to go. If I'm not gone by the time they're home, I plan on slitting my wrists. What's one more cut right? 

Anyway, goodbye to all of you people. See you on the otherside.
