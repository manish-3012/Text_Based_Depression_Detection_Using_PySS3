I wish that I didnâ€™t love so muchI wish that I didnâ€™t love my fiancÃ©. I wish that I didnâ€™t love my dog. I wish that I didnâ€™t love my mother. I wish that I didnâ€™t love the sunsets at night and the first sip of hot coffee in the morning. I wish I didnâ€™t love movies. I wish I didnâ€™t love my home. I wish I didnâ€™t love my job. I wish I didnâ€™t love ice cream. I wish I didnâ€™t love sports. I wish I didnâ€™t love hiking. I wish I didnâ€™t love nature. I wish I didnâ€™t love the smell of the fall air on my night walks with my fiancÃ© and dog. 

If I didnâ€™t love so much it would be easier to just end it. It would be easy to just......let go. 

I wish I didnâ€™t love so much so I could try and stay alive for myself and not everyone/everything else.
