I have a plan to kill myself at the beginning of January 2020.I was going to drive out to a stargazing place area and take some meds + alcohol in a combination that I know will kill me. Since I decided to do that, I started on some anti-depressants and started seeing more of my family friends.  Iâ€™ve been much more open with my thoughts and to people, because fuck it right? Since I started living like this, Iâ€™ve had a lot more highs and also a lot more lows as well. Iâ€™m having second thoughts about my plan since living like this has made me feel a little better.
