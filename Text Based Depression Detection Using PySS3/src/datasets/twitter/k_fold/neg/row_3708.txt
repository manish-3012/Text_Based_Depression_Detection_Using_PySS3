Is it really bad?My friend just committed suicide. We found him. Did he have the right idea? I can escape from finances, diseases, sadness.  He had no care and Iâ€™m jealous. The worst is going to happen? People that â€œcareâ€ cry and go through grief. The move on... I can just make it seem like an accident. They wonâ€™t know. I think it will hurt my siblings less.
