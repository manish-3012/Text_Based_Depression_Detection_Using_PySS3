What is the point?I have no good friends, no job and I drop out of college this year. Never been in a relationship either. I'm just always looking a way out of human contact. 

Despite this, my life is not particularly bad. I have home and state supports me enough to live minimal life. I could still finish my degree or apply for jobs or at least train my skills as I have all the time in the world, but I just don't see why I would want to do that, if I can just sit home and do pointless stuff that keeps me somewhat happy and sane. 

This on the other hand has brought up another problem that has been in my mind for months that is, why I even continue living when there is no point in anything. What does it matter if I die today or live another 60 years accomplishing nothing? For the past week I have been thinking just ending it as the void just feels far more better option. Today I have spent entire day researching different suicide methods so I could just drift away.

But... now I'm starting to feel that being somewhat content with this pointless stuff is actually preventing me from making the final decision and with the constant desire of dying, I'm now in some sort of middle ground where I can't kill myself but I can't live either. I just want a way out of this feeling.
