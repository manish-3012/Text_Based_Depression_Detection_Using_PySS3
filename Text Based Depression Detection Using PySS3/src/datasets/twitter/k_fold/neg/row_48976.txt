I feel like existing isnâ€™t worth itI am taking up space, money and time. I donâ€™t know why people care about me, Iâ€™m selfish and too absorbed into my depression. Any bond I form is parasitic, and I wear everyone down. I am so sorry to my friends for them to have met me. I have an immense self loathing and Iâ€™m posting here because I can no longer go to therapy.

I couldnâ€™t do it because of my parents, and I am their only child. But, I find myself wishing that I was dead often and not being phased if I am in a dangerous situation or so sick that I could die. My anxiety and fear is the only thing that keeps me from failing in school. I donâ€™t think life is worth living anymore and havenâ€™t been able to shake the thought for over six months. I donâ€™t see a future for myself beyond the year and Iâ€™m just slowly moving through time.

Maybe my friends will find this and know how sorry I am. I love you.
