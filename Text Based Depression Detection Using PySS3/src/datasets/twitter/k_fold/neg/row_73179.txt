Emotional abuseIt's been 31 hours since my last sleep. My girlfriend has been abusing me emotionally, calling me a good for nothing, not capable in life, worthless, trash, screaming at me, swearing, bad words, you name it. But I endure all of that because I love her. She has anger management issues and bursts out at the tiny bit of a hassle. She even made me choose between my father and her so we could go away and get married. I said "there's no point of choosing because in the first place I shouldn't choose between the two of you" and she concluded that I chose my father over her since I didn't choose in the first place. She wishes our family to have a bad luck and die. She is also blackmailing me that she'll commit suicide if I don't do what she wants.

I don't know anymore, I feel so helpless. I feel locked up in this relationship since if I leave her then she'll commit suicide and it will be in my conscience forever. I don't know how long can I still endure this relationship. I tried my best to be a good partner but I don't know if it was enough. Maybe she is right, I have no future, I am a good for nothing, fuck I feel like my head will burst anytime. I just wanna fade from this world.
