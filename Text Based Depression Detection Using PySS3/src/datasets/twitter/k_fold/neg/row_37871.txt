I don't want to be here since tomorrowI (23 M)  have been debating the whole day on whether i can survive tomorrow or not. I doubt I have the strength to face one more day. I cannot live with the memories of the series of traumas i have been through. Somewhere in my heart i want to see tomorrow. But now everything seems dark and out of my reach. Like I don't belong. Like there's no point in moving forward.
