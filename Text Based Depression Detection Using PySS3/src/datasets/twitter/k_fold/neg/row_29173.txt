UnderappreciatedIâ€™m gonna save the life story, so this post doesnâ€™t get too long. Iâ€™m a 19 yo M with borderline personality disorder (recently diagnosed). I have been depressed since I was 14 yo. Iâ€™ve self harmed quite a bit over the years (cutting wrists and thighs), but it was never my intention to kill myself. Cutting was a catharsis, an escape, and I also have a deep fascination in my scars. Iâ€™ve been clean for 8 months, but itâ€™s getting harder every day, especially with cold weather coming (long sleeves). Iâ€™m so sick and tired of being sad for no reason. My life is great, or should be at least. Two loving parents, the best role model I ever couldâ€™ve asked for in my brother, and countless friends who genuinely care about me. But still, I want to kill myself every single day. Because I was infected from birth with this stupid fucking mental illness, it will NEVER go away, I will always be unhappy, no matter my circumstances. The only reason I havenâ€™t done it yet is because of my mom. Sheâ€™s tried so hard to make me happy, and Iâ€™m even tearing up typing this because sheâ€™s so perfect. The thought of hurting her in that way deters me, because Iâ€™d much rather suffer, than have my mom suffer.

But Iâ€™m starting not to care. Iâ€™ve deleted all of my social media. Iâ€™ve stopped talking to my friends. Iâ€™ve stopped trying to talk to the girl I was after. Iâ€™ve stopped caring about my future, because I donâ€™t see myself having one.

I think Iâ€™m gonna overdose on my antidepressants. Not tonight, probably not tomorrow night. But itâ€™s coming. I canâ€™t take this anymore.
