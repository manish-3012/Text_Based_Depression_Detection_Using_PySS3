Unsure how suicidal I may or may not beDoes anybody else ever doubt the legitimacy of their suicidal thoughts or will?

As of recent (last 4-5 months) Iâ€™ve found myself looking at suicide in an appealing manner, but I am constantly wondering â€œAm I truly suicidal or are these just some intrusive thoughts?â€ I can list things to myself that effectively justify suicide but I for some reason find it hard to believe myself. Itâ€™s difficult to explain but if somebody understands, Iâ€™m interested, thanks.
