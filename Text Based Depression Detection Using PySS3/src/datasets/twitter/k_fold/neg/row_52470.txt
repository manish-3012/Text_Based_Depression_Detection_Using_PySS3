I got 99 problems. 1 bullet could fix it.I'm isolated from my friends and family. My girlfriend doesnt want to talk to me anymore. All I have is rum, weed, and time to think. But the more I think the more I wish I wasnt here. I just seem to be a problem or an inconvenience to the people in my life. I'd rather just go away than bother the people I care about.
