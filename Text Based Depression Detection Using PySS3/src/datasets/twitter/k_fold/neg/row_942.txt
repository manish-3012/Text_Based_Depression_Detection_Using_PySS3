Tried multiple times. I think I'm going to succeed tonight.Maybe if I ask someone to push me off the edge into the ocean; offer to pay them, they may help me finally succeed. 
I've been married for almost two years now, to a guy who never understood how I feel. And today, he hit me. Slapped me. Punched me. Pushed me. And covered my nose and face to muffle my screams, so hard, that I thought I'd die from loss of breath. Then, he booked me tickets to my parent's, and asked me to leave the very next morning. 

I don't want to stay with him. Of course not. But going back to my parents is not an option. I have no money, no friends, nothing. Everyone thinks I am in this happy marriage because I have lead them to believe so. And there is not one person I am comfortable in confiding. I had taken to cutting myself to calm myself down. But tonight, I don't even want to do that. Cutting only leaves me with bruises and no solutions. There is no solution, in fact. I am from that part of the world where a divorce is not the solution. I'll only end up bringing disgrace to my family. And knowing myself, I also know I will not be able to kill myself. But I really want to die. I'm really thinking of asking someone roaming alone at night, someone who looks like he may do it, to take whatever money I have in my pockets, and just push me.
