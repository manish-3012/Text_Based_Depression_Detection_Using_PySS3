I really let myself down this yearOn opening day of baseball I posted my World Series prediction. I went to a baseball game today. I was checking my reminders on my phone when I noticed one I set to go off after the all star break. It said â€œâ â â â â â Post on Facebook your updated World Series update!   You picked Cleveland and Philadelphia with Philly winning in 6 on opening day!  Stay happy and loving baseballâ€

I took a screenshot and was going to post it here but the sub doesnâ€™t accept images. At least one of those things is still true, I do love baseball.  Iâ€™m so broke and Iâ€™m in so much debt, I can barely pay rent. Payday was yesterday, I paid my rent and I have $102 left in checking to last me 2 weeks. Havenâ€™t bought groceries yet, or paid the electric and gas bill, and my truck is gonna need gas here soon. Insurance is also due soon and thatâ€™s $142. This is why I want to kill myself.  I have no enjoyment.  Iâ€™ve got about $600 left to spend on one credit card, once thatâ€™s tapped, Iâ€™m gonna do it.
