I hate it and I just need a hugEverything is going wrong. Nothing I do is right, I canâ€™t do anything to please anyone else, and Iâ€™m constantly berated for even opening my mouth. Whatâ€™s the point anymore. Iâ€™m too much of a chicken to do anything, and I hate it. I hate my life. I want to be strong and funny like the people I used to read about as a child. Instead, Iâ€™m a useless piece of garbage who canâ€™t even afford to pay my rent. I hate it. My mother passed away a few months ago, and I hate it. My father is close behind, and I hate it. I have no friends, no one to talk to, and I freaking hate it. Thanksgiving is coming up and I have no one to celebrate with, and I hate it. I need a hug and someoneâ€™s shoulder to cry on, and I donâ€™t have anyone. Iâ€™m so alone.
