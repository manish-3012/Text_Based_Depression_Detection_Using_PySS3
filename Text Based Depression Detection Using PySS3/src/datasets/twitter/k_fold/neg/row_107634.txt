I turn 27 tomorrow and I have absolutely nothing to show for it.No job.
No money.
No skills.
No career.
No friends.
No hobbies.
No social life.
No will to live.
No dreams.
No goals.
No help.
No point.

You can all tell me how good life is if you like but I have been waiting and holding out for so long, I kept fighting and for what? To be pushed around by dickhead bosses that donâ€™t think Iâ€™m worth anything? To be treated like shit and get shafted for working hard? To be belittled and used by people who do fuck all? To be in debt and scrape and toil? For the rest of my miserable life? I didnâ€™t ask for this life. I didnâ€™t want to be alive, to be here. I just want to die. Iâ€™m just an unemployed loser. A talentless waste of skin.

I canâ€™t even hold down a job for long enough at all. Iâ€™ve been falling out of the arse end of companies that just chew you up and spit you out. Mostly because my mental health is so bad and I donâ€™t have any options. I canâ€™t get on benefit, it wonâ€™t do anything, not for weeks. The doctors wonâ€™t help me or my anxiety. I donâ€™t feel like anyone wants me better. 

All they want is for me to shut up and sit down. They couldnâ€™t give a fuck when I tell them that I feel this way; so low that I want to stop living, that I hurt myself. They donâ€™t want to help, I know that theyâ€™re secretly thinking â€œDo it and I wonâ€™t have to pretend to give a shit about you anymore.â€

Tomorrow I turn 27 and not a single thing will be better or brighter. My family donâ€™t care they wonâ€™t even call me to say happy birthday. I will do fuck all for it and itâ€™ll go by without even so much as a cheer. Fuck this day, I wish I was never born and so does everyone else. I have been on the earth for 27 years and Iâ€™m still a stupid fucking loser with nothing to show for my life.

Iâ€™m a loser. I have ruined my life. I canâ€™t take care of the most basic things anymore. Iâ€™m a fat ugly stupid cunt with nothing to live for. All I am is a huge burden on everyoneâ€™s life. Iâ€™m a leech, a drain. A waste of space. I canâ€™t take it anymore. I wish I wasnâ€™t me. 

So tomorrow, Iâ€™ll join the 27 club. I donâ€™t see any reason to keep going when all there is left for me is sadness, pain, heartache, bone breaking work, suffering... Iâ€™m not sure how Iâ€™m going to do it but I honestly I donâ€™t care anymore. Iâ€™m spending my day alone and with no one around me. Just another awful birthday, another awful year. 

Nothing changes. Itâ€™s the only thing I know anymore. 

Please tell my fiancÃ©e Iâ€™m so sorry, tell her that I love her so much and I will miss her. I will never stop loving you my darling. 

Please tell my little sister I love her and Iâ€™m sorry too. I couldnâ€™t hold it together anymore, I canâ€™t do it anymore. I donâ€™t want to be strong anymore. I donâ€™t want to feel like this anymore. 

It might seem harsh what Iâ€™m saying, maybe even hurtful, but it doesnâ€™t hurt as much as living as who I am. Iâ€™m a disgrace. I hate being me.

Before anyone says, I wonâ€™t go to A+E because they donâ€™t care unless your halfway dead and even then they treat you like shit. I canâ€™t be sectioned because they donâ€™t care and if the company that manages it in my area comes for me they will abuse and or hurt me because I used to work for them and thatâ€™s why I left. The whole system is corrupt and honestly, I canâ€™t keep going. I canâ€™t keep fighting. I hate living so much.
