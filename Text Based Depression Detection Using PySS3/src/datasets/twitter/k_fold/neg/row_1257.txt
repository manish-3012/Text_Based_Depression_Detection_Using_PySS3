Iâ€™m not scared of committing suicide. Iâ€™m scared of failing.I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m so selfish. I have everything going for me. I have a husband,good grades and a roof over me head but for some reason all I could think about is me ending my own life. I donâ€™t know how I could be so selfish. The only thing stopping me is knowing my husband would be completely devastated. I just donâ€™t know anymore.
