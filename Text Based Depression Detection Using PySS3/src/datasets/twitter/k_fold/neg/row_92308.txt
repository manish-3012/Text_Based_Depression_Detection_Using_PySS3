Finally opened up about our problems only to have them shut down. No point living.We have DID, working towards a diagnosis with other therapist. Counsellor said we are delusional and childish. I can make us all die this sunday. This system doesn't have to exist anymore. I'll jump for all of us and then we wont exist anymore, just like what our counsellor said. Wonderful.
