Is there an escape besides suicide?I took out a letter from the electric company, they want me to write down the usage amount. Why do these fuckers not do it by themselves? Why do I have to work for them? This is happening everywhere, the big companies dump THEIR work on small people. I'm so tired of this system, of human in general, I don't want to do a single bit of work for ANYBODY. I just want to live a free life as a hunter and gatherer but they destroyed nature and privatized everything, I couldn't even if I wanted to, first I need money to move out of my place to some far away wilderness. But does that even still exist? The whole planet is postmodern prison, everything is privatized. How can I break free from this? Are there still hippie communities somewhere? Like real independent ones? How do I get there without money? Why would they even want me? I WANT TO BREAK OUT OF THIS SHIT SYSTEM. I WANT TO BE A TRULY FREE HUMAN. I DON'T NEED CARS HOUSES CHAMPAGNE COCAINE HOOKERS, none of that, I'm done, let me go you motherfuckers, just let me go, I have nothing left to give, my ego cannot take a single insult, not a single arrogation, anymore. WHERE IS THE FUCKIN EXIT BESIDES SUICIDE. There is no, right? IT IS A REAL QUESTION, TELL ME THE ANSWER
