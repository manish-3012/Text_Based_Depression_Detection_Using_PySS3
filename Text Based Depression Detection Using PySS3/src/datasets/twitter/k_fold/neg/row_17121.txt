Too anxious and depressed to leave apartment.Nothing to look forward to. I suck at life and can't handle it. I've tried to convince myself to stab myself but too scared so I just lie in bed all day. Im gona fail all my courses now cause can't study and too anxious to leave apartment. I am such a failure at life.

It frustrates me so much that the default human condition is sadness and you have to work at being happy. I don't have the energy for that and its only a matter of time before I'm homeless.
