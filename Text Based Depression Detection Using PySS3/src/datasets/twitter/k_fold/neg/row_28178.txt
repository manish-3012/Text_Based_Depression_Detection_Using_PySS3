nobody would noticeiâ€™m so pathetic 

on my birthday my parents couldnâ€™t even muster up a phone call. my sister managed to handle 10 minutes. i had a terrible time with my girlfriend bc i just felt so worthless. and she doesnâ€™t know me. she doesnâ€™t know me bc i canâ€™t open my true self up. i donâ€™t want to burden her. i donâ€™t want her to feel responsible for how i feel. i feel responsible for how every single other human feels other than myself. and like for my birthday any attention on me made me uncomfortable but i didnâ€™t want to feel like i didnâ€™t matter. all of my birthdays have fucking sucked i genuinely donâ€™t understand how people feel loved and special on their birthdays??? i donâ€™t have anyone who wants to celebrate me. and i feel like a bratty idiot whoâ€™s just complaining and is selfish but it makes me feel so so fucking terrible and i canâ€™t handle that. i forced myself to be with nancy bc i just wanted another person around instead of being alone. but i was so anxious. i went to see a movie by myself. iâ€™m so pathetic. every time she wants to hang out i instinctively and immediately find a way out of it or i feel guilty for canceling the last time so i have to grit my teeth and do it. 
i donâ€™t want to eat i donâ€™t want to drink i donâ€™t want to live. i just want someone to care about me. i want to feel like i matter to someone. iâ€™ve been trying to recover on my own going on 8 years now. it isnâ€™t working. but itâ€™s my only option. idk how i can win.
