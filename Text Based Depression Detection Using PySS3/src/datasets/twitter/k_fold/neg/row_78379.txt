I think I'm going down the drainI've posted multiple times before on this subreddit, and I've always been amazed by the responses I've gotten. Thank you for making me feel better about the situation,even if it was for a few moments. 

This feeling has been over me for years now, and has only grown dominant. I'm at a point where I'm okay with the people around me suffering because of my death, and i know that's not a nice thing to say. But yeah that's what i feel like doing. Honestly it's tiring and agitating at this point, trying to work it out with my mind. I tried multiple therapists and maybe i did not find the right one, because I ended up leaving all four of them a month of trying them out.
