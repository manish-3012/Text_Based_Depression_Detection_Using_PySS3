Advices neededHi, I've been posting here for 2 or 3 times ish and since after my last appointment with my psychiatrist, I've been doing better, or at least i hope. I've been working extra every day for 2 weeks and since i love my job, it's not a huge issue and i get along better with my colleagues. The only issue is when i went back home for my holiday. 

Usually I've always been scared of it, not because of my bullies or the bad memories that lingers on (it's been resolved a bit with emdr) but because of the family stuff. I have quite an active personality that i made up for myself as a way to not be bullied again. The thing is that whenever i go back, i always have trouble with my family when it comes to my look. My dad says i look like a hideous freak and he's disappointed to see me. Everyone says that they have to suffer from troubles since the day i came back. I know that i need to fix my look. It's so easy to do so. It just that I'm so used to not being worried about looking bad since the day i came to The Netherlands. It's just a hairstyle, but it defined me and makes me feel happier and more confident. I just have a lot of thoughts going on again and I don't ever want to go back to the clinic. I'm just so confused about my identity and who I really am.
