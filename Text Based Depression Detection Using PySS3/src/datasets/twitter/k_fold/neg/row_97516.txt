Is it ok to tell my friends Iâ€™ve been feeling suicidal?I'm not sure if this is the correct sub to post (I posted on r/mentalhealth too) but I've been going through radical ups and downs these days. When I'm at my worst I get suicidal and I recently had such an episode. I tried to cut ties with my friends and it sounded a lot like a suicide note but they haven't picked up because they thought I meant I simply need a break and will be moving on in life (we've been getting a bit distant lately).

Now I feel really bad that I left on such terms. Should I just let this be and not contact my old friends anymore or should I try to reconcile? If I do reconcile is it wrong to tell them the reason I left was because I was suicidal? I hate making others worried and bothering them, especially as I know some of them are dealing with mental health issues themselves. I would never want to trigger or upset someone. Then again, during these days when I'm feeling more lucid, I start fearing that I might actually do something when I hit another low. I just hate feeling like the whole world hates me and wants me gone, and that I can't even tell anyone because they probably think I'm better off dead anyway because I'm such a burden. What should I do?
