I donâ€™t know.I canâ€™t ever escape my feelings. For as long as I can remember, Iâ€™ve been the outcast. I was the outcast in my school. I was the outcast in my family. My step father locked me in the room. Dead bolted windows shut. Just because I was behaving like a kid. I never got to experience being a kid. I was always in trouble. He mentally and physically abused me. I ran away twice. My mother has been sick and doped up since 2003 from her addiction to pain kills the doctor prescribes her. So as soon as I turned 18, I joined the army to get away. I was happy for a little bit. I got married. Then all of a sudden, I wasnâ€™t happy. I divorced my wife, and got myself kicked out of the army and became an alcoholic. Every girl Iâ€™ve dated, Iâ€™ve been extremely happy in the beginning. But my self destruction always gets the best of me. Iâ€™ve only not been cheated on twice. Out of quite a few relationships. And the ones that didnâ€™t cheat on me, I ruined. I had this one really good girl. One that had never treated me so good. Slept on a couch with me instead of going home. Sat with me for hours while I tried to start up my own business, not making any money. Broke. No vehicle. She was there for me. And I ruined it with lies and cheating on her after leaving the clubs from djing. Ruined. Iâ€™ve stolen from people. Iâ€™ve stolen money. Everything I do is so self destructive. And I am so depressed. Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I remember. I can not remember a true happy moment. And every time things start going good for me, I always ruin it in some way. I can not get on top of life. Iâ€™m currently laying in bed right now, next to my ex girlfriend. We are both on the lease, broke up on Christmas Day. I sold my car previously so we could go on vacation. Idk whatâ€™s wrong with me. All I want is to make people around me happy. Make myself happy. Build a good life. But I CANT. I canâ€™t get a hold on life. Iâ€™m so mentally fucked up in the head. I see myself getting more and more quick to anger. It scares me. I canâ€™t afford help. Literally. I can not afford to go somewhere for help bc Iâ€™ll come out with nothing to my name. I have no vehicle. Iâ€™ll lose my job. And wonâ€™t have a place to stay. I have no friends. Thatâ€™s not exaggerating. And thatâ€™s because every time I run something somewhere, I pack up and move. I use it under the mask of being a traveling DJ. But idk. I just want people to like me. But I hit my self destructive moments where I am so depressed and all I want to do is listen to suicidal music and contemplate hanging from a belt. And thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m at right now. I am so sorry if this post is going all over the place. I just really need to let some of this shit out and Iâ€™m just writing as it comes to my mind. I donâ€™t understand why I canâ€™t be happy. Why I wonâ€™t allow myself to be happy. Itâ€™s like Iâ€™m constantly punishing myself. I know I want to be happy. I know I want a healthy relationship. I know I want a good job. But I canâ€™t make myself follow any of it through. 

My family life I shit. My father figure and my best friend died while I was in basic training. My grandfather. And since he has died, Iâ€™ve lost touch to the already fragile thread of a relationship I had with my real dads side of the family. Iâ€™m so out of hope. I literally have no one. I donâ€™t even have the money to put a down payment on a vehicle to make sure I can keep getting to and from work once Iâ€™m forced to leave my exâ€™s house. Iâ€™ve been homeless before. I can deal with being homeless if I have a way to and from work. I just donâ€™t have that way. And as soon as I have to leave here, Iâ€™ll end up losing my job. And all of this is due to my self destructive behavior.

I just want to be loved and accepted for who I am. I want friends. I want a good girl. And I want to not ruin that like I always do. Iâ€™m slowly letting go. Iâ€™m becoming more and more numb. Iâ€™m thinking about dying more and more. And idk if I want to die or not. The only thing thatâ€™s holding me back is the what if â€œGod is real and hell is realâ€. I lost my faith a long time ago bc God has never been there for me. Not with anything. Not when I cried my eyes out laying on my bedroom floor bc all I wanted is love from my parents. Not when I tried to kilo myself once before. 

And no one cares. No one care. You can not tell me people do. Because they donâ€™t. I would be missed for maybe a day or two. And thatâ€™s it. If even that. Iâ€™m just so scared and lonely. And I donâ€™t know what to do. 

I am so sorry for the unorganized process of this if anyone actually reads this. Iâ€™m just writing as I think. 

I want to die. But Iâ€™m scared too. I want to hit the reset button and do life completely different. Iâ€™m so lost. Iâ€™m so fucking lost.
