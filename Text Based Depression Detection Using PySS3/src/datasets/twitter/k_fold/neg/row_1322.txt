Trying to find a reason to go on.Hi. I never thought this would be my first post on reddit. To be honest I just got really depressed and googled what I felt and stumbled upon this thread. Probably a silly reason to join but I just really needed to talk to someone.

All my life I have been trained to focus on making good grades so I could go to college and get a job. I did well at that. I've got a full time job with benefits and I'm out on my own. And that's it. I feel like I've fulfilled all I've ever known as my purpose in life and everything seems completely pointless. To boot, I'm new in town and 90% of my friends live 3+ hours away. The ones that do live nearby flake out on hanging out almost every single time. One of my best friends said she'd try to move here after she graduates but it's apparent that's not going to happen. My long distance boyfriend promised the same but I seriously doubt that will happen either. And if we can't figure out a way to be together, he's already told me that'll be the end of it.  

So, I really don't have anything to look forward to. I've got no real goals to strive for, and even if I did, I barely have the energy to clean the apartment and make food for myself. I tried to confide in a friend last night but all he said was "stop whining and do something you like"...

 I've been here before, and I know I probably won't actually kill myself, but the indifference I feel about going through with it kind of scares me. 

Hope this is okay. Thank you for reading.
