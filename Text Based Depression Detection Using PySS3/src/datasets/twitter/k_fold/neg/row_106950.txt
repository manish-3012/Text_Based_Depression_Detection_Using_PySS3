I attempted last nightI'm 14. I don't want to live anymore. I've been starving myself since I feel too ashamed to eat.

My parents won't care if anything horrible happens to me they only care about my grades. My dad will threaten to hit me or yell at me if I don't do my work. My mother controls me. 

The only way I experianced affection from a older person was when I got groomed online.
