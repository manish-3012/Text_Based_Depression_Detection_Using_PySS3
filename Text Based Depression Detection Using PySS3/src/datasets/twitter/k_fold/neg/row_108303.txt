Gastritis, I want a way outGood evening. I'm male, 25 years old. 
So as the title says I suffer from chronic stomach issues. It all started 4 years ago when I'd feel really nauseous all the time. I went to the doctor, had an endoscopy and they found chronic gastritis. I did some natural remedies and some prescription, and it took a long time but I got to feeling normal again. 

Now: A month ago I got sick on vacation. I thought it was food poisoning, but I stayed really nauseous after the acute phase was over. This has been going on 1.5 months. Every. Single day. Nauseous as hell, missing work, feeling like shit. Went back to the doctor, had another endoscopy done 3 days ago. This time it found a hiatal hernia, gastritis and duodenitis most likely due to bile reflux. My doctor has me taking dexilant twice a day. Also I've been given zofran but it hasn't helped at all. Sometimes the dexilant manages my symptoms but mostly I still feel like shit. I'm sick and tired of feeling this way. I don't want to continue living this way. I used to be so happy and enthusiastic about tomorrow and the future. Now I dread it. I used to be able to weight lift and exercise but now I feel too sick to do more than walking. I'm at my wits end. I have a follow up with my doctor but that doesn't change the way I've been feeling. I want to enjoy my life and each day I have, I hate feeling sick to my stomach all the time and I don't want to go on like this. 

Am I suicidial? I don't know, but if I'm honest I've had thoughts about it recently. I'm trying to get into grad school but my application is weak and I feel like I have no purpose in life. I have a girlfriend but she's getting ready to start grad school and she wants to break up so she can put her all into that. And of course my stomach problems make all of this so much worse. I need help.
