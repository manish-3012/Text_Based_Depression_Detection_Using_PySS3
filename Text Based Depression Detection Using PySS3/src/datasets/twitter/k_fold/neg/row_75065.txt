Need somebody to talk toHey, i'm Ben \[16\] 

Superficially, I have everything you could wish for... a beautiful girlfriend, many friends and i recently finished school with a good grading; preparing to go to uni next year. I got lots of free time to spare and go out with my friends all the time. 

I drink, smoke pot from time to time and am a healthy person. I have no real problems that come to mind at first glance.

&amp;#x200B;

But for some reason i feel lonely and unhappy with my friends and girlfriend around. There is a void inside of me that i cannot get rid of. I have tried professional help but that turned out to be a waste of time. 

I set expectations way too high for myself and need to stop overinterpreting... 

I feel unhappy with my gf, but do not want to put her under pressure by telling her that i feel depressed

If there is anybody who would be willing to voicechat with me and listen to me it would be a real help...

I just feel like i cannot take it anymore and am afraid of myself. I cry myself to sleep every day and am extremely emotionally unstable when alone...
