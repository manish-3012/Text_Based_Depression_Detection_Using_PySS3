Just started 6th form, I cant deal with itA few months ago I was close to suicide, after posting on reddit I got some good advice and decided to wait until I at least started 6th form. This would be the first school with both boys and girls I had been to, so I thought I could make friends with some girls for once to try and be more normal as I never really talked to any girls before (too shy, spent too much time indoors). Stupid idea. The moment I walked in to the school I realised this was completely impossible, I had no idea how to do it. It feels so pathetic to be 16, in the second last year of school and not know how to talk to a girl. I felt so abnormal, once again I started to hate myself and I realised how hopeless I was. Luckily about 3 guys who I knew were there. One fucking broke, he doesnt talk or anything, just stands there and stares basically (he was basically my best friend which isnt saying much) The other 2 are frankly dicks. So basically im completely alone in about 300 people. Many of which are people from my old school who I have already failed with and who hate me.

I used to be religious at one point, my mom made me go on some crap church youth thing, it was the same, at one point a guy basically beat the shit out of me with about 5 other guys, all the girls laughing etc. I thought, either god doesnt exist, or hes a cunt, a total bell end. 

Im just too shy to really function normally. I wanted to get cognitive behavioural therapy but I dont have enough money. My family signed me up for some volunteer work thing, I have to go tomorrow, I am fucking dreading this, every time I feel remotely good about myself, something will happen to completely fucking smash any self confidence I had gained and made me want to kill myself more. Made even worse by the fact that I literally have no one to talk to about any of this, my parents are not bad people, they are just, really distant. My dad is indifferent, maybe disappointed that he got such a fucktard of a son. My mom is just distant really.

To be honest it seems like the world wants me to just go, like, natural selection, I cant fit in and no one likes me
