IdeationIt's back. Sometimes I just can't sleep because the suicidal ideation is so bad. I want it to stop but it doesn't. All I want to do is just jump off a bridge and never have to deal with this world again. Last night was awful. I tossed and turned all night as images of me shooting up on something and cutting myself and jumping off buildings and bridges flooded my mind. 

And my boyfriend found out today that I've been cutting again. He's really upset now and it's making everything worse. We made a promise to each other not to cut at all, but I thought he'd been breaking the promise because he talked about it so much and even asked me a few times if he could cut. So I thought it wouldn't matter if I cut a little just to blow off steam. On the one hand, I'm glad that someone actually cares enough about my cutting to be upset, but on the other hand, I hate myself more because now he's upset. I understand why he's upset, but I can't do anything about it. I'm so tired of this world, I really just want to leave it.
