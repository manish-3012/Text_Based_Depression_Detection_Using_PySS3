Was told to try 7 cups is tea and now I feel worseI tried the 7 cups of tea app that was recommended from someone in here and I was called a nigger and asked if I wanted to talk about sex. 
I feel so much worse. Why would teed be something for people looking for help and then get asked if I want to talk about sex to some stranger after they call me a nigger, I'm a white female so wouldn't you call me a bitch or a cunt?
