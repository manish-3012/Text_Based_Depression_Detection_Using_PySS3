I'm so fucking scaredI'm 14 and I've been considering self harm and suicide for months now, each time the thoughts come back stronger. Theres very little stopping me from doing either.
I dont know hoe much longer I can go and still have the willpower to stop myself from cutting or just dying.
I dont want to tell my parents, because I dont know if we can afford to send me to therapy or put me in a psych ward. Even if we can I dont want to burden them with having to pay for it just because I'm some coward who cant deal with my own emotions. I never wanted to come to this sub, but every night it gets worse. I kept telling myself that I could never do it because I care about my family and friends too much and I wouldn't want to put them through loosing me but now I dont know. I want help but I'm afraid I'll just be more of a burden. Itd be easier just to kill myself and get over with it.
