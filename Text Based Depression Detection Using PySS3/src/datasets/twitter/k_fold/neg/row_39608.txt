I just donâ€™t want to be alone, Iâ€™ve always wanted to have a companion by my sidesAll of the rejections and bullying from over the years is starting to suddenly wear me down Physically and Mentally. Iâ€™ve always wanted to help people and become a problem solver and I figured that my eventual death would become the Ultimate Solution by any other human being that I have inflicted suffering on just by being in the same room as them. Honestly Iâ€™m doing all of those girls that told me they were lesbian and my bullies a favor. After I die they are all suddenly my friends and will be spreading the word on social media about how this tragic event was so â€œunexpectedâ€ and to like and follow their pages to stop self harm and suicide.
