I hate everything about me and my choices. I have tried to be kind and thoughtful, but it doesn't change that I hate myself.You can check out my recent post history, if you want. I wrote out what was making me feel hopeless, and somebody just commented that my choices are my fault. I know they are. I haven't tried to be self-destructive. 

I don't know how to do anything. I have wasted my youth. I am damaged goods, clingy and needy and desperate, and no one will ever love me enough to take a chance on me. 

I think about dying constantly. I am too afraid to do it and don't want to let my mom down; she invested a lot in my education and upbringing. I just don't want things to keep getting worse. I feel physically terrible all the time.

Thanks for listening.
