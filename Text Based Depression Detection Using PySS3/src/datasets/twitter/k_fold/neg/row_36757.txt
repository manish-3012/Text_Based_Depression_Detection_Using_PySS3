Reconsidering suicide because of Super Smash Bros 5I was actually plotting a painless way to swiftly die, but then, I stayed up one night at 12 am and "studying", and then decided to watch the Nintendo Direct 08.03.2018. After seeing the final announcement for which game would come, which was FREAKING SUPER SMASH BROS 5, I reconsidered; I can't kill myself in a time like this. I have to live to play Super Smash Bros 5. I'll definitely not kill myself before I get my hands on that piece of joy in life. 

The point of this post, is that, don't commit suicide, because unexpectedly, there might just one day out of nowhere come a reason for you to keep living in this dark world with a little illuminating joy here and there.
