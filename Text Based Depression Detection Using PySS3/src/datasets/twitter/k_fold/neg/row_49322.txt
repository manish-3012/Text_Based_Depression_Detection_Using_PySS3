This is the moment when you decide to talk to strangers because no one around you understandsMy story is quite complex. Wonâ€™t get in much detail but summing it up Iâ€™ve got divorced parents, moved to a different country, went to college (architecture which is pretty much hell) and thatâ€™s not even what I wanted to do. I lived in another city for 5 years during college and had to come back to my parents house because I tried to kill myself with a bunch of sleeping pills that gave me nothing but a drunk feeling. Ended things with my boyfriend because I just thing he canâ€™t handle it. Had some really bad friends that just couldnâ€™t understand or help and talked behind my back. Now Iâ€™m here, in my parents house, thinking about my ex while my best friend tries to convince me heâ€™s the love of my life (yes he knows Iâ€™m still in love with the other one and yet he doesnâ€™t care. He just says heâ€™ll wait because heâ€™d waited 9 years already) but Iâ€™m still here, feeling guilty about all of that and still trying to come up with a simple solution to kill myself because I just canâ€™t handle adult life or even finish writing my thesis. I just canâ€™t handle it
