can't stand the fortunateIf somebody starts telling me about their relationships or their friends or the social groups they belong to, I nearly tear up. Granted, I barely ever talk to anyone, but even just reading about happy people sends me over the edge. I'm miserable. I have never once had a positive relationship with anyone. I have never dropped my guard for anything. I don't know how to. And, because I'm a man, I was never exposed to anything that could have helped me become more socially competent. I'm not even human. Human beings are defined by how they socialize with each other. I don't socialize. I get my thrills by talking to myself; that's the closest thing I have to a fucking friendship. I'm too poor and too disabled to ever improve my circumstances, and yet I'm surrounded by happy people.

And the worst thing about it is that those same happy people will insist that they know how I feel, and try to pin personal responsibility on me for my sadness. No one understands how bad I have it, no one cares that I have it this bad, and no one will ever feel enough attachment to me to want to help in a productive or kind way. Meanwhile, everyone else gets to go to parties and experiment with their sexuality and experiment with hedonism and develop identities based on how they contrast themselves with others. They get to be humans. All I am is a broken shell with a prognosis in my 30's.

I want to fucking die.
