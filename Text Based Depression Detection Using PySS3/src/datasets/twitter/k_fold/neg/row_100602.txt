I donâ€™t want to live anymoreI hate my life Iâ€™m told Iâ€™m weak and that Iâ€™m a bitch everyday by my mom, Iâ€™m not allowed to talk to my dad, and my younger sister who I always try to be nice to is so mean to me and I wish she loved me too because I just need someone. The only reason Iâ€™m alive is because I donâ€™t want my friends to be sad. I started secretly drinking and Iâ€™m going to buy a vape or juul too, I hate my life.
