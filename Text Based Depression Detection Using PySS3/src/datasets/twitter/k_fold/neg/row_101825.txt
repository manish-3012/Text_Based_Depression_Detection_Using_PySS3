Tonight is the night I finally am brave enough to do itI've fantasized about suicide for years. Tonight is the night. I bought a bottle of my favorite whiskey, made homemade tacos (my favorite), and now have a noose tied and waiting. I wont delve into the events that has lead up to this or my whole life story. This isn't a cry for help so much as I just want to fucking see people care. Once I'm dead I wont be able to see my family and friends care about me so I turn to reddit in my moments before.
