I just got a really messed up VMI wasnâ€™t able to answer but my cousin just left a VM on my phone about suicide and now I canâ€™t get hold of him. I know he was on a suicide group on reddit, hope this is the one. The message said something about a post but I canâ€™t find any posts by him except a bunch of stupid troll stuff and airplane quotes. Hopefully itâ€™s just bs but the last time this happened he was locked up after a failed attempt.
