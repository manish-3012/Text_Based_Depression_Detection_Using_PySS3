My self worth is almost directly tied into employment.... and itâ€™s making me want to die. Well, itâ€™s one of the things making me want to die. These are other things. 

-I have celiac disease. I sought a diagnosis because 5-10 minutes after I ate I would get horribly nauseous, exhausted, and suffer from stomach cramps. It took years to get diagnosed only for me to become asymptomatic two years into eating gluten free. So now I eat whatever I want because why the fuck not. The damage to my intestines is still being done but I canâ€™t feel them slowly dying. 

-My life has been shitty. Witnessed my father shot in front of me and then abandoned by my birth mother at 2yrs old(she kept all her other kids), homeless until 4yrs old, first foster family was abusive in ways I donâ€™t remember, didnâ€™t speak to anyone other than my adoptive mother until the 10th grade(beyond simple yes/no type responses), right around the time I was getting mentally well put together in college I encountered my first husband who proceeded to abuse me in any and every way he could think of for five years until I summoned the courage to leave(only because he struck our dog for the first time ever), dealt with his stalking/threatening to kill me for a bit until I got a serious career and a house of my own at which point he ceased almost all contact, was on my way to getting healthy all over again when current husband stepped in to continue the cycle of kicking me right when I think Iâ€™m normal. 

Despite all the craziness, my thoughts never turned to suicide. I was unbreakable. Until now. Now itâ€™s like everything has caught up with me and I want to die with every breath. Every half breath. I donâ€™t want to be strong anymore. I donâ€™t want to persevere and rise above and be molded into the person Iâ€™m truly meant to be. Iâ€™m tired. Iâ€™ve always been tired. I will never not be tired. And I want out. There is no possible outcome that could make everything Iâ€™ve been through worth it. Anyone who says that is selfish. â€œSuffer through this and come out the other side so you can do great things.â€ No amount of money or fulfillment can fix the sinister thoughts that slither unbidden through my mind. 

I will be 29 in 13 days and I want to die. But I probably wonâ€™t until more unthinkable things happen to me and I beg for my mind to break so I can check out and it wonâ€™t. I will stay fully cognizant of the horrors until my body gives out from old age.
