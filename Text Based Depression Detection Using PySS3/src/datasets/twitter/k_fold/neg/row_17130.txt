what are some good reasons to live?I am feeling suicidal as fuck right now. All these years I have been "casually suicidal" but these last few weeks I actually have a plan and am so close to carrying it out. I just don't see an actual GOOD reason to live. Maybe we as a community can think of something, anything really.
