WhyWhy canâ€™t I die? I want to end it everyday so badly. Canâ€™t get out of bed, do studies or whatever anymore cuz I donâ€™t care about any of it and want to end it all. Am I just too much of a coward? Scared of hurting the people who might be hurt by it? Even if someone is hurt theyâ€™ll be able to get over it cuz Iâ€™m the only weak person I know of. Theyâ€™d be able to replace me easily and get on with life. Canâ€™t tell anyone irl cuz parents are suffering of this virus and friends are doing so well and happy. Do I actually still want to keep on living if so what for?
