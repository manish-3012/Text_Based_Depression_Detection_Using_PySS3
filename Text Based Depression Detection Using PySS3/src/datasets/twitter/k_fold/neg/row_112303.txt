My life is fucked and I hurt everyone around me. I just need to kill myself.Spent the last two years of college dealing with worsening depression/anxiety/whatever.  It fucked over my grades an now im graduated with no job and no possibility of grad school.  I wake up and hate myself, how I fucked myself over.  I hate my face when I see it in the mirror.  I spend most days just sitting around, barely coping, not even able to get the strength to leave the house most days. 

Today my mom came home after I'd had a particularly rough day of hating myself.  It took it out on her and was needlessly cruel to her.  I cant even explain whats wrong, even when she point blank asks me.  She cried and walked away from the confrontation.  

I just hurt all the people I love, they dont deserve any of that.  No one deserves to suffer because of me.  Killing myself would make everyone happier,  including me.  Itll hurt my family but theyll move on soon enough.  Itll be the only good thing i can do for them.
