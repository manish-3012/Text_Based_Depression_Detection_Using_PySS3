Why I got depression**Hi. Before you start reading, this is a real story. If you get bored by this stuff, you can click away.**  
**I'm telling this to feel better. Also to help others realise that people around them have problems too. Stay safe and don't do anything stupid.** I considered r/offmychest but this story is too much of a central point of my life and a root of depression for it to be posted there.

  
My life is like one of those fat pie charts: One half is the part of my life which keeps me relatively happy, the other one is the one that constantly attempts to drag me down to an early grave.  
Oh, by the way, this is a throwaway. Not that I'm too ashamed of my situation - I'm pretty sure you can very easily track me but I'd appreciate if you wouldn't. Thank you.

I live in a beautiful country. So beautiful but so freaking far from the US. I'm a twenty-something years old dude, and I live with one of my parents, the other is deceased. Family-wise, I'm okay... I have a few mid-range relatives that I can trust.

Let me tell you the sad part now: I am a total fail in terms of love. I'm a uni student now and in the years of my youth I feel like I've only accumulated a little grain of experience. It started in school - I was (and I think I still quite am) a big-head. I never had problems with bullies (except one in my entire life, but that's a minor thing I won't bother ya with), never got called "bighead" and laughed at... except when I would confess my love or if someone would tell my crush(es) I like 'em. "EWW" and the like. At that time I knew what was wrong about me. Fast forward to highschool (**hs** *from now on in this post*) - I was playing on a totally different field. I would get rejected... and that was it! Nobody would tell me what exactly about me is wrong. Not even my "highest-ranking" girl friend (as in friend, that is a girl). But boy oh boy... when I reached 10th grade, I had made what might be my worst mistake in my life.  
Before I get into how I met ***her*** (Imma stick with this bold and/or italic style for the one that effed me up in the head), I must tell you a little prologue: I was in friendly terms with a... "mentally stressed" pal in our hs. Poor guy was constantly bullied because of that. Anyway, he did sometimes punch me in "joke" and stuff, but I knew the poor soul wasn't doing it on purpose. End of prologue.  
So, one day there happened to be some sort of "gala" or whatever those events in large halls with lots of chairs are, in our hs. Some theatral play, some award ceremony for the students, I don't remember any details, because, of course, I can only remember the details linked to the "love of my life". Anyway, I participated, and for some reason I went there too early or too late, with the "stressed" friend. My class was nowhere to be seen (or I don't remember) but we took a seat somewhere in the middle column. "Stressed" friend started to annoy me with punches and stuff, and I moved to the right column. Lo and behold, the dude follows, sits next to me again, and proceeds to "aggress" me again. (Tho as I said, poor fella has problems, I won't ever judge him). I finally convince him to leave me alone.  
I happen to have a problem that I didn't know about at the time: I'm way shorter and whay more child-looking than the MOST of men/boys of my age. And my voice is kiddish. This is probably the true reason why I never attracted any women in my life - who would let herself effed by a "kid"?  
With these child traits in mind, moving on: Just after the dude leaves my area, a particular girl ( *NOT* **her** ) approaches me, thinking that I'm crying ( And boy oh boy, I love cryin' myself while depressed, but otherwise, I have a condition of sorts that makes me cry whenever I'm put under pressure by one or multiple individuals. School and HS people all know I have the habit of occasionally crying over being accused of forgetting a group homework at home or something along these lines.)  
I tell her that I'm not. I can't remember if her (girl)mates came to my row too or if she asked me to come back a few rows to them... but it's certain I was amidst them a few moments later. At first, I didn't have any crush-moment. I've ended up having a nice discussion with 'em. They asking me about myself, I asking them stuff, etc. etc.). Somewhere like after 15 minutes I quite notice one of them in particular, and (with safe context, as in I wasn't suddenly complimenting) I told her she's beautiful. I think I saw her blush a little bit but it could've been in my mind. As everything nice has to end, the meeting/gala/thing ends, and we have to fill in some forms with our names and stuff... and since the desks at front were occupied,  we ended up ploping the paper on the wall. Lo and behold, when I saw ***her*** rise up and be like 5-10 cm shorter than me. (Believe me, if I knew *Hallelujah* back then, my brain would've blasted that.) And suddenly, she wasn't just beautiful anymore, she was **gorgeous**.  
So I easily peek at her full name and e-mail address (which I **hate,** ***HATE*** myself for not remembering). I felt like knowing her mid-name would help me a bit. (and it later quite did, since I apparently was the only person to know, except for her classmates ofc)  
Now comes the heartwarming (or heartbroking, depends if you're looking at this from my PoV or from yours) moment - she freaking... dares... to **HUG** me. I could not believe it. I've been hugged before, but by a classmate who rejected me, and she told me I'm like a brother to her and sheet. Obviously, that didn't give me the vibe and shock that ***she*** did. Like, hug a person you've just met? Are you insane? But I didn't have the time to think, as to me that hug was, and is, the most valuable experience I've ever had in my life. She hit the perfect spot, right after I crushed on her. The golden moment, idk how to call it. Tho, honestly there was another later hug (iirc) that I valued even more, since it's more recent, but I'll get to that.  
Anyway, so she hugs me bye bye. But HOLD IT! "I think I'm in love with you". Yes. Me. I said it. Yes. To her face. First day. Fuuuu\*\*.  
I'm gonna speed naration up a bit for this part: We spoke a day or two, then one of my besties contributed: you know high-school males, "helping" each other out, telling on their mates' crushes. Yep, she finds out, then I send **her** the message. She says she's not ready, she doesn't need a relationship, blah blah blah. Some time passes, she sends me a text so horrid... something about me alone in a burning building and... You get it... she **hated** me. (Blocked me too) Oh well, time to fruck that girl's rep (not intentionally, really): I ended up telling my classmates during the next days what happened, showing them the awful message. Believe me, they be eyeballing the sheet out of poor ***her***  (ok I don't think I need to use italics and/or bold anymore) whenever she'd pass by our classroom. Months go, I get unblocked, and I decide to ask her what happened. She tells me she didn't write that horrible message, and that she is disappointed that I said she's an idiot in front of my class and I did all the stuff that made everyone around the hs look at her with a judging stare... and that she "saw my real face". But... she's not "mad" at me... she's ok, but says there will never be something between us. Neither love nor friendship. But we could stay "pals".  
So here it starts: Years of being her "pal" and just speaking... telling each other stories about what we did today, blah blah-ing about arab women and stuff... she had a weird list of topics, but I didn't mind. (Not that I don't respect her interests and what they represent). Last year of hs, I bring her some flowers, and even tho I am pretty sure she still hated me in some way, she hugs me - or I remember she did, anyway. After the few years since the first-meeting hug, this was so damn good for me and I wish it would never stop, just as with the first one.  
Anyway, fast forward to when I finish hs and start planning for university -  No more randomly seeing her on the halls :&lt; .  
We still talk, but less and less. One year later, when I'm in second year, she's starting university - now things get sad. She moved to the capital too (obvious choice of city for studying), and now had access to a load of manly men while I rotted away, in the capital too, but with only 12 yo girls attracted to me ever.  
So I go to a fastfood one day... guess what, she's sweet-talking her manager. Oh yeah, and pretending so well that she doesn't know I'm there. Believe me, it sounded so damn "fairitalish" I knew for sure she's doing it on purpose. I text her - yep, didn't see me. Since then, for like a year, she occasionally mentions her boyfriend, in the rare times we're talking.  
Then, still in year2 or at the beginning of year3, or whatever, I can't remember, my bff (which I had for like a year and I knew from hs - yeah, it's cool how awesome of a new friend can you find from old colleagues that you almost never spoke to) advises me to say some stuff to her and just block her.  
Here is the beginning of the real downfall - Told her she's dead to me. I thought it was justified to do so - she was b4nging that manager dude and my heart and "honor" could not allow that.  
But, of course, time passes, and after around a year I start hating my bff for leading me to such a decision. Ofc, I couldn't stay angry on them... it was still MY final decision. Now I was regretting it. Ended up unblocking and sending a pic of my chat with my bff about how effed up I am and how I miss her. I was tired at that time and I just couldn't get the shame out of me to actually write her a consistent message. (Tho I probably did apologize too)  
Nope. Blocked.  
*Press F for me.*  
Epilogue: Been like another year since it happened. I'm still cold and lonely... and that's how I ended up making a throwaway and spilling my depression tale here.

**I left out a load of details... what I wrote here is really long anyway. I might have made mistakes (both in life, and in writing this)... please take everything with a grain of sugar, and a grain of salt.**

**Massive \*typos\* can exist. I won't come to correct 'em. Every time I re-read this stuff I'm wetting my laptop, so you're on your own to figure out what some mashed up word means.**  
TL/DR (pls also read the bold stuff): Crush sends me message like "I wish u ded" and blocks me, Me go to classmates "she is an idiot, why she not wanna me? sob sob", after a few months, she unblocks me, me go "what happened?", she disappointed I went "sob sob" to my colleagues and made them hate her and said mean stuff about her, and told me the message was not written by her, for the rest of the time we are only "pals"... we finish highschool, she (I suppose, not sure) b4ngs manager-dude, and in some messages, occasionally, she mentions a boyfriend. My bff says to just fruck her (metaphorically) and block her. I do, with the added message of "You're dead to me", time passes, I regret, I unblock, I go sorry-ass, she block. Bonus: Me frequently remember her awesome (two) hugs, me cry pillow.  


Also, to get myself a bit of a catharsis... (mods pls allow this, thank you) - Dear **her** , if you happen to stumble upon this... *F u. Telling men you'd wish they die in a fire isn't human. Neither is leaving your phone unsupervised so others can do it - for both scenarios... either of them which is true... doesn't matter. F u.*
