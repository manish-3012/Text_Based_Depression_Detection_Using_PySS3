Self thought answer to "why?"In previous post I mentioned I've been wanting to commit suicide for about 12 years now. I've came to my own conclusion that I will be happier, and for the thought that my gf and family would care doesnt matter like everything else people will feel pain for awhile but will soon be able to go on with their days as nothing ever happened. The next time I'm driving and the urge is strong enough my mindset is clear to me I will crash, and will die and I will make sure of it. I am done feeling empty inside and feeling self hatred for no apparent reason. Fact is I'm a statistic that holds no real value we are all numbers and when I think of hell i think I of myself being alive and maybe heaven is really death . No more feeling or pain and self hatred. Just blank kind of like going to sleep. I have truly found my own answer and for once I'm smiling knowing I'm comfortable with it now. And i hope others can feel happy regardless , if i dont respond that means i had my strong enough urge that has been growing for a long time. And all i needed to do was self accept that I'm better off dead.
