This evening I'm going to kill myself.My head hurts so much. I've been experiencing feelings of depression for as long as I can remember now. It wasn't always like this, but ever since I've hit my twenties I've found myself contemplating suicide and feeling depressed for atleast the last five years. I'm so tired. Yes, the issues in my life aren't worth letting go of life, but if it isn't these problems, what will it be next? There is always a different reason for the season. I've felt sad over the thoughts, and I've felt happy and calm and even excited about ending things, and this time, now, I've been calmly living out my last few days since deciding tonight would be the night. In this very last moment I can't understand my own thoughts anymore.. everyone is calling me..I haven't cried out for any help or let anyone in on my plans, but it's almost like everyone can sense something, and it's starting to make my head hurt..I can't figure out what I want anymore, WHAT DO I WANT?! I feel like part of me has already died and I'm living in a dark cloud right now. Is it common to be on the fence until the very last moment you take your own life? Am I waiting now for some kind of answer that isn't going to be there? Is it common to feel a subtle pain of not wanting to miss out on what life could become? I almost wish I could speak to someone who did kill themselves to find out \- how did you feel in that last moment? Last night I hung myself from a short suspension until my vision started to blur \- no that's not how I want to go. Today I've gathered all the material to kill myself via CO poisening and have rented a car for this evening to do it in.  I feel like I'm going crazy and I don't know what I want or am doing anymore. And if I don't do this, how do I climb back up from here? How do I feel the kind of life I used to feel, when I've opted to end it all? How do I remove this black veil and breathe again?
