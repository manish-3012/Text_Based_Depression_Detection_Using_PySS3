I feel the end approaching, sooner than I thought.I have a date in my head. It popped in there a while ago. For a bit it was comforting. It kept the pits of my depression from spiraling quite as far down as they had in the past. Its still a ways off, but this past weekend Ive felt I'm not even going to make that date. 

I've known the method for longer. One truly can't know for certain, but it should be peaceful and painless, for me. It wont be for those I leave behind. It will be cruel. It will be sad. I hate that I'm going to put them through hell. I'm tired of all of this.

I scared of the pain I see on the horizon. Climate crisis, pandemics, all of our cruelty and carelessness coming back to bite us. I'm adding to it now. 

I told myself I would outlive my mother. She lost a husband and a daughter already. I didn't want to be this cruel. I'm tired and I don't want to be in pain and I see so much pain ahead. I feel like if I don't do it now, I may not get the choice in the future.
