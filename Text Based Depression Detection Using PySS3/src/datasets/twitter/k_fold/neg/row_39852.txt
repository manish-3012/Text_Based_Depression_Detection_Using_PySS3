Iâ€™m at a loss of what to doSorry if this doesnâ€™t belong in this subreddit, but I attempted and failed to commit suicide, my parents wonâ€™t leave me alone or let me go out or let me have any power. I donâ€™t plan on trying again but I do understand where they are coming from. How do I get my trust back? How can I convince them Iâ€™m doing better? I donâ€™t know how much more of their behavior I can take before I can no longer just nod and say okay to them. What do I do?
