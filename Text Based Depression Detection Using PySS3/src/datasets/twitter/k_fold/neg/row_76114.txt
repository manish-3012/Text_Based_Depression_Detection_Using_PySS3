i will never have a girlfriendi was supposed to have my first date today in three years and i got stood up. we were supposed to meet in town and she kept texting me when she was going to be there and i was stupid and believed it and waited for six hours and then she just stopped replying to me but i can see she read my messages. i cant stop crying and im just mostly mad at myself for being stupid enough to believe people like that and waste all that time when i should have known she was doing it on purpose. even if she thought she didnt like me that way anymore she didnt have to stop talking to me  i want to kill myself but im too dumb to do that either
