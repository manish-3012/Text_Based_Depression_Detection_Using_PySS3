Waiting to die of nothingI stopped eating and drinking yesterday. I've given up, bored of isolation and watching civilization implode. I tried to reach out to my few friends, but as soon as I opened up a little about being in a dark place they all pulled away. No one cares. Deleted myself from social media so at least now I don't get crushed by hope.  Been researching methods for weeks, they all seem so messy. Came across VSED, it's meant for old people but it should still work. So now I'm just passing the time laying in bed until my mind and body shuts down for good. I'm sorry you are here too.
