I can't stop thinking about ending my life. I think I need helpThings haven't been so great lately. I lost my job because I got injured, I have no friends because I accidentally pushed everyone away, and girls just seem to leave me for no reason. 

I just don't know what to do any more. All I can think about is ending things. I nearly threw myself off a cruise the other day. Had to spend half an hour convincing myself I had stuff to live for, even though I don't. Contemplating jumping off the balcony head-first right now, and fighting it is really, really hard. 

I've tried everything I can to help like getting fit, trying to talk to new people, cutting down smoking weed, and more, but nothing seems to help.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm losing this fight.
