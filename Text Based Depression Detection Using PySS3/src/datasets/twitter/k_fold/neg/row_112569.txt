I think Nobody loves meI have nothing left. Iâ€™m alone, scared and sad. Everybody I meet treat me like trash. Even my family doesnâ€™t treat me well. I needed support more than ever. I have problems with eating and sleeping. I canâ€™t relax or stop thinking about this. There is no one I can talk to :( Itâ€™s very painful. Do I deserve this? Does my life matter? I honestly thought Iâ€™m a good person. But, If thatâ€™s true. Why would people treat me like this?

This is from my perspective. But, I canâ€™t help. But, Feel like this is true. 

My english is bad. I apologize about that.

I hope all of you have a wonderful day. I wish you all the best.
