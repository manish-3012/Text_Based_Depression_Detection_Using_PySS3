StrugglingI just want to be dead so bad. I force myself to keep on going like everything is normal but when I'm alone I break down. Like tonight I'm breaking down over just wanting to not be here anymore and not being able to handle the depression anymore. I have an interview tomorrow for a summer research program and I feel like I'm just wasting their time even going. Like I question of I'll even be alive in a month. If it wasn't for this interview tomorrow I would do it tonight but I'm afraid if I did somehow survive it would make look terrible and I'd never get hired. I don't even feel emotion anymore, I'm just numb. I can't handle this much longer. I see a new psychiatrist in a month but I have no hope that he will be able to do anything different than the others. I'm sick of feeling like this all time, I want it to be over.
