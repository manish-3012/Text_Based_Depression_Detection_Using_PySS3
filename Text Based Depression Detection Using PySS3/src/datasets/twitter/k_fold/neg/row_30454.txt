what is the point of it all?No friends at all, no girlfriend, no love life, still a virgin

I'll be lucky to pass my classes this semester.  My dad might stop with his financial support, and I can't take out enough loans to continue on my own

Job sucks, manager sucks, they're giving me way too many hours, its fucking with my school.  

I don't know what I want to do with my life, no goals, no interests, no natural talents

But really, the thing that bothers me the most is that I'm a social hermit.  I have no social skills and haven't made a friend since I was in middle school.  Life is really lonely and has been for my entire adult life.
