Canâ€™t sleepI have so much on my mind Ik im tired but my thoughts are keeping me up. All Iâ€™m thinking about is how I will HAVE to go to jail one day seeing I have warrants out for me. I hate my life I just canâ€™t understand y me. Y is it that others are so blessed with everything they could possibly want and me nothing. Sure I have a family that loves me but who cares about that when all u want is to die. I just wish some luck would magically come my way. Are miracles actually a thing? Is there anyone out there that could make my life worth living? I donâ€™t want to die I want to live a full life and have kids and see them have kids of there own. But right now I donâ€™t see anything bright in my future. Just darkness with no hope of any light at the end of the tunnel. Iâ€™m tired of acting like everything is ok Iâ€™m tired of saying Iâ€™m just sleepy when someone ask me whatâ€™s wrong. I shouldnâ€™t wish bad on anyone especially my mother but I wish she was dead so I could go through with killing my self. My mom is the only reason Iâ€™m still alive. I donâ€™t want to kill my self knowing she will cry for years. Thinking that she failed me. When really I failed my self and if there is a god I hate em so much. How could u watch ur creations suffer so much? Is our suffering entertainment to u? Do u actually love all of us because in my eyes u pick and choose who u love and bless. I just canâ€™t understand out of all the people in the world y do I have to be on this hell of a earth? I just want to go thereâ€™s nothing here for me. Iâ€™m not fit for this time at all I would have rather been born into slaver maybe then I would have a drive to fight
