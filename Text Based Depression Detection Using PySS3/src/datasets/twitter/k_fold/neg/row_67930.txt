A year ago yesterday one of my best friends killed himselfHe was a good guy. I don't say that lightly, he was a genuinely good person and that's something pretty rare. Sometimes when you are struggling you can't see the forest for the trees. He couldn't know how much it would've affected everyone. Friends, family. I am not looking for sympathy, all I want is for people to think about consequences. If you are suicidal, please talk to someone. There is always hope, things can always get better. Reach out
