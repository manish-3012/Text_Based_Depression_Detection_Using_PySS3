I dont really want to be here anymoreLife is just kinda shit right now and it seems like the internet is the only place to find kind people .(ironically) Ive stopped talking to my best friend, because he is sort of the cause for me and my girlfriend breaking up a few days ago, and im pretty sure she also cheated on me from things ive heard. So i generally just feel betrayed by both of them. Then school isnt exactly going well either, ive gotten a home visit from them because of all my absences and i tell them ipl try but every morning its a struggle just to get up and its like why, who am i trying to please. This isnt just a bad week, ive been pretty fucked up for awhile. Im not one of the kids here who go around asking for sympathy when they didnt see shit but about 6 months ago my school was shot up and my best friend was killed.,(santa fe if youre curious) I havent noticed but ive heard from friends and family i haveny been the same since. Im definitely fucked up, but normally i can handle it, but this week is just sending me over the edge. Everything is just too stressful and i dont see a point in letting myself get so stressed out about these pointless things when i can just, not have to deal with iy anymore. Idk what i came here for, sort of just to rant, sory of looking for words of encouragement i suppose. Anyways, if you read all this thanks for your time.
