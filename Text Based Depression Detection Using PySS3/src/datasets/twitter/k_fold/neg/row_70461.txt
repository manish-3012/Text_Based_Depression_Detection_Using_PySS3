I don't see much of a point in posting a title, people generally know what your posting on here for I guess.Part of me thinks this is a dumb idea. Kinda like the depression subreddit, I'm worried this one will turn out to be toxic and filled with people telling me they feel the same. Maybe it's selfish but reading that? It doesn't help much if at all, even. I'm worried of going into this subreddit and seeing how messed up things are for other people and it just amplifying my own feelings but I feel like there's a chance this might help, even if just a small amount, it's better than nothing. I'll keep things simple by saying yes, I'm in a bad spot right now. I've lost the will to live and the smallest things are setting me off into a crying mess, hell just writing this out has got me holding back tears. I just want someone to talk to, I'm tired of going to friends for help and just making them uncomfortable. They aren't equipped to handle this and I understand, it's not easy, I don't blame them but it doesn't change the fact that I need to talk to someone. I've gone to therapists a fair few times now. I'm tired of being lonely, I'm tired of being depressed, I'm tired of being anxious. Honestly, I'm just tired. I just want someone to talk to.
