Stared down a parapet for 15min today and considered climbing overOnly reason I didnâ€™t was because my mom had left work early to search for me for hours the moment she found out I was missing. Iâ€™m not sure if she sensed that I was about to do something drastic, but the desperation in her calls made me feel such immense guilt that I finally forced myself to step back. Iâ€™ve dreamt of it for ages, but this was the first time I truly felt that if someone had pushed me over, Iâ€™d let them.

Tried to work up the guts to tell someone about it, but Iâ€™ve shut off just about everyone of my own accord, so Iâ€™m posting here.
