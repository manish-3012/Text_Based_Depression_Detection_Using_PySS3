Help. I can't get my mind on track.Where do I start...? I'm a PhD graduate student who can't focus. I was diagnosed with ADD a few months ago but I guess it's not too severe since I've gotten to where I am today. But it feels like it's getting worse. I have had really bad bouts of depression since college, and most recently, this past summer. I've given up on meds. I just try to eat healthy.

Every time I have a task to do, it takes so much effort to put my mind to it. Lately, it's been really tough, even for simple tasks like posting this on Reddit. I guess I might still be depressed, yet I manage to go to the gym and eat well. So, maybe I am just lazy. I don't even know anymore. I feel like a total failure, especially compared to the other grad students around me. I always procrastinate to the point where I frustrate those who rely on me. I am afraid to apply myself. This has been getting worse and worse over the years, and especially recently. If this keeps up, I feel like I will have to kill myself.
