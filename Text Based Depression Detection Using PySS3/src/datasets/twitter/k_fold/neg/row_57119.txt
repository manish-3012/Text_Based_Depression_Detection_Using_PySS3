I want to kill myselfI have bipolar disorder and there are days where I feel pretty "normal" &amp; out of nowhere I have another "episode" that is worse than the last. which makes me feel like i push the people closest to me away. It causes guilt, i forgive myself. tjings get better. bam. another episode i find it hard to forgive myself for. i wish i could just die and spare everyone the time..
