I was doing better for a while...Itâ€™s all gone downhill in just a few days. School is stressing me out way too much. I have homework to do, but canâ€™t get myself to do them. My depression is getting worse again. 

I just want to end my pain. I donâ€™t want to wake up everyday and pretend. I donâ€™t want to get out of bed and go fake everything at school. I donâ€™t want to live and breathe this air anymore. I want to go. I want to be at peace. And the way to that is setting myself free.
