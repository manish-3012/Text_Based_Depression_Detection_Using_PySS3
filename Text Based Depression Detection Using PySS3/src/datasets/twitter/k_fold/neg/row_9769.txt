Tired of being undesirableMy dating life is nonexistent. It is a series of rejections after the first meeting. Iâ€™m insecure, inexperienced, without much confidence

I am tired of sayings how society puts pressure to be in a relationship. I donâ€™t feel that, I donâ€™t care. It is my internal desire to be deeply connected with someone that is driving me mad

I could live without relationship if there was any indicator that I have a normal chance of getting into one, of having some options from time to time, of getting any interest from a girls

Online advices to learn to live peacefully without romantic life is invalidating my feelings and struggles

I donâ€™t want to live like that, setting some hard deadline for changing the course of life seems to be a good option. That would give me some peace of mind that I wonâ€™t be in that state too long, no matter the outcome

Despite being overused, 27 yo is a nice number. Birthday. A little bit less than 3 years from now
