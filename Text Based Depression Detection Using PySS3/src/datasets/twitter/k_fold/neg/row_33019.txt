Iâ€™m alone and I canâ€™t change that cause I am me and I am alone, and no one can change that for me cause Iâ€™m alone....I posted literally 12 hours ago and here I am again... so I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a good sign. I just have a lot of thoughts going through my head...
About loneliness. 
I scream a lot of demeaning lonely thoughts at myself. 
I feel like maybe itâ€™s my fault that Iâ€™m alone, but who am I kidding OF COURSE itâ€™s my fault. But then I get overwhelmed with joy and thoughts of â€œmaybe this loneliness isnâ€™t what I thought it wasâ€ but then I shoot it down to the ground cause Iâ€™ve been alone a lot lately. In spite of this new depression I still donâ€™t know who I am or where Iâ€™m going. And honestly, I donâ€™t care who I am or where Iâ€™m going because this sadness is who I am and this loneliness is where Iâ€™m headed. So it all seems pointless... 
the other night I went on a drive and instead of singing along to the sad music in my car like usual I screamed every first word that came to my mind, and I cursed at god or the lack thereof and I cursed at life and the world and in that moment, I felt honest. 
I showed up at a bridge in our city overlooking the snake river next to some big waterfalls, and I climbed to the top. And I almost jumped, but 2 fears stopped me, the fear of going to hell and the fear of not dying. Only 2 fears. And I was 1 step away from possibly finding either. (I feel like this is a scattered post but ya, my thoughts are really scattered too.) 
Anyways... I feel lonely. And thatâ€™s nothing new. But, itâ€™s getting overwhelming.
