So it's like 3am and I can't sleepSo I'm finding it hard to sleep so I thought I'd indulge the part of me that wants to just talk about how fucked up I am/things are. So I apologise for my now inevitable unthought badly thought through text post that i'm writing on a message board to be seen or unseen by people I've never met or will never meet.

*Anyway a lil' background information*. I'm 18 years old and have been "suffering" with Crohns disease for about 4 almost 5 years now, I dropped out of school-*ish* as I'm still registered but haven't attended in about 6 or so months. I'm currently spending my every day sitting in my room and only leaving it for basic human needs (So that brands me as lazy).

I've been referred to phycologists and have previously taken a handful of different anti-depressants for a couple of moths each all of which seemed to change nothing. The few appointments I've had with every mental health team I've seen have all given me the same response of "We can't help you due to **x**" **x** being mostly I'm too far gone for their department to help. But the most recent of my sessions was a couple hour long heart pour, kinda like I'm doing now, of my life thoughts and feelings (or lack thereof) and essentially both the 'therapists' that I saw and my GP (General Practitioner for those who don't live in the UK) told me that the general consensus is that I'm not depressed but that i'm in their words "no offence, just hopeless" and haven't heard anything back since about a month or so.

Every mental health team that have been - *against my wishes* - involved with or contacted me all are perfectly aware of my mental state and my lack of value towards my own and others life, feelings, safety etc etc and all seemed too anxious to pass me onto the next specialist team (TBH most of the people who have contact with someone who is feeling suicidal want to pass them on not because they care but because they're personally and legally playing hot potato with not being the last ones you've talked to before committing suicide. **IMO - I stress that I don't want to offend anyone but this pointless post is about how I see people and the world**.)

Anyhow I did have a job working at a chinese in the town I live (You know a less than minimum wage cash outa' till at the end of the night kidna thing) but I packed it in when I realise that money kinda has no meaning to me, and I value my time reasonably similarly, I use it only to buy food and drink etc to keep my body functioning. Sure I buy the occasional game or confectionary item to keep myself entertained for a while but neither basic food or entertainment is worth any amount of money that I'd have to earn. (**Hold up** so this is the part where i'm branded as a lazy young adult who just takes other people's money for granted to live a selfish, self indulgent life. Label me what you will your opinion matters not - *no offence*. This post is in no way me looking for pity or sympathy just venting a lil'' to strangers on the internet. But I digress.) Again all health teams I've seen know all of this.

So here's the thing that I'm stuck at and if there's anything to comment on in this whole post it's this to help me out: I don't care whatsoever about life and I'm not interested in living it. *I've had enough people try force feed me reason why I should, thanks, I don't need more*. So I feel the need to kill myself since it should be my choice as a living being in all. Except apparently it's not? Okay fine the will of the people is that I live against my will. (Okay all aboard again for my needlessly high amount of bracket text **choo-choo**. Yes i'm fully aware of the numerous ways there is to kill oneself but I'm atleast self aware about my deaths impact on others to at least want a funeral plan and some sort of method to reassure people who know or don't know me who seem to want to blame themselves for someones choice to take their own life. So that my departure from Life Central down the Non Existent Afterlife mainline can be as least chaotic to everyone as possible.) But I see no reason why I should recieve money that other people worked for to fuel a life I kinda really don't want to live. And I bet you pretty much anyone reading this will agree on that. But if no one is willing to help give me a less chaotic way out than jumping in front of a train ^It ^happens ^a ^lot ^around ^here or cutting my wrists open like a christmas present ^I've ^seen ^13 ^Reasons ^Why ^and ^no ^thanks I'm kinda in a Limbo of not wanting to provide for myself since I don't want to live and not being helped financially since *it's not right* to end my life. There's basically nothing I can do and It's keeping me awake 99% of the time just at a loss.

Yeah i've been kinda sitting here writing for an hour since it's 4:15am i'm not gonna keep ranting to this post since there's literally ANYTHING anyone reading this could be doing with their time. I realise the last paragraph just kinda got stuck and went nowhere but so do I when I try figure this shit out and hey these text posts allow up to 40,000 words so &gt;5,000 ain't bad. Hope reading this shit was entertaining to at least someone but if having to endure a couple paragraphs of this tired un-proof read crap made your day/night "literally unbearable" sorry I guess just leave a 1 star review. Anyway gnight.
