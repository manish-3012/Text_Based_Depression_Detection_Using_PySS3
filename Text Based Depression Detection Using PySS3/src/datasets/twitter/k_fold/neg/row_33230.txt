Already dead insideHi..I created an account just to post this because I don't have anyone to talk to in real life.

I feel dead inside, my life has not been the greatest(family/daddy issues lets call it), ever since I was a kid I've been kind of depressed but I kind of just got use to feeling that way.

But lately, specially in the last two years I feel like I lost myself, I just simply don't enjoy anything, I don't feel like a human being anymore, I feel so shitty and miserable that I don't feel nothing at all.

I'm 24, I see the people around me getting awesome.jobs, getting married,having kids,degrees, with everything figured out and I'm just stuck on my shitty call center job.

I try so hard to have a decent life, but I feel like everything is falling apart, I had to stop going to college because I can't really afford it, and I need to get an education because I do not want to work.on a call center all my life.

I live with my boyfriend and we have a great relationship but he is one of those people that believe that you can just stop feeling depressed and anxious like you have a switch in your brain or something....

I am lost, I have no one to talk to, I can't afford a therapist (and on the country where I live no one gives a damn about mental health) and I've started to feel suicidal because life is just too damn hard..

I don't want to kill myself, but I feel like I'm loosing my mind and I'm afraid one of these days I'm going to just snap and drink poison or jump in front of a car...

I'm scared of what I can do to myself
