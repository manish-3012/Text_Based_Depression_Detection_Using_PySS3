I just want to tell SOMEONE, ANYONE WITHOUT HAVING TO LIEI know I can't tell anyone about how much I want to die, there's no way I could tell my therapist, he'd probably just put me into fucking inpatient, like that's ever fucking helped anyone... I'm just burning inside, I want to scream for help but I just know that I'll lose all control over my choices for medication and I'll probably just be fucking pumped with drugs and slapped with the label of "broken" again, noone will see me as me anymore, just as suicidal....

What the fuck am I even supposed to do at this point?
