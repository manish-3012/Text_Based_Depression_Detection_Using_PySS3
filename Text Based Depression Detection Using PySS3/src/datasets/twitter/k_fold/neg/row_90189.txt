Im a Suicidal and I love to imagine that once Im dead, I'd become a Star in Thr NightI love stars and when it was Night time I'd go out, sit down, and watch the sky and look at the stars happily when I was young, I can still remember how happy I was when I saw The Big Dipper. But growing up now, I've been unable to see them, specially that my family had moved to A City Place.

I've almost forgotten about the stars in the sky as my life became so dull nd miserable. But when I was able to finally see them, I felt myself at ease.

Those little lights in the sky were beautiful as always. Seeing them makes me feel accepted and happy, just thinking of being there with them, twinkling in the night sky and making someone smile makes me feel...useful.

So I loved to imagine that when I'd successfully killed myself or died in either an accident or Natural causes, My soul would fly up there and join the stars.
