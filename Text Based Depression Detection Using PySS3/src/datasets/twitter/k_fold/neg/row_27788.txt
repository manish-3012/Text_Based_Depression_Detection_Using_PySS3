I think it is finally time.Basically, I think it is finally time to end my life.  I saw something on Snapchat this morning that I really wish I did not see and it just made me "snap" a little bit.  So I immediately went into the bathroom, got naked and started cutting myself in all the places that i usually do (the forarm, shoulder, and thigh) and i cut deep. the only problem was that it was only temporary relief and i felt like i did not cut deep enough and now i'm wanting to cut again, and again, and again.  I'm so tired of this all. living this false life. I have about 3 Oxy pills, and some adderall, and i'm probably gonna take them all this weekend. I'm so done with this life.  Now I'm about to go to class and deal with that and put on this fake smile for the last time.
