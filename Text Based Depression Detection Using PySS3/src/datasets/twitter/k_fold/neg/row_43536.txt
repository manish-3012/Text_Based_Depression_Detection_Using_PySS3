Suicide ultimately is my only optionWell, I've decided, I will bring this to an end after the play has passed, but, I'll still end this. Suicide is more or less the only thing I have. All but one of my dreams has crumbled before my very eyes, and that dream is impossible to achieve. I feel that this was all predestined, I mean, it's just too perfect. My dreams have been crushed, the ghosts of my past returned for one last time to show that regaining that which I have lost is truly impossible, those I loved went away, and finally the one glimmer of hope I had, the one thing I gained that led me to believe, has gone, either through my actions or in spite of them, I do not know. Death will be my release from a mortal coil I never asked for. I've made my peace with the universe, I understand who I am, and, more importantly, I understand that this is my destiny. I'm tired, I've been fighting this for a while now, and, every time I get a bit of ground, every time I get a feeling of hope, it's dashed away and things get worse. I don't want to live the rest of my life seeking transient hope spots. I've begun saying my goodbyes, it's time I deliver on the promise those goodbyes carry with them.
