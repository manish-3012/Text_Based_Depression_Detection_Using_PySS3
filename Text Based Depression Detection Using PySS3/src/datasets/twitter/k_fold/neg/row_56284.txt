I can't live like this anymore.I'm dying inside. Just nothing goes right anymore. I feel so bad for saying it, though. I have a boyfriend, who I love with all my heart and who loves me back. But I also have a depression and other stressful problems killing me slowly. I don't want to die, but I cant live like this anymore. Can someone please help me? I know this subreddit may not be for that, but I have no one right now and I'm really scared..
