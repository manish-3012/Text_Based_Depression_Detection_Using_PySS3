I can't do thisI can't do this anymore. Things were going so well and this semester everything has fallen apart. My friends have left me and I have nobody. Everyone hates me. I've dug myself into a whole in school because depression made it so hard to go to class for a while. There's no coming back from this. It would be so much better to just go fall off of one of the parking garages on campus. Quick and easy and done with.
