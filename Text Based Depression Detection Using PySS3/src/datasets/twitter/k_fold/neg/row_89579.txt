A living ghost...I don't know if I would quite call myself suicidal... I don't want to live, let's put it that way. I hate my life, and I can't get over my immense depression. I've even gone as far as begging friends to end my life for me. They thought I was joking. I've never made it to an actual attempt, but I've gotten damn close. I'm seeing a counselor, but since I'm in school I can only see her every three weeks or more. I turned 18 recently and for a couple of days I felt amazing. It slowly faded, today I was mostly content, but right now all I can think about is ending everything and getting this bullshit life over with. I already know that none of my dreams will ever come true. Please don't try to tell me that "You never know" or anything like that. I know, for a fact, that my dreams don't have any chance of coming to fruition. At this point I only keep a hold on those dreams so I can tell people something to make them believe that I'm normal. I don't find it fair to force my problems on others, which is why I've kept most of the details to myself.

I feel like my life is a really bad movie that you paid a lot to see. You really want to leave, but there's still that feeling that you don't want to waste the money you spent on your ticket. I'm getting to a point where that tickets price is lower than the price I'm paying inside to watch this movie. It's killing me, and I don't even feel human anymore.

While talking to a friend I described it as feeling nothing for anything. Nothing makes me happy. I despise all that I once loved. I'm still alive, but my true self killed itself long ago. I'm a living ghost.

I'm sorry if this post has wasted your time. I understand completely. In reality I just want someone to ask me if I'm okay with true meaning behind it. I'm sorry.
