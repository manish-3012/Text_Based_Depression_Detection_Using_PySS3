Should I see a therapist? If so, how should I do it: through a school counselor or through my parentsI think about killing myself a lot, and I canâ€™t remember the last time I went a full day without wishing I was dead. My parents donâ€™t want to hear about my mental state, and neither does my sister. My mom makes everything about her and completely shuts down my feelings, my dad thinks Iâ€™m just joking or being over dramatic, and my sister is unsympathetic towards mental health in general. My last option as a person to talk to and confide in is my high school counselor. Iâ€™m reluctant to talk the counselor because I donâ€™t want her to tell my parents I went to her, but I really want emotional support that nobody in my family can provide, and I think going to a therapist would help. What should I do?
