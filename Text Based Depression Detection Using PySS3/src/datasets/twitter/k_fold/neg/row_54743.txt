Alright SW, I really need your help...I'll keep it short and put in more details if this gets any replies.
Damn, it even depresses me to talk about.

theres this girl, perfect in my eyes. We were talking over the internet for about a month (we're 5 hours away) and decided to meet. Well the last minute she cancelled the plans for who knows why. About a month later we start talking again, and now that we are, I want her more than I did before because I saw how easy it is to lose her. I want a relationship with her because I know it would work out but she wants to be friends because of the distance issues. 

I've had a major heart ache, bad anxiety, and extremely depressed because of it. I know how I'm going to kill myself just not when yet. I can't take this for much longer, and anything I try to get it off my mind never works. All I want to do is lay down all day and be a recluse. I've lost pretty much ll joy in everything I do, and can't concentrate in anything that I do.

A lot of people say that I'm just a dumb kid (I'm 17) for thinking this way, but its a serious problem to me. Its just getting too much to handle anymore.
