K i hope I can post this herSo, I hope this is okay bcus I'm probably not going to kill myself in the near future, if I'm being real. I tried twice though. Honestly tried. Just made the mistake of contacting my Ex shortlybefore and underestimating the time it took the ambulance. Now I gave myself 5 years (4 and a half of those left) and I said if life doesnt get better then it never will. I don't know if I'm gonne make it all the time through. Nobody whos important to me would care anyways, I guess. But then again, nobody is important to me, because I'm a pretty big fucking asshole. So now I just sit in my apartment, smoking too much, drinking too much and I don't know what to do. I also saw my ex earlier, which wasn't great.

I dunno, I just wanted to get this off my chest, I guess.
