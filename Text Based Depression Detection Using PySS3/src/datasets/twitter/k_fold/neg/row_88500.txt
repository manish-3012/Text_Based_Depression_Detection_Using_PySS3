No other optionsI've been depressed for a long time. I tried dealing with it by myself for more than five years, but couldn't make any progress. Went to professionals for help for another three years. It only got worse. At the end I was just told they couldn't help me any better.

Can't keep living like this anymore. This has to end. 
Why go back to therapy when they admitted they couldn't help me? Can't deal with this alone either. 

The only option I see is suicide.
