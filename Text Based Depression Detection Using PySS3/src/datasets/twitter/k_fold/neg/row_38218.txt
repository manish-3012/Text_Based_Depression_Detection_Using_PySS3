How to deal with suicidal thoughts?Whenever my parents are fighting, it triggers my suicidal thoughts. I know how stupid the fight is, but I just canâ€™t help but to think of suicide. I donâ€™t even know why am I having suicidal thoughts. I mean yeah, I have a lot of days when I think that Iâ€™m tired of living, I donâ€™t want to live anymore, Iâ€™ve also attempted suicide before. None of these fights are the main reason. But sometimes, like today when Iâ€™m feeling really good about myself, the fight triggers my suicidal thoughts, and think that it would be better if Iâ€™m dead. Itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m the reason why theyâ€™re fighting. Iâ€™m just scared that it might come real strong one day and just do it. Is there a cure for triggers?
