I hate myself so muchI'm 17, I've been homeschooled since I was twelve, and I'm about to be graduating highschool in 3-2 weeks. I have nothing. I don't plan on going to college because I'm too fucking dumb for college which became apparent when I took one, easy community college class and managed to fucking fail it. I have no friends because I'm homeschooled and have extreme social anxiety. The only people I talk to on a regular basis is my family and parents (unintentionally) encourage my suidical ideation by reminding what a fuck up I am. I've never been in a relationship and I really do nothing except scroll around reddit all day. I'm lazy, unmotivated, I have no job and can barely focus on the simplest of tasks. I fucking hate myself.
