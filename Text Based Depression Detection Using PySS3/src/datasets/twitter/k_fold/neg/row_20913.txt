I donâ€™t want to die, I just donâ€™t want to existI havenâ€™t been happy for a while. The more I think about it though I donâ€™t want to die because I donâ€™t want to hurt others, I just donâ€™t want to exist. In a way I wish I could oblivate my existence and just be dusted out of reality. Iâ€™m so sick and tired of fighting for happiness where non exists. Iâ€™m tired of seeing things I want to be able to do just out of reach. Iâ€™m tired of being depressed, angry and in pain physically and mentally. Existence is painful and I am done being in pain. How I wish magic existed in this world.
