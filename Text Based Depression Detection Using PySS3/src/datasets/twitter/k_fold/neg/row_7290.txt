I didn't goI didn't go to work today. I technically still have time, even if I'm late. I still have time to call in. To make up an excuse about why I can't go. I wish I could be honest and say I'm unwell. Tell them I'm sorry. Tell them I like this job and I'm grateful, but that I'm struggling. I didn't go last week either, but amazingly I still have a job. After today I probably won't. Last week the thought of losing my job was terrifying. I was so freaked out and anxious. I was so frustrates with my decision and inability to function. This week I'm okay with it. I know it's a shitty choice, but at this rate what does it matter?
