It isn't fair.It isn't fair that everyone else around me can be so happy but I can't. 

I didn't ask for any of this, I never asked to be born, I don't owe my family/friends jackshit. If it was my choice, I would never have been born.

Why tf does  everyone else get to be so happy but I don't? Why do *I* have to constantly feel like a useless sack of shit while so many others get to lead such content, fulfilling lives?

I'm not attractive or that smart, there's no reason anyone would want anything to do with me. My parents still think I'm the kid I once was, but they have no idea what a fucking loser I am. 

I'm done. I'm so done. I've purchased a rope and am going to hang myself today. Fuck this life.
