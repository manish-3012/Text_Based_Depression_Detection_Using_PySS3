Suicidal thoughts becoming more difficult to push downHi, this is my first time posting in something like this. 
It's just these days I have had aa much stronger urge to let go and off myself. Everyday I wake up and I feel stagnant, half dead. Whay makes it feel so much worse for me is that everytime I have those thoughts of suicide all I can think is how thankful I should be of my life, which only serves to make me feel even worse, because I know out there, there are people who deserve a better life than I do and I feel like a useless person. 

Worst of all, there is nobody to really talk things with. I don't feel that I could talk about this with my family or anybody. Today I broke down at the thought of how useless I am, and right now I honestly just want to die.
