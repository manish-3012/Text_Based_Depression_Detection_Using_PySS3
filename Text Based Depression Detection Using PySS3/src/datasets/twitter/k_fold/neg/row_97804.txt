Back in the gutter.The guy I thought I was going to marry ( he literally told me he picked a ring and was going to propose ) just left me. I have a shitload of pills and even though I promised my mom I wouldn't do anything, I really want to down the whole thing.

He was what pulled me out of the dark, and now I can feel myself falling back in it. I can't feel any reason to keep living. I don't have a job, I barely keep in touch with the one friend I have, and the only thing I should have to look forward to is my 21st birthday, which is four days from our anniversary. Not to mention I'm sleeping in a room with a AR safe.
