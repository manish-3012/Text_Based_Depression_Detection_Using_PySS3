I'm very worried about my ex-gf[F31]Hello,

My ex-gf of almost 10 years mentioned to me that she's at the stage where she's planning suicide. A few years ago she was found by a friend after overdosing on some pills (according to her. We live in separate countries now).

I have tried to tell her I'm here to listen but she rebukes me by saying that my feelings are fake. We have a very toxic and dysfunctional relationship so I not much help. Everyone else I turn to says she's doing it for attention. Regardless, I'm extremely scared about her.

What can I do?
