Seen to much, no one to talk to.The last few months of my life have been terrible. My homelife was fucking terrible, things happened and we (mother an I) got involved with some bad people, they stole stuff, beat her up, trashes our house , got into fights, eventually after the cops were called to many times I had to go to a refuge for a few days before a friend could pick me up to stay at their house. I have been with my mate for 2 weeks, the holidays are ending tomorrow, school starts. I am starting a new school in term 4 in a new city I have never fucking seen, and only for 2-3 weeks before we move across the country to start our new life over their. I am completely traumatized from what I have seen and what I have been through, I have no one to talk to. I don't know what to do. I don't want to kill myself but I am considering it as a viable option as it feels as if I have no where to turn. The fucking only thing that brings me happiness in my life is a fucking video game, and I can't play that for 3 weeks, I saw my mother for the 1st time in weeks and I didn't even want to talk. I don;t want to talk to anyone, I don't want to make 'friends' at a new school for 2 weeks then fuck off. I haven't slept at night properly in weeks, just don't know what to do.
