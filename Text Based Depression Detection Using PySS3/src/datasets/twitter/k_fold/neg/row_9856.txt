Giving up hope soonI don't even know what to do anymore. I'm losing hope. I'm so miserable. I really think that it won't get better. Everyday I want to die. I'm scared I'm going to be like this forever. Fuck. I think I need to go soon, but I'm too scared to die. I wish I was never born, that way I wouldn't have to die or suffer. I hate myself so much. I am nowhere in life and I'm just so jealous of everyone. People with friends, good looks, money, a future. I have no future. I have nothing in life. I hate my body. I have a binging problem. I have tried starvation, but I have always always went back to binging. I don't know if it's an eating disorder or addiction, but it sucks. I'm also really bored with life and everything seems pointless. I am always feeling every negative emotion there is. Anger, frustration, sadness, fear etc. I'm so tired. I can't go to college because I'm too scared of the social aspect and my family is poor. I can't drive. I'm twenty years old. I have never had a real friend and I will never date anyone. I feel like if I died five years ago or if I die five years in the future it wont even matter because nothing will change. Every day is stagnant and repetitive. I am so pathetic and if anyone ever reads this stupid post they probably will think that too. 

I hated high school. I was always left out. People would have conversations and I would never talk People would tell me I'm quiet and I wouldn't know what to say. Is it bad to be quiet? Now people from my graduating class are becoming engineers and doctors, while I'm living at home. I have nothing going for me. I got to see them talk about learning to drive and who they were dating and what there doing for college while I got ignored and left behind. I kinda feel like a ghost. I can't take it. i want to sleep forever. Oblivion sounds like heaven.
