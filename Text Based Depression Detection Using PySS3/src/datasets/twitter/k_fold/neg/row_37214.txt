Life will always be like this and itâ€™s not worth the pain.When youâ€™re in distress and feeling so depressed, everyone likes to tell you that youâ€™re not alone and that most people feel that way. I absolutely canâ€™t stand to hear that. It only confirms my thoughts that this is just how life goes and I will continue to feel so fucking shitty regardless. This is just life and man do I fucking hate life. And I have to experience it year after year after year? Why would I not just cut to the point and end my suffering now? Iâ€™ve tried talking, Iâ€™ve tried therapy, Iâ€™ve tried positivity, Iâ€™ve tried productivity, Iâ€™m successful in school and make decent money, I always can keep myself distracted, Iâ€™ve got hobbies to use as an outlet. All that and Iâ€™m still here thinking about how badly I want to kill myself every single day. Itâ€™s soul crushing to always wish that something terrible would happen to me so that I could die and finally end it. I have no will to live, no want to exist. There is no point in trying to get better because life will be shitty either way and I donâ€™t want to.  Itâ€™s so fucked up but it really feels like the only thing I want is to put this gun to my head and pull the trigger. Nobody can help me, I am the only one responsible for helping myself and Iâ€™ve already proven to be a failure at that. 

why.
