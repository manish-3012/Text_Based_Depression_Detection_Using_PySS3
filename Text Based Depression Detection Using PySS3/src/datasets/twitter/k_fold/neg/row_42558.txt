Final postThank you. Goodbye.
I tried to wait a couple days...on the request of someone...things got much worse...tonight is it. I'm sorry. I have disappointed everyone. My mother just told me she doesn't want to know me anymore....as we were by my grandmother's deathbed. I didn't even do anything, but say how I was feeling about her dying, which apparantly doesn't count for anything. The pain is unbearable. It won't stop. I have tried everything. Time to go. My birthday is next week...I won't see it. For this, I am glad.
