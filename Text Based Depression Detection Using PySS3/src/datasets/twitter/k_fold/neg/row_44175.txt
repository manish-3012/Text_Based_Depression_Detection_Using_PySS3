Life feels like its crushing my soulOh where do I start? My drivers license has been revoked for way longer than it should have and the DMV isnt listening to me about whats happening, I owe over 1000 dollars to the courts over a stupid traffic infraction of which I need to pay at least 50 dollars of it tomorrow which I dont have, I get fired and replaced at every job I apply to and if I dont get fired then I quit out of sheer anxiety, I am trapped living at home with my narcissistic mom who berates me for the tiniest things and she doesnt want me to move out or get a GF for some reason, I have no true friends, I flunked out of college recently because I couldn't focus on keeping up with stuff or afford tuition, and whole lots of other stuff. I just want to end it seriously. I don't know what death is like but I can imagine its a hell of a lot more peaceful than this shit I have been dealing with forever. I've tried so hard to fix stuff but it all comes crashing down again. I just want to give in to the temptation of the void. Sorry.
