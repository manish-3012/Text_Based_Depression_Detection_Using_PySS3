A big majority of the reasons I'm suicidal are related to money and it's the kind of money people my same age who had a better dice roll at birth blow in a few weeks. The world is horrible and cruel and I want outI failed/dropped out of college becaus I'd depression and now I'm supposed to pay my loans back already and my whole family is in crisis and fighting about it, blaming me for all of it. I can't go back to school anywhere else, and I can't pay for rent, my credit card bills, gas, or groceries. My credit score is 460. (*460*) My girlfriend has yelled at me almost every day for not being able to pay my share of rent on time and hit me for it a couple weeks ago.


I'm on 3 medicines and I ran out of one already and am taking half my dose on another because I can't afford the copays to get them refilled. Soon I'll run out of all of them and be fucked. I tried applying for free state insurance but screwed up the paperwork somehow and now it's too late to try again until the end of the year. I don't have a therapist, can't afford one and there are no free ones in my area (I've looked really hard).


I don't have friends to talk to about it and I can't talk to my girlfriend or family about it either. The closest thing I have to therapy is texting a crisis line, but that barely helps.


It's all about money. If I had been born rich I literally would be fine right now. I could be back in school, have my debts paid off or not have them in the first place, have the therapy and medication I need, and I would be completely fine. A number on a computer screen is making me not want to live and there's nothing I can do about it
