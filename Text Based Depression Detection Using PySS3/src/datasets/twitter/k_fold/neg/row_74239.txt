Screwed it up, like everything elseI fucked it all up again. My life is nothing but one fuck up after another. I'm 28 and I have nothing to live for. I want out. I tried to kill myself today. I fucked that up too, I broke the door and when I finally started to lose consciousness, I panicked and saved myself.

I just want out. Why cant this be easier, why do I have to keep living when I dont want to. Please someone end my misery.
