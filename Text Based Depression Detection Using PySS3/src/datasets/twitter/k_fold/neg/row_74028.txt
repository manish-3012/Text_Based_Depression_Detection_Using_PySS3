Please help me.As stated above, i am suicidal, i have been so for months, the only thing keeping me alive being guilt. Recently i managed to talk to someone who can help at my school (trained member of staff), 
this seemed promising, we talked about my anxiety and deppression and they said they would help me... i's been over 3 weeks and they haven't said anything.
On top of this my parents cannot know about this, they are most definitely not supportive, which means speaking to a doctor is out of the question (i'm not old enough to make an appointment.
Wherever i turn i see problems, i have no way out and i don't know what to do, even my best friend has abandoned me because my anxiety is getting so bad that i can't really hold normal conversation.  
I can't take it anymore, nobody seems to care.
