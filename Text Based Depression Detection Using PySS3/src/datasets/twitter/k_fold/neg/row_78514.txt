Yeahhhhhh, today is the inevitable day Iâ€™m feelinâ€™.My long term girlfriend just unexpectedly dumped me the other day. Thatâ€™s the icing on the cake. 

Been having too many other issues regarding finances, depression, family, and self-esteem. 

Thinking about taking a bunch of benzos to knock me out since I have zero tolerance and tying a plastic bag to my head right beforehand. That should work...I hope. 

Anyways, I hate to do the shitty thing, but I quite literally canâ€™t function anymore.
