Iâ€™m spentProbably going to get fired from my job. I never went to college and Iâ€™m almost 40 years old. If I lose my job, Iâ€™m absolutely FUCKED. WE are fucked. I donâ€™t think my girlfriend can pull both our weight, and who knows if I can find a job that doesnâ€™t make me want to die. 

I feel like a broken human being. A constant fuck up, a consistent let down. My girlfriend is a saint for putting up with me for so long, but she doesnâ€™t know what to do with me anymore. 

Iâ€™m not sure if I want to commit suicide, but I definitely want out. The meds arenâ€™t helping anymore and I donâ€™t even know where to turn to for help. Maybe stronger meds, but thatâ€™s not going to go well when I donâ€™t have money for an appointment, let alone to afford the meds.
