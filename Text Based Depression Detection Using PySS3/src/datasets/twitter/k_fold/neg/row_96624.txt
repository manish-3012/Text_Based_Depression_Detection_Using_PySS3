I just wanna die...I see no point in living anymoreI honestly canâ€™t take anymore...Iâ€™m 20 years old and my life has gone too downhill from here...Iâ€™ve suffered with depression since I was 14, and the shit that happens to me only fuels it...my girlfriend that I was so in love with died...my other ex girlfriend ended up cheating on me...I became a disappointment to my parents...my best friend died...my other best friend hates me now and will never talk to me again...I gave up on my dreams...I have absolutely no one now...I have no one to go to and I have no one that will listen, this honestly might be the last thing Iâ€™ll ever write...Iâ€™m gonna attempt to kill myself some time this week because I honestly see no point in going on anymore...I canâ€™t take anymore, I just wanna end it all...
