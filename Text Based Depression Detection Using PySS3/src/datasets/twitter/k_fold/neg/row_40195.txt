Bye guysFor a better day. I'm gonna be gone soon because this covid and elections has given me so much stress I don't wanna be on the earth. I'm sick of nasty reddit comments to me and being bullied all my life. I hate having autism but I like the people who have similar struggles.

This life is just cancer basically..
