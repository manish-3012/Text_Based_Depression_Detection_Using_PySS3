The idea of suicide..actually makes me feel good.Like,as I type,I feel kinda good about suicide somehow.

Because,I guess it offers a way out of this bullshit filled life.

And if our twisted motherfucker in chief is gonna get the world fucked up anyway,then why live?

I mean,I don't really know if there's anything left to look forwards to.

Shitty job market,the ever-present(and *rising*) possibility of nuclear war/holocaust,and the fact that America is fucked in more ways than one...

Again,I wish to fuck that dying wasn't so fucking hard...but it's so fucking scary..I mean,what else are we supposed to do? watch people suffer and die? suffer and then die ourselves? have NOTHING go right for us? It's too much fucking bullshit!

Because,for one,Maybe I won't have to see Japan get that third nuke(or US getting a nuke) at all. Can't see a nuclear war if you're already dead!(Taps head)

I mean,I have SEVERAL ideas on how to go out,but I just need to do some things beforehand,research and the like(I don't want to screw up any attempt..when I do it,I want that to be *it*.)
Honestly,why live when there's so much bullshit in the world?

And I must reiterate..this shit is fucking scary..but what's more scary:Death or living in a burned-out husk of a world and/or a world not worth living in(in HUGE part,due to our twisted motherfucker in chief)?

Think about it. I sure as hell have.
