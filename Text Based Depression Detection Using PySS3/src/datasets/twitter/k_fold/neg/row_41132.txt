Nothing left to live for now that my boyfriend left meI don't have any goals in life, the only thing that was keeping me alive was my boyfriend, who I loved more than anything. But we recently broke up and now I've got nothing left to live for. The only thing that could keep me from offing myself would be if my boyfriend gave me one last chance, but I can't force him into it, and he probably wouldn't do it anyways, nobody would want to be with a waste of space like me. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself what not to do in my relationship. Before I started dating him, I was completely unhappy, and suicide was on my mind from time to time. Then suddenly I fell in love and I started feeling happy when I was with him. And I started craving that happiness (clinginess was one of the biggest reasons he broke up with me- he won't even talk to me now). I don't want to go back to being unhappy like I was before, it's like going from Windows 98 to Windows 7, and then being expected to go back to 98. I wish he would give me a chance so I didn't have to do this. I know you're going to say something like "there will be other guys", but honestly, I can't bear to suffer like this while I try to get over him. The only thing that gets me through each day is my cutting and constant napping. I've already set a date, but I wish he would just give me one last chance.
