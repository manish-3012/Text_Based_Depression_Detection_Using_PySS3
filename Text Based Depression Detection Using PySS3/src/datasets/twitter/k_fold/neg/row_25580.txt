OD because I am at rock bottomI think I am going to OD because I will not be able to take a public hate campaign and I know terrible information that IDK what to do with

Iâ€™ve been in a 3 year relationship with a successful musician. Everything has been getting to me (from my past to this breakup that happened 2 weeks ago). Iâ€™m really afraid of things going public because I think his fans will create a smear campaign against me or send hate. Iâ€™ve already seen many comments speculating about our breakup. He has been receiving some hate, as am I when they donâ€™t even REALLY know me or what has happened! We looked perfect in the public eye as well. Paparazzi have come up to me asking why Iâ€™ve been looking sad lately, why Iâ€™ve been less active, and asking questions about my boyfriend. 

Now being out of it, Iâ€™ve realized how abusive, manipulative &amp; selfish he really is. And fans fueling his ego doesnâ€™t help at all. He kicked me out of our home through a letter on a table after I had just got done w errands. No real explanation, I thought things were perfect as we discussed getting spontaneously married in a few weeks . I am now looking for a new home, staying with friends, trying to be strong but I canâ€™t. I can barely process anything. Iâ€™ve lost 11 lbs already. And only get 2-3 hours of sleep a night. 

His manager has been supplying us with drugs and thatâ€™s where Iâ€™m going to get my fix from. The abuse Iâ€™ve received from the music industry, family, and him is all clouding up my mind rn. Even though Iâ€™ve gone though a lot, from being a public figure to my own personal bs. Nothing has hurt me more than this. I actually loved that guy with everything in me. I have never loved anyone or anything more. Directly after the breakup I went through his phone/computer to get answers as he told me nothing. He was loyal to me but I saw in a few convos w his friends he was saying the reason why he wants to break up is bc there is no spark. Thatâ€™s it. 

I also saw a history of him watching rape videos whenever Iâ€™d be away from him and that he HAS HAD RAPE ALLEGATION on him that he paid off a year before we met! And it never got leaked or talked about. Even I never fucking knew about this or heard until I searched through everything. I am thinking about connecting w the alleged victim though before I OD though. This breaks me so much because on social media he has made posts about feminism. And also I would see females approach him after shows telling him how amazing of a guy he is etc etc. 

Iâ€™m in a world of shock. I donâ€™t know what to do. Or how to process any of this. Iâ€™ve tried to talk w therapists, hang out with friends/family, record in the studio, nothing brings me joy. Our last interaction was me confronting him in which he was completely silent and shoved me out the door. Yet heâ€™s still painting himself out to be this great guy. I know people have good/bad in them but the BAD REALLY OUTWEIGHS THE GOOD. 

This all hits different, this has been my first relationship w another public figure, first relationship where we lived together w the same goals, and the only man I actually gave my all to. It hurts so much. 

I have lived my life already. Iâ€™m in my 20s and have been able to tour the world, I found love (then lost it), I am self sufficient, battled abuse, but now... I just canâ€™t do it anymore. Idk what to do.
