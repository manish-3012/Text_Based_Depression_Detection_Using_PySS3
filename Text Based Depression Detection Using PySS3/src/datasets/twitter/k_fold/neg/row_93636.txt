Im slowy spirallingI have autism, pretty low on the spectrum but its there none the less. Ive always been a bit odd and not really known how to understand certain emotions like empathy. And me being autistic has also made me hyper aware of my surroundings and everything i do. So now i am constantly self aware of every single thing and how people react around me. So this shit has now grown into full blown social anxiety where i cant even order stuff from a resturant or anything because i dont want to have to go through that social interaction becuase i dont want to mess up. This also really affects my relationships with people because im overly emotionally attatched to people and clingy especially my girlfriend. More and more i notice we argue more often and i dont think we will last much longer becuase of the way that i am. Ive already lost most of my friends and shes the only person i have left. I drive people away with being too emotionally independent and its esting away at me. I feel so isolated despite still having family around me that care. When i start spinning ideas in my head i go through manic emotional cycles of ragin anger where i start breaking shit, which goes into hurting myself (biting, pulling hair, punching, smacking head agaisnt the wall. Etc) and then into manic depressive episode where i feel hopeless until the cycle continues. I feel so lost and i really dont know how i can deal with my emotions properly at all. I dont think i want to stay alive.

Also sorry for spelling mistakes im on mobile
