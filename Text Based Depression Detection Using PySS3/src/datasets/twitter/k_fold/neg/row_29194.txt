My nephew killed himselfRight now my nephews body is on life support, waiting for organ donors to be ready for his body parts. He shot himself yesterday. He was only 20.

I can tell you, his family is devastated. We have all tried to help him, but his drug addiction and poor choice of friends has beaten him.

Reading through these suicide notes, you all seem to be only focused on yourself. When you consider suicide, do you think about the wreckage you are leaving behind when you are gone? My whole family is devasted. We all wish he would have reached out. We all feel like we failed him.

I guess that is why suicide is considered the ultimate selfish act. You all really have not even one clue what you are doing to your family... 

Don't do it. Life is really hard... I know, I am in my 50s. But I have learned that tomorrow your problems won't be as bad as they are today. You must keep talking, even if you feel like no one is listening! Please just reach out... Even if you have to do it every day...
