SupportIf no one reaches out today from my friends or family I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna give up all together. I know it's wrong and not worth it and that people care and that should stop me but it won't. I'm just ready to give this all up. I don't want to hurt anyone anymore and I don't want to suffer anymore
