A message to my little buddy.Hey, I'm sorry for failing you, I know you were hurting the whole time I had you, but I tried my best, you were amazing, and you didn't deserve what happened to you. The thought of me being alive, And not you, is sickening, I would fucking gut myself right know if it meant my family could have you back, hell I think they'd appreciate you, more than me.

You know, I have been thinking about suicide, but..I'm afraid that I won't be able to join you, I fucking love you, and I'm so afraid. I feel like everyone has gave up on me since you've left, please come back, please..or I'll come to you, I don't know if heaven and hell exists, but I know you're in heaven, you're a saint, and I don't know if I can follow..I'm planning on overdosing when I turn 21. 

 
Until then, I'll rot in my eternal guilt until then.

I love you.
