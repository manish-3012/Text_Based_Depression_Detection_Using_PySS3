I'd like to finally die alreadyI've overdosed probably like 3 times within the last 2 years and I'd like to finally die I'm really sick of being alive it's really a bad and terrible time on a pretty consistent basis. I was raised by a dad who thought it was great to call me a retard and a bitch and threaten to kill me and scream at me and lecture me and make me cry and today he told me that I love to ruin my own life. I want to die so much. I'm never going to get better. He has me diagnosed with borderline personality disorder because he's a physician and he talked to my last psychiatrist because he manipulated me into letting my psych talk to him. I switched psyches and I've been living away from home but I'm still in hell and he thinks that "proves" that he's a great person and I'm terrible.

I want to move away 2 hours where my boyfriend lives. I got accepted into school for vocal performance (I lived there for 3 years) and I have a stable living situation June 1st but I don't have enough money to make it that long so I'd rather just die. I can't spend every day crying and being miserable.
