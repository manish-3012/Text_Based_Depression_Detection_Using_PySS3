When you've reached such dark, impossible depths...How can you return to being the person you once were? I've seen too much, done too much, experienced too much. It's holding me back from recovering. Having had a taste of true despair, I can never go back. Happiness feels like a dull, transparent charade that I can never achieve. Knowing what is really out there, I can't simply go back to a regular life and act like everything is okay while I'm going insane on the inside. Staying this way seems easier, more comfortable.
