I think today may be my last.Everything's becoming too overwhelming and once it's late enough into the night I think it would be enough to go and finally end this miserable life of mine. I have a plan that works, if a certain friend doesn't call again. But I don't know if I'll be able to actually move.. I don't know what I want anymore but dying fixes everything, like this pain in my chest... And everything else.

Dying would fix everything, and I'd stop being such a nuisance and a past to the people I care about.

I can't waste anyone's time if I'm dead.

I think once the time is right, I'll go.
