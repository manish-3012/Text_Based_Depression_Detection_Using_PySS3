can't live in societyi can't live in society. i simply don't understand all there rules, goals and strange (for me) things. i don't get how all this works, why i have to feed myself, but to get food i have to do some job, and if i'm stupid and can do nothing?? it's like everyone else know something since their childhood that i still don't know at my 20's. i don't know how to live with people, talk to them and how to work and... i should die.
