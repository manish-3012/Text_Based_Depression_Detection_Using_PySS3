just want to go to sleep for a littleiâ€™m so anxious i canâ€™t function. itâ€™s not going away. i had a breakdown and shut down completely. i thought about killing myself and got a wave of peace. i was laying on my bed staring at the feeling and i was calm for the first time since i can remember. i felt no anxiety. just relief. i could barely move and didnâ€™t have any water in my room to take the pills so i didnâ€™t. itâ€™s been a few days and i still feel horrible and i really want to do it. not even die just maybe go to sleep for a few days. iâ€™m so tired i donâ€™t know how to live like this.
