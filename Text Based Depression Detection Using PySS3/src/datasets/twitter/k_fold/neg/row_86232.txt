I'm giving up SW, is there anything I can do?I've posted here once before under a different guise, but for some reason I feel like I should start over fresh.

I turn 19 in a couple of weeks and I'm about ready to end all of this. It seems like no matter how hard I try, this negative pull, or this painful emptiness never leaves me permanently. I used to be very healthy and lived a very good life until I broke up with the love of my life/best friend of 5 years. It has been about a year now and no matter how hard I try, I always fall into my depressed state; I literally believe I'm going crazy, there's no way this is all a consequence of my break up? I have dated other women, taken time to try and be comfortable being alone, been involved in my favorite sports... but they're all temporary fixes at best. I'm doing poorly in school at the moment, I'm beginning to hate my job, and the choices I have been making. I know that she still thinks of me and loves me, and so does my family, and those are the only reasons I am still around, but I'm starting to believe that I am suffering too much  to think about their comfort anymore. I still have trouble being alone sometimes and think about her every day. I am pathetic. I have no trouble being social, I am a good looking athletic guy and used to be a 4.0 student, but now I don't know what I am. I've been thinking of enlisting just to find something to do with my life where my emotions are nullified. 

If any background information is needed, here it is: I grew up in a loving large family, except my father left when I was a baby, so maybe there's something to think about. 

So PLEASE SW, save me from myself. I'm scared..

Edit: Thank you all for your support; I've read some very insightful stuff and I really am trying to just keep moving and be involved in life. I do know that I need to stop dwelling and I guess I needed a reality check. I just hope that I can stop these episodes..
