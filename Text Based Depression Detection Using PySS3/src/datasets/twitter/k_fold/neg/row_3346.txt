I am very angry and frustrated at myself. Huge regrets and disappointments. I might end up doing something.I am smart, talented and hard working. Yet I am a big failure when all my friends are now accomplished. 

&gt;I graduated from engineering in 2008. Got a job as a software engineer and turned it down to startup on my own. Did not go as expected. However, I did get some cashflow going when I tried something (A) but complicated that too much and messed it up.

&gt;Then, I got another opportunity to partner with a guy who was experienced. I went to another city to startup with him. Worked my ass off and established a base there, but he did not work and I ended up doing everything for next to nothing. Walked away from that with nothing. That company is now doing well (B).

&gt;I came back to my home city. One of my old customers offered me a contract and I almost got started working on it. However, in the last moment, Something did not feel right. Like If I took that up, I would not be happy and missed out on that opportunity (C).

&gt;If I had taken up any of those, I would be making a lot of money and I would have also had the free time to try out other things. Instead, I am still struggling at 25 with nothing to my name.

&gt;Did I mention that I had to drop my dreams as a very talented artist when I was young since my parents did not want to get into that? Now, the guy(s) who took that shit up are raking in money with animation, film making, camera guys, visual effects, artist, designers, etc.

&gt;I was one of the smart ones. I feel like a complete failure. I am ashamed of myself. Not sure what to do.

please help.

If someone could just get on skype or something and talk to me. It would be great too.

btw...I don't live in the US. 

Any help would be appreciated. I can't sleep since I am so angry at myself. I might do something to myself.
