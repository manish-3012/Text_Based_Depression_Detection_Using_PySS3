I genuinely see no point to keep going anymore.For the past year, everything has just been going downhill. I have anger issues and I've done so many things that make me feel like a trash human being. I don't deserve a family, or love anymore. I feel so terrible for everything I've done. My older brother opened up to me about seeing no point to live anymore, and it just made me feel terrible. I have so much guilt from my past and I just can't let it go, even when I've tried to hard. My dad is fucking terrible person and he abused me and my mom and my family for years. My mom has been arguing alot with her new boyfriend, and taking out all her anger on me. I feel so terrible because nobody understands me. I wish I could just start a new life but if I kill myself I'll just be in eternal torment forever, and I'll leave even the people I care about scarred forever.
