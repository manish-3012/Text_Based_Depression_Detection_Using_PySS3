Give me a reason to be happy please.I posted here a while back and I really felt better afterwards. I actually recently thought maybe I wasn't depressed and that I was just being stupid.

I don't have any motivation to do anything, I can't even get out of bed most days and tasks like finding a job or talking to other people just seem so meaningless and stupid.

I don't know where people get motivation from i've tried so hard recently to just get up and do stuff and I just can't. Most weeks I can't even be bothered to shower. Nothing I can think of doing, or that I see other people do seems worth the effort they have to put in.

I'm not really considering suicide or anything but this community has really helped me before and i guess I'm just hoping for that kind of lift again to get me out of bed in the mornings at least.

I don't know who else to turn to really, I don't want to worry my family because they have all their own shit going on at the moment and I don't want being being an idiot to make things any worse for them. I don't really feel close enough to any of my friends either to talk to them about this, they don't really know how I feel about stuff and i'd kind of rather they didn't know really.
