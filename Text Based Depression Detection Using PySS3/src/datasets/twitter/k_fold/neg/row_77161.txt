I don't knowI'm scared. I honestly can't imagine any way for my life to pan out where I don't kill myself soon. I can't even imagine making it to the end of the year. A few months ago I was thinking about preordering something that comes out in September and I thought to myself "But I won't be here then". I've been planning since middle school to kill myself before I graduated high school but now I'm in college. The first time I held a gun to my head was in the 6th grade and I just wish that I got it over with back then. Nothing has improved it's only gotten worse. I just want it all to end. I don't think that I was meant to live. It feels like there was some glitch in the system and I was born somehow. I don't think that I'll ever be a normal functioning adult. I feel like a kid in an adult body. I have 0 life experience and I'm a complete loser. A lot of times I wish that a freak accident would happen and kill me instead so that my family wouldn't be mad at me for killing myself. I'm just over it all. I'm sorry that this doesn't all make sense I don't know how to put my thoughts together.
