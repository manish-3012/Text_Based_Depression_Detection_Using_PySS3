I wish people peace when they post about killing themselves.Let's be honest. Pro life comments get downvoted here easily. Nobody wants to hear that life is beautiful or you're meant to "face challenges" (which is just sugarcoating of "man the fuck up, you pussy"). 

Life does not get better on its own and that's the harsh reality of it. People will tell you that it's up to you to fix yourself and that you're always in charge of your life. All those experts tell you that it's all your fault and that you shouldn't blame depression or any other shit. 

I will probably never kill myself, because I'm too much of a pussy to handle pain. However, there are people who are brave enough to do something like this. They choose the most effective way out of this dump.

While I will probably never gather courage to do it, I hope people find peace, whether it's by suicide or eventually fixing their lives. I can't stop them anyway.

I'm so envious sometimes.
