Trying to recoverI used to look around for help all the time wondering if Iâ€™ll actually ever find it, I asked so many people and went to so many counsellors and therapists but they didnâ€™t seem to help as much all they kept saying was â€œI understand and know how you feelâ€ which I found annoying after a while because they have no idea what someone is going through unless theyâ€™ve actually lived the life of that person. 

Help isnâ€™t as easy as people say it is to find and I will continue to look until I find the right help I need. Having my boyfriend there has made a massive difference to my life and has helped me through so much more than I got through on my own. He is the reason my suicide never happened in the end and I thank you so much for that.
