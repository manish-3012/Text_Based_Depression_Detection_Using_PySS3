I felt compelled to post her after my third day in a row standing on a bridgeAll I do these days is mope around. I tell everyone I'm just tired or sick or have a headache. Everyone either believes me or doesn't care enough to call me out. I've had a loving girlfriend for almost two years now. I have a great home life and an expensive therapist. I don't know why it doesn't do anything. I feel trapped. Stuck. My legs are always fucked up from my knife. I'm so bored and lonely. It could be because I'm intelligent. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bragging. I wish I was average. Or content with shallow things. I just don't give a shit about your dog or the weather or sports. I feel lonely in the sense that the only person I can actually have a conversation with is my girlfriend. Who I can't do much with out of school because of her abusive father. I'm so absent all the time and it kills her. I just want to die. I was so close to taking some pills earlier. I didn't. She kept me holding on. I have such a great life and so much to live for. School is a breeze, yet I fall asleep in every class and can't manage to do any work. My best friend is temporarily living across the country from me and is busy all the time now. If I told her the truth I'd just let her down anyways. I'd like to give you something better to read but this is all I can manage. I just want to crawl into bed and never get out. I have some interests but no energy to do them. I built my mom a new computer for valentines day and it made her so happy. It made me almost want to live. So yeah... I just want to off myself to make it stop. I don't know what it'll bring. I'm more afraid of nothing than I am of whatever asshole created this life. Whoever you are, I hope you're in a much better spot than me. No one deserves this shit
