I just want someone to give a shit.I have friends and I love them. I have my mom and I love her. But we're not affectionate and that's just how it is and it isn't going to change. But every person I try to form an affectionate relationship with just wants to use me for sex or to boost their self esteem, then either pretend I don't exist until they are feeling down on themselves again. I can't put myself at risk by trying to meet many people during covid and honestly that's fine because I don't have the emotional energy for that. But the few connections I've made in the past couple years just seem to go the same way. No matter how well I think things are going, it always seems to go the same way. They like me enough to keep me around as a consolation prize for when things go badly with people they like better. I just want some kid of consistency. I just want someone to really care about me, not just when they want something from me. I never meet people like that, so I've started shutting myself off to everyone and it's so fucking lonely.
