I want to be happy.What do you do when you want to be happy so so so bad and no matter how hard you try you just canâ€™t fight the feeling? Itâ€™s funny I got told by my mom today that I should really rethink my whole life and depression because there are people who have actual clinically diagnosed mental health issues and Iâ€™m just giving people like that a bad name because my pain is only temporary. Gee thanks mom. I donâ€™t know what feels worse, the fact my own mothers doesnâ€™t really care, or the fact that I feel like I deserve all of this..
