Thinking about deathI just posted this in another sub but i really need someone's help
Hello, im new to reddit and my first language isn't English so I'm sorry for any mistake
I'm very very sad and thinking about killing myself, my life is literally falling apart everyday, I'm trying so hard to keep it all together but i just can't
4 years ago i jumped from the 5th balcony
Since then i always want to die, i don't want to be alive anymore 
Yesterday i tried to kill myself but it just won't work out, i can't even die peacefully 
I don't know what to do anymore
