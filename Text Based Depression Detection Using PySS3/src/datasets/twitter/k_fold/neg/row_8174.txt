I don't know where to go from hereHello everyone, 2 weeks ago over in /r/Depression  I posted a [thread about not knowing what to do with myself](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/3bbmbf/i_dont_know_what_to_do_with_myself/) &amp; I suppose this is a continuation of that post as I still don't know what to do with myself...
A few months ago I met this girl online whom we'll call "Sarah". Sarah is such a sweet girl &amp; we get along really well, we're both the same age but live in different parts of the country. After several months of talking with Sarah I start to realise that I've got a crush on her so a few weeks ago I pluck up the courage to tell her this. To my surprise, Sarah also quite likes me as well (to the point where she thought she was out of my league. I thought that was the cutest thing ever :)) couldn't quite believe that especially after past experiences including that of Jane &amp; the fact that I thought Sarah was way out of my league.
That was taken from the thread linked to above. Things are still going well between "Sarah" &amp; I, but I would like to ask her out as I think we have chemistry &amp; I'd like to see where things end up however she thinks we should wait (which I'm find with)  I'm just scared that whilst we're only still ***"cosy friends"*** (her words not mine, hehe, which I think is cute because to me that suggests we're more than friends yet not quite exclusive.) She'll find someone better &amp; who lives nearer, I have no reason to believe she would or has done that but I just don't know what to do.

Because she said we should wait, two things are currently going through my mind: 1) I don't want to annoy her by continuously asking her out &amp; her reply being "we should wait" &amp; 2) She's saying "we should wait" because she likes someone else &amp; is too afraid to tell me, even though I did tell her I didn't want to be stuck in the friendzone with her reply being "I'm sure that won't happen". :(

She takes a while to reply sometimes (which isn't a bad thing plus she always ends her messages with a ridiculous amount of kisses &lt;3 &amp; I do the same :)), I'm not jealous I'm suppose I'm more paranoid that it will turn out like my previous relationship ([with a girl called "Amy"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/2qnmrw/i_feel_tomorrow_will_be_my_time/)) &amp; that "Sarah"'s found someone else. 

"Sarah" &amp; "Amy" are two different girls, and I feel differently about them: Whilst I find both girls attractive, Sarah feel more like my bestfriend/soulmate than Amy did. "What I have" (it sounds really clichÃ©) with Sarah whatever it may be, it feels more real than it did with Amy. I'm starting to realise that what I felt for Amy was more of an infatuation than actual love &amp; I feel "actual" love for Sarah.

Sarah feels like "wife material", I never felt that with Amy. That probably sounds weird saying that this early on but I suppose when you know, you know.  kinda want to tell her that but I'm scared she might think I'm weird &amp; be scared off. :/

It's coming up to a year ([in August](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/2dvxpe/reddit_i_need_your_help_im_being_a_massive_idiot/)) since I met "Amy" &amp; told her I was catfishing her, I would never have dreamed of what lay ahead of me. As the anniversary approaches, all the thoughts, feelings &amp; emotions I've felt over the past year are coming flooding back &amp; I feel as that date comes ever closer they will overwhelm me more than they are now. I kinda fear for my safety.

The only things that are calming me down &amp; distracting myself from all these things are thoughts that "Sarah"'s in a situation where she can't possibly reply (as I haven't heard from her since yesterday). That I can always overdose if these thoughts become too overwhelming &amp; the smoothing music of The Smiths, The Antlers &amp; Sigur RÃ³s.
