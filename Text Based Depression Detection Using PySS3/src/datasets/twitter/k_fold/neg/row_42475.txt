I hate myself. I am the reason why my life is terrible and that's why I am going to end it.I'm a shit person. I have BPD and I have no fucking clue how to control it. I've tried everything in my power to keep happy and under control (therapy, medicine, gone to 2 mental hospitals) but nothing works. I have ruined my friendships with some of the only people I could be 100% open with. I have pretty much ruined my relationship, even though my girlfriend is with me still, she will never trust me 100% again. I'm not allowed to have female friends and I can't connect with other guys well. (Trust me my girlfriend isnt a controlling bitch, too much backstory to get into). 

Music is my only passion but i'm too depressed to even pick up a guitar half the time so I am stuck not improving and going nowhere while I am in my prime (20 yrs old). Even if life was better I can't afford any recording equipment or anything like that. I can barely afford to rent a bedroom with my girlfriend, that's right I can barely afford 225$ a month rent because of so many other expenses and a shitty job. I can't get a different job because I just lose control after 6 months and quit or get fired. 

Life isnt worth living if it's 10% okay 90% misery. I'm stuck with a shitty life. Shitty mental disorder. Shitty job. Shitty living situation. And I am done. I can't wait to shoot myself in the head, I can't fucking wait.
