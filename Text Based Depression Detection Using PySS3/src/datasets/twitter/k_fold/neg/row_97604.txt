Iâ€™m so angry all the timeIâ€™m so angry about everything. Classes started recently and Iâ€™m so upset that Iâ€™m missing out in a year of my freedom. Iâ€™m going into my third year of university. I finally felt like I was in a good headspace and was able to manage my classes. I felt ready to improve my grades and finally felt confident enough to try making more friends. Then a pandemic happens and ruins everything. 

On top of that, my home life sucks. Thereâ€™s a lot of fighting that goes on. My parents argue a lot. My sister fights with my parents etc. And my parents are pretty overprotective of us as well which makes it hard to go out whenever I want. Iâ€™m just overall super depressed about the situation and feel like I have nothing to look forward to. 

My grades have been shit the past two years because I was too shy to make friends and mostly stuck to myself. I feel like I need balance in my life. A bad social life is a major reason that my grades have struggled so much. This year I joined a club and I feel like Iâ€™m finally gaining confidence to become a more social person. But itâ€™s so hard with everything online. I feel so alone. 

Recently Iâ€™ve been having a lot of bad thoughts. I have a history of cutting myself and although I havenâ€™t done it in 10 months, the urges are becoming really strong again and hard to resist. I find myself constantly laying in bed and listening to angry music. I also canâ€™t stand to be around other people anymore and find everyone so fake. I feel like I Iâ€™ve become such an angry cynical person. I know my therapist always tells me I just need to change my mindset. But itâ€™s so much easier said than done.
