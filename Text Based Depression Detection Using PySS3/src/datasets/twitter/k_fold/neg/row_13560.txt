What do I do when I just can't push anymore?I'm tired.

I'm just so fucking tired of fighting all the time.

Everyday it's a struggle, a battle, to keep moving, to keep breathing.

I'm not even living for myself, not really, hell I haven't been living for myself since I became 13.

Everything I've done is because that's what's expected of me, or what I'm supposed to do, or what a good son does or a good brother does.

I just want to die, but I'm not allowed.

Isn't that just the fucking funniest thing?

I'm not allowed to die, because that's not what I'm supposed to do.

I'm supposed to live, because that would make my family happy, me living. I'm supposed to take care of people, because that's what a strong man's supposed to do right?

Doesn't matter if my mind's breaking every second, doesn't matter if I have to press hot metal to my skin just to feel enough pain to remind myself that I'm still alive. Doesn't matter that every damn day blends together into one seeming mess of bullshit.

I want to die. I want oblivion. I want the peace that was promised to me.

I want to be alone in the darkness, I want nothingness, I want the voices to stop, I want the pain to stop, I want everything to fucking stop because I've had enough.

I want to die.

But I'm not allowed.

I can't be selfish, I have to be good.

Everyone else can be selfish, everyone else can want what they want, but not me.

I'm not allowed.

Why can't I die.

Why can't this end.

I'm tired of hurting.

I'm tired of fighting.

I'm tired.

I'm tired.

Please, someone, anyone, help me.

Tell me what to do.

Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

I just want it to stop.

I didn't ask to live.

I didn't demand this.

I don't want it anymore.

WHY CAN'T I BE ALLOWED TO DIE
