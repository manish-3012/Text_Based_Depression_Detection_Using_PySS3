I feel lost and terrifiedI've been thinking a lot about the financial/occupational side of my future, and it's terrified me. My passions are music and literature, my main passion being music. However, you can only learn so much on your own, and that weighs true in this situation. So, knowing that my two actual passions won't be a source of reliable income, or at least a big enough one, I had to think. For a while, I figured I'd just be a Welder. I'd go to a trade school and learn welding and be a welder and work on music stuff on the side. Seems easy enough, right? That's what I thought too. Correct me if I'm wrong, but welding requires mathematics and blueprint reading and such. I'm terrible with math and always have been, and I've never been able to understand blueprints. I felt so secure in my plan for a while, or at least as secure as I can get, but now I'm panicking again. I have zero fucking idea what I'll do to support myself after I graduate. And I can't just take a break after highschool to figure it out or anything, they wouldn't allow it. I'd be a disappointment. So I don't know what to do. My senior year of highschool is this year, so I only have that time to figure it out, and I don't know what to fucking do. I hate college and refuse to attend it, so trade school seems to be my only option, but I feel like my options are limited in the sense that I'd be miserable doing most of them. I don't know. I'm just so scared and so lost. It doesn't help that I'll be alone when I graduate, since my only friend is going in the airforce. I'll have nobody and will be all on my own. And dating isn't an option. I'm simply not good enough. My future is looking grim. I don't know where to turn or what to do. I feel like my fate as a failure is sealing itself, and I'm running out of time to reverse it.
