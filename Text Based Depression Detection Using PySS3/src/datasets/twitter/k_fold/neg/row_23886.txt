I don't know what I'm living for anymoreThere was a time when I would just buy things online and wait for the package to arrive. That used to give me something to look forward to. Nothing expensive, just some small things for my pc or an acccessory maybe. But I know that I really have nothing to look forward to in the end. After every package it's the same old "Why do I suffer at all?" I can't really find anything to keep me going.
