I'm just tired of this. Why won't anyone talk to me?I just want to talk to someone. A person I know. Now, you guys do a great thing here. Offering help to those who are really lost for nothing in return. But I wish someone in real life, who I know, who didn't first meet me because of what I'm contemplating. A hypothetical person who likes my personality and doesn't just pity me. Why does know one care until they know I don't wanna exist anymore? Why won't anyone talk to me? Why do I spend days at a time inside my home? Why won't anyone ever call and just ask how I'm doing? Why do I still have all this social media when no one has contacted me in months? Why does no one reply? Why am I not worth the effort? Why does no one think about me or consider me a person with feelings and everything else everyone else has?
