It seemed all good for a brief momentYesterday I had a good talk with my parents about how I should approach my depression and what realistic goals I should try to achieve. I listened, and everything they told me made sense. Today, I am at work again, crying alone because the sense of reality has once more overwhelmed me. It hurts me insanely to see how worried and scared they are for me. I could not gather the strength to tell them that I do not even feel that I want my life to change. How can I possibly tell them I contemplate about how soothing suicide seems to me every day? How the hell can I stop feeling sorry for myself and man up and achieve my goals one by one making my life finally work?
I am a disappointment to them. They told me not to worry so much, they told me not to obsess about things, but instead to plan my course of action to get my life in order. But today, it all seems just so damn overwhelming again. I wish I got into an accident and died instantly. I am too weak of a person to fight for life. I fear I will end my life when my parents pass away. That way I will at least not cause them pain:( I feel completely worthless, I hate myself, have nevet loved myself. I wish I never came into this world.
