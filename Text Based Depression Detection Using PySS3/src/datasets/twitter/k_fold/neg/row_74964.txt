If ECT fails, I'll probably kick the bucket.(M, early 20s.)

Right now, I really hate my life. I'm home from college because I'm too depressed to do work. I've been on/off suicidal and constantly miserable since 16 and feel like I'm locked in a cage with a father who's always pushing me to do things his way, like I neither have nor deserve a free will, which is how he treated me up thru high school.

I've tried several medications. They've all totally failed, except bupropion which initially gave me enough a boost to make me want to go to college but then stopped working. All of my friends have at least had one relationship, but I've never been with a woman. Actually, I sometimes think I might be gay and I so thoroughly hate that (I don't know why. I'm not a homophobe). I also no longer feel any joy in anything, no interest or purpose, and I feel like so much of a wuss that I'll never be able to stand up for myself and be a strong, independent person. 

I'm bitter towards everyone around me, esp. whenever they have an annoying flaw. Part of me wants to die in order to hurt the people I feel have slighted me, some of whom I want to call friends but am too emotionally distant. I feel all alone bitter, angry, and miserable beyond any hope.

I know most of my thoughts have to be irrational, but that doesn't change the fact that I'm terrible and just want that pain to be over. If ECT doesn't work, I no longer will feel obligated to live.

Try to change my mind, I guess.
