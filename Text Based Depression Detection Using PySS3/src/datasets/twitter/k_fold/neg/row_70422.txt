What do I doSuicide is the easier option. 

I can't and don't want to get out there, make friends, love myself, find something I love to do, and maybe perhaps a woman may come into my life or she may not. I can't do it. I don't know how to do it.

I can't focus on loving myself. The only thing I can focus on is being loved by someone else and that someone else showing it physically, which will never happen. I want to hang myself.
