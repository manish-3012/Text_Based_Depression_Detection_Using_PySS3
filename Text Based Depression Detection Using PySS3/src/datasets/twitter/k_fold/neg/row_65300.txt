How to tell my parentsI've been 'depressed' for a long time now, the past six months or so I've beginning to feel like its not worth going on anymore. I won't go into it to bore you, but I'm scared of feeling suicidal and despite the fact that I keep thinking this way I don't know how to talk to anyone about it. I don't have any friends, I live in a furniture-less studio apartment, unemployed, kicked out school (for a year) and my parents are across the country. I just want to let them know I'm feeling this way and maybe it will help to stop these ideas that keep popping up in my head every time my brain and 'heart' decide to screw with me again, but I can't talk to them, they have no idea whats been going besides the well-known fact that I'm a loser at life...sorry for asking but I feel like I'm starting to wind down further and further and i dont want to go without anyone knowing...
