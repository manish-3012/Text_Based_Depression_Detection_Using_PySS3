On the edge of giving up26 y/o male. I was picked on my whole life, Iâ€™ve never felt like I fitted in anywhere. The worst of which involved being raped by a â€œfriendâ€ when I was a kid. 

After many years of suppressing I opened up about that to one of my friends. At first they were super supportive but after a month or whatever they started to be the total opposite of understanding. It was really shit. 

Couple of years ago we stopped being in contact and Iâ€™ve been so fucking lonely since then. Any time I talk with anyone I feel super tense and self conscious of everything I ever say. Pretty much impossible to like me when Iâ€™m like that.

I have wanted not to live when itâ€™s been like this for a really long time already, but my hope that one day it would ever get better is pretty low right now.
