It's been a bad yearAbout a year ago, I cheated on the girl who changed my life in innumerable positive ways. She was a lively soul, smart, beautiful, and forever giving. She was always there.

I took advantage of her trust and I betrayed her. I'm certain I took some of her optimism with me, too, which implicates me in much more than just infidelity. I probably changed her negatively as much as she changed me for the better.

It's been about a year, and while I can't claim that our breakup is the only reason why I can't seem to make any forward progress, I can't deny its magnitude.

The past year at school was endlessly challenging to my intellect, my nerve, and my emotions. I think I turned to working as an escape, but that pulled and stretched at my patience until I was burned out.

This past vacation was a sham. I barely lifted a finger, when I should have been preparing for phone interviews. I was rejected at the company at which I wanted to do an internship the most. I sputtered and stopped. I let myself go. I started listening to the voice of negativity that is constantly narrating my failures.

I'm back at school, which no longer seems to be the haven it used to be. I'm too old to be here, I should have graduated, and I'm not making adequate progress on my master's degree. I have to ask my dad for more money to borrow, which may not even happen. I've lost all detectable desire to go to class.

My therapist helps, but only for twenty-four hours or so. I try to meditate, but only images of past failure, regrets and dreads, or images of her come out, and I can't maintain the focus to make my mind silent.

I have a crush on someone, but I have every reason to think it won't work. That's all I feel any more. Hope for hopeless outcomes or punishment for stupid mistakes.

I'm not the person I act in front of everyone. I don't really think anyone knows how messed up I am. Maybe her, but she's long gone.
