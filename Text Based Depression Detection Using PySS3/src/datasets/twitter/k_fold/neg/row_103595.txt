I don't see the pointI can barely make it a day without having suicidal thoughts. Ive lost the best support I ever had and this year is so garbage already. It feels less and less convincing to say it's not worth it when I see everything around me falling apart. All I want to do is drink and I don't know if I'll even have enough money to pay rent this month and I don't know why I even care if I'm alive anymore. Sorry Im probably just being dramatic or something I just have talked to all my friends about how I feel and my girlfriend has left me I don't really know where to turn with this because it feels like nothing actually helps I just get platitudes and feel good thoughts but nothing that actually convinces me any of this is worth it compared to so many things I see that tell me it isn't. I don't want people to think I'm whoring for attention but I guess it doesn't matter at this point sorry whoever reads this
