just want to talk. I dunno. I can barely write, I just want someone to talk to. every friendship I've built in the last 2 months has fallen apart because they don't want to hear about my depressing state.

the reality is I feel this way, I can't unfeel this way, I can't pretend to be a happy normal person, nobody accepts anything else, therefore if I can't find somebody who accepts that, I can do nothing except kill myself. I'm stuck. it's not like I haven't tried.
