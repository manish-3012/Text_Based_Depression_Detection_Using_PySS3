Iâ€™m laying in my bathtub with nothing on my mind really.Crying, Iâ€™m fully
Clothed. Iâ€™m contemplating whether or not to just slit my wrists. If it kills me or not, Iâ€™d be happy either way. I tried to off myself in the morning walking to school since it was foggy I can just walk across the street not paying attention to any lights, caused a car crash. 
Iâ€™ve been so sad and had so many feelings of just hopelessness since I was like 9. My family isnâ€™t great. Itâ€™s awful. I feel like fucking shit. I havenâ€™t had any happiness in like 5 years. Thatâ€™s not a lot I know but itâ€™s a lot to me. I need help. Desperate help. but my family doesnâ€™t care. Am I allowed to just,  you know, die.
