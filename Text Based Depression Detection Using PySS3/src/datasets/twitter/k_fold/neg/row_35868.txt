Why are you at this point of your life?My loneliness is like a sneeze that never comes out, a man going hungry but never being able to starve. Itâ€™s sad you get disconnected and outside looking in... I canâ€™t comprehend the emotions I feel when going through it. I believe I suffer from chronic loneliness.. I canâ€™t form connections.. at all.. I look at my family members and see how easily they connect with others. Why am I so left out? Iâ€™m so jealous.. Iâ€™m nobody, I feel like absolutely nothing.. canâ€™t even manage friendships. Itâ€™s pissing me off that I canâ€™t describe this better. I just sit there and take the pain. 

I act weird when Iâ€™m sad so people wonâ€™t notice Iâ€™m sad. I have no money saved... my sister and â€œfriendsâ€ keep taking my money bro. Iâ€™m so disappointed in myself, youâ€™ve gotten no where in the past 5 months??? ABSOLUTELY NO FUCKING WHERE? 

Manz shouldâ€™ve just k@&amp;$@ himself in 2017, couldâ€™ve saved you so much trouble, a pathetic low life, where only people use your talents and skills but donâ€™t really care for who the fuck you are. My biggest regret is living.. such a waste. Shouldâ€™ve just popped one in the head but how stupid you are, you wouldâ€™ve just done it the wrong way and lived. Canâ€™t wait until you actually get to your breaking point. Until you realize there is no hope, what are you holding on for? The signs are clear.
