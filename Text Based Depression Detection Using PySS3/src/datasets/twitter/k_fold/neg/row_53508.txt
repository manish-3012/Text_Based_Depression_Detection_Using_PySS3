Would a detailed suicide note help?I was just curious to know if a detailed suicide note is optimal? As in where the person who commits suicide thinks out all possible questions any person might have and answers them in an organized manner, such as typing up answers that are organized into sections, with detailed paragraphs where necessary that are properly explaining the reasons for suicide.
