Why do people act like life is such a breeze?When you tell a normal person your troubles, they act like all you have to do is x, y, and z, and all your problems will be over. Seriously, what the heck? Like my living situation. I can't move because there's nowhere affordable. Staying at home is expensive because my mom chooses to live above her means (and mine). I'd hate to abandon her and she gets put out. Not that I could because that would make me homeless. People seem to think that I can just cruise over to whatever apartment/house I want and just move in that day. As if they don't check credit, or if I can just afford anything. At the moment I'm receiving benefits which I can't talk about online since people think that makes me a leech. I wish I could just end it all, but I'm too much of a coward. And asking online only gets your post locked, or you banned. Can't get a doctor to euthanize me since I'm "healthy". It's like I'm trapped unless I intentional inflict a worse case scenario on myself, which may just lead to more depression. Therapy is a joke and I have nowhere else to look for help.
