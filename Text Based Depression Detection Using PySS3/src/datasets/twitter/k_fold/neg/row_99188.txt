Today I feel... good?Hey yaâ€™ll. I post here kind of a lot because I often have panic attacks that make me want to kill myself. 

Well, in September I started therapy. In October I started taking lexapro. Iâ€™m still having fairly debilitating panic attacks in the mornings, so I knew I needed to change up my morning routine. The fact is I just CANT live my life feeling the way I often do. So either I need to die, or I need to change even more. Iâ€™m making a point to do morning guided meditation on YouTube. I sort of think meditation is bullshit, but Iâ€™m desperate I guess. Today was the first day, instead of snoozing for 10 more minutes (which inevitably makes me start to panic because I think I should be getting up and being productive) I got up, sat on the couch, turned on YouTube, and listened to some ladyâ€™s soothing voice for 10 minutes before getting ready for the day. 

HOLY SHIT YALL. I was calm all morning. Even through a very stressful work meeting. Kept my cool, and didnâ€™t fall apart inside. 

Sharing this in the hopes it will help some other shattered souls out there. Best of luck to you guys!
