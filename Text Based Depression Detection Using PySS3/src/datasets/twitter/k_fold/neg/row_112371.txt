I try so hard but just doesnt work.Hey guys, not sure I can post this here and sorry if it's a weird layout I am on mobile

Ever since my grandmother passed two years ago ive struggled more and more with suicide. In an attempt to get better and away from everything that was causing me to feel that way I moved in with my fiance a few states away. ( from n.y to Ohio )

It helped for a little. We had our ups and downs but I hung in there. I changed, I bottled up my emotions and suicidal thoughts since he said its all attention seeking and I believed it maybe it was. I tried my best to be at least an okay wife and mother to our child now but even now its not enough. He's tur ed to sleeping with his coworkers and snapping at me for not liking it since " he can sleep with them but not be in love with them he loves me".  Ive tried but hes done things to me, hit me just cause I was "in the way". I dont know what I'm doing wrong im just not enough.  I cook, i clean, i handle our bills, I take care of him in every way.

Im not enough for him, i wasnt enough for my own family after my grandmother passed, and its all piling on me again and i just want to kill myself. Im never enough for anyone and when I needed a shoulder cry on right now, went through all my contacts and friends list and realized I had no one I could call.  Just made me realize how unimportant I am despite me pouring all my heart and care into my relationship into my friendships. Usually people are like "if you do this you'll be missed" I cant even find comfort in that cause no one will miss me. My husband would probably be over joyed I'm gone since I'm such a nuisance. My daughter too young and wont even know whats going on or remember in a few years. 

I'm so sorry to everyone I bothered with my presence. I just don't know whats left to do. I meed my grandmother so bad. Always told her when she passes im kill myself but no I stayed alive for my husband for what. For him to want me dead. Im sorry I don't know where I went wrong. Im sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just so sorry
