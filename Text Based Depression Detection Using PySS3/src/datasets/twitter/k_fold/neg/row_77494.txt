my deformity makes me wanna dieI have tubular breasts. a pretty severe case too, they're two severly asymmetrical triangles (pointing to my toes) with big puffy nipples. they look absolutely repulsive and any guy who saw them would instantly puke. and since boobs are considered so important to female beauty I don't even feel like a real woman because of them. I feel like a monster. I feel like I'm being robbed off sex and relationships because of them. I would get the surgery if I could but I can't afford it so I should honestly just off myself instead
