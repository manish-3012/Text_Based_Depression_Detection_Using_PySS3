What is the point of living?I feel like I'm just trapped inside a physically healthy body that should belong to someone else that actually wants to live. I feel like all the good days I could ever hope to have are over and that only mental illness and other shit is in my future. I have moments of happiness, but they are only temporary. 

I would kill myself but all the methods I know of are too risky. I would spend my last 6k to hire a hitman to kill me if at all possible.
