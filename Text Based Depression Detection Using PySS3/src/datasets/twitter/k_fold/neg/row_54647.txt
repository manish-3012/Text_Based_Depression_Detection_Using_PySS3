I have tried everything and I still can't find the will to go onI have been diagnosed with a biological depression for the past 5 years. I have tried multiple forms of medication and none of them seem to stick. I will feel better for a month and then will head back. I have tried therapy and it has never helped. I have tried exercise, adventure..even moving across the world; have tampered with alcohol, even tried goal setting and staying in school to get engineering degree. I have taken up many new hobbies, volunteering for NGO's and community functions, made daily lists of things to be happy about, peer discussions, as well with family and friends. NOTHING seems to help. 
I feel as if I am drowning and nothing can pull me out of this. As quoted by my favorite book: "I still have to deal with the hours before and the hours after". 
Any advice or help?
