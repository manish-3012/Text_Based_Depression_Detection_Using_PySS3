Disturbed saved my life.I donâ€™t know if this is the right place but I needed to get this out. 


45 minutes ago I was in my car with the engine on, window cracked in my garage. I was writing a goodbye letter to my daughter. 
I googled how long it took and the first thing that popped up was the Suicide prevention line. I didnâ€™t call it, just scrolled on by to get an estimate. 
I sat there and wrote and listened to music and then I got an even worse headache, dizzy, sleepy, calmish. I kept asking myself is this what I want. Do I really want to do this. Whenever I would panic and think of opening the garage or turning my car off. I would chastise myself and just tell myself it would be over soon. 
I started thinking of my daughter(who is at her grandmas) and my pups(theyâ€™re 6 and 3 and my babies). And then I started worrying that they might get poisoning as well cause they were in the house attached to the garage and my husband wouldnâ€™t be home until 5 hours later. I didnâ€™t want to hurt them. 
I was looking at pictures of my daughter, reflecting, and then started listening to the music(which at this point was background) and it was Disturbed, Reason to Fight. I took it as a sign to live and turned off the car and got out. 
Then crumpled to the ground sobbing and getting puppy kisses. I canâ€™t believe that I came that close and was that committed. 
I feel like such a failure at life. As a wife, mother, and overall person.
