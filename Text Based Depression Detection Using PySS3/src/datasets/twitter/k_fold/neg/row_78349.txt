I think Iâ€™m readyThe last time I posted here I was stopped when I got sent to a psych ward. I thought that maybe going to the hospital and listening to them might make things at least a little better. Since then everything has gotten worse than I thought it could. I canâ€™t even afford the payment plan the hospital offered me, Iâ€™m indefinitely unemployed, I can barely pay my other bills, and my relationship has fallen apart. I feel worse about myself than ever and Iâ€™m beginning to realize that my emotions are negatively affecting the people I love. At this point, I think it would be better for everyone if I ended things. Iâ€™m fully aware that it will hurt for some people, but eventually they will move on. Anyone who says that isnâ€™t true is lying. If I end things now at least Iâ€™ll be able to die while someone still cares. I havenâ€™t been eating so that for once in my life I can know what it feels like to be pretty and thin before I go. I hope I donâ€™t fuck that up the way I fuck everything else up.
