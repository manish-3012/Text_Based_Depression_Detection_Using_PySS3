Suicide Prevention Chat Disconnected less than a minute after it was finally my turnI kept the link in case I needed it. In case I didn't have any other means of hope left. I needed it. I have been waiting on my turn in the queue for over an hour. Watching the screen the entire time as it went from 11 to finally my turn. [This is the one I used](http://www.lifeline-chat.org/SightMaxAgentInterfaceLifeline2013/waitingforoperator.aspx?accountID=17&amp;siteID=21&amp;queueID=53&amp;browserID=a84eff47-7b92-4590-a705-aaa8195ea06e&amp;sessionID=85a01c05-b996-4b4a-8498-c0aa7e8d973d&amp;chatRequestID=225421&amp;chatName=Michelle). A part of http://suicidepreventionlifeline.org/. I wanted to talk to someone about how I'd been abused this past weekend, how my life is going bad, and I'm afraid of being abused again, maybe they might help me find a way out of it.

But Kris disconnected. I waited an hour, he didn't even give me a minute. I'm a fast typer, I was just trying to find the right words to say as I've never done this before.

I don't want to wait another hour only to find I'm not worth someone else's time... again. Is there a better chat site? Because fuck if the suicide chat doesn't even have a minute for me... what the hell do I do.+

I'm not feeling emotions right now. Dissociation maybe? I just can't stop the intrusive thoughts to kill myself.
