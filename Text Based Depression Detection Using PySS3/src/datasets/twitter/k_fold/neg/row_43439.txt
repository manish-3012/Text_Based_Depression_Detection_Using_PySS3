I'm going to overdose on Prozac tonight.I'm 13. I've been to the psych hospital before, it didn't fucking help. I've had a therapist, it didn't fucking help. I hate myself, I hate my life, and I hate every single fucking thing about me. My only chance of finally having someone who understood and gave two shits about me was my GF that I met in the hospital, but now she's not allowed to talk to me. And probably never will. I'm sick of anyone that ever gets close to me ends up leaving. I can't keep any friends, I can't function in day to day life like a normal fucking person. I want nothing more to be dead, and that's that. The only reason I'm posting this is to get my final thoughts out. This is the last of me. Goodbye. 

Update: Survived. Still here, unfortunately. I chose not to get hospitalized again. Don't OD on Prozac, it's fucking terrible.
