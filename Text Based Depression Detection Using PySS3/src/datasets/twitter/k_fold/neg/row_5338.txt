My roommate/ex-GF is trying to commit suicideWe were living together when we broke up last year. I left but came back to support her. The break-up happened during a bad time for her financially. She was unemployed and is just starting to find a new job. She does have a new partner by then already but she is not yet comfortable living with him (one of the reasons why we decided to part ways is that guy btw). When I came back at around September last year, I â€˜kinda wanted to win her back but that died down and realized I just really wanted to help.

Fast forward to now, covid-19 happened and she is in a bad place again with her job  due to the quarantine and decided to break up with her partner. Childhood trauma of being trapped and being denied from her â€œdistractionsâ€ is taking a huge toll on her mental health. Then her old feelings for me resurfaced. She then said she still loves me and wants me back. I said to her in pure honesty that I cannot and she is just probably feeling confused due to her being trapped with me. Sheâ€™s forcing it upon me but I really cannot do it anymore. These are her main reasons on why she wants everything to end.

Now I feel trapped and I do not know what to do. I cannot make myself to pretend that there is still a chance between us just to make things better. Am losing sleep and needed to skip work a couple of times just to be on guard with her. She tried to run towards the balcony and was able to stop her twice already which really rattled me and making me paranoid. She is preventing me from messaging her relatives and I feel obliged to comply because it might make things worst if I do.

I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I am getting tired everytime she goes through a bad episode.
