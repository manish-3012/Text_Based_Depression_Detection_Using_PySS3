realization of my family is going to kill meim an incredibly late born in my family, one of those "haha your dad is old enough to be a grandpa" except its real, he was a grandpa

and at first ive never paid any mind to it though last yr during fall my dad passed away from old age and sickness, i havent been dealing well with it,  and now this year all i can think abt is how my closest family has at the lowest a 16 yr gap with me, and that i will have to watch them drop like flies one by one by one, the thought of it makes me so sick to my stomach, like my parents are most likely going to be dead before i turn 18, and its been grinding away at my already pretty messed up mental heath that i just want to fucking die
