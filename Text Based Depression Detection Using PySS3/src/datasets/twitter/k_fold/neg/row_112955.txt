Surviving a suicide attemptHello, it's been a while since my suicide attempt but creating a group for this has been on my mind for a while. After my attempt back in March, I had ended up in a rehabilitation center for a few days on an involuntary hold and after I left I was referred to a therapist who didn't help much. I decided that seeing him would be a waste of time and that I would find resources elsewhere, except after searching for a while, I realized that there were none. If you go online, there are a lot of groups for people who have lost someone to suicide, and people who are planning on committing suicide, but there was nothing for the people who attempted and failed. I never thought I would wake up and have to go back to living a normal life, as if nothing happened, but that's what's happening. I go through each day and it's like it never even happened. I don't know if it's me being in denial or my family just trying to push away from it but I haven't even spoken to my mom about it since I left the hospital and it makes me feel really alone sometimes. So I thought that maybe if there were people out there who are experiencing what I'm experiencing and don't really know how to cope or who to talk to about it that we could talk to each other and maybe help each other through it.
