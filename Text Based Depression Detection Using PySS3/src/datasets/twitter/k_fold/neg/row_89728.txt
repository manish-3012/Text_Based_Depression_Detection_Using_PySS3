I shouldnâ€™t be here in the first place.I have no intentions of hurting myself tonight. But Iâ€™ve been here so many times and I feel the end is near.

Iâ€™ve been diagnosed with multiple mental illnesses that result in me being low-functioning. My inability to keep a job or have any interpersonal relationships keeps me locked in my room most days. I know Iâ€™m a financial burden because my family is still taking care of me. I should be better than this. My family has a history of mental illness and addiction. Yet they still look at me as if Iâ€™m such a failure. They donâ€™t want to say it but I see the pity in their eyes. I should be better than this but Iâ€™m not. I just want to die so no one has to worry any more.
