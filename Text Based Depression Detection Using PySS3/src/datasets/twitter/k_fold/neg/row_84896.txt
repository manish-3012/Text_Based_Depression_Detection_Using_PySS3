This is different.I'm not the typical impulsively suicidal person who's been under too much too soon. Their pain eventually passes. Mine doesn't. I get worse and worse. At this point it isn't suicide but voluntary self euthanasia. I just want the pain to stop. I just want to be done with everything. Would you keep a vegetable or a dying elderly alive when all it does is causes pain? No. If someone made a sane, lucid, well informed decision to end their suffering would you stop them? Ive decided to stop eating and drinking. Hopefully ill die within two weeks. But i put this question to you. Am i wrong?
