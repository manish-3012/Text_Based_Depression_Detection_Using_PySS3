On the surface, my like looks good,but it's notI have an awesome job, plenty of money, a nice house and car. I have a good family an have fun hobbies. I put on a happy face in front of everyone and honestly, looking at my life I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. At 30, I can honestly say I have no friends despite talking with coworkers all day long, and I have terrible depression and I'm lonely.

I've suffered with depression for the last 15 years of my life and as I look forward,I wonder if it will ever get better? What do i have to look forward too? Coming home to an empty house every day and being a 3rd wheel even when I'm with family.

It seems like suicide is on my mind everyday and the most comforting part of my life is knowing my pistol is on my nightstand for whenever I've had enough.

It feels like things have been getting worse and worse and I'm really having a hard time finding a reason not to pull the trigger right now. It would hurt my family, but is that really worse than spending the next20+ years miserable. I had set some goals to try to improve my life in2016 and fend off these thoughts, but I just don't want to continue

What makes it even harder, as a Christian, I think I'll still likely go to heaven, so why not end the suffering and go to heaven. A 9mm hollow point should be quick.
