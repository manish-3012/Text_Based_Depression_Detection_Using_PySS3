I'm an attempt survivor. A student at the school I work at just took his life. Now I'm really struggling with suicidal thoughts again.I work at a high school and last week a student took his life. I knew him, but not well. It was incredibly sad. I feel so much heartache for his family, classmates, teachers and friends. I'm sad he didn't see any way out of whatever he was going through. He was only 6 years younger than me.

When I found out he died, it was tough. But when I found out it was suicide, I totally lost it. Mainly because of my past experiences. I've struggled with depression since I was in middle school. It was extremely bad last year when I was 23 and I attempted suicide. I sought treatment which helped to an extent. But what really helped was starting a new job at the school I work. This job and the students I work with bring me so much joy. It felt so good, but I can honestly say it also felt weird because I hadn't experienced joy since I was a kid. Nobody there would ever know I've struggled with deep depression because I'm always happy and laughing while I'm at work.

So I was doing a lot better. But a few weeks ago my depression hit again. It wasn't intense this time. In fact it was pretty mild. I just kind of associated it with this time of year. January is usually kind of a depressing month for me. But last week I just shut down when I heard this news. Suicide is such a difficult subject for me. Anytime anyone mentions someone else committing suicide, I automatically shut down and it takes me back to where I was about a year ago. I know this is a bad quality to have but suicide is just such a painful topic for me. I don't let anyone know this because I would never want to inadvertently discourage someone from coming to me if they were struggling. I would WANT them to come to me and be open and honest.

I couldnâ€™t stop crying for a couple days and during my lunch break the next day I talked to a chaplain that was there. I told him my story and I told him I felt guilty because I know this situation isnâ€™t about me, itâ€™s about the student who passed away. He told me it was normal to feel the way Iâ€™m feeling. He asked me if Iâ€™m thinking about suicide now, I told him no. But the truth is, I am. Not seriously. I donâ€™t have a plan and donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever act on it again. He gave me his phone number and told me to call him if Iâ€™m ever feeling suicidal. But I didnâ€™t want to tell him how much Iâ€™m struggling because Iâ€™m worried he could go to the school and tell them and Iâ€™ll lose my job. My job is truly one of the only things that brings me happiness and I couldnâ€™t handle that. It would make everything so much worse. But I haven't wanted to go lately because it's just been too hard and I can't stop crying, although I have gone every day.

tl;dr // Student at the high school I work committed suicide. Not only am I extremely sad about the student, but Iâ€™m also an attempt survivor and Iâ€™m having a very difficult time. Itâ€™s triggered a lot of flashbacks and thoughts. Committing suicide is fresh in my mind again. I don't think I would do it, but I've been thinking about it. Not sure why this event has stirred up this in me.
