How do get out of bed when suicidally depressedDoes anyone have any tips or strategies for waking up / simply getting out of bed when severely depressed? I've been suicidally depressed for the past 2 years. The way depression really manifests itself in me is that I tend to regularly oversleep (anywhere from 8-14 hours a night) because I find sleeping and dreaming to be effective escapes from depression and suicidal ideation. I consider it a major victory if I can get up at noon-2pm, but most of the time end up sleeping until 4-5pm each day.

I feel like I've tried everything--I've set alarm clocks all around my apartment so I have to physically get out of bed in the morning, but I simply get up, turn them all off, then go back to bed as if the world depends on me going back to sleep. Even if I have something I'm looking forward to do in the day (which is rare), I have a hard time getting out of bed, or sometimes simply stay in bed and miss/cancel what I had planned for myself.

Really feel like I'm helplessly locked in a pattern of oversleep that I can't break out of. How do you get out of bed when you feel you have no future?
