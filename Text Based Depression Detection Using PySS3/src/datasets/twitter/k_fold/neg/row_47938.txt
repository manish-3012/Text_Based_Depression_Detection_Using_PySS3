I've lost everythingI fee like I have lost everything. I live alone my family don't speak to me my boyfriend left my because I am to miserable all the time I lost my little girl to the big man in the sky. 

I am all alone. 

I wish there was some way I could make very thing ok and just be myself again. Since I lost Carla my life has fallen apart. I flunked out of school didn't go to college and quit uni because I just didn't want to do it anymore. 

My life is over. I can't feel anymore. I hate my job and haven't made something of my self and I just feel useless and alone.
