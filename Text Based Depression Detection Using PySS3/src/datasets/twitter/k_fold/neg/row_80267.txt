Hi, I want to kill myself. I am not sure what to say or do about this.I find it hard to sleep. Leaving the house stresses me out beyond anything. I cannot find work. I do not care about my health. I do not care about my friends and family (and communication with them is becoming rare). I do not care about what I am doing with my life anymore.
