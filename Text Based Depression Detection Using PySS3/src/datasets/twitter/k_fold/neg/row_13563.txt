I am fucking done.I am so close to just ending my fucking life right now. Everything is going downhill. My mom died. I can't afford college or get a co-signer for my loan. I have plenty of friends but I don't care. I feel like a fucking failure every day of my entire life and I just want it all to stop. I am so tired of being disappointed. I don't know what to do. I can't sleep, I'm ugly, and I have nothing and no one to live for.
