Rock bottomI know what rock bottom is now.
And I've made up my mind.  I'm going to seek help so no one can say I didn't "try".  
I don't think suicide is the cowards way out, in fact it's painful and scarring on loved ones but I respect it.
Isn't it selfish to force someone to continue living, when every single day there's nothing but mental agony.
I love in a society which doesn't accept me, which humiliates me.  I've been compared to a dog.  I've failed at everything I've ever done, and I have only ever had one real friend.  I know that if I continue I will lead a life of torture, and I will never amount to anything.  
I'm living in poverty.  I have no job, no friends, no prospects, I'm single, and every moment is a nightmare which I can't seem to wake up from.
Wouldn't it be better to not exist at all?
I ask this rhetorically of course. I've made a decision.  Now I need a plan.
