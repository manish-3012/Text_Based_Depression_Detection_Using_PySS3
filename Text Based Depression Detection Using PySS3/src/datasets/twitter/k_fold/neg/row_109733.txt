I am a Fucking LoserI dont know why Im even on here. I just want to write out how I am feeling right now. Im crumbling to the pressure to be successful. Coming from a family that expects me to be something significant, I feel like I will let them all down. I applied to colleges with a major I dont even think that I want to do. I just did it because my parents expected it of me. I also feel so lonely. Never had a girlfriend, never had anyone interested since 6th grade, and I only have a few friends who Im not even close to really anymore. I have no one close to even talk to. I dont think Im worthy to talk to anyone because I dont want to ruin their day by doing something stupid. I dont have any drive to do anything... I spend most of my day after school just watching youtube or netflix and doing nothing productive. I am not going to be successful in life. I dont know what I want to do. I have little friends. Yep, fun times....thanks for reading my rant
