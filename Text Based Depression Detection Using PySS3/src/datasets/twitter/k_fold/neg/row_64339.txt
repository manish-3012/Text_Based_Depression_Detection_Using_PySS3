IdkIâ€™m 32 years old, 4 kids, married for 8 years and Iâ€™d prefer to be dead. The last 2 years of my life have been a fucking train wreck. From losing jobs, jail, rehab, domestic abuse. Iâ€™m done. About 2 years ago I was accused of taking narcotics from my job. (Iâ€™m a nurse) I completely deny the accusation. Iâ€™ve spent 20k on lawyers for this. I ended up just fucking spiraling. I have an addiction issue with everything but I didnâ€™t steal any pills. Drank everyday. Iâ€™ve been doing DXM to check out. Iâ€™m 3 months sober of alcohol tho. Iâ€™ve been in jail twice. First time bc I was drunk and punched my husband. Second time a DWI bc I refused to test. My husband beat the shit out of me in March and I tried to leave. Iâ€™m talking I had bruises all over, rub burn on my back from him dragging me down the stairs. But I didnâ€™t call police. Bc I didnâ€™t want him to lose his job. So no repricussions. When I was 5 my brother started molesting me. He made this little area under the stairs at our house where we were hidden. He would talk me into taking my clothes off, and sucking his dick. It went on for years. I tried to tell my parents but they told me â€œwe donâ€™t talk like that.â€ 

I share all that bc those are the main things breaking me. I cannot seem to go forward. I have nightmares. Every night. Everyday. Flashbacks. I just feel like I canâ€™t fix this anymore. I feel like I just want to end it but then I think of my kids... I want to see them grow. I hate living but I canâ€™t fathom not seeing them grow. How the fuck do I get out of this fucking hole. I did rehab. Not helpful. I self medicate to try and stop the thoughts. Iâ€™m on antidepressants. I just hate my life.
