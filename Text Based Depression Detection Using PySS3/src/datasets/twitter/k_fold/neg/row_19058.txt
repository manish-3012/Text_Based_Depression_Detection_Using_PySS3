Can't live... Too scared to die!What to do! I'm a dad with the most insane cocktail of anger, depression and anxiety all rolled into a body that feels completely out of control. I'm married and have a 20 month old baby who is incredible yet the challenges that come with it are just completely unbearable now - especially with this quarantine. I think of ending it so often, completely sick and tired of the constant thoughts of hopelessness and pathetic anxieties around work, people and general culture. Tonight I walked away from social media which I realised is just a key hole into a world of happy, yet (in my eyes) clichÃ©, uncaring people that don't give two damns about me. My wife loves me, as does my daughter, but I've now got a point where the bad luck in my life is so heavy that not being here (and inevitably finally removing the burden of my problems from everyone) outweighs anything I could possibly bring! My anger is so heavy that the smallest of things send me into a rage and I can't face this anymore! The only thing more annoying than living in this horrendous, god forsaken world is my pathetic fear of death itself! And I know how pathetic I am to even think these things having a daughter who would lose a father (and instantly put me in the failed, judged coward category) but the way I am, I wouldn't be offering any decent fathering skills at this stage and she would be far better suited without me and being loved and raised by everyone else! I'm just turning into a complete pile of hell and have no idea what to do!!
