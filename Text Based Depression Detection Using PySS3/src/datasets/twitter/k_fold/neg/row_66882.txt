Not suicidal yet, but I'm having thoughts.Hello,

I don't even know why I'm writing this. It's not like anyone cares.

Anyway, since Monday I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, usually when I've got nothing to do. 

Like on the bus to/from college or waiting for something. I just have vivid thoughts and images of me jumping off a bridge or being hit by a car and dying. These thoughts have been happening quite a lot this week. 

I am incredibly depressed but not suicidal, so I have no idea why I'm having these thoughts.


I'm posting here incase it gets worse overtime.
