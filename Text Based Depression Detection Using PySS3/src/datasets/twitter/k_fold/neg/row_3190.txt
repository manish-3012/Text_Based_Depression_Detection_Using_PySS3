Is it selfish for me to give up?I want to kill myself. I really think there is no reason to live for myself anymore. But my best friend says he needs me alive. I donâ€™t think he does, but he thinks so. I think it would be best for me to not be in pain anymore, and I feel selfish that his pain isnâ€™t enough to deter me from doing it.
