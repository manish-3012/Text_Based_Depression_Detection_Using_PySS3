Forget meI don't know what I'm looking for posting this. I've heard that everything will get better and to not have such a negative view on life. And part of it for me I guess is that I understand what I do and that I have a problem and that life isn't so bad... But I still just drown in this feeling of hate and death and depression. I tried to kill myself twice my Junior year of highschool and I was out of school for two and a half months. I dropped out of highschool after that because all of my grades were then failing. My mom always has to mention to everyone she meets that I'm a disappointment for not completing highschool. My mom loves me but doesn't like me. I live alone. If I could live with her to save money up I would, but she tells me all the time that I'm terrible to live with. Because I get depressed and I'm irritable. I get irritated because my mom still does so much for my dad. My dad abused me growing up mentally and physically. Everyday I'd do to school and get beat, stabbed, choked and then come home to be told by my dad that he'd kill me and that my siblings are so much better than me and that I'm a piece of shit. So I'd go to my room and watch movies and cut myself. I absolutely hate myself. I'm comfortably numb. And I want to change for the couple friends I have... But suicide runs through my head constantly. I just want to be done. But that's stupid. My dad always told me that people that kills themselves are stupid and worthless. When I was hospitalized, he pretended to finally care. All I wanted was to be loved. And I've lost every relationship I've had because no one wants to put up with or help with my issues. Because all I ever see in myself is my dad. And it drives me mad. And I get drunk every night. And I want to be done. And I just can't. And I don't know what I want to hear from you all on this post, but I just needed to say something to the majority. It's more anonymous that way.
