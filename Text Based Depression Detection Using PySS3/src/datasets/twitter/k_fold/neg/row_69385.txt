I am a lonerIve tried to talk to people, to be social, to make more friends, to talk to girls. None of it ever works, I will always have too much anxiety. I am pathetic I never get invited to anything social. I sit alone in lunch at school. No girls are into me and why would they? Im just a pathetic antisocial reject. I feel empty. No one cares about me the quiet kid. Im not going to blame society or my peers or even my parents. It's all me, my fault im too much of a loser to make friends or anything. I hate myself and am thinking about just ending everything. It would be much easier than dealing all of it. It will be easy.
