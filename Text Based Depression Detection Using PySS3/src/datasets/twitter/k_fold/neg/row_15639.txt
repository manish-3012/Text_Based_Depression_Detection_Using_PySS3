My mom's birthday almost became the date of my best friend's suicideI'll preface this by saying she's safe right now. But last night she was on the verge of suicide for the 2nd time in the past few months. She was under the influence, extremely emotional, her parents were angry with her, and she had just broken up with her boyfriend at a party I was with her at. She texted me that they broke up, and I knew I had to find her because she would hurt herself if she was alone, but I didn't know where she was. She was sending me her phone password, and saying I could have her money, and she told me to tell him she loved him all while I was texting and calling her and begging her to not do anything because I was on the way to her house. 

I called my mom, sobbing into the phone while I heard her birthday party in the background, and told her what was happening and she agreed to meet me at her house. I told her dad that she was saying she was going to commit suicide, and he said he would talk to her, but from past experience I knew he didn't know how to help her or keep her safe. I came inside to talk to her, both of us crying, and in some bizarre turn we started making each other laugh and I knew she was ok for at least the night.

The thing is, both my parents and her parents didn't take me very seriously and I could tell they thought I was overreacting the way only a teenage girl can. I do get very paranoid and have problems with emotional stability, but I really believe she almost died last night. She ended up apologizing with her boyfriend and they got back together. But I know she's suicidal, with (professionally diagnosed) untreated depression and anxiety, and 100% capable of killing herself if they break up for good. I'm going to talk to my therapist, and try to convince her to get help again, but I'm not sure what else I can do.
