I donâ€™t want to wake up anymore. Itâ€™s all too much, all I do is take care of people and there is no one for me to lean on.Thereâ€™s something really wrong with me and I donâ€™t know what it is or how to fix it.  I feel so broken inside, the only one to fix it is to shatter it and throw it all away. 

Iâ€™ve tried therapy for years, I spent time in the psych wards and Iâ€™m on enough meds to make your head spin.  Itâ€™s all for nothing Iâ€™m too Fâ€™d up, Iâ€™ve always been Fâ€™d up I wish I saved everyone the disappointment that is me.  Stupid fucking me.  Why didnâ€™t my mom just have an abortion?  F

I will never be whole, Iâ€™m always sick.  Even my own brother cut me out of his life, wtf?

I want to get in my car and drive far away , I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore, I just want the pain to stop once and for all.
