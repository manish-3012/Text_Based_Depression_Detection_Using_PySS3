Soon time to goI am close to the end now. Ive survived 6-9 severe attempts on my life, with everything from opiate/benzo mixes, medicines with high toxicity and thousands of iu of insulin. Since none of them worked i have now gotten ahold of a chemical that has no known antidote that will guaranteed kill me. I just dont want to live anymore. I have a good life, with a wife, two dogs and two pigs, a house, two cars and enough money to not want for anything. But i am still obsessed with killing myself. 

I was raised by an alcoholic abusive mother, i was raped by a strange man at age 9. I have abused steroids for 11yrs. I believe i am a pedophile(i have never acted out on these urges). I used to kill animals for the thrill of it. I have depression, anxiety, bpd and i hear voices. The devil commands me everyday to kill, i amg going to kill one of these days before i take my own life, it is his wish and his command, i also urge to do so. To feel the rush of the kill and to be remembered. I have to take my own life before i act on any of these urges. Thats why ive goten ahold of the chemical. I know death will be long, anything from several hours up to a couple of days, but atleast theres no question i will die. My letters are written, my will is updated, my financials are in order, so im all good to go. Just waiting till i get the courage to do this one last time.
