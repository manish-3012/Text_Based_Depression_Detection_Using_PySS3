HeyHey guys

I think I posted once here before but I deleted it, I think I'm going to do it.

I think it might happen sometime in the next two weeks and I will start the arrangements sometime this next week. Since it is not allowed to discuss methods here, would any of y'all be kind to redirect me to a place where I can read more about them like a forum or something?

And also, how would y'all write a goodbye letter just to let my parents know that it is not their fault at all? Because I think they would think its theirs and it is not at all. I hate myself and that's all it is, I can't live with my mistakes and me in general it has nothing to do with them.

Thanks!
