Scheduling my Suicide for 8/31The reality is I am going to break up and leave my boyfriend in the next few days. I have tried to do this 7 times and 7 times he's talked me into staying. I am not just disappearing on him, or being mean to him, by breaking up. It's been 10 years, I am NOT in love with him, and I refuse to go through life pretending that I love him. It's my RIGHT to leave. I have the RIGHT to break up. I have the RIGHT to date other people. We are not married. 

But if he talks me out of it, again? That's it. I'm done. I am going to the bridge and I am jumping - over 300 known people have jumped into the deception pass. It seems like every week a car is found in the lot after dark and no one is around to claim it. My car will be one of those cars on August 31st, 2018 if I do not leave. I commit, 100% - if I cannot live the life that I want and choose to live, then I will choose to live no life at all. 

Please do not comment telling me to give my boyfriend another chance. I do not want to. I want to be single. I want to be free. I want to live MY LIFE the way I want to. Please. Please don't tell me to stay with him - tell me I don't need to "save the date" - that I'll do the thing I need to do and I'll just leave him so I don't have to leave Earth.
