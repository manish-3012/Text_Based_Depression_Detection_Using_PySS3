I don't know what to do now, I shouldn't be alive.I was going to commit suicide, but told a friend about a week before I did it, she called the cops on me and I got Baker acted. I'm 15, have AP classes and all of my regular classes are Honors. I don't know what to do, I don't want to die, but I feel like I shouldn't be alive right now. I don't know how, but someone help me please.
