Something wrong with me
I keep trying to reach out to people with advice or anything kind, anybody, even online, and just getting negative reactions. People are arguing with/lecturing me constantly, or flat out ignoring me. I'm losing faith. It feels like I should just off myself but I don't want to risk failing that. I can have a short temper and can be a little to reactive. I'm definitely not perfect. I'm working on it but I don't understand why people's approach to me is so intense.
According to my psychiatrist and mom I'm "getting better" yet my life is spiraling downward really fast. I am tired and just trying to help and love, and it backfires. I really don't understand the point. I know that social media plays a role in triggering me but it also calms me down. It's really frustrating
I have ADHD, panic disorder and depression with bipolar tendencies. I have a feeling it's something else sometimes
