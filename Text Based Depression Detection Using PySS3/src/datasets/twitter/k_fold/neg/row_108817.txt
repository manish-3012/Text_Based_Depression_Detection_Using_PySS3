    Like God told you you're gonna die?
    What happened?

    like pretty sure God doesn't want you to kill yourself
    aren't you fucking with that girl? like u were just talking to her on twitter recently?
    ur prob experiencing psychological withdrawals if you stopped smoking weed too

rrrrrr 3:39 am
    not to be weird
    but like I legit don't want you to leave this Earth unless you're in like immense pain that won't go away, like physical pain
    So...like if you say some shit like that and then there's radio silence I'd legit worry about you

rrrrr    i dont wanna leave bruh
    it feels like i have to 

rrrr 3:40 am
    But why?
rrrrr3:41 am
    Like basically I'm trying to figure out how you killing yourself or dying or w.e. would be something God wants to happen
    or what happened in your life that made you change from like seemingly enjoying life to feeling bad about it

rrrrr 3:44 am
    Can you tell me a little more about it pl0x
    wrud?

rrrrr 3:44 am
    if i die everyone i know will change

rrrrr 3:45 am
    Yeah, but not necessarily for the better
    prob for the worse

rrrrr 3:46 am
    prob not gonna do it tongiht
    but eventually
    i think its gonna happen no matter

rrrrr3:46 am
    But you have control over it?

rrrrr 3:47 am
    the more i think abot it the more i want o dit
    if u wrent online right now
    id prob be gone

rrrrr 3:48 am
    You would have killed yourself?

rrrrr 3:48 am
    Isn't there a ton of stuff you want to do?
    like in life
    like fun shit

rrrr 3:48 am
    idc

rrrrr 3:50 am
    I can assure you, almost virtually that God doesn't want you to kill yourself
    and wants you to help better other's lives
