He beat me to it. Now I cant end mine.My husband committed suicide two years ago. Itâ€™s been hell since. For the 8 years that we were married I tried to save him until he finally succeeded. It was a hell marriage honestly. He cheated constantly and was emotionally abusive but he had severe ptsd and his mental was rapidly in the decline to the point he would talk about the fbi getting to him. We have two children so I gave up trying to save him to save my kids mental health. But in the process of all the madness I forgot about my own. Now Iâ€™m a widowed single mother with ptsd, severe depression and all I want to do is off myself. Iâ€™ve tried to keep myself going by going back to school. I have a new job. My own place. But I feel like I never let myself process any of it. Iâ€™m exhausted. And all I think about is how unfair it is that he got to go first. I think about all the different ways I could do it. Everyday. But I canâ€™t. I love my kids too much to put them through that again. But I also feel like they arenâ€™t getting the best part of me...itâ€™s gone. They love me. They tell me Iâ€™m the greatest mom ever which I donâ€™t know how but okay cool.But damn...when does the suffering end for me?I feel like a prisoner in my own mind.
