Iâ€™ve been pointing an unloaded gun to my head for therapy these past few weeks.So this is gonna come off as really bizarre but I donâ€™t care. Iâ€™ve been depressed for 7 years now and came close to suicide many times. I just never had the balls to go through with it. Mostly because of my family.

But either way, Iâ€™ve been taking up unorthodox methods of managing my suicidal thoughts. I keep a really nice chrome barrel .44 magnum revolver that Iâ€™ve been pressing against the underside of my jaw. Iâ€™d cock the hammer back, pull the trigger and click, cock it back again, click. I donâ€™t know why but somehow it makes me calmer. To be so close to death, knowing that all it would take is 10 seconds for me to load some rounds in it and boom. Life over. I have a very carefree attitude towards death. In that I donâ€™t feel fearful of it anymore.

I end up going through the day without much issues after that. I do it every morning and I feel as though Iâ€™ve killed myself already and have nothing to worry about anymore. Anyone else have bizarre methods of therapy?
