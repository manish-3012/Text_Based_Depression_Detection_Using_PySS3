I'm not allowed to be happyNo matter what I do, things are always at the state that they could be good if it weren't for one thing. It's almost as if I am not allowed to ever feel happy and I am punished for being alive. Sometimes I wonder if it's my punishment for not believing in god and maybe he isn't fictional and this is my limbo for denying his existence.
The only time I ever felt connected with anyone, they betrayed me.  And the more I think about it, the more I realize I fucked it up. I cannot change the past, but I'd want to do anything to go back and do things differently. I cannot live in the NOW because I cannot bear the idea that I am helpless. I shouldn't have been. 
All these years I didn't see the plan through because I was waiting for a guy to come and save me, or maybe to come and join me. I am not sure. But no one ever came and if they came, it was just to ruin me further.. Thanks to all of you.
My existence is torture and I'll make sure to clean the slate.
