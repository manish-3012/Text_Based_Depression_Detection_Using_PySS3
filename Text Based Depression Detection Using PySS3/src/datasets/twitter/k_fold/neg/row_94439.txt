I don't know if I'll make it to 21I'm a fourth year in college. I've been obsessing over the thought of suicide for almost 2 years at this point, and almost downed a bottle of rubbing alcohol to try and end it 3 days before New Years. I ended up convincing myself to keep going, but I keep imagining how I'm going to (quite violently) kill myself. My birthday is tomorrow, and I don't know if I can keep going. I've been ruining things for myself and pushing people away so that I won't have an excuse when the time comes, and that time could be today.

I don't know if I can bring myself to move forward. I just want relief. To leave
