Today is the day I finally die.I posted on the amiugly subreddit and got some really negative comments about my face, my biggest insecurity. I have BDD so my life is practically ruined because of this. I left my job, completely isolated myself, and was hospitalized two weeks ago for attempted suicide. In an hour, Iâ€™ll be picking up some pills and take the whole bottle (365 pills). Iâ€™m too ugly to be alive and Iâ€™m tired of hating life because of it. Iâ€™m a butterface and a loser. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll ever be.
