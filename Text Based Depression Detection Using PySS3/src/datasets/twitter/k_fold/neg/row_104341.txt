I turned 17 today and I feel like my life is over I miss being 15 so much. 15 was one of the best years of my life, even though I spent almost half of it in the hospital for depression. Being in the hospital was amazing. On my 16th birthday I could almost sense that my life was going to turn to shit very soon and I was right. It happened soon after. 

My anxiety got out of control. I stopped leaving my house because of fear and nausea. I began getting random sharp pains all over my body. I developed weird psychosis-like symptoms. Here I sit at 17 years old, having not left my home in 8 months. I have no friends, no goals, no motivation. I can't go back in hospital because i've aged out of the child inpatient services and that is/was the only place I feel comfortable. 

This is shit.
