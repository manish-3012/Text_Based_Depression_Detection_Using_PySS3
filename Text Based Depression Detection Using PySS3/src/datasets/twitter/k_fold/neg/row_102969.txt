Just can't shake the feeling that it's time to go.I have typed messages only to delete them 5 times now. Not doing it again! Just going to type whatever comes to mind, not proofread it, and click submit. Sorry for poor sentence structure.

I am that annoying guy that you meet out at places. A nice enough fella, just not someone you want to be around for longer than 5 minutes. I've never been good at anything. Just ok at lots of things. I am married to a woman who has very little to do with me anymore. I have a 4 year old son who has tons of personality and is the highlight of my life. I have no other family in my life. I don't think I have ever been depressed, and I always feel that I have a positive outlook on everything. Though, I am very unhappy with who I am and the 29 years of life that I have led. I have had no income for the past 2 months, and we are about to be homeless. I know that suicide is a very dumb idea that comes with many consequences, but it hasn't stopped me from planning it out in my head and replaying it constantly. I normally don't tell anyone how I feel so me posting this here is very out of character. Why I am still typing, I don't know. Now I feel stupid and am resisting the urge to delete. Ok just submitting. Sorry if you read this!
