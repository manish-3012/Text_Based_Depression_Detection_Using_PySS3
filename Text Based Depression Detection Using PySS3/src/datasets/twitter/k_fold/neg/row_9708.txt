Is this ocd ?Since a exposure with an hiv positive person  (at least thats what she told me) i had 16 negative hiv tests it was 5 months ago so i would actually be on a really safe side for not infected . I always get panic attacks about it i tested last time one week ago , i spendt like 1200 $ overall for so many tests since then .

Tge procedure is like that . I get a panic attack -&gt; get tested -&gt; get a negative -&gt; im calm for like a couple of days -&gt; getting panic attack -&gt; get tested 

It like a cicle i can't get out off . How can i beat this shit .

This incident also made me suicidal if i would test positive i guess i would immediately kill myself.
