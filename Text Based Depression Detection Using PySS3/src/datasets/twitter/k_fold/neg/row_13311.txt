What if everyone who had BPD plus childhood trauma died?Iâ€™m thinking of joining the statistic seeing as to how without having a good childhood or any of that shit, along with BPD, I canâ€™t ever be happy 

Yet Iâ€™m only 22. If I die now I can be free. Start life over with an even better family 

I was abused by my mom. Physical (belts) verbal (threats and called horrific names, told to kill myself, get raped, etc) punished for everything, even just standing, my dad enabled everything, my family enabled everything, confided in a neighbor a while back who told me to just go home, was bullied in school and by teachers 

5 years of therapy and meds couldnâ€™t save my ass. If I give up now and die ill truly be happy right?
