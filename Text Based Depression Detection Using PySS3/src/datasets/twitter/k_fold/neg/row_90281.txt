I hate myselfFirst of all, I want to say that i'm not writing this on my main account because I don't want people to look at my karma or status.

Second or all, I'm not very good with english so I'm sorry if you don't understand some parts.

Now, I wanted to write some things to get off my mind here for a long time, but I didn't have the courage.. and now I finally have.

Ok so the main question: Why do I hate myself? Or rather why do I hate myself and the majority of this world? - Idk when it started but I found myself depressed like 4 or 5 months ago cuz I realised the reality of this world. - So I hate myself for my decisions and for what "friends" I had.

I liked and still like to play video games and watch anime.. Why? Because I could distract myself from the reality.. I tried to change but it all comes to the same end (or ends): I either 1. Get disappointment in myself and get even more depressed or 2. Straight get depressed and disappoint my parents.

People always say to stay positive... but why? To keep you distracted from the real world and continue doing your thing.

I don't like to go outside very mutch and be the middle of attention because I know I'm going to dissapoint more people later. I don't want to try to make a good future.. I don't want anything... I really want to die, but if I suicide I'm going to disappoint much more people.. and some people that I actually like. I wouldn't mind if a car would hit me. I really don't care at this point. Yes, I have things that I want to do, but there are somany things that I hate, I can't keep it up.

Please help me. If you at least see this please, I beg you, repley to this. Please.
