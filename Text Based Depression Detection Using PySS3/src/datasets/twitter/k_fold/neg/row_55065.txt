I'm trying to be better but no one lets me and I am phisically ill with who I am. And I just want to die.My name is Ian I'm 15 and I already relay on substances. My thoughts started to come around when I realised I liked guys (at the time I said I was gay, but it's more complicated) and all I could think about was, "what would everyone think, what would my freinds think, what would my dad think?" At the end of the day I blamed it on a fight with my friend. Then up to recently the thoughts were gone. I then decided to practice moral philosophy, so the people around me could be happy, but to do that I had to confront the past. That is when I realised that I am a vile, manipulative, vindictive, asshole, who's only justifiable action is to kill himself. I even have a plan, I just want it to be over, I just want eveyone else to feel better. I feel like Hittler.
