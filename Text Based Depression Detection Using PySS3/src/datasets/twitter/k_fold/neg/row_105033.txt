I am 16,and I don't want to live anymore.For a past few months,I felt awful all the time,and had no hope for things to get better.Then my crush started to give me some signs about her feelings.I thought that when we will start dating,everything will change to good.

I knew from her friends,that she is struggling with the decision whether she need to start a relationship or not.

Well,today she decided not to.Now I absolutely have no hope,I feel bad all the time,I want to kill myself,and probably will do it soon.

Yes,I know,I am young and stupid,and I am dramatizing.
