Never able to please my parentsThis will be a mess but I cant do this anymore. Every time I attempt anything I fail. My family has a delusion that I'm smart.  Then they call me a monster, a bitch, lazy, an asshole, a dumbass, a McDonald's employee, stupid, etc, when I inevitably fail. They call me an asshole for not thinking that material objects equals love. They call me a bitch for not wanting to talk (be insulted and belittled) to them. They'll hit me and when I defend myself I'm told I started attacking them. They get mad for me not being this fantasy in their head. They get angry when told I don't wanna go to college, end up in debt and have a useless degree and work at some boring job.
I used to love, I mean love love science. Figuring out how and why the universe worked. Now I can barely stand it. We can't afford college, but I still have to go. The only way is to win a scholarship. But I can't. There others who actually want and deserve thise scolarships and college. There are those who can change the world. But I'm not one of those people. Why is that so hard to accept? 
Everything I do is wrong. My passions are wrong. My height is wrong. My dreams are wrong. Me friends are wrong. My aspirations are wrong. My ideas are wrong. My art style is wrong. My mental capacity is wrong. My opinions are wrong. Fuck even the way I play Minecraft is wrong.
If everything is wrong why can't I die? I've tried and failed before. Everything I do fails. God I just want an end already.
