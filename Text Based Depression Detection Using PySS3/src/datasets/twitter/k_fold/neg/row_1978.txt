Do the thoughts ever really go away?I vividly remember thinking in my teens â€œjust make it to 20â€ â€œjust make it to 23â€ â€œthese thoughts will all be gone when youâ€™re 30â€ â€œpeople say it gets better! Letâ€™s see!â€

I had an awful childhood. My parents had 7 kids in a 2 bedroom 1 bathroom house. We didnâ€™t eat breakfast. We never brushed our teeth and rarely bathed. My dad would beat us, and my mom would say things like â€œbeat themâ€ I remember my sister pooping in the tub and my dad peeing in the sink when the toilet was in use. I never drank or did drugs but my dad found zigzags in the couch and my mom found beer bottles in the yard waste and they always just came at me. It was never me.

I tried to kill myself when I was 22. I still have ups and downs, sure. But since then Iâ€™m married, my husband and I are homeowners, we have more money in the bank than outstanding debt. We are pregnant with our 3rd kiddo and we always have food in the fridge. Though I have my degree, I am able to stay home with our kids for now and I know we just have it way better than most.

But Iâ€™m 32 and not a day has gone by for 10 years that I havenâ€™t thought about killing myself.  They say itâ€™s a permanent solution to a temporary problem but Iâ€™m over here like...itâ€™s a permanent solution to ALL my problems ever.

And then people like Robin Williams and Chester Bennington and Kate Spade and Anthony Bourdain... Iâ€™m worried Iâ€™ll be 62 and it will still just plague my mind.

Thanks for coming to my TED talk, it means a lot to me.
