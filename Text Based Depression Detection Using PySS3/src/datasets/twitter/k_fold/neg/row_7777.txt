So what if I am selfish?It's my fucking body. I own it, and I disown it. I never believed in myself, I never felt like I am strong enough to do or accomplish anything, I feel so empty. I don't want to drag my ass through life, it's not life - it's existence. I want to live deliberately, I want to be free.
