I know where I want to die but not whenIâ€™ve chosen a specific bridge where I want to end my life. Iâ€™ve been visiting it every few days for the past few months, just standing there and looking down on the spot where my body will lay at peace. I usually just smoke and listen to music while standing there for hours sometimes. I donâ€™t know when Iâ€™ll finally do it. Maybe next week or next month, maybe even tomorrow idk. I keep the letter in my bag just in case I decide to do it impulsively one day. I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m waiting for tbh, I wish I could just grow a pair and get it over with.
