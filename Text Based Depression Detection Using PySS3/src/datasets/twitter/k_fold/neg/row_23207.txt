I don't know why I botherIt's so hard living when you're only doing it for other people. I've been hospitalized before, put on anti-depressants, been to therapy, and I know that I SHOULD be happy. I've got a family who loves me, a darling fiancÃ©, and 2 close friends but that's pretty much all I'm living for. I don't live for me, if I were alone I'd die tomorrow, but I'm living just so these other people don't suffer and it sucks. I almost wish they didn't care, because while it would hurt, at least I could end it and it would all be over. 

I guess it's just so hard when I don't have anything really in life. I'm turning 25 soon, I'm stuck in my parents basement with a ton of debt (I was going to college but couldn't finish due to medical issues and now I can't work due to medical issues, so I'm just stuck), unable to work, unable to move in with my fiancÃ© for AT LEAST a year (probably longer due to covid) and I can't even see her right now due to Covid. I haven't seen her in 10 months now and it just feels like things aren't going to improve. She doesn't make enough money on her own to support us and I'm unable to contribute enough to matter (I'm on disability) I can't drive, and I can't do pretty much anything. 

I literally just sit in my room all day with the only thing I look forward to being dinner. I can't go anywhere (both due to covid and being unable to drive), I can't see anyone (due to covid and long distance friends), I can't work due to my medical issues, and so I just see all of my friends and family advancing in life while I slowly waste away in this basement, unable to do anything.

I know right now, I'm just living for my family and friends, but my friends hardly ever talk to me, my fiancÃ© would be better off with someone who makes money, and I've just been a monetary burden on my family, so why do I bother?
