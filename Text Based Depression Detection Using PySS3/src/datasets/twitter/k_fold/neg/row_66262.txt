LonelyThe only 5 popup messages I get from my smartphone per day are spam emails from Amazon or Linkedin, but I kinda chose to abandon all friends that I used to have, because I couldn't open up to them so I guess it's all my fault.... Or maybe it's the universes fault for constantly punish me with great misfortune and bad luck....
