I tried talking about my impending suicide, nobody seemed interested.Well... I've told my wife over and over again how terribly depressed I am, she doesn't seem to have a reaction. I told one of my "good friends" that I wanted to kill myself. He turned the conversation around to be about him.

The only thing stopping me at this point is fear of screwing it up, and just maiming myself. I'm just looking for a surefire way.  I don't know why I'm posting this... for attention?

So that's that. Best of luck to the rest of you.
