Is it worth it when no one cares, even in the slightest?I donâ€™t have anyone online or irl that asks questions or shows interest but I try my best to express interest and keep the friendship going when no one shows it back. Its even sadder when I ask why they donâ€™t ask anything,  they say â€œoh your just probably desperate to fuck or trying to get a relationshipâ€. Since when is it too much to just to ask for someone to be friendly, not everything has to be about sex.
