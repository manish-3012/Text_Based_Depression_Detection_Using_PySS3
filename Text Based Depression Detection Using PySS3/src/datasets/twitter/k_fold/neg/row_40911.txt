Everytime I am close to something good something bad always happens.I'm gonna be working to get a lot of money and buy a bunch of clothes with that money. I just now realized you can go to the sale section of the stores and that I can get more for less. I feel like there's gonna be something that is gonna somehow some way mess that up and I'm not gonna be able to get those clothes and I'm gonna look like a total retard with wearing all the clothes I wore last year. What can possibly happen? I'm not myself suicidal but I know that if I can't get the clothes I want any of my remaining ego and self esteem is going to be buried in its grave.
