I'll have the perfect opportunity to end my life this weekend, but I'm still afraid to do it.Roommates will be out. No family to want the real me. No loved ones. Just one friend - maybe. My cat is dead, my dad  is dead.

I just want to stop suffering. The weight I feel in my heard is so heavy, what's the point in carrying it around anymore? No one cares.

I'm so lonely. I hate my life. I hate who I am. Why doesn't anyone care?

There are too many people like me in this world, anyway. Who needs one more?

But I'm still scared to end it. I'm scared of what's going to come after, or what won't come. I'm scared of failing as much as I am scared of succeeding. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? Why do I have to be like this?
