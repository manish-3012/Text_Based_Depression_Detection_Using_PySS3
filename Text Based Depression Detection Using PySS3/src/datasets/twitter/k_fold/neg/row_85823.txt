Suicidal ideation on and off.Hey, so from around mid July to early September I went through a depressive episode and I was having moderate suicidal ideation and came up with various ways  to take my own life. It sorta cleared up during late September but even now I still have suicidal ideation on and off. Iâ€™m not seriously considering ending my life anymore, but under certain stressful circumstances and even if Iâ€™m just alone in my bed at night fleeting thoughts of suicide go through my head and it sometimes causes me to get anxious. I still have a low mood from 2-3 days at a time, usually every second week. Should I see anybody for this? Iâ€™ve never been diagnosed with a mental illness, but I have been diagnosed with have ADHD and I used to take medication for it.
