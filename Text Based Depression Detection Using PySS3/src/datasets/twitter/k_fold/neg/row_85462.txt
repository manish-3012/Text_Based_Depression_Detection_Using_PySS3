Being Ugly SucksI'm 18, Male, Gay. Being ugly sucks. People treat me differently and it's taken a massive toll on my self confidence and esteem.

It's harder to find friends, get into a relationship, and it makes it more difficult to get a job.

Being ugly is making me more and more miserable, and I'm afraid it will get to the point where I will stop enjoying life completely. What do you guys do to deal with depression?
