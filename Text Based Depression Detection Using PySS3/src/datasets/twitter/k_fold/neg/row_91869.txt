I know I need help, but I'm too afraid to get it.I honestly know I'm a major danger to myself. I've been giving every ounce of energy I have into actively avoiding killing myself because if I let my guard down, I'm going to do it. 
The only reason I'm here is to help others. The only reason I haven't done it is to not hurt anyone, but I'm tired of living for everyone else and I hate myself too much to live for myself. If I did what I wanted I'd have been dead a long time ago. 
I can't reach out. I'm in therapy, but it's 5 days away and I can't even see myself getting through today. If I tell the truth in therapy I'll end up in a psych ward again and my parents can't afford that. I tried to tell my friend today how I've been and a kid came up and started cracking jokes about how I'm gonna end up killing myself no matter what I do. 
I'm at the point I want to go walk up to my mom and just say "I need help " but the last time I did that I went to the hospital for an evaluation and they said no teenager would willingly check themselves in and that it was for attention and/or a way to get out of school.
