Rejected from jobI got my first interview in months at a job that would have been incredible. I made it past the phone screening, and I felt like I nailed the 7-hour technical interview. After a month-long process, the company emailed me to say that I didn't get the job and that they were going to "continue looking for someone who better fit their needs."  

This means going back to square one, throwing resumes and online applications into the HR black hole, and having to live in my parents' house. I get to hear my dad tell me more about what a disappointment I am and how I should be doing more to get a job. I ran out of money this month, and my parents will not be sharing theirs. 

I have almost no hobbies, almost no friends, and almost no good things in my life. Every day is pain. With this job interview, I thought there might have been a light at the end of the tunnel. Now I know I get to experience this hell for the foreseeable future. 

Life is awful.
