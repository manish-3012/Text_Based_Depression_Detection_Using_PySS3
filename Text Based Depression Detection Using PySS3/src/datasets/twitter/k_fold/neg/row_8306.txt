Why bother trying anymore?Heavily medicated and undergoing therapy for years. My life has been gradually improving over the past couple of years. Losing weight, making friends, relationships, education...

None of it is making me any happier. I put on a mask and act happier, I lie to the doctors and say I'm feeling better. None of it really matters anymore to me. I earned my GED. What good is it if I can't use it to further my education? It's not good enough to enter engineering; instead I have to go to community college and upgrade. Calculus and trigonometry and whatnot. That's fine, except I can't pay for it. If I work to pay for it, I won't have the time to go to school. It would take a year of working to save up enough money to pay for it, and that's assuming I don't have to eat or live indoors during my school time. Or I can take a worthless arts degree and go into massive debt and waste 4 years of my life.

I'm just so tired of suffering because my anxiety made me fail high school. How much longer is this going to be going on?
