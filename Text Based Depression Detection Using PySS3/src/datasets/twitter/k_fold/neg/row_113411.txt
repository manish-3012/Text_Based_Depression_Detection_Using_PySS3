Iâ€™m tired of being autistic and only my death can change that.Grew up being told Iâ€™m lazy and slow. I still got the work done, though, so I donâ€™t understand what the problem was. I was always told I was brilliant and smart, but I donâ€™t believe that to be true. If I was smart, Iâ€™d find a way to be happy with myself and who I am. Iâ€™m always alone. People donâ€™t understand me and I donâ€™t understand people. Iâ€™m never included by proxy, I have to insert myself. I trip over my words and never know the right thing to say. Every job Iâ€™ve ever had has told me Iâ€™m slow. I speed things up, but it feels unnatural and as if Iâ€™m in hyperdrive. It doesnâ€™t make sense to me. 

Iâ€™m never going to be good enough. I donâ€™t even know where I fit in to this world. I donâ€™t know what to do with my life, but itâ€™s worthless anyway.
