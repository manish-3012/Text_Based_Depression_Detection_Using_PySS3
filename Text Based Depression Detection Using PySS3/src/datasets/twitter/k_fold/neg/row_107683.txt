What do you call a 27 guy year old without a jobA loser. Thats all there is to it. I will have to go back home and live with my parents. At that age all my other friends moved on. They are doing bigger and better things while I because I started and graduated school so late will have to move in back home and begin life as a loser. 

I have a great girlfriend but due to not having a vast network or a 3.5+ gpa I will have to move to where the jobs are and break up with her. Even if I decide to keep the relationship she will dump me because most girls do not like losers. 

Eventually I'll find an engineering job and become a productive member of society but it could be a year.  Where I move I can set up a social network by joining groupme activites but by then it will be too late to live a fun life or find the right woman again. Most guys begin to slow down in their late 20s and there is a huge taboo with older guys "reliving their 20s." 

Therefore it will be better to just get it over with than go live a life empty of good memories and full of disappointment.
