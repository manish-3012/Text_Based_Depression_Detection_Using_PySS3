I'm excited, I will follow through with my claim shortly.I've made a decision discontinue my life. This is for the protection of myself and others, and for the purpose of maintaining the order of our society. This order was violated through felony offences I've been convicted of committing. I am preventing the furtherence of any potential pain, suffering or criminal activity through death.

 I am also completing suicide as a method of removing past traumas and other irreparable faults from Earth, as these contribute to actions I have performed and plan to perform in the future once more. The suicide will remove any earthly penalty such as government sanctions or other forms of slavery. It will protect myself and others. I believe the suicide may have the potential to have unintended side effects, such as reincarnation into a felony free, reduced trauma life. I plan on taking advantage of this lovely opportunity.
