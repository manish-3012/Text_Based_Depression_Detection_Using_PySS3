Just need some mental help here... Not sure how to go on.So i've dealt with depression for a very long time. Nothing too severe the majority of the time, but sometimes it just spikes and I get happy at the thought of not having to deal with... Life. You know?


I got laid off at the beginning of december, after having a shitty paycheck for taking a week off due to being sick, and as you can imagine I've run out of money. I've had $0.46 in my bank account for around a week and a half now, after having to pay for a traffic ticket that wasn't really my fault (That's what they all say) and I'm living off of one box of brown rice I found in the back of my pantry.


I thought I had found a job that could get me through until I found a real one, and I was elated, but it turned out to basically be a scam. I've made a grand total of $25 for 15+ hours of work, and I wont even be getting that for another week. So you can imagine, going from elated to absolutely crushed has ruined me both mentally and physically. I don't think I left my room today other than going to the bathroom. It's 1:26 and I haven't even had a drink today.

And to top all of this off, Apparently Hulu can overdraft my bank account even though I told chase, when explicitly asked, to *NEVER* let my account be overdrawn. So now my bank balance is -$7.53. And I'll be charged a $34 fee for that, which I wont be able to pay, because I've only made $25 dollars. So there's *another* fee on top because of that that I won't be able to pay. And on and on and on...


Added to this the fact that if I want a *"real"* job at any point in the near future I need to go through college, getting myself further into debt, even though I don't even know what I want to do for a career anymore. 


I just don't see the actual point of being alive, when all I am is unhappy, or happy but *waiting* for a problem to present itself. What do? Help.
