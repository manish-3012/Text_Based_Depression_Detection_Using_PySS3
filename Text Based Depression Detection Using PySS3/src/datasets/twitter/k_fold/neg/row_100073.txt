I don't know what to sayIm depressed.I want to kill myself.My mom does not understand me.She has negated my mental stare for so long.Always saying its my fault.I have texted to my only friend just now and it made me depressed because i have not seen him for about 3 years .I have been a shitty friend to him and i don't deserve him.I think i have emetophobia and social anxiety.I want to hang myself but in my shitty house there is no good spot.
