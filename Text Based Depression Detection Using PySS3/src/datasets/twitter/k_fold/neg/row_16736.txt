Completely expected, Iâ€™m getting intense enough to have ideation nowThe honestly hard part that I totally get here is that right now I canâ€™t afford my therapist and it happens to be the worst timing. I plan to see my therapist but I jus canâ€™t for two weeks. I used to go to NAMI meetings to fill gaps like these but I have no way to get there (if I knew how to drive I would Suicide).
Iâ€™ve been able to handle well but this moment is hard with everything hitting at once. I went through an extremely hard breakup and I donâ€™t do well with recovery on that front. Iâ€™ve attempted 5 times and failed and I do not want to make that 6 times. My body is not ok. I canâ€™t tell much without giving out info for multiple parties. I just want some advice on how to not divert to substance abuse and what I can try for filler until I can see my therapist next month.

Iâ€™m a self harmer but I normally have it under control until July 30th, but I canâ€™t go get checked in yet let alone that the only hospital I trust would send me out somewhere else because they are full (yay Texas). I didnâ€™t relapse for 6-12months before then, was doing great, this was just too much. I normally have years in between just one in a super bad spot right now relationship wise. I donâ€™t want to say more for the sake of other redditors.

Are there other resources I donâ€™t know about?
