If I die because I can't afford medication, it's not really suicide, right?I have an ear infection that has moved into my face. I was dragged to the doctor today, but can't afford to fill the prescriptions. Its closw enough to my brain that it'll eventually kill me, right? I can't seem to keep a grip on money anyway. I'm a disappointment to most, so this is a much easier way out.

At least they'll get my life insurance.

I'm not looking for help or anything. I just want to be able to say what I really want to say to someone who can't answer me back.
