Preparing for the endI have a whole list. At least 15 different ways one can stop their vitals from functioning, resulting in cardiac arrest, a split spine, asphyxiation, neurological shock - therefore, death. Then there's the list for hiding one's own cadaver. For those who are unacquainted, you'd be surprised how easy it is to hide and disappear in this world even if it's packed with people. 

Day after day, I feel less and less afraid of executing any of these methods. I have already acquired some of the resources for what is on the list. 

I cannot complain nor can I cry. I have a life many would want. Any criticism I have towards life as we know it would be nothing but a failure's excuse.

Yet time and time again - life just seemed like nothing more than an endless, pointless road which demanded persistence and confidence where all people ultimately cared about is winning - nothing more. Every passing hour, I keep reminding myself over and over that I just cannot come to terms with  what being human is about. All I see is that being human is repulsive. Disgusting. Abhorrent. Filthy. It has escalated to the point that being happy just doesn't feel like enough, or even worse, it feels like I do not deserve to be happy at all. 

Life as a pointless, endless journey with such little yield of reward for the most questionable purposes - it was such a horrifying thought. After around a year or so of contemplating thoughts daily of leaving this earth, horror became absurdity. Life, as daunting as it still is, became ridiculous, nonsensical, stupid, primitive. I kept asking myself why I am here, why *all* of us are here. 

I write this message to those far and wide who share the same concerns and have perceived the same horrors. Chances are I will no longer be in a year or less. If so, then it is what the world willed.
