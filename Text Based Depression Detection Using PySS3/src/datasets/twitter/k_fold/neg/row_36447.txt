Don't delete the memoriesI think I'm going to end my story tomorrow. I could have been so much more. I could have been a hero, I could have changed the whole world. Or at the very least I could have been someone. To someone. I'm a ghost now. I haunt this room. I'm tired, friends. I'm going to sleep forever. I'm going to jump off a bridge. My story will be forever untold.. I'm sorry. I hate this. I'm so tired
