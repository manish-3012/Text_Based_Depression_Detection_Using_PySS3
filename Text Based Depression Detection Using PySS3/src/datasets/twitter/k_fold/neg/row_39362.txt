Lonely n cowardI know I'll  always be alone and no one can help me to get over my depression, I know everyone will just give me encouragement that makes me feel good for a few second and then disappears forever. I know I will never have anyone close to me, even I can't close to my parents. I know no one can understand me in this world. Everyone has their own problem and I can't be a burden to anyone. I know no one gives a fuck if I kill myself, but I'm just too coward to do that hahahaha. I always hope I'm brave enough to kill myself, not now, not soon, or maybe my self destructive behaviors will kill me slowly before I get better
