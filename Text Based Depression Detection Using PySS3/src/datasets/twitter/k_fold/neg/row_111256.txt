&gt; I've been talking to this girl for the last 2-3 months and in the last couple of weeks we have met up a few times. On saturday she came to my place and we just chilled and watched netflix and it was the happiest I've ever felt in my entire life. I wake up this morning and all of a sudden she's blocked me on absolutely everything and it's killing me. I just want to die now. She's been such a big part of my life recently and it's heartbreaking for me to think that shes just gone like that with no explanation. I really don't know what to do.

i just really need someone to talk to right now, I can't sleep and I feel like I'm going to do something stupid
