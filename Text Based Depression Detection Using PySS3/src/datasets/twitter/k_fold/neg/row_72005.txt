What Scares Me (90 days - 81 to go)My issues are legion. A lot has happened in my 30 years on this planet. I survived childhood sexual abuse at the hands of another child. I've survived cancer. I survived a brutal assault that included being stabbed twice. I've survived depression throughout the last sixteen years. I've survived parents so wrapped up in religion and their own happy marriage that they couldn't see the misery and issues of their two children. I survived alcoholism so far, including a rape that took place whilst drunk (and the police never caught the man). I've survived the incredibly lacklustre mental health services the UK provides - including a lack of follow-up after my fairly epic suicide attempt last year (80 paracetamol).

I hate talking about my problems. I'm known as a drama-queen among the circle of friends that I have, and the circle of people I know at church. I'm known as being fun, loud, noisy, controversial (in an amusing way) and alive.

No one really knows I don't want to be alive. That suicide doesn't have to be an impulsive thing. That on October 22nd (which will be my 90th day sober, just to prove to everybody that I can do it, and leave with something positive) I will kill myself. A random hotel room in London, more pills, detergent or bleach if I have to.

The terrifying thing is that I lived a life for everybody else but me. I lived for my parents, restricting myself from lifestyles, and education options. I forced myself to believe things, to be scared into saying things I couldn't justify in my heart of hearts - and now - I'm stuck at thirty with nothing.

This isn't to have people tell me I'm worth saving, that I should live, that I have so much to be grateful for... I just want a time-stamp, to think that a part of me will remain even for a little while after I'm gone. 

So you have me for 81 days reddit. I'm going to write up on things as I go and keep updating things.
