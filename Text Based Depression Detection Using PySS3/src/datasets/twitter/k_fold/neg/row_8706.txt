I'm losing my mind . help\- i think my family are talking about me

\-i have a mixed family, of 6 sibs including me (4 step, 1 half)

\- they low-key hate me because i'm the odd one out

\- i don't know my dad

\- i feel like they're laughing about me because  our walls are so thin, i honestly feel like they can hear me breath talk and move. i feel like the commentate and everything i do or  listen to

\- i'm so confused why they could hate me like that 

\- they lie to me about this under-breath shit ,... someone tell me if i'm wrong, because i'm the target. i feel like i'm being lied too 

\- i used to be a mad stoner (not legal where i'm from) just came clean almost a year ago .. but on and off have some. stopped because of the paranoia ... honestly started to feel like they were commentating on me or mocking me or trying to drive me crazy.  it got so bad i even thought my . family installed a mic/camera in my room. 

\-  i got put on serotonin because they said i was unhappy  and so paras do you blame me? 

\- i used to have a  huge  group of friends and then last year we started growing as individuals, but i'm going down hill as fuck unhappy with my body, face, family, and mind-state. i sound  so crazy i know  i just wanna know if  anyone else there  has had this before or could just help ?  

ps. been sexual abused by a close family member, paras started happening after me and friends drifted,  now i abuse alchs and do drugs when i can ., which is not often as i'd like. i feel like i'm being lied to !!! from people that shouldn't be been to therapy before it got worse, i hated it, tried to commit suicide twice ...  HELP.
