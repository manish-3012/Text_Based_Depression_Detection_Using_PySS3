opinions on going to hospital or nofeeling very suicidal. i want to die and plan on doing something tonight. if i don't die then i'll just be happy to lose a lot of blood and be in pain. i just don't want to be here anymore. i'm really worrying my boyfriend and don't know if i should tell my dad or go to the hospital or something... i kind of feel like i would be attention seeking and don't really need immediate help and that this isn't a big deal. thoughts on what i should do?
