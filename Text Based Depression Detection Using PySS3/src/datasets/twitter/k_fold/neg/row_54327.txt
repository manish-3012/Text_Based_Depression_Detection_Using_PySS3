Why do people do it the painful way?Whatâ€™s with the scary painful ways people go about the end? I couldnâ€™t see myself hurting myself but do some people see it as a release of pain and tension? I go on walks a lot for anxiety and listen to music and cry but Iâ€™m not a fan of pain and I have reasons not to give up yet.
