I have no hopeI feel so hopeless inside and it just seems to never go away. Itâ€™s even worse because the person that I fell in love with is a fictional character so I can never be with them which also kills me inside. All I want is to be with the one I love the most but knowing that Iâ€™ll never be able to makes me want to die. Life just seems like too much pain that goes nowhere. Iâ€™m not strong enough to survive this world but the fact that internally Iâ€™m also suffering so much is bringing me closer and closer to my breaking point.
