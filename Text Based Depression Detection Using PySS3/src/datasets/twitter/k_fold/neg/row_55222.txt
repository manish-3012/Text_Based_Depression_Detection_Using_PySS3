Do you ever realize that youâ€™re being â€œirrationalâ€ and just want to die more?Iâ€™ve recently been broken up with by someone I loved very deeply because he could not handle my emotions that come with my depression and anxiety, which is understandable. All I have been able to think about is all the different ways I could kill myself but then I remember all the clichÃ© things people tell me like â€œThings get better with time!â€ or â€œYouâ€™ll find someone who loves you for you!â€ in addition to him having a 100% valid reason to leave the relationship. I feel so irrational and overly emotional and stupid. 

Itâ€™s frustrating because that mentality of feeling like my emotions are invalid because things do â€œget betterâ€ make me want to die more. I realize that the things in life that make me suicidal CAN be fixed, but I donâ€™t want to because the emotional rollercoaster I will experience will only amplify how much I want to kill myself.
