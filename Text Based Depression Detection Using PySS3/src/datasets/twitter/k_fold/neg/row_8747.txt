Just to talkI made a plan and in 2 years I'm going to kill myself, so I was thinking that if anyone wanted talk about anything at all we could. I would put my cell number on here because I'd like to talk on a more personal level but I think it will be safer to pm that.  But feel free to pm if you'd like my number or just to talk in general. I'm not the best at advice or anything but if you're willing to vent or anything feel free. Oh and please dont try to talk me out of it, my mind is made up and I'm going through with it no matter what. (:
