There's nothing I have going for me. I'm a defect.Literally the only thing I enjoyed in life was video games and I don't even like those anymore. 

So not only do I seriously have no reason to stay, but I'd also leave the world a better place. 

As a kid, I was bullied basically every day from age 11 to 18 (not saying I didn't deserve it, but it explains why I turned out such a huge failure.)

 Now people leave me alone, mostly - though I still get people laughing at me when I enter a room or when I'm asked to talk by a professor. Still, it helped me learn I'm a defect. I'm vile to look at, I'm dumb, I'm not good with people, obviously, I'm not physically fit, and I'm too shitty a person to fix those aspects. Evidently, if depression is what I have, then I also have a propensity for mental illness. Which is just a testament to how shitty a character I am. At any rate, I don't want to get rid of it. It gives me a way to fix something that should have been fixed years ago. My parents made a last minute decision not to abort me, as I was an accident. What a fuckup that was.

I'm a gigantic manchild, as a result of basically not having grown up at all during my teenage years. While people were out experiencing stuff and becoming people, I just got home whenever I could and only left for school, where I had no friends anyway. All I did when school was done was run home, study, and play video games. Now, I still do so but I put less effort in studying. I still have my father drive me everywhere and help me study. Still he makes decisions for me. 

I just can't wait to gather up the strength to commit suicide. God, I wish I could just drop dead. If I'm not going to be of any use and I don't even enjoy being here then there's really no excuse to stay.
