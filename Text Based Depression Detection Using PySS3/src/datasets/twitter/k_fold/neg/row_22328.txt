I messed up pretty badly.This mentions self harm and itâ€™s pretty gruesome so maybe donâ€™t read it if youâ€™re sensitive. Basically I made a mistake and over reacted and was suicidal. I was going to overdose but instead I stabbed myself with a pencil and shoved a tampon in the wound. The thing is, when I live the people I care about get hurt, if I die they get hurt, if I ghost them they get hurt, if I self harm they get hurt and if I donâ€™t self harm I get hurt. Iâ€™m in so much pain that I guess stabbing yourself with a pencil is a distraction. Thatâ€™s all. Thanks.
