Someone please, please help me get through the evening.I just can't deal with the up and down cycle of bipolar disorder anymore, and my coping mechanisms are completely shot.  Please talk to me.

**EDIT** - I'm going to go sit in a bath for a bit.  I'll check back in soon - thanks for PMing me and talking to me.  It's really helping.  I love this community.
