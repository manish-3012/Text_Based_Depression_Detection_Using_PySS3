Is it normal to think about ending your life everytime you're sad?I started having suicide thoughts about four years ago and I did try to end it a few times. After one particularly bad attempt, I told myself that I had to carry on and the thoughts stopped. I genuinely thought I was over it.

But during the last two years, the desire to end my life came back, except that it wasn't random like before, I happens when I'm really sad.

It feels like I can't allow myself to be sad anymore... I don't know what to do anymore... I don't want to live like that. I need the pain to stop. I wish it wasn't so strong and that death didn't feel like the only way out of my sadness... I don't know what to do.
