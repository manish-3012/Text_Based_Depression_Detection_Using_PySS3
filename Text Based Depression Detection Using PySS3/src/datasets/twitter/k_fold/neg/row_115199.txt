Feeling bad bc of teen suicides around me.Okay so basically Iâ€™m a freshman.  Donâ€™t know if I should be on her but like...  
Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts since sixth grade and had two attempts.
In January, a girl from my school committed suicide.  I really didnâ€™t like her and I talked shit on her constantly.  But when she died I cried for two days.  Iâ€™m still not over it like 9 months later.  I feel so guilty and I feel like itâ€™s my fault. 
Her death made my suicidal thoughts way worse.  Exactly a month after she died, I had my second attempt.
Since itâ€™s been so long, Iâ€™ve started to feel a little better.  Like the pain has started to wear off even though I still think about her every day.
BUT last night, I found out a girl from a school near me committed suicide two days ago.  Lots of kids from my school knew her so they were all posting links to her funeral fundraiser.
I didnâ€™t even know she existed until now but it still feels awful.  It hasnâ€™t affected me as much as the other girl, since I didnâ€™t know her and also wasnâ€™t a bitch to her while she was alive, but I feel like itâ€™s set me back a little if that makes any sense.
