I want to end it but I donâ€™t know howI donâ€™t want pain. I just want out. Iâ€™ve never seen the point of any of this. I was put on this Earth without being consulted. Itâ€™s hard enough for me to see any value to life when things are going fine, but lately things have been going down the shitter and I honestly cannot take one more minute of this.

I donâ€™t have a job. The job I did get I couldnâ€™t start because I wasnâ€™t granted a work permit in the country where I live (I wasnt born here). Itâ€™s been months of waiting around, in limbo. 
Iâ€™m out of money and options. I havenâ€™t felt a real connection to anyone in years. I barely have any friends, and most of the ones I do have donâ€™t really give a shit. Theyâ€™ll say the polite thing and move on. Thatâ€™s fine, I donâ€™t want to be a nuisance, and theyâ€™re entitled to their life. 

I just want out. Iâ€™m so tired. I keep fighting for things to get better and all I get is a slap in the face. Some people are just unlucky I guess. 

And yet Iâ€™m one of the lucky ones. There are so many out there who are worse off. It doesnâ€™t make me want to die any less, if anything it just confirms that this world is no place to be, for anyone.

Iâ€™m gonna die in a few decades, maybe earlier than that, anyway. In the grand scheme of things it makes no difference when or how so why should I keep suffering. I just canâ€™t find a way to do it thatâ€™s foolproof. I donâ€™t want pain or agony. I just want to press a button that gets me out of here. I hate my parents for bringing me into this shitty place.
