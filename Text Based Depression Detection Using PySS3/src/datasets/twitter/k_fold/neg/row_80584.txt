My life is pointlessI donâ€™t have anyone who truly loves me. I lost someone for good. He said Iâ€™m a crazy and horrible person. I donâ€™t want to die, I just want to be a normal twenty year old. But too much time has already been wasted and Iâ€™m just getting worse. The pain I feel is unbearable and I really donâ€™t want to hurt anyone but Iâ€™m afraid I already have. I feel like Iâ€™m going crazy and I hate who I am. I just want to be good and normal. Everyday recently I just wait until I can fall asleep and not feel pain anymore. Itâ€™s not fair that people get normal lives. Iâ€™ve been trying for so long.
