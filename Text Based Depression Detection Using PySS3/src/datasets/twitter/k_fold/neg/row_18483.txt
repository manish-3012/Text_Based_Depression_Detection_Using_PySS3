I Think It's Finally TimeAfter a year of the most bitter hell all brought about by my own poor choice (one choice, that's it, undid everything I had built over years and years and years), I feel like there's nothing left to do but end it.  I will never get my life back, my soul disappeared a year ago with everything else.  I am a shell that has taken beating after beating, and there is nothing left but for me to bash my head against the concrete wall until I'm dead.
