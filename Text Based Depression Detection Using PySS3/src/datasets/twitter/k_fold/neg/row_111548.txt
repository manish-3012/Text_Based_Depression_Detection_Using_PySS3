"It's the most selfish thing anyone can do"That's what my stepmother said about suicide. Nice dinner table conversation for a nice family gathering, celebrating one nameday and two birthdays (one of them my own, anyone else in a crisis because they didn't think they'd live to be 20?). Had to pretend the whole time I'm normal, in no way involved or affected by the topic, haha. I had no idea the whole time how many people here even know I'm seeing a psychologist and all that stuff (one of my stepbrother's seeing a psychiatrist, so it's not that they're judgemental, it's just that he's 'valid'). 
I had no idea how she could say such things, especially in the context of how she had thoughts about this, too. How she agrees that there might be times, where even if by being here we can help others, it's the most selfish thing in the world to give that oppurtunity up. (What the FUCK.)
One step-brother and one other family member, who had an attempt herself, started to set her to rights. Meanwhile I was busy being a coward, trying not to show I was hurt, trying not to cry, poker face. Dad was sitting beside me and I lay on his shoulder for a long time, staying silent. He eventually asked me jokingly "are you falling asleep?". It's better if he doesn't get the situation, and I just needed the contact, anyway. 
Only my psychologist knows, and I don't know how long I'll be seeing her. (Well, and anyone on the internet who cares to know, and we joke about it with my friends, which I know might be harmful -- but if we didn't laugh, we'd cry.) 
God, sorry for the rant. I'm just so tired of pretending.
