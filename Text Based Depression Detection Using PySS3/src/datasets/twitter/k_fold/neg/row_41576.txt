i donâ€™t think i can do grad schooldid my undergrad in english lit &amp; history but you canâ€™t really get a job with that so i applied to grad school - business for non-business majors! you get to learn actual practical skills! and iâ€™m like, very unemployable, struggled to find and hold a job during my undergrad, have had recurring bouts of severe depression &amp; anxiety and loooooots of suicidal ideation and got diagnosed with borderline personality disorder earlier this year. but i thought i was smart, at least, good at writing and researching and all that jazz. so with encouragement (aka: i was forced LOL) from my mom i applied and miraculously got in. 

and then it starts and it is utter HELL. math formulas weâ€™re expected to know. hefty assignments assigned and due 18 hours later. everyone is confident and ambitious and motivated and driven and smart and iâ€™ve spent every night sobbing at my computer while handing in shitty work because i donâ€™t understand anything and iâ€™m FOUR DAYS IN. iâ€™m not even good at writing or anything and my brain feels so slow and sluggish and i am in physical pain 24/7 and having nightmares and bad sleep and all that jazz and i am somehow expected to perform at 110% and be an expert on concepts we touch on for like an hour!!! and i donâ€™t know any of this shit!!!!

and weâ€™re supposed to be coming up with a whole business plan but instead iâ€™m trying to figure out how to off myself because i just spent so much money on this program and i feel like iâ€™m just gonna fail out, itâ€™s so competitive and difficult and my brain just does not work and i feel like i should not be alive but it isnâ€™t like i have any actual employability skills. i just wish i was fucking dead. everything makes me feel sick and i have been living in this utter hell of a life for far too long already and the thought of having to do this 9-5 corporate job for the rest of my live is just repulsive. i want out.
