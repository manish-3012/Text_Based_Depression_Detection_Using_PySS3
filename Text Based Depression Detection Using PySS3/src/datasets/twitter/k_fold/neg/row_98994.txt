I wish someone cared about me.I am 15 and Iâ€™m very depressed and suicidal and I feel as if I canâ€™t talk to anyone because they wonâ€™t understand or that I would be bothering them . Iâ€™m also worried that if I tell someone how I feel they wonâ€™t believe me because im quite young and they will think Iâ€™m over exaggerating.
