How's therapy? Does it actually help?I was offered therapy by my college but I declined. Im worried about the amount of time it'll take and interfere with my ability to finish my assignments on time. Im also worried that my parents will find out because I'm living at home. I feel ashamed sharing about my problems. I dont think I have a good reason for feeling the way I do. Im sure the therapist will think it's pathetic and I dont wanna take away the time of someone else who is probably dealing with a lot more than I am.
