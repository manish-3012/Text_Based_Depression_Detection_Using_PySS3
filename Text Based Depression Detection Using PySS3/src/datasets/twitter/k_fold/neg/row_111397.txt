Is there any hope for me?I'll try to keep this short.

Basically, I'm living with my mentally abusive grandparents, and I have to go live somewhere else, I don't only want to, I have to if I want to get better. I've been dealing with suicidal thought since I live with them and every single day they make it worse. They are constantly feeding bullshit to my naive mind, they are constantly talking yet when I try to talk they don't give a shit. They make me feel worthless and it's almost as if they liked it. To keep it short, they are the worst assholes I know and I have to leave their house, I can't keep living here or I'm definitely going to kill myself. The problem is I have nowhere to go.

So I'm asking you all if you have any solutions to my problem, is there anywhere I could go to until I can afford my own apartment considering I don't have any income for now?

The only solution I have is to live in my car but I'll be hard to find a job if I do..

Thank you for your help, you can save my life with a few words so please do
