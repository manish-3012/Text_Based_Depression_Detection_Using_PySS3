I intend to do it tonightI'm going to sum this up quickly so that we don't have a wall of text.

I have no memory of before I was 11, diagnosed with PTSD, likely from parents.  Parents love me now, as well as two older sisters, but I'm in too much pain.

At 16 after first attempt to hang myself, diagnosed with extreme depression and anxiety. Shortly after, found out I was having 300 petit mal seizures per day and no one had noticed.  Got medicated. Helped to a degree.

Still felt suicide was inevitable. Went to college. Did well, but no passion. Only there because it was expected. In final year, tried marijuana. Best thing. Gave me will to live for first time. Months later, got caught. On probation. Have to be clean.

Was going to kill myself, had some weed out of desperation. Failed next urine test. Told if I fail again it will be sent back to court. Feel trapped, can't think straight.

Strange thing happened, old coping mechanism, strange change in personality, no empathy, manipulate others for own survival. Had not been used since childhood, had no wisdom. Did research on probation officer only to help me to feel less powerless, no malicious intent. Let it slip that I did so.

Called probation officer today, transferred to new one. Ordered to do no research on employees. Frightens and intimidates me. Cannot do this anymore. Too much stress, took away only outlet.  No friends. One sort of friend, only likes me to try to have sex.


Wrote goodbye note. Figured plan. Did research to make sure. No mistakes this time.  Would live, but can think of no way forward that does not involve too much pain to be worth it. Never did much enjoy life, why bother going through emotional torture to live when I don't want to?
