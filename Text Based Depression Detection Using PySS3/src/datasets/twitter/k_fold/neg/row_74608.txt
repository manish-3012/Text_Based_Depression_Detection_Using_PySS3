For those who are suicidal or have suicidal thoughts, how long has it been going on? Months? years?I feel like this has been going on way to long for me, to the point to where I'm questioning if I'm faking it.

The first year of middle school I constantly thought everything was pointless and that I'll just die anyway. Same went on for the next grade, seventh grade, and I was imagining myself dead on the ground after killing my self. 

It wasn't even until eighth grade that I figured out what suicide, depression, and self harm was, because I finally got social media and went on the internet to explore. The feelings went away for a bit that year, but then they came back.

9th grade was the same, all the same thoughts and actions. 10th too, it was very bad, then came along 11th, then 12th. 

I'm doing better than any other year, but it still lingers in my mind. Just the thoughts of being depressed, the actions that come with it, like not being able to get out of bed, or brush my teeth, hair, or wash my face some days. Some days it's completely gone, others it's fully there. Today's one of those days. I've been sleeping in my classes. 

Even when I was a child, second or third maybe, I would tell my mom how if we ever got captured by isis and they would magically tie us up on a high cliff, then I would jump off and kill myself. Probably scared my mom to death.

I guess this is just a question but also a vent of some sort. I don't even know why i have felt like this from the beginning of middle school to the very end of high school. I live in a good home, we're comfortable with our money, and we go on vacation every year, etc. I just don't get it. Never been diagnosed with anything either. Not able to.
