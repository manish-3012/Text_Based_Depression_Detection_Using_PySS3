I feel trapped.Not bothering to make a â€œthrowawayâ€.  Fuck it.  

There are times when I make it a point to force myself to go out and meet people.  Tonight was one of those nights.  I had a few beers and more than a few laughs.  Iâ€™m a contemplative but â€œhappyâ€ person usually, just extremely guarded and distrustful.
This doesnâ€™t mean that I donâ€™t think about what it would be like.  I would love to just get it over with and say goodbye.  I have friends and I pretend to be â€œhappyâ€ and sociable.  I put on a mask for everyone so they donâ€™t feel sorry for me.  When Iâ€™m alone I realize what a waste I am.  For my family, my friends, and I think how much better it would be for all of them if I just disappeared.

My life isn't the worst.  If anyone else had my life they would be fine.  Itâ€™s a living.  I have two jobs, wonderful friends. But I never feel like I can tell them what Iâ€™m really feeling.  I feel trapped.  I feel like I expected too much.  Then I feel guilty because there are people out there who would love to have a stable job (mostly stable) and a place to live.  I feel ungrateful and lost and stupid because obviously I donâ€™t understand what it means to be grateful for what I have.

Iâ€™m surrounded by people and no one knows who I am.  I think â€œWhat does it matter?â€  I want to connect and â€œdoâ€, but hide continuously.  Iâ€™m afraid of dying, but would rather do so.  I know whatâ€™s waiting: nothing, and somehow find that peaceful.  Blankness.  Void would be preferable.  I never wanted to be rich or famous.  Iâ€™m just at the poverty line.  I just want to be happy.  I donâ€™t want to be with someone, I just want to feel something other than sadness.  I want to live and not just survive.  I want to be, but I feel like Iâ€™m dying already.  Just killing myself slowly.  Waiting for the end.

No beer can help.  Weed only makes me analyze my awkward actions further.  When/how can I be at peace?  Nothing brings me close.

Iâ€™m a disappointment.  Iâ€™m not what I told everyone I would be.  Iâ€™ll never be close.  Iâ€™m a fuck up and everyone knows it but wonâ€™t say it out of kindness, bless them and fuck them.  To think I thought I could once help people like me!  How conceited.  How stupid.  Iâ€™m so scared of what Iâ€™m becoming and thereâ€™s no one that understands or would believe me because Iâ€™ve worn this mask of normalcy for so long.  Itâ€™s a wonder that I havenâ€™t convinced myself.  

I wish I could.  I wish it was that easy.  Maybe you know someone like me.  Someone who hides behind humor.  Someone who tells a joke so they can go home and wish they really told you how they felt, but would rather not suffer the potential judgment.  Iâ€™m sorry.  I donâ€™t know.  I feel like itâ€™s too late.
