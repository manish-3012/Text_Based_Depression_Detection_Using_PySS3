Life's been going downhill lately, experiencing suicidal thoughts commonly.Can't even be bothered to make an alt for this.

I've suffered with depression for a year and a bit now and it hasn't been getting any better. I was medicated for a few weeks, but that just made me feel emotionally deadened. Two weeks ago my girlfriend broke up with me, which hasn't helped much. Over the past week or so I've fallen into drug use, been getting high almost daily, I took ecstasy on the weekend, things are just kind of dropping into an abyss. I've been having thoughts of hanging myself, and it's been almost daily, even when I'm high.

I've been getting crazy nightmares which isn't doing any good. I just really want it to all end. I want to tell someone but I feel like they're just going to call the hospital or something. Admitting myself to hospital logically seems smart, but I feel like it wouldn't help me go anywhere. I want to leave the world but I don't want to hurt anyone in the process, I don't want people to blame themselves. I've contemplated making friends hate me just so they won't miss me if I go through with it.

I'm sorry if this is too much, thankyou for reading though.. I really just needed to get it off my chest.
