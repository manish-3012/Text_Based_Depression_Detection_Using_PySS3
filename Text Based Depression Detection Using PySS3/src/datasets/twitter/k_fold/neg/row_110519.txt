I just want to be free of mental illness.I have a cluster of mental illnesses that love to feed into each other. Bipolar disorder, social anxiety, eating disorder...I'm so tired of them. 

I want to wake up in the morning and they're all gone. I want to wake up and it's okay again. I want to wake up to a life where I can eat without guilt, where I can love someone without pushing them away, where I don't waste hours and weeks and years of life distracting myself from hunger and buying things and watching shows I already know by heart.

Mental illness is not going away. I'm tired of pretending that's okay. I'm tired of pretending I'm just like everyone else. I'm tired of people telling me that the best choice is to pretend it's not there, to pretend that these things aren't real, because they are, and I'll end up in a life where I've written a hundred checks I can't cash. Hell, I'm already there.

I just want it to be gone. For once, all gone.
