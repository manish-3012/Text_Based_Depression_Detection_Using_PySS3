Taking control of my life for once25 male aware enough to understand that my death would leave behind sad friends and family. I am barely hanging on and my life is amazing. I want to pass away, I smile and Iâ€™m kind and I help others but inside I feel like there is something incredibly sinister about life on earth. And I need to leave, 

Iâ€™m going to sell everything I own and disappear. Thereâ€™s too much pain and nothing in this life makes sense. Weâ€™re just flesh skeletons on a rock ruled by psychopathic war criminals and where humans are a commodity bought and sold/harvested by the very people sworn to protect the public. This is hell, we are in hell. 

And everyone is getting brainwashed without even realizing it. This is a strange existence and the only thing I feel like I can truly know is that there is more to the story. Everything is so bizarre why wouldnâ€™t there be an afterlife. Iâ€™m overthinking and I wish I could shut up but ever since I started waking up my sanity and soul has worn thin. Idk wtf is happening and Iâ€™m a quarter thru this corporate nightmare

Iâ€™m done, but Iâ€™ve been saying that for years. Love you all just needed to rant.
