Love of my left keeps threatening a break up, parents killed my cat, all my friends left me, and I'm alone at the gym thinking about death.Yah, what a fucking week. The love of my life keeps threatening to break up with me because at 20 (hes 32) is mad that I dont know what career I want, and even then, hes mad that I wont be a SAHM. 

Then my mom recently went and killed my cat. She was.only 8 years old and she said that she was tired of the hair getting everywhere, so she put her to sleep. I'm in college, 20 min away I could have found some one if she told me, I clean her house when I go over, but what ever I guess.. 

Then, all my friends left me because I called a girl out on her egotistical rant about how she's better then everyone else. 

This is my life, I've been depressed for years now, it just keeps getting worse socially. I thought the worst of it was over when in the fall, I got raped brutally by a family friend, but nope... all these God damn thoughts! I just want to end it, I'm going to end it, and I'm going to write a big fuck you letter to everyone I know, laughing dead to the grave.
