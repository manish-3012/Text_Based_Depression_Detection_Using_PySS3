Stuck...I've attempted suicide many times already.  Last one was 3 weeks ago, most serious so far.  I have excuses; cerebral palsy, alone, rejection from family, my living arrangement just dissolved and I don't know where to go.

I'm stuck, and I definitely know myself and I feel in the near future I will try soon.
