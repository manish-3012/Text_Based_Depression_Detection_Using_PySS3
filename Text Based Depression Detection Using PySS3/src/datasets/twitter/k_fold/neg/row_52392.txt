i'm beyond helpnothing's ever helped me. I've never gotten out of a conversation or an article in the internet thinking suicide is a bad choice. I've been through several meds and a handful of mental health professionals, they either didn't work or made me feel worse. It's been going on for years, this is not going to get better (because I'm trapped into a situation that has no realistic resolution). I'm just so tired of being so hopeless. Why doesn't anything help me? Am I broken so far past recovery? Why, I've never been through enough to justify being that fucked up in the head. I don't know if it even matters anymore, having hope that is, almost anyone who says they "survived severe depression" adds that they're still depressed and suicidal, "just not as often". I have a plan to follow come monday, I just felt really lonely.
