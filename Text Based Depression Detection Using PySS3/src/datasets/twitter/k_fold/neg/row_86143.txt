I just want the pain to stop.I will start by saying I haven't been able to get a prescription for anti-depressants for a week now... so that may be the reason I am feeling like this. However, it really doesn't negate the situation.

I have no friends that really want me around... I'm always setting up stuf with them and asking them to do stuff. I did an experiment where i didn't ask any of them to hang out for over two weeks. I didn't even start conversations with anyone online or via text either... no one talked to me.

my boyfriend is causing me so much pain without meaning to... its a very complicated situation, but it takes a little piece out of me every few days.

I just want it all to stop. I want it to stop. I have more things that are making me feel this way, but my grief over the fact that i want to die is clouding my thoughts so much that i can't think clearly. I promised i wouldn't hurt or kill myself tonight. but i have no promises for tomorrow. and thats as about as long as i can go on...

i am just always miserable. i have periods of happiness... and without fail i always return to my default self-loathing, depressive self. i want oblivion. i want to not exist and not feel the human emotions that come with being alive.
