Suicide by jumping in front of trainWhat are the odds of it being successful if it was coming at an average speed or faster. From 1-10. 

I don't know if the shape changes the speed, damage, etc. The ones here vary so it's either those square ones or newest ones which have triangular noses. 

And what are the odds I survive and end up in a wheel chair or something.
