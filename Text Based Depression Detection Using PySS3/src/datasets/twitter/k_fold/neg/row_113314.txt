At this point I'm just happy to have moments of mental reliefs before I kill myself.I can't say what it is, but I've been going through a lot of mental pain and suffering for the last week or two. I haven't been able to rest at all, I haven't been able to seriously focus on anything and I could barely think. Most of my mind was occupied with fighting intrusive thoughts and letting them pass, contrary to belief, made everything so much worse..

Now I am feeling better and I am just thankful that I had this small relief before I kill myself.
