I may be suicidal but I'm not depressedI've not been diagnosed with depression or anxiety, and I'm also not actively trying to kill myself. I just think that life isn't as precious as other people make it out to be, and that sometimes death sounds really appealing. I'm agnostic so I don't believe in any specific afterlife but honestly, most things sound better than living with emotions and expectations that I'll never be able to fulfil.

I'm not trying to kill myself bc I have no reason to right now, but I also don't have a reason to live either, you feel?
