I can't take it anymore...I'm being abused by my mother - both physically &amp; emotionally. My dad died few years ago since then my mom has turned into a psychopath. I'm not good enough no matter what I do. I have scars. When I study she keeps saying how I'll fail no matter what. I'm ugly and stupid according to her. I guess she's not wrong. I had A grades in the start of the year now I've F grades. I don't have anyone to talk to and it's taking a huge toll on me. It's legal in my country to hit your children so I can't report it. I want to be out of this torture somehow. I've lost my interest in life.
