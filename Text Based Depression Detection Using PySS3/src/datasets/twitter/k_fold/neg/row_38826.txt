A few more days leftI wish I was talking about my number of days left as a terminally ill patient.

That would be nice as a suicidal person.

However, I'm talking about how there will be a few more days left before I'll finally really kill myself.

I did have goals. I did have things to look forward to. But they don't matter anymore. Just like I am. People tell me otherwise but I bring more hurt than happiness. And I hope that people continue to remember me, if they chose to, for the hurt i've given them. So they'll remember that I am or was better gone than anything. 

I hope that everything goes according to plan this time. I've thought of all the variables and other possibilities that will happen before, during, and after. I hope I can take it all and finally be successful this time.

That's why, I hope you could wish me a successful plan too.
