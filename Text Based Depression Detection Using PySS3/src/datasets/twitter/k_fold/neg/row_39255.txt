I think it's gotta be something with science why thoughts like this exist.Why is it that these thoughts exist, why would my body hurt my mind. I called a hotline because I thought a garage with about 5 stories would end it, but I chickened out because I don't know if it's high enough. The lady asked why in a mean tone why I called about something if I didn't want to seek help. I mean I only said 5 words, maybe just it's my time. I look at all these posts I mean there is a lot of stuff in the world, no one knows why. There just had to be some sorta drug that gives courage, right? I don't know. Please just I don't know about communication I'm not good at it. I don't know. Please just why can't I get help to die. I wish I wasn't so weird and so much anxiety. These bullshit pills  I think it fucked with my chemical levels. Nvm I should be a man right? I'm not tough, I'm some fucking nerd. I hate my thoughts. I'm sad everyday. I regret my actions and thoughts.
