I need guidance please because I'm about to give up..I just recently graduated from college with a chemistry degree. I'm looking for jobs and I am having a hard time just getting interviews. My dad is just working as a retail associate and he's paying for rent and my car. I feel so pressured. I'm doing everything to look for jobs and I am also willing to work 80 hours a week just to pay for everything. But I am not succeeding. 

I'm so unlucky 5 years ago I chose the wrong major, I should have studied nursing but stupid me, I didn't do it. Now chances of becoming one is slim not to mention how long it would take. I have student loans, credit cards, car payments. I can't pay for all of these things. Everyday my dad makes me feel like I'm not doing anythings. I feel so useless. I'm so tired of thinking of strategies to solve my problems, but when I do there always a barrier. Why is the world against me? I think it wants me to die.
