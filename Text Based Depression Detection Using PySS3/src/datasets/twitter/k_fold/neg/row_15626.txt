Did the online suicide hotline chat todayâ€¦Talked about how I want to die, how I've been depressed and suicidal for over half my life and I don't want to spend the next however-many-years until my natural death suffering like thisâ€¦I'm too depressed to work, I'm a burden on my family, this is no way to live. I've tried therapy and many kinds of medication, and no matter what, I always end up back here, wishing I was dead.

I think everyone has the right to die with dignity, on their own terms. No one chooses to be born, and so it feels morally right that we be given a choice at some point (whether at age 18, 25, or whenever) to opt out. I should be able to end my life without agonizing over the possibility of surviving and being institutionalized or having an excruciating death.

I articulated all of this to the counselor chatting with me, and you know what they said? They said I'm right, and I shouldn't be forced to suffer like this, and people should have the right to die. It was strangely validating, but not helpful in getting the wanna-die blues out of my head lol.
