Haunting me (triggers: France attacks)After hearing about all the terrorist attacks all day at school (I take two social study classes and a french class) and everyone was talking about it all weekend and it really hits me and then I found out today that one of my teachers from elementary school died and it was sad enough but then my sister (who adored him) came down stairs bawling saying how it was a suicide.


I tried killing myself about 5 years ago and it just like hovers over me all the time and my sister always says how she would be so sad if I killed myself and when I first told my one friend I remember her just sitting there hugging me and bawling and bawling and bawling and I'm tired of all the heartbreak and tears I just want to cuddle my cat and watch Netflix and eat brownies I'm tired of it all I'm so tired
