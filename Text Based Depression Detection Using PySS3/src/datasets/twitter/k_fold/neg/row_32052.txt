If I tell my psych this will he admit me?Iâ€™ve been having these weird flashes of me harming myself. They are almost like a flash back but not quite. They are usually just a couple second flash of something that hasn't happened. They are realistic, but I still know what's actually going on. I haven't said anything because I'm not planning to harm myself, and I can't deal with the stress of people freaking out right now, nor do I have time or money for a hospital admission. 

If I tell my psych about them, what will happen?
