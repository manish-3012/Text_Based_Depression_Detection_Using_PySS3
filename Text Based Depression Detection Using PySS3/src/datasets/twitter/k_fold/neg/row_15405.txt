I hoped to get buried in a wedding tuxI know Iâ€™ll never get married, and my family really wants to see me in that damn tux at a wedding reception. The thing is I donâ€™t plan on even staying alive long enough for that to happen. Iâ€™d like for them to get a piece of happiness through my inevitable demise. Voices keep telling me Iâ€™ll be dead by 28, so why even waste someoneâ€™s time by even giving love a chance again?
