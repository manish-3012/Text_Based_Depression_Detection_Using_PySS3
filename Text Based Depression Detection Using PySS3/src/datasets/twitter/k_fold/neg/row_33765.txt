I want to seek help but...I know I need help. Badly. I'm in a bad place and it's been getting worse.  I want to reach out to professionals for help but I'm terrified for a few key reasons...

1. My job.  I barely get by as it is and I know getting help and being possibly (likely) commited probably means my job is gone.  Took me forever to land this one. I really can't afford to lose it.

2. My family - I have a fiancee' and a (kinda?) step-son that I want to be with and be there for. We're currently separated geographically and I've been working on moving up there but there's some debt in the way I've really needed to clear up first. Getting commited would just rack up more debt, possibly cost me my job (see point 1) and set me back on being with them even further...

3. Going on my record, which would prevent me from likely working further in my field.  I don't know how to deal with that.

It's bad. My fantasies are starting to be less fantasy and more plan. I need help. No bullshit, no excuses - I need help.  But I don't know how to do it without actually making things worse on the other end...
