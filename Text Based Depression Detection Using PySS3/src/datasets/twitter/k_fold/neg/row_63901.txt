why am i like thistw: iâ€™m not censoring anything. 

iâ€™m just so tired. 

recently a kid at my school died. i didnâ€™t know the kid, but it oddly made me feel less suicidal. and that makes me feel sick to my soul. someone lost their life from something out of their control and iâ€™m here happy because iâ€™m not suicidal from it. 

but the thoughts came back. 

i was on prozac, iâ€™m now taking zoloft. it isnâ€™t working and iâ€™m so frustrated. i still want to die. i want to see myself bleed and suffer and end my own life. i donâ€™t deserve to be on this planet, but iâ€™m still here. 

iâ€™m just so tired.
