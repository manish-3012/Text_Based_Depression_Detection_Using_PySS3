Invisible.I'm invisible and I know it. I'm not even worth the time of day to anyone. I'm ignored constantly by everyone around me. Every time I try to put myself out there no one acknowledges my existence. I know people look at me and see me as that antisocial loser and I know it's not my fault. I can't change at all. 


I can't keep going on like this anymore.
