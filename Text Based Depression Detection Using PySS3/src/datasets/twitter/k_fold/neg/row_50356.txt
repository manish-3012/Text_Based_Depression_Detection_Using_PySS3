Will I be aware of the pain?I want to kill myself. I have thought about it for a while and there are two things keeping me from killing myself. My parents being one and the pain. The only way i can think of doing it would be painful (if it was painful on another part of my body its going to be painful there). But will it hurt or will adrenaline come into play and make it happen quicker? I dont know and im scared to try. My parents dont deserve my death. They are good people and I believe that my death would greatly upset them (im an only child). I cant do it, but what other choice do i have?
