Are any of you like me?This is very hard for me. I'm only writing this because in Reddit I'm anonymous and I'm planning on deleting my account eventually. I've tought about killing myself since I was 5 years old. The thing is that I have never been abused, nor do I feel that I have a severe mental illness. I have a difficult dynamic with my parents, I have personality problems like being terribly antisocial, and I get depressed often, but nothing like most people go through. In fact I believe I was probably blessed in the life I was given. But I have always thought about killing myself, I've made plans and at different stages of my life tought about doing it. I don't want to go into much detail, about my feelings. And I don't think I need anyone to give me advice. I just want to know if anyone out there is like me. Having this tought of killing myself for no apparent reason. I'm sorry my post is so long.
