CowardI think I'm sick.

Sometimes I get these bursts of ambition. I think I'm gonna teach myself a new instrument and get good grades this semester and move out the moment I graduate, I think that I can have a good life, too.

But that's rare nowadays.

Sure, I have my cliche tragic backstory and my pointless reasoning, my pathetic traumas and overreactions. But why I want to kill myself isn't the problem anymore. I've given up on trying to reason with myself. The problem is that I'm a coward who can never go through with anything, not even something I really fucking want to do.

Fifty aspirin, slashed wrists, maybe even a bad hour of sitting on a rooftop, we've all had those. But you step off the ledge, you don't cut deep enough, you go out in the street and faint. Sure, it's easy to tell yourself, "today's the day," to tell yourself, "I'm blowing my fucking brains out today," and you genuinely think you'll do it. You get your gun from your bedside drawer, you put the barrel in your mouth, it's cold and greasy and your finger is on the trigger. It's what you've been planning, right? But then you realise the entire world stands between that moment and the moment you've been planning. You put it back. Have a panic attack. Go on with your life like nothing happened.

I'm sick of being a coward. I'm sick backing out.

Maybe I can get another burst of ambition soon. Enough ambition to actually go through with the bullshit, once and for all.
