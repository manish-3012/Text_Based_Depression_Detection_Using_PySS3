Life always seem to go wrong for me no matter how hard I try. Staying alive takes so much effort.People always tell me to keep on trying and things will get better as long as I don't give up. But life always seem to go wrong no matter how hard I try. 

I have been battling social anxiety for years now, and failed at all the full-time jobs that I have taken up. So I went the freelance route but it has been laden with problems too. 

I wrote a few math assessment books for a publishing company based on the title they asked for, but they decided to change the title and structure of the books at the very last minute. The book became laden with issues (some questions were classified into wrong topics, the answer key had errors, the chapters were uneven, among many other problems). The worse thing was that when I pointed out the issues to them, they ignored most of my corrections and printed the books with my name on it. So now I have to live with books which have my name on them, but which I want nothing to do with. I take pride in my work and this problem has bothered me for more than 2 years. I have tried to occupy myself with other thoughts, but the issue kept coming back to me. 

Sorry for ranting about my problem, but I had a sleepless night and I needed to get it off my chest. I really wished I could leave this world so that I will no longer have to worry about work issues and dealing with these people.

I believe that there is no afterlife, so dying would be the greatest relief to me. The only thing holding me back are the two cats whom I love dearly. Still, I don't know how long I can hold on for. I guess I was never meant for life, for work, and for dealing with people.
