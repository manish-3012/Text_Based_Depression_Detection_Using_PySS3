My sister's 2nd suicide attempt in 2 months.My sister was born deaf. She can't speak or read lips and only uses sign language. She has been depressed pretty much her whole life ever since she was young. Now she is 17 years old and has said that she doesn't want to live past her 18th birthday. She prays to God every day for the ability to hear. She has been having suicidal thoughts since she was 16 and has a methodical list of ways to commit suicide. First time she attempted, she was hospitalized and put on a 72 hour watch. They said they would discuss a treatment plan for her, but never did and told her to stay out of school. A month goes by and she still hasn't been to school. She attempts again, and again another 72 hour watch. They can't even find a bed for her. I'm afraid once they release her, she will attempt again and be successful. There are no signs that she is getting better and the 72 hour hold is not working at all. I'm afraid she will die and her health care provider doesn't seem to give a shit. Nobody gives a shit. This post is our last resort. She gets released in 48 hours. I don't know what to do next.

I should also note that she suffers from extreme anxiety and doesn't have any friends.

Another note: she received treatment before but it was only for like a week at a center for teens. She hated it because they didn't provide a decent interpreter and she didn't get better. 

We need strong suggestions for places/treatment centers that would help a deaf suicidal person.
