I will never amount to anythingI'm in my second year of college. Finals have started, and grades are starting to come back. Last fall I got over involved with varsity sports and my grades suffered, but I didn't drop the sports teams until it was too late and my grades were almost irreparable. In the spring, I worked at it and got my GPA to a point where I'd be able to keep my scholarship, but it's not nearly as competitive as it needs to be for when I get to grad school. This semester to felt better about things, but after just getting back my biology final grade, I once again feel hopeless and useless. I go to UNC, and granted it's a tough school and the science classes are rough, but there are students here who have 3.8/3.9 GPAs taking the same classes as I do. Those are the kids that are going to get into grad school, med school, and law school, while I'll be stuck doing the runt work that nobody else has to do because I'm not good enough. 

I know this may be coming from a place of privilege, being that I go to a top university and I know I'm lucky to be here, but oftentimes I feel I don't belong here. I'm nowhere near as smart as everyone else and have no chance of getting into post-undergraduate schools when competing against other students in my class. 

My GPA is currently a 3.048, possibly getting up to a 3.130 after this semester. Last fall, it was a 2.878. Granted it's now much higher than it used to be, it's not good enough. 

Since starting college, I've been struggling. My grades are low, I have very few friends, and while I have a great support system, I always feel alone. I have GAD and PTSD to top it all off. I just don't think I can do it anymore. Everything's getting to be too much, my low grades prove to me that I won't be able to go anywhere after graduating, if I even get to that point, and I'll never amount to anything.
