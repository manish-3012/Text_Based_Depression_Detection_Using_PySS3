I survived my suicidal feelingsI have been feeling suicidal for a few days and feeling hopeless, I am glad I survived those days and the feelings did pass. I did see my therapist during one of those days which was quite helpful in helping me survive the strong emotions. I realized when I am suicidal I am often not thinking straight.. Hope this encourage some of you that suicidal thoughts will pass if you just try to go through the tough days / weeks..
