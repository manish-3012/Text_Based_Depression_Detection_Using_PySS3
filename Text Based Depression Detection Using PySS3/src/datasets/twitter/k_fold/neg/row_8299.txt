I don't know anymore.I'm really frustrated with life right now. I'm almost 19 and I feel like it's already over. I feel like dying every day. I hate everything about myself. My family is having financial trouble. I haven't graduated high school and I doubt I ever will. College is out of the question and even if I did end up going I wouldn't know what to do. Nothing makes me happy anymore. I haven't ever had friends and I never will. I'm horrible at everything. I have no talents or skills at all. I'm just a fat worthless sack of crap. I just wish everything would end. I want to disappear forever. I shouldn't have been born in the first place.
