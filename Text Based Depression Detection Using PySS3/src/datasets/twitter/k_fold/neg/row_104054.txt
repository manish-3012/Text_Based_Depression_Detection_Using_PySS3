stuck and angrycalling the suicide hotline doesn't work anymore. last time I called the guy just didn't say anything. he asked me what he could 'do' for me. what the fuck kind of question is that? I just need someone to talk to. i would talk and he didn't say anything. 

i can't call my school's after hours mental health line. 
they can only listen, like the suicide hotline, and they can't refer me their services because their services are short term and they say i need long term help. 

i tried therapy but my therapist started talking about how I should really try believing in god when she knows i'm an atheist because i respectfully made that abundantly clear and I think it's really scummy because you shouldn't proselytize to somebody who is vulnerable emotionally I wouldn't tell a suicidal Christian that there was no god for instance

i'm scared of trying psych meds because i don't want them to change my personality.

i don't like telling people about my problems because how they react is bullshit. not that i expect people to fix my problems, but i don't like the reactions i get. a friend of mine asked if i was going to be safe and started worrying themselves and they have anxiety so now I know not to tell them anything anymore. another person responds to my vague facebook posts in a way that tells me they want something from me. don't call me 'sweety,' the way you say it makes your intent abundantly clear. 

I haven't showered in like a week and I know I've got depression and OCD and I've got to run a meeting tonight at seven that I forgot about until now. I also have two part time jobs and I'm doing grad school. one of those jobs keeps me going but i might have to quit working there. if i quit working there i wont be able to afford my new therapist.

Also I want to check myself into a hospital, but my insurance will probably run out and also it's REALLY EXPENSIVE to check yourself in to a place for suicidal ideation and I can't afford it.

also I kind of want to fucking die but I'm too depressed to get out of bed all I do is watch tv all day so how can I go out and actually do the deed? i hate everybody's simplistic solutions I'm on the fifth floor of a tall building and I just want to jump out but I can't because there's a chance you can survive I wish I was in a fifty story. 

also i have no motivation to do anything i want to die.
