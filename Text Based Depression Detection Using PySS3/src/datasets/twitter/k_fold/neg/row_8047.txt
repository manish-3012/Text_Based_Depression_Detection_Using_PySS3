My young brother is suicidalMy brother is 11 and I just found out he was depressed and self harming with multiple suicide attempts for a year and a half. He did it at night when we all thought he'd go for a snack he'd try to hurt himself using a kitchen knife to his chest. 

We're a huge family with some of my siblings who were bullying him as well as some of his school friends. I admit I was a stupid sister and didn't support him all the time and neither did my mom since she worked a lot. I feel so hurt and frustrated knowing this all happened right under our noses. 

How can I approach him and help him without making him feel like a burden? I also don't want him to know that I knew. Do gifts matter anymore? The more I think about it I realize I am not as close to my brother as I thought I was. 

Please give me suggestions. I want to make his life easier and to not need to act in front of me and to trust me enough to openly talk about most of his issues at least.
