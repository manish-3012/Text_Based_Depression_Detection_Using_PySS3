Daily thoughts of suicideEveryday suicide seems like the best option to end my pain. 

Years of therapy have helped understand why I hurt but have not resolved the pain. Iâ€™m 53 years old, I have a job that pays well. I am 5 years and almost one month sober. I suffer from PTSD,  ADHD, depressive disorder, and other behavioral addictions. I constantly need approval from others in order to maintain any self esteem. I battle internal fits of rage triggered by mistakes made at work or fabricated memories of my neglectful, spiteful Mother and distant older brother. 

I have few meaningful friendships in my life. Iâ€™ve never had a meaningful relationship with a woman. Almost every sexual encounter has been a rare one-stand, or more usually a paid escort. This habit can be expensive so my sexual outlet had mainly been masturbating to porn. And, I suffer from erectile dysfunction that is physical in nature. I assume years of chronic masturbation have damaged me. 

This is no way for a man of my age to live and Iâ€™d just as soon end my life. 

I recently had major surgery. My surgeon wrote me prescriptions for a hydrocodone/tylenol pain killer and a muscle relaxer. I have barely used them. I have 76 of the hydrocodone tablets and a dozen of the muscle relaxants. 

I have had daily thoughts of taking them all once.

I think this would let me sleep and not wake up.
