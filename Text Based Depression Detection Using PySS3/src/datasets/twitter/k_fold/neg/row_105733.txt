Scared of being judged for killing myself??Itâ€™s currently around 7:00pm, I have done all of my research.. I know how i will die tonight and when but Iâ€™m very hesitant and i donâ€™t understand fully why i want to die.

My boyfriend and I broke up, and although I sometimes had suicidal thoughts before, it has never been quite as bad as now. 
I love him more than life itself and I know no one will ever love me as much as he did. He is my soulmate.

I feel like my life is over and I know that Iâ€™ll never be happy but.. Iâ€™m so scared, Iâ€™m scared of surviving the attempt. Imagine my family, the hospital bills and how awful my ex would think of himself. I donâ€™t want to witness hurting anyone.

Another silly thought is that Iâ€™m scared of being judged for killing myself, i donâ€™t want to survive and be seen as the girl who killed herself for a boy... i know, itâ€™s lame
