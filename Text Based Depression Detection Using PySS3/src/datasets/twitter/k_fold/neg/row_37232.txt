The last noteI've written dozens of suicide notes at this point. It used to be therapeutic, kind of. Not anymore. I've written the last one. That's the note I'm going to leave next weekend. I'm going to burn the rest of them, and I'm not writing another. Somehow it feels good to know that that will be the last note. To already know what the last thing anybody will hear from me will be. To know how I'm leaving things with the people around me. Fuck I'm kind of excited for next weekend.
