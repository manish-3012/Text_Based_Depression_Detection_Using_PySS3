i donâ€™t know anymoreI canâ€™t do this anymore, or maybe I can? I donâ€™t know anymore. I wouldnâ€™t care about my families feelings when I pass, if I pass. Or do I? I donâ€™t know anymore.  The amount of stress is putting me over the edge, I say this with no over exaggeration. Or am I? Is everything better than it really is and I just canâ€™t see it? I donâ€™t think so, I hurt everyday, I cry myself to sleep every night and I canâ€™t handle it anymore. My parents donâ€™t support my aspirations and dreams. I feel like I donâ€™t and canâ€™t live up to societies expectations of what a good student athlete should do. I canâ€™t remember the last time Iâ€™ve been happy.  Itâ€™s all a facade to please the people around me, they think everything is fine. But one thing I give myself credit for is that I always see things out to the end. Maybe something will come of all this, maybe not. I donâ€™t know anymore.
