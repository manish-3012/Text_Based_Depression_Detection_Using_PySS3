numb to all helphey guys i am planning to kill myself on january 15th because i dont want to ruin christmas  and new years for my family(i'm suicidal not a monster)and i'm numb to all forms of help because i already know it's true but its still not enough for me i just feel like i'm being loved just by default and that when i'm around friends at school i feel like i don't really belong there because i dont really go out with any of them and dont understand anything or know any of the people they're refrencing  and i feel like i'm just added space for just like maybe a joke or something i dont know and everything i'm interested in is weird to the community i'm living in and barely anyone gets it and really by no i'm just completely over it. so if anyone want to take a crack at helping me out in an unorthodox way have a go but i'm already set on it and going to do it
