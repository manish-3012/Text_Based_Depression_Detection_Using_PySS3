suicide/self harm questionMy friend tried to commit suicide and is in a coma now. It seems like he took a concoction of drugs. There was also some minor cuts on his arms and calf muscles. I presume this was some sort of self harming. 
One question that is baffling us at the moment, is that a blood pressure arm monitor was found beside him and it looks like it was being used before he was found. Can anyone explain what this could be used for in relation to suicide/selfharm?

Thanks,
