REPOSTING: Had a good appointmentSomeone is STILL downvoting me, so I have to repost this.

I just got back from the Psychiatrist and it had gone BETTER than I ever thought it would! I talked openly to the PA about the drinking and she said there is a medicine that stops cravings and also makes you sick if you ingest alcohol, but I said I really don't need it because the cravings aren't all that strong and I can resist them. She was very happy with me today--said I was nice and bright eyed and positive. :) Yeah I feel pretty darned good!

I would like to thank my friends here at SuicideWatch for being such a great community. I have found support here and I appreciate it greatly. 

To all my sisters and brothers who are suffering here: Please accept this gentle {{{hug}}} and know that if anyone needs me that they can contact me anytime. I know how it feels to be at the bottom of a dark and deep pit, looking up only to see more blackness. I have been there...and I can be back there tomorrow. I don't know. Right now I am feeling better, and I will focus on that and let tomorrow take care of itself.

So thanks again friends and I hope each of you has a better day!!
