Trying to find the positive in lifeI've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life. I've felt worthless for a long time. Let myself be emotionally abused by multiple exes that told me I was worthless or always made me feel like I wasn't good enough. Constantly hating myself for the way I look and just everything about myself. It's hard in my new relationship because every time we have a disagreement I get flashbacks of my ex leaving me. Never giving me a reason or making me feel like a piece of shit that no one would want. I have to convince myself that the same thing isn't going to happen. If I make a mistake or say something he doesn't like I know he will still love me but my anxiety and depression convinces me otherwise. Why would he love me when everyone I ever loved convinced me that I was unlovable? Why can't I just love myself enough to believe I'm good enough? Sometimes I think everyone in my life would be better off if I didn't exist. I get quiet and he tries to get me to talk about what happened to me but I'm worried he won't love me if I do. Why can't I just talk to him about it? He's never judged me. Has always made me feel loved so why can't I convince myself to tell him how much I've been hurt and abused? I still believe I don't deserve to be happy. I still feel worthless and unworthy of love. I hate myself and don't want to be alive..
