Iâ€™m shittyI shouldâ€™ve killed myself in high school Iâ€™m such a fool. Why did I ever think things would change? I am trapped by this body, by the name I was given, and by those who know that name. Easily forgotten when alive but difficult to forget when Iâ€™m dead. Why is that? Why canâ€™t I be forgotten completely? Why canâ€™t I erase my name and this body that came with it? How can I put together the right words to describe this pain... how to put it in simple but profound words. Sometimes words arenâ€™t enough. It hurts to know nothing waits for you when you wake up the next day. It hurts to know that youâ€™ve lived so many years for absolutely nothing. I used to hope something in my life would drastically change for the better, but now I know hope isnâ€™t a real thing and doesnâ€™t manifest itself like people think. Life is purely random and there is no reason behind anything.
