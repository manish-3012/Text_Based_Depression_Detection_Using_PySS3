Suicidal as a result of injustice and dismissal of my feelings.I suffered a traumatic incident long ago, but time has moved on so much and I never really recovered from it, I'm still in exactly the same place as I was then yet at the same time I'm a completely different person. The memories fade but the effect on my character and the way I am hasn't.

My family won't validate my feelings or accept that what happened was partly their fault and because of that refuse to talk about it or help me pursue legal action, if I do kill myself it will be partly as a protest that I'm not going to live my life just because that's the law, if the law refuses to accept that what happened to me is wrong.
