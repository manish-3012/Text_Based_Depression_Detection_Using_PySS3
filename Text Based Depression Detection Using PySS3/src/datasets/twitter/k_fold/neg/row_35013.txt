RequiemI'm sitting here in a McDonalds parking lot thinking of all the reasons not to drive as fast I can into the nearest solid object. There isnt any. Not a single one. For as long as I can remember I've been my own cheerleader. Climbing and achieving and clawing my way away from where I came from. I'm tired. I dont sleep. Food hurts. My health is failing. The stress is overwhelming. If I give up... there will be no requiem for me... so I'll just hum one for myself while I sit in a McDonalds parking lot.
