Isn't a suicide less tragic than a poorly lived life?Edit: Original post removed. It was written in anger. I'm glad I managed to breach the subject and get some helpful comments however.

A relevant quote from Alan Moore: "There are a frightening number of people who seem to have the urge not just to ignore the Self, but actually seem to have the urge to obliterate themselves. This is horrific, but you can almost understand the desire to simply wipe out that awareness because it's too much of a responsibility to actually possess such a thing as a Soul, such a precious thing. What if you break it, what if you lose it. Might it not be best to anaesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure. I think that the way people immerse themselves in alcohol, in drugs, in television, in any of the addictions that our culture throws up can be seen as a deliberate attempt to destroy any connection between themselves and the responsibility of accepting and owning a higher Self and then having to maintain it."
