Getting closerIt keeps coming back, I feel myself getting more comfortable with the idea of death. Iâ€™m separating myself from the things that are holding myself back. I have a decent amount of money in my savings, I have a promising career in a difficult science field and graduating in a few months. I have a few jobs lined up, and have the opportunity to move cities.

 But Iâ€™m separating these things from the idea that i want to leave here. I donâ€™t feel guilt that I will leave behind all of this and â€œcut it shortâ€ and you â€œnever know what will happen tomorrow.â€ Iâ€™m ready. This is what I want and my work ethic that has gotten me all the previous things, will get me this too. Iâ€™m working towards it. Iâ€™m ready.
