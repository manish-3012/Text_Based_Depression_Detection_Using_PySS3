Well my dad tried to kill himself 2 nights ago...Step dad to be exact.
but this guy is everything to me. I model myself after him, as strong as I've always seen him, even after his countless surgeries and PTSD. 
He tried threatened it once when he was drunk... but 2 nights ago I woke up to phone call after phone call of my mom crying saying she got woken by police and told he was "unstable". He was already in the ambulance and we knew NOTHING else.
He was checked in as a private patient and because they aren't married, (although been together 13 years) we couldn't find ANY info out.
Finally 12 hours later we hear from them... 
He took woke up from a dream of him not being able to afford us Christmas presents. The state took us all away. (2 of us are moved out and are over 18, but this is a dream.)
He took (estimated) 100 of his anti-depressants and wrote a note. 
He said that he was doing it for us, so we could have the money from his life-insurance and we could be taken care of. He then freaked out and call 911 on himself.
 The cops found the note and took it.  
I'm just at the BIGGEST loss. I have seen him go through more than one person ever should... and if my hero, the STRONGEST guy I know call fall so hard, I just don't know how I can do it.
I posted here 20 days ago... I'm still alive. I am thankful for all the support I got.
