Totally lostI hate to complain especially when people are worse off, but if I don't get it out it will eat me alive. Where do I start? I feel alone even when I'm with friends. There's only one person I feel comfortable talking to, she's my best friend and I've been in love with her for a while. Of course it's only one way. And I hate to complain to her even though she says she's there for me. I'm afraid she will get annoyed although she says she never will. I have no confidence, no self esteem, and no idea of how to meet new people. I'm nihilistic, apathetic, and am emotionally vacant except when I think of her. Death doesn't phase me, I've already confronted my own mortality a while back and feel like I should have died a long time ago. I think about ending my life multiple times everyday. The only thing keeping me here is knowing my family will mourn. I'm an alcoholic and I binge drink when I feel sad. I wish I didn't exist in the first place so there would be nothing to miss. I want to seek help but I'm afraid of being diagnosed with something. I'd rather it not be in ink. I'm no threat to anyone but myself. I'm tired of being alone and tired of feeling this way. If anyone has felt this way please tell me how to fix it. I will appreciate any feedback. Thanks
