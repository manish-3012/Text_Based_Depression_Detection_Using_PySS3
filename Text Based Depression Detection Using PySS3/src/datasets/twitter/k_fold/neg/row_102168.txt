I'm so close but I'm so afraid.I think I'm actually going to do it. Finally. But I'm scared because what if it goes wrong and I survive? What if they send me to a mental hospital? What if people treat me different? What if the people who are nice to me suddenly aren't? What if everything gets worse for me? I'm so afraid.
