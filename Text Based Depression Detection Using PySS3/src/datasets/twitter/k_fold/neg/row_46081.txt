My Ex girlfriend is depressed and a little suicidal. What should I do?Hi. My Ex girlfriend is depressed and suicidal.

I like here as a human being, but there are no feelings of love from my side anymore.

She now said, that she will (I'm paraphrasing) 'I will put an end to all this, this year.'

What should I do?
She has been in therapy. The therapy ended at a good point, but It got downhill again.
I think she should definitely try therapy again. But I don't know if she is going that road...
