Is this dumb?Itâ€™s super dumb but has anyone ever tried to kill themselves by ingesting everything they can find? Iâ€™m talking toxic stuffs like perfume, high dose of caffeine and vitamins and all the pills, pesticidal and other stuffs??

I will probably just throw up but i plan to keep going for a while and eventually drown myself or some shit
