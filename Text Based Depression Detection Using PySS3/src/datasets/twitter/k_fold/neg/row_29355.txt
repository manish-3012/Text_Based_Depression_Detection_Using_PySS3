I just wrote my suicide letter.Iâ€™ve been depressed fo most of my life. As an adult, I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. Iâ€™ve done a lot of fucked up shit on my compulsive states, Iâ€™ve been a bother to all the people around me because of how emotionally dependent I am. Iâ€™ve forced my friends and family through so much. Still I wanted to believe Iâ€™m strong for living through all the trauma and still managing to get a job, to take care of others, to still be an opinionated woman who stands for what she believes.
The past few days Iâ€™ve been extremely depressed. And my insecurities and fear of abandonment have been over the roof. Yesterday, I told my boyfriend that. He wasnâ€™t in a good mood (heâ€™s Bipolar) and was a little harsh. I got too worked up and said it was hurtful and that I helped him through his episodes, I just deserved the same. He said he couldnâ€™t deal, that he fell in love with a strong woman and thatâ€™s not what heâ€™s got, that I suddenly turned soft and he canâ€™t take care of me. He said some other terrible things, like I want a codependent relationship. It sounded a lot like he had been triggered and was not being himself, but he broke up with me. This person who said he loved me so much, just broke up with me. Now Iâ€™m a mess and firmly believe Iâ€™m just a weak piece of shit my family and friends would me better off without. 
I donâ€™t know what else to do. I guess Iâ€™ll hold on until tonight at least. But Iâ€™m pretty certain itâ€™s gonna happen this time.
