I am not cut out for this world help me pleaseAll I have accomplished since graduating high school 6 years ago is getting my heart dreams and trust broken. I've been abused and gaslight and raped and many of my loved ones are dead or terminally ill. I have always been viewed as being talented and intelligent but I don't do anything talented or intelligent these days or for years. I can't afford college, I can't afford rent. I am terrible at everything I do. Everyone is angry at me at my job and I jut hate myself so much. I am worthless. I have nothing to contribute to this world. I want to leave my job so so so badly but I can't because I am too poor to be without a job and doubt I can just get another one easily in this economy. I can't move back home because my parents don't have anywhere to keep me and they don't have running water at their house. I have nowhere to go and nowhere to turn. 
I hate so much about myself. I feel like I must have been a mistake. I am a terrible and worthless person. There's no place for me here or anywhere. I am a fundamentally broken person. I am a constant disappointment to everyone I know. I am a burden. A fraud. I am in so much pain and have been so mentally ill for so long I just can't take it anymore. What is the point of living in this realm when my own country couldn't care less about whether I live or die, I will never fit in or belong to any group, and life is a constant cycle of death and pain and suffering? I am a disgrace to my family for even feeling these feelings. I am a ridiculous waste of air and space. I don't know why anyone would ever want to be close to me. I am sure to die alone. I hate myself so much for being such a disappointment.
