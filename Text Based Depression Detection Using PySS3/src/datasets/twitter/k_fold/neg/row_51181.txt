Itâ€™s my decisionMy life has been shitty, like a lot of other peoples lives. 

Why is that the government can force me to stay around? Why is suicide ILLEGAL in some states? Thatâ€™s insane to me. People should have a right over their own body. To dictate what they do with it. I mean, my consciousness is stuck in here. Itâ€™s my decision. Itâ€™s my decision to end my own misery. 

Some people are so insecure of the idea that someone doesnâ€™t want to be around anymore... it just blows my mind. Suicide should be legal. It doesnâ€™t always â€œget betterâ€. We should have the option to take a drug and slip a way without botching ourselves or feeling tremendous pain.
