I don't know what to do. My mom blames me for wanting to kill herselfSo. First of all, I'm really sorry this is really personal and heavy. I don't expect you to even respond if you don't want to. I appreciate this.

 I'm having a lot of difficulties with my mom. She's very unstable right now and she's saying that it's my fault that she wants to kill herself. She took three of her pills last night, and almost the whole bottle.
 I have an incredibly uncomfortable and hard time showing compassion for my parents. At the same time I don't know if I love them anymore or care. They need my help though. I know that they won't be able to do everything without me. But I don't want this. I don't respect, love, or appreciate them enough to want to help them. They've created such a mess that isn't my fault. 

I've tried so hard, but after this move I just can't feel love for them.

My mom told me that if I'm going to be this kind of person that I should just pack my things and get out.
I have been wanting to not live with my parents for a very long time. I would love to have that opportunity, but, my morals. I don't know! They need my help, but I. Living here makes me depressed and anxious. I can't just abandon my parents though, can I? Am I responsible for them? Do I have to help them? I don't know.

They really try. But they already have so many problems and are so pressured and depressed.

I don't want to be here. I want to leave, but they need me. How could I leave them at such a time of need? It's so morally wrong to me. I'm so conflicted.
