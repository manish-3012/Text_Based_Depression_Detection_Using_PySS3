I don't see a justification not to off myselfThere's nothing here worth staying for in my life. I do have a younger brother I love dearly but what about me? Am I supposed to suffer for the rest of my days for no reason? This existence has been meaningless punishment and I'm so tired of it I just sleep all day. Perpetual pain and exhaustion is no way to live, I'm done with this sickness of a world. My time here has added up to nothing so I'd rather die and be rid of everything.

There's never been true happiness, only escapism for me. That's it. I am distraction. Maybe it's my cue to experience the final escape.
