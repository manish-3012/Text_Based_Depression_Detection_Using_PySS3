I'm worried about my depressed friend who hasn't had any contact with me or my other friends for nearly a monthSorry if this isn't the right place to post this.

TLDR at the bottom.

On 1st May my friend, we'll call him Sam said that my other friend, we'll call him Paul is depressed. Sam kept going on about Paul being depressed and then Sam left the group chat.

I was worried about Sam so I sent him a message asking what was going on, I was also worried about Paul. Sam did not reply to my message even though he'd seen it. Paul is fine, he said that Sam was probably high when he sent the message and we've been in contact often.

I've sent messages to Sam, trying to find out if he's alright, he's read them all but not replied. I tried calling him today but he didn't answer, so I left a voice message.

Neither Paul,  my other friend, we'll call him John or me have heard from Sam. 

I'm worried about Sam because for ages he's been saying he's depressed and joking about suicide. His brother has tried to commit suicide a few times. He also lost his job because of the current situation and his dog died. I know he's still alive because he's been reading my messages but I'm really worried about him.

I'm not very close with Sam, but John is. I don't know if John has tried to get in contact with him or not since he's been very busy.

I don't want to keep bugging Sam, but I also want him to know that I'm there for him. I'm honestly worried that he might do something like try to kill himself.

TLDR: My friend who is depressed and jokes about suicide hasn't been in contact with me or our friends for nearly a month. He left our group chat and didn't really explain why. I've been messaging him, he reads the messages but doesn't reply. I'm really worried about him and want to know what I should do and how I could help.

I'd really appreciate any advice. I just don't know what I should do.
