Everything I do with my life is a waste and it doesn't matter what I accomplish.There's two ways this life can go. Ending things early and sending all my potential down the drain. You would consider that a waste wouldn't you? Just cutting your life short and not living to your fullest. I would consider that a waste at least. 

The second way goes like this. I live my best life but everything I accomplish will disappear eventually. It won't matter it happened. Eventually my mark will be gone and there's no changing that. That's like spending hours cooking a meal then just tossing it in the trash. 

You ever just wake up and feel like crap and think I'm useless. Well in the big picture I am useless. I do nothing for humans. I know I can't hope to benefit anything as massive as the human race so let's go smaller. 

Looking at the bigger picture I was a waste but now that we narrow it I'm trapped. I can't kill myself because I'd be hurting people. Making others life worse but staying alive sends me through an endless torment. I'm stuck in a nasty cycle and I can't get out. 

"Meaning and solace aren't to be found in the heavens, but in the trenches of everyday living. We'll know everything, and then we'll be ok. We'll kill everything, and then we'll be ok. We'll forget everything, and then we'll be ok. We'll live forever, and then we'll be ok. We'll cling to everyone, and then we'll be ok. And even then we weren't ok. Because that's not how the game works."
