No point in staying aliveI don't see the point in life anymore. I don't really have anyone. My family doesn't care about me (they're emotionally abusive/neglectful). My best friend is locked up in an RTC and I know she'd rather be with her boyfriend than me anyways. (She's called him 3 times, on the days she promised me she would call me, and never ended up calling me.) My ex is the only person I ever opened up to and she left too. I lasted two days without her before I tried (and failed) to overdose. I don't feel like I can go back to school just to face my ex ignoring me and deal with having nobody to talk to. 

I'm in a different city for a festival, and the bridge I've always planned to jump off of is less than 5 miles away. I didn't come for the festival, I came because the bridge is here and jumping has a higher chance of killing me than pills.. 

My death wouldn't really affect anyone so I don't know why I shouldn't. Knowing me, I'll probably wuss out. I do know I'd regret it if I jumped, but four seconds isn't very long to think about it. But I also know that if I don't jump, I'll regret it later.

I don't see any point in being alive anymore. I just don't.
