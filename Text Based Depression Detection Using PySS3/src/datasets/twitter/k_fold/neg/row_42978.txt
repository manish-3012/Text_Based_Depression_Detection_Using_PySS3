An open letter to everyone hereI don't know who you are,  where you're from,  or anything like that.  I don't know what drove you to have these feelings and thoughts.  Maybe it was a relationship,  unrealistic expectations from family,  a divorce,  loss of a child or parent,  perhaps a job loss during the pandemic.  I don't know. 

I've been in your shoes.  I'd wake up every day pissed off because I woke up.  I would drive somewhere and actively wonder if I'd survive 80mph into a concrete bridge.  I even stood in cleaning aisle contemplating a purchase of bleach and ammonia.  I've been in your shoes.  I know the feeling of despair,  hopelessness,  not being good enough,  etc. 

I want you to know that despite the current feelings you have,  you matter to someone.  They may already be in your life or you haven't met them yet but trust me,  you matter.  

You are stronger than you realize.  You can get through this,  you might need counseling or meds but  those aren't crutches,  they're tools that will guide you to a better you.

You got this!
