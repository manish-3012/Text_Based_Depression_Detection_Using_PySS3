I don't know what to do I want to dieI really want to go to someone sit with them and just cry my heart out to them and just tell them about everything I cant do anything I am the most stupid useless and shitty person to have existed I have these 2 people that I can cry to and who will listen to me but I don't want to keep on troubling them again and again and even they have problems to deal with i feel really empty inside and i am having a hell lot of temptations to cut my wrist and i will probably do it tonight when everyone in the house is a sleep and i have school tomorrow and i will just hide it with my sweater
