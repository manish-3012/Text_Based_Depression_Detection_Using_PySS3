Numb all overI feel nothing now. The drugs dumb the sorrow. The knife lets me know im alive. Sometimes i want to feel so bad i almost drive my head through a wall. I JUST WANT TO FEEL. 

Maybe i just need space, maybe i need to do something thrilling. But, when i lay to rest, insomnia hits while i am obsessing over death \(OCD\). When i wake up, im mad at the sun for waking me up and reminding me that im still here on earth. 

I just want to fly, i just want to be free. And nobody wants to help me unless they think that im dying. Like the times when im not actually physically dying, where are they then? Growing up just shows how ugly this world is. Im so close to the edge..

but ill be fine..
