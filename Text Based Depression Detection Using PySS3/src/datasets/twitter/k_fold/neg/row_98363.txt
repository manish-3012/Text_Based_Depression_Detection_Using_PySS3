Nothing fucking mattersDoes anyone else have a view similar to mine?

I'm 20 years old and in college as a biochemistry student on the track for medical school. I've got a 3.7 GPA right now, and everything feels completely fucking moot. I have a lot of happy moments, but I have even more bad moments. 

I view our (humanity) existence as an anomaly on this tiny speck of dust, known as Earth, hurdling at several thousand miles per hour in space. We're all bound to die eventually. Humanity will be wiped out in the future, and there will be almost no trace of our existence afterwards. Even then, the probability of other life finding our remnants is infinitesimally small.

There is no God, and there is no afterlife as far as I know. I can't go living life hoping that I'll be happy or still in existence once I'm dead. I can't force myself to believe in some crap like that without good reason.
