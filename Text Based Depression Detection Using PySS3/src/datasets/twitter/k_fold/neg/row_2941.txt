Lost and I feel like my life is overI was accused of something I did not do, my wife thinks I cheated on her and doesn't trust me anymore. I have nothing else in life and no where to go. I sat there with the gun in my hand for 3 hours before crying myself to sleep last night. 

Dont even know why I bothered calling out of work today and tomorrow... I haven't eaten all day either. The only thing stopping me ironically is my fear of death. I'm terrified this might be what finally pushes me over the edge...
