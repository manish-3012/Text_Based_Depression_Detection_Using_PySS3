SavedSo I went to the parking deck I chose today and couldn't bring myself to do it because there were some kids nearby and I didn't want them to see me jump...i then got the idea to go buy a camping knife and go to my favorite hiking trails and end things that way. I went off trail a ways near a group of dead trees and was ready to do it. I decided to turn my phone back on and message a few friends for a final goodbye. One I had already seen in person this morning and we talked and cried and hugged before we parted ways. That friend called and asked if I really wanted to do this and he'd come get me. While I still have issues to get through I'm really glad I didn't end things. Sitting in the ER now waiting to be admitted feeling much calmer.
