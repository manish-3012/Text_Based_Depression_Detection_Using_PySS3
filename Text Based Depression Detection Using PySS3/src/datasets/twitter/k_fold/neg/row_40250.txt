How should i do this?Idk how to start...
Hm, im 19 and i just want to die. I think iâ€™ve been depressed all my life but it really hits me when i was like 17-18... last year i tried to take my own life but i didnâ€™t work and i finished in psychiatric hospital for 6 weeks... i thought i was healed but i guess iâ€™m not... i lost my grandfather the summer after my attempt, he took his own life by h*nging himself... it was hard to see his body at the hospital but life must continue, right? 
I started to Â«Â live againÂ Â» but I started crying again, wanted to die by the end of the year and i dropped school...
Now im working, due to covid19 it was really hard.... i started to take medecine again in february because i was in a really bad mind and my psychiatrist didnâ€™t want to me to go back to the hospital... 
in april, I started to feel really really bad: no energy, feeling empty inside, i didnâ€™t feel my body moving, i wasnâ€™t able to think, i didnâ€™t remember my name, my identity, i didnâ€™t who I was.... 
so i was put on a leave by my doctor... 
it was good, i can relax myself, sleep, see my gf....
But im doing crazy nightmares: i dream that i want kill people, im going crazy bcz i canâ€™t talk to my psychiatrist cause she isnâ€™t available, dreaming that I hang myself.... 
itâ€™s so strange and so real at the same time... should I do it? Iâ€™m really tired of thinking abt everything: am I enough to my family and my girlfriend? Am i worth to be alive in this world? Will I have a future? WHO THE FUCK AM I? Iâ€™m not perfect and imperfect people shouldnâ€™t be alive, right?
My mind is so fucked up 
I want to hurt myself, I want to disappear 
I hate myself to the point when I was looking at myself in the mirror I wanted to puke, cut parts of my body, cut my entire face, burn myself
I know i canâ€™t do that, my mother is depressive and my grandmother might be too and my gf is depressive too 
Thereâ€™s so much on my mind
I really want to disappear 
Am I even real? I donâ€™t fucking know, i might be an invention, full of lies and my body is just an empty shell.....
Idk why Iâ€™m writing this.... the more I think abt killing myself and the more Iâ€™m attracted to this.. my heart and mind are thinking that it is a good thing to do... but idk....
Idk what to do guys....
Sorry if there are some spelling errors, im not english native...
