Life is Ilussion and lost hope.Power feeds the soul.

But not all of us have it within our reach. 

Desolation. Loneliness. powerlessness. Lacking. Dissociation. Dissatisfaction. 

All that posseses your body at times might feel all bad. Only darkness. Only void.

Then there are those of us who have fallen even deeper into the pit. Our bodies husked with horns of death, rejection, abuse, lies, and hate.

There is no "sometimes." 

The will breakers are with you always.

"Why can't I make someone care?"

"Why does darkness chose me?"

"Am I just not worth anything?"

Life is here to bring us pain. And it has made that very clear. 

Hope is a distant dream locked behind doors to which there is no key. 

No amount of sacrifice. No amount of mourning. No amount of forgiveness nor predisposition for suffering will help you find it.

The will broken's resolve is thin.

But so is the foundation of this reality. 

That is why so many of us with to escape it, and why others stand at laugh at your pain.

Destiny has not favored you. 

Nor have the ones you loved most.

The pangs of reality crush your heart, mind, and would one by one. 

A future would be a luxury.

So would a spec of hope.

No more suffering, there would be.

No more lies.

No more hate.

No more disappointment.

No more tears.

No more punishment.

No more void.

Noore laughing at my pain. 

No more frowning upon me.

Death is fresh, death is pure. Death greets and never abandons. Death doesn't lie, and it doesn't feel. 

Life steals, cheats, lies, corrupts, and tortures. 

More pain is more life. Less life is more peace.
