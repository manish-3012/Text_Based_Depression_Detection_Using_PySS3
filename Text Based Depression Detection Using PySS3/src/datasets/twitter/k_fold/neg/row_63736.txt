For a suicidal friend: Can a suicide attempt and suicidal tendencies/severe depression be enough for a doctor to approve short-term disability?Hi /r/suicidewatch, I'm hoping you guys can help me.

I myself am not suicidal.  However my roommate, who is also one of my closest friends, is.  He attempted to OD on sleeping pills the sunday before last.  Since then, he has told myself and other friends, and is taking time off work.  The reason he has taken time off work is because his depression and subsequent suicide attempt stem from heartbreak...and he works at the same place as the cause of said hearthbreak, if you catch my meaning.

He can transfer to another location within the same town, but hasn't managed it yet.  He wants to go on short-term disability while he gets himself back together, gets therapy, and works on the transfer to another store.

He has an appointment with a doctor tomorrow, and he's hoping the doctor signs off on his FMLA paperwork.  He has way too much hope for this, IMO, and I'm really afraid of what's going to happen if the doctor refuses and my roommate has to go back to work at the same place.

This leads to my question:  *If a person has attempted suicide, and is still suicidal, would a doctor approve FMLA for short-term disability?*  I've never heard of people getting it for severe depression and suicidal tendencies, and I'd like to have an idea of what to expect next.  It's been an extremely rough week-and-a-half for me, trying to support and help him.  I've broken down more than once since I found out about his attempt.

tl;dr - Can a suicidal person get short-term disability?  How likely is a doctor to sign off on the paperwork?
