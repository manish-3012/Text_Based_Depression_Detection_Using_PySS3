Committing suicide soonAfter much deliberation, I've decided upon a date and method to commit suicide. The events of each day are inexorably driving me to the edge, and I don't have much time left. 

My post/comment history perfectly chronicles my downward spiral. It's a window into a turbulent soul. 

Farewell, everyone. I hope you find peace and solace in your lives - I've scoured heaven and earth trying to find it, but to no avail. 

I've capitulated to my demons.
