Suicidal when aloneIdk if other people feel this way but I struggle to keep myself together when alone for too long. And by too long I mean a couple hours will really start to weigh down on me. It can go one of two ways usually.

This morning for one example, as my bf was about to leave for work, I began to panic before I was even left alone bc I am scared. I will start to hyperventilate/cry, essentially have a minor panic attack bc I guess I psych myself up. 

Or sometimes I will be fine if left alone but only for a short amount of time in which I feel this desire to be alone as well. I have to want some private time usually to just be fine with it. But its very short and usually only to gather my thoughts and emotions or sometimes lye down for a bit. I get tired and exhausted if at social functions and often want to leave and go home. 

I hate myself and hate my private time so why do I do that if I am so lonely.

Complaining at all feels shitty bc at least I have a boyfriend who I see. We live together and sleep together but just the thought of him going out starts to make me panic. Not because he is with other people but because I know unless I tag along I will be alone. 

Friends? I can only take them in microdose. I eventually want to push them away and sulk alone to my miserable headspace. I don't wanna burden anybody.... so i just keep quiet until the panic is too much and I become manic almost. I feel crazy sometimes with rage or heartbreak over stupid shit. Too damn sensitive or something. If I am with people though... or preferably with my boyfriend who is also my best friend, I at least feel SOME purpose. With people my biggest issue is enjoying the things they enjoy and also not wanting to hide under a rock within a couple hours.

Im just a spoiled brat or something who needs things her way. Doesn't know what she wants but knows plenty of what she doesn't. I really fuckin hate myself
