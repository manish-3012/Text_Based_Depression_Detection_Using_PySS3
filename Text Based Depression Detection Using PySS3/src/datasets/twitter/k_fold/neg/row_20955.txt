Why do I feel so worthless, even though I'm living a good life?I don't know why I feel so tired every day as if I just want to end it. I don't even have a mean mom or dad, I just want to die. I cant' sleep anymore, I don't know why? Why do I feel so down, when I am living, what others would call, a good life?
