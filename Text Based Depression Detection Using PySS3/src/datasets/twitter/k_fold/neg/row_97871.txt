I really need to talk to somebody.There is so much going on and I canâ€™t talk to my friends because I know that Iâ€™m going to start screaming at them. One minute Iâ€™m mad and the next I feel guilty for being mad. Last night I had a call with one of my friends and I started screaming one of my biggest problems at them that Iâ€™ve kept a secret for awhile because I lost control. I just really need to talk, Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll be able to make it through the night.
