I'm so supposed to start seeing a therapist soon because of my depression and suicidal thoughts, but I can't tell anyone one of the main reasons i'm depressed because its too embarrassing and pathetic to talk about.I'm on my own for this one. Nobody can know about this. So i'm in grade 12 right now and I have crush on a girl in one of my classes. I hate it because I can't stop thinking about her even though 99.99% chance that i'll never even have a chance with her. I say this because i'm only 5'7 and shes at least 2 inches taller than me. My face is also covered in acne and i'm socially awkward. That plus my social anxiety is not a good combination. I'm not very good with people in general. She on the other hand is popular and beautiful. And I think she might have a boyfriend but I haven't confirmed that yet. My already low self-confidence is zapped whenever i'm around her. I've barely even talked to her either. I hate myself every day for being a pathetic coward. I just feel empty, lonely, and depressed all the time now. I know I should just stop thinking about her and move on, but I just can't for some reason. It's messing me up inside and consuming my mind. I used to enjoy going to history class. Now I just hate myself every second that i'm in there. I hate mysel. I'm so fucking pathetic.


Edit: Only I care about my problems I guess.
