I always thought I'm strong enough to fight this feeling, but I guess I'm not.I never thought I will make a post in this subreddit. I never thought I will have suicide thoughts anymore, it's been a while I haven't feel this way, totally frustated and heart broken. I survived a few suicide attempts years ago and I told myself that I'm strong, I'm brave, and I will never have this feeling again. It's ironic how I became one of the redditors who initiate monthly rant/rage thread and count your blessings thread in my regional subreddit to spread the awareness of mental health and encourage the others to stay positive. It's ironic to see that I'm the one who needs help now.

I feel betrayed by the person I trust the most. I feel all my hard work and dreams are gone. It's been a week, I can't spend a day without crying, my chest feels heavy, it feels like being stabbed. A huge fight last week let my eyes wide open to see the truth that I've been living in a series of lies for years. This reminds me of an episode of HIMYM where everyone found a dirty truth in each other and you can hear the glass shattered. That's how it feels like, but in my case, it wasn't because you found out that your SO likes to chew loudly like Lily or singing about whatever he's doing like Marshall. In my case, I finally realized that I've been fed with false hopes and fake dreams.

It hurts.
