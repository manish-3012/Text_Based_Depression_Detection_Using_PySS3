Im not going to get a soon life am I?What's the point of being alive if all i'll ever be is a guy sitting alone at a desk. I got bored of video games by forcing my self out of it to try to meet people, now i'm just sitting here doing nothing half the time and feeling like killing my self for every thing I do or say. 

Still waiting on going college, not even applied yet, nobody to talk to, even when I get there I never been good at school. After that i'll just be alone again. Now days every time I see someone I try to not keep contact because i'll just end up cracking in front of them someday. 

I cant get treatment because my dad just doesn't seem to believe a word I say about depression it seems like, I left my a year ago, emptied my bank account. Don't have a car. looked for a job for 3 months. 

Depression is probably the biggest to off for anyone and I just can't get out of it, because im lonely and feel totally stuck in life. Everything iv tried just exhausted me more.
