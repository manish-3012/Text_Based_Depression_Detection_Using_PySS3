Gradual descent into madness.So i've been suffering with this my whole life.  
Like most of you, I can't ever remember being happy.  
Even as a kid I was quiet and neurotic - finding escape in books and videogames.  
Started cutting as a teen which helped for a bit until people noticed (why do others care what I do with my body), forcing me into therapy and lithium-based anti-depressants.  
After a few years of being a placid zombie I got off that and started self-medicating.  
So far i've been through addictions to alcohol, weed, heroin, spice and meth.  
Although I am obviously messed up i'm generally stable and can usually support myself but once or twice a year I quit all my jobs, break up with my SO if I happen to have one, and destroy my brain until I feel like I need to fix it again.  
This time it's different though.  
I've quit the best job i've ever had.  
I've broken up with one of the few people I can honestly say I love.  
I'm about 8 grand in debt, but this isn't about debt, I don't regret spending that money as I've travelled the world and tried pretty much every chemical under the sun in a desperate yet futile quest for happiness.  
I just don't think it's for me, whatever the reason, society, a chemical imbalance from shitty genetics, it doesn't matter I cannot escape.  
Getting my shit in order (wiping phone, harddrive email etc) so just before sunset I'll drop a few hits of acid, head to the beach and hang myself from a tree.  
This is going to hurt a lot of people but I just can't do it anymore.  
So long, and thanks for all the fish :)
