I went for a walk in Kabul, Afghanistan (cont)http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/pgr56/so_i_leave_to_afghanistan_soon/

I got all of 3 blocks before being stopped by Nat'l Police.  Found out when I went to "bail" myself out that ex forged checks and cleaned out my account.  I'm back and leave again in March after her trial.  

Nothing is better.  I am more numb ...
