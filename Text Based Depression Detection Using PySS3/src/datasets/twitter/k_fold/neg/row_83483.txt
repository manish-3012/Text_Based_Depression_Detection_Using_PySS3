Need serious help I don't know what's real anymore.I just don't. I fucking did it. I tried to jam a fork I had in my room into the socket, but I blinked. Then I blinked again, and I was near the socket, fork nowhere to be found. A minute earlier than it was just a little while back. I'm confused. I think I'm hallucinating. Please. I'm confused. I don't know what to do. I tried to go to bed, but I can't.
