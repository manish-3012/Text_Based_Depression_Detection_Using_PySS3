I want to, but I can'tI really want to die. I want to hurt the people who hurt me and who are supposed to love me. But I don't feel loved. 

But I can't do it. I'm too weak. I tried to cut myself, but even that did not work, the knive was sharp. I couldn't do it. 

Why? I want to end this, but I can't. I don't even know whether I have a depression or not. My parents don't take me seriously when I talk about my feelings, and they tell me that. I don't know what to do anymore. Only two people know that I want to die. First, my sister. But I told her I won't do it. 

Then my best friend. But I only said it by the way. She probably didn't even notice. But without her, I would probably be dead already. 

I'm used to be a very happy person, but sometimes, now more often, I have these feelings. 

Smiling does not feel right anymore. I am afraid of the future. I googled 'best suicide method' a lot. I just don't know what to think. I feel so alone and empty. Why do I stand up every morning? To finish school, get a good job and earn a lot of money? In the end I'll die anyway. Without being happy. 

That's just my thoughts, not my story. That would be too long and I don't think it matters a lot if I tell it or not. 

Thanks for reading. I'm feeling a little bit free after writing this. Please take me seriously. Only one time.
