How to deal with guilt feelings on own suicide?Each day I'm getting closer and closer to that day when I'm finally going to kill myself. But I don't want to make my family feel bad. I know that's impossible, but I'm really done with life.

I need to say that we have a fine relationship, although I've never told them how I really feel (actually to nobody).

How do you deal with this feeling? Once I'm dead I couldn't really care (duh) but that will probably devaste them. 

The only thing I've thoght about is telling them is not their fault (even tho they unintentionally helped a lot), as well as telling them how much I appreacite them, but after that I have no idea.
