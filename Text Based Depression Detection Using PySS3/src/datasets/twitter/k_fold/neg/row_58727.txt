Dealing with Pssd for 8 years...I'm thinking to end it all. I'm looking for ideas of how to do it, surely and painless. 
I'm 22, I haven't felt horny for 8 years because of s
SSRI and I miss it so much, and my life feels empty since then.
I'm having troubles of learning new stuff and commiting to it. 
My parents pressure me to study and I feel clueless because my lack of hobbies and passion.
I am in a first happy relationship that I have difficult to enjoy because of my insecurities. (I feel like I'm not pretty, smart or good enough for him).
And this feels like I'm a weak bitch but right now I am overwhelmed by all of this.
