Girlfriend threatened suicide...Note: The situation is under control. This post is more of a learning experience.

My girlfriend messaged me on Skype, saying she was going to kill herself. My tablet had died, so I didn't get the message until 3 minutes after she turned her phone off. I panicked, and proceeded to call 911. I would like to point out, we live in different states, and I was not aware of her address, or town she lives in, but rather a big town near her. Dispatch had told me to call the town near where she lives. They redirected me to one of two possible towns, only to be sent right back to the big town's police. Somehow, with the very little information we had, they were able to locate her address. Thankfully, she was okay, and she is doing much better.

The point of this post is to show that no matter how little information you have, it can be enough to prevent a tragedy. So don't give up if you only know a name and a general location, because as it turns out, that's all you need to save a life.

EDIT:  If by some odd chance, a dispatcher is reading this post, I want to thank you for all that you do. Dispatch never gets enough credit, but they deserve it. What you do is amazing, and you are heroes for it. Thank you so much.
