Finally decided, its such a reliefI'm sorry if this is the wrong sub, I'm new to Reddit and I'm not sure how everything works. (Also, English is not my first language)

I just need to someone out there to know that I want to die. I've found two ways that I feel comfortable with and now I just need to choose. 

I have many reasons, many traumas starting from when I was 5 years old, but being broken up with recently just pushed me over the edge and now I've finally decided. I can't stand being the reason our relationship ended. I can't stand knowing that we both still love each other but can't be with each other because I fucked up. I think I'm going to do it sometime next week, maybe Friday. Right now I'm in bed with my ex (we're still friends, no sex, and he's asleep). I wanted to see him one last time, just be close to him and hug him one more time. 

A, if you ever see this: you are the most wonderful person I've ever known. It's been an honour to be your girlfriend these past two years, you have taught me so much and made me a better person. You've shown me what real love is. Thank you. I love you infinitely, now and forever. 

Also, thanks to Reddit for creating a space where people such as myself can talk about this sort of thing. It's really a relief to be able to be honest about this.
