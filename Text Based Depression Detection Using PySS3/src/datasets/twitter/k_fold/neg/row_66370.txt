Iâ€™m here, with her. Left my house and my state for probably the last time.I made the trip. Iâ€™m here, at her house. 15 hour bus ride down. I said good bye to my long time partner. She didnâ€™t know it was likely goodbye forever. Didnâ€™t even give her a last kiss. Not on purpose. We just both forgot. I feel bad about that. 

Left my state. The only place Iâ€™ve lived for my entire adult life, all 23 years as an adult. It was surreal thinking Iâ€™d never see the red hills or the mountains or my desert again. But that place stopped being home a while ago, so it wasnâ€™t as hard as I thought it would be. 

And now Iâ€™m here. In her house. In her bed this second. But nothing happened. We just slept. Her in brand new, full pajamas. The night was eventful. These were stolen kisses and very intentional flashes of parts of the body that should have undergarments by didnâ€™t. And it was almost enough to rekindle a little hope. But then we barely touched all night in bed. And there was no shower together this morning. She said no when I asked. And she dressed in the tiny room that contains the master shower.

I donâ€™t know what the fuck is going on. Itâ€™s so hard to read and I just want answers. But I canâ€™t push it or Iâ€™ll ruin everything. So I get to lay here, in limbo, for the next couple of days until I can get er entirely alone, to find out if Iâ€™m dying on Friday or not. Itâ€™s possible I have to wait until Monday night, after sheâ€™s been at work all day. I think Iâ€™ll go crazy if I have to wait that long.

At this point Iâ€™m sure Iâ€™m going to be killing myself this Friday. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s no hope left. But I know me, the not knowing for reals is just brutal. Just mind-breakingly awful.

Wish me luck, both with her and with staying sane till I can figure things out.
