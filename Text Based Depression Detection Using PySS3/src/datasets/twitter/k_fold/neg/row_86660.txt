This autistic idiot is done. Signing out.I'm done guys. The only person in my life is leaving. I'm failing my classes. No help, support, concern, nothing.

I'm autistic so I suck at communicating. That's why she's leaving.

I've wasted space, resources, time. There's nothing here for me. 

It gets better. The doctors think I have cancer! So I'm probably going to die anyway! I'll kill myself and make it a spectacle so everyone knows this is not what you do to people. That's the only thing I can offer to the world.
