What's happening to me? Why try anymore?I've been depressed for about 2 years, I'm having counselling and I'm on medication, I was getting better until a few weeks ago.

I started having weird things happen to me, I wake up covered in sweat, I hear muffled voices in my head, I see flashes of light which aren't there, I can't eat or sleep properly, I can't even leave the house any more. I'm feeling as bad as I did when I first got depressed. I never feel "right".

Now I'm borderline suicidal, I'm getting worse and no matter what I do I'm not getting better. I'm always exhausted, burned out, I just have no energy to put up with this shit any more.

It was hard for me to even write this, I just feel weak, no fight left in me, no energy. I'm so lonely, the only people who would care if I died would be a few people on the internet. I just want to disappear, be at rest. People say "it gets better" but not for me, thing are going down hill.

I don't know how much longer I can put up with this.
