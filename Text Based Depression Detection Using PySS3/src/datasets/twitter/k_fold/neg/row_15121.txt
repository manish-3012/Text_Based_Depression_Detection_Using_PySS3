Unemployment is making me want to end it allIt's been two years and I still can't find a job and I'm starting to lose it all. Everyday I feel the urge to end my life because of feeling like I'm an absolute failure. I feel like I'm a burden to my family and an embarrassment. I'm so, so tired and I don't know what to do.
