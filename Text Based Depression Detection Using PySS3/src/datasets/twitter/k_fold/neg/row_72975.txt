life fucking sucksI don't know why I am even writing here , probably because no one in my personal life cares. For the past two years or so , life has been a fucking trash can . I try to be myself , do the things I want to do , the things I like , but it seems like I have to fit to other people's standards. because Id rather read a book than play basketball I'm a fag. because I wear the kind of clothes I wear , I constantly get ridiculed and judged . never once was a woman ever attracted to me. im honestly debating over becoming homosexual because maybe a goddamned man would calm my loneliness , a better trade than looks or sexual feeling. hell maybe just taking a gun and blowing out my brains would be a better choice than going through the effort , because no matter how much I do , I can't get any emotional satisfaction. ive started abandoning my musical tastes , because they're not conforming to what is going to impress someone. I've played guitar since the 7th grade , but I've just started taking pictures and posting them to Instagram rather than actually playing it. 

the world we live in is a intolerant piece of shit, and I don't want to be part of it. I've spent the last how many fucking years doing what is popular , what will have society acknowledge me
