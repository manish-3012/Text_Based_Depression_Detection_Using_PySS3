I feel like a worthless &amp; hopeless idiot.I'm three years into university and I still doubt myself. My classes are getting harder as I progress further into my major. I know what I want to do but my mentality is awful and I don't see myself graduating because I have little to no hope for myself. I'm so far behind, which doesn't help. I feel like I'll be here forever.

I have a long history with depression, anxiety, OCD, and suicidal thoughts. Everything is being treated and I've been in so many in- and out-patient programs and I always get better for a little while. New medicine changes only work for so many years. I have a therapist that is great but I can only see them during my breaks... which is months at a time until summer. On-campus therapy is garbage here and my insurance is military and most places don't accept it. I feel like a lost cause.

I don't really want to die yet but I think that I will before this semester is over. I just feel hopeless and pathetic -- stupid. I have so much to look forward to and so many reasons to live. I should be so grateful for the opportunity to go to school with it being 95% covered financially... but I can hardly get out of bed, let alone go to class. Dying means not having to worry about any of this and that sounds ideal right now. I'm so tired of worrying.

Does anyone else feel this way? How do you cope and motivate yourself to keep going?
