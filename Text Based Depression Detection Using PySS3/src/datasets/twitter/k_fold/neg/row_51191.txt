ll Hope Has Left My BuildingI'm not sure where to even begin. I'm 44 years old, and have spent half of those years with he greatest woman I could have hoped to have met. I raised her two sons from ages 2 and 3, an we had one of our own. That kid has been my rock.

I have struggled with depression for most of my life, and have sadly taken out my frustrations by yelling a lot, and have been miserable for years. My guilt over that is all-encompassing. I'v been so clouded by my depression that I couldn't see the good... nay, GREAT things in my life, and have pissed them all away. On my sons 13th birthday, my wife bluntly said that she wants a divorce. No therapy, no counseling, no discussion. 

I have pent a month seeing a therapist, attending Church groups, and even being supported emotionally by my great friends... Yet nothing can lift me. 

This isn't a cry for attention... I'm to the point of ending it all tho week. I've tried giving it three days and more, but it simply isn;t worth carrying on and bringing my dark cloud around those I know who can at least feel happiness. 

What I am asking for, I suppose, is a coping mechanism, something; ANYTHING. I see no future for me, and have the tools in place. Wednesday is zero day, and it's odd to finally have something to look forward to.

I only ask because of my son and my Father. I can't begin to imagine their dismay, but bringing MINE around isn't healthy either.
