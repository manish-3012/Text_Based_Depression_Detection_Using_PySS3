Why I cutI cut in an attempt to feel something
I cut in frustration of not being good enough
I cut in hopes that somebody will notice and help me
I cut in hopes that a may hit a vein and bleed out
I cut to feel the cold steel against my arm
I cut in anger at myself
I cut because it is an addiction
I cut for physical proof of what's going on in my head
I cut to cope with loneliness
I cut in sadness
