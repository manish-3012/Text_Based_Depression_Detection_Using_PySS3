Does taking a break really help?For the past 5 or 6 years I have wanted to kill my self. There has not been a week when I havenâ€™t thought about ending my life in multiple different ways. One of the main reasons I hold on is the thought that itâ€™ll get better (the main reason is to avoid hurting the people around me). But in the process of holding on and trying to live a â€˜normalâ€™ life in spite of my suicidal thoughts, the extra stress, disappointment, anxiety and fear that comes with it make me want to die even more. 

Iâ€™m still young and living with my parents, so I have considered the option of taking time to sort my mental health out before committing to school/a career but will I end up losing out in the end? Iâ€™m afraid that by taking the extra time to improve myself, Iâ€™ll be left behind by my friends and family around me . 

Have any of you taken a break to sort out your head? Was it worth it? Does the time that you lose really bother you in the long run? Every day it gets harder and harder to get out of bed and pretend to be content with my life to please those around me. Everyday I get the glaring thought of death and killing myself. Right now Iâ€™m trying to decide if I should wait for the future, or just end it now.
