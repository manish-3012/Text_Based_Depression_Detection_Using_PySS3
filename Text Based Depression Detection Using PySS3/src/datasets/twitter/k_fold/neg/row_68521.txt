This is itI am doing it. Ending it. My boyfriend of 5 years doesnâ€™t even acknowledge my desire to end my life. He ignores my kind attempts to ask for help. He turns off his phone and disappears for days at a time when I am struggling. Itâ€™s almost as if he doesnâ€™t care. He tells me things like â€œyouâ€™re fineâ€ and thatâ€™s it. I am done. I canâ€™t do this anymore.
