I have almost gotten to the point where I don't care about who I will hurtThe times when I feel best are when I am asleep. I have wonderful dreams of a better life. Then I wake up and I feel like dying. I pushed away the girl I liked and my good friend by telling her I liked her. Now she doesn't want to talk to me. I have no one to talk to, and I have a razorblade that I am considering using to try cutting myself. Not killing myself yet, mind you. I have bruised my hand today with the amount of wall punching I have done. I deserve the pain because I am a worthless pile of trash who needs to die. Physical pain is also 1000X better than this horrible emotional and mental pain. I can't get my mind off of it, and I can't get any work done. I'll probably go into work tomorrow completely unprepared, but I don't care anymore. I want to die.
