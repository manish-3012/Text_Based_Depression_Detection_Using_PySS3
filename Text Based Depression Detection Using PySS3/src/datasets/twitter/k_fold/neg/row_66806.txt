I've been pushed too far.I've posted here before and have been helped tremendously. But now I've been pushed too far. The woman i loved cheated on me 6 times and once with my best friend. Now they're together and i don't want to see my get hurt but in the back of my head i do. She only does things (flirting wise) when I'm around and it kills me. Now I'm stuck with this evil feeling of betraying my best friend like he did to me. What makes it worse is that i know i still have the power to get her back,and that leaves me with the choice of get rid of the hurt now and just get hurt again in the future or push through and have happiness in the end. Which i know i can't do that's why i have decided to take my life. I know there is no heaven and no hell, but whatever is out there must be more peaceful than what is on this earth.
