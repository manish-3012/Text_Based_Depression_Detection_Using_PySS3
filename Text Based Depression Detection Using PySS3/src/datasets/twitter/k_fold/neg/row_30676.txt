iâ€™m tired of itiâ€™ve written an entire essay i was gonna post here but i felt like no one was gonna read it, so to sum it al up..... i just feel like giving up.... iâ€™m tired of putting in so much effort into everything i do for bearly any reward if any at all.... nothing really seems to be worth it... i am just exhausted of living.... i essentially â€œhave it allâ€ yet at the same time feel little to none happy. my life right now is spiraling out of control once again, and the future looks so dark and honestly iâ€™d rather not see it for myself. I want to just give up so bad and i donâ€™t know why i havenâ€™t yet.
