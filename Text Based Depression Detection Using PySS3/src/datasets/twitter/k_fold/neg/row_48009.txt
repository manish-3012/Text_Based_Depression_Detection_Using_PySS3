I'm 16 and I don't want to live anymore.I've never posted online about how I want to die before so i  don't exactly know how to phrase this so I'm sorry if I screw this up or anything. I don't necessarily want to die, more like I just don't want to live anymore.

 I'm just tired of everything all the time. I've lost interest in everything around me and it all feels pointless. I just keep remembering that my life is pointless and meaningless. I know that when I grow up I'll just be more miserable since I have nothing to live for. I just want to end it early, now. I know it will make my parents and my family sad but I just don't want to do it anymore. 

I don't think I have depression, since I've always felt like this, and I don't want to kill myself out of sadness or anything. I wanted to end it before my drivers test, but that's tomorrow so it's a little late. I don't even enjoy driving even though most people my age do. 

I'm basically worthless, I have no life goals, I suck at everything, and I'm a nervous wreck. I feel the main reason I'm posting is because I view suicide as my best option but I'm looking for any advice before I try to commit. Since you can't come back from being dead. I'm very sorry for rambling, like I said first post like this, but thanks for reading.
