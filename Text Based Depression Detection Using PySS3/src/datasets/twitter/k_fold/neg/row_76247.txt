Thinking of using a shotgun, Im genetic garbageI'm 32 male and I realize that I'm genetic garbage unworthy of attention/attraction  from the opposite sex. I'm ugly, I'm a minority, and been given enough evidence that I don't measure up to what women want. I don't have the personality and charm either.

To live on is to just suffer, in nature the weak are weeded out. I've failed, I have nothing to offer, I'm weak and the best place for me is to remove myself and end the pain.

My plan was to buy a shotgun and use a slug, aiming in my mouth downward, toward my spinal column. 

I see a psychiatrist, I take five different medications, for depression anxiety and mood stability. I've had ECT done 22 times. 

Unfortunately I'm still ugly worthless and unattractive, and I don't want to watch from the sidelines anymore. I'm always looking from the outside in. Maybe it's time to say goodbye having looked in long enough.
