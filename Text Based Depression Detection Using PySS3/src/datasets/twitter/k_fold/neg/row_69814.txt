What's the point in choosing to live? From what I understand people I have chatted to suggest that they enjoy life - get more pleasure than hurt out of it. Beyond that, there are responsibilities and religious reasons. 

Are there any other reasons? Is there a point to living? If you could choose whether or not to be born (pre-existence?) would you honestly choose to do so? I'm sure I wouldn't.
