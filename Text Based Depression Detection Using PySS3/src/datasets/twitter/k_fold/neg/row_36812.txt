I don't know what to do.Why I want to kms:

1. I always find a way to disappoint my parents.

2. I'm a waste of money and time 

3. I keep getting C`s on. English quizzes no matter how hard I study 


4. I have no future because of my g.p.a

5.  I have no purpose. I was only born because my brother was alone. He has a lot of friends. So I don't matter 


Why I don't want to die:

I can't imagine how disappointed my parents would be.

I will have a terrible afterlife
