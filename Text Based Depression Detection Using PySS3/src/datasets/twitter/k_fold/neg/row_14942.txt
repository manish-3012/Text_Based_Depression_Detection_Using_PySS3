I am not sure this is the correct place, but I want to make a choice. Please advise and thank you for your consideration this evening.I am typing this and looking at the wrinkles on my hands. I brought two children into this world with my wife, but we have no family support. I have a very large life insurance policy on myself, which pays out on as long as my death is not deemed intentional. A car accident should suffice and if I decide to move forward with this action I will simply place this laptop into the bin, with this throw away account there should be no actionable information. I'm tired. I tried very hard, we have no family but two children. The job pay is capped and despite my optimism that starting a company might turn into something. I think I have failed and a large lump sum will set everyone up for a much better life than what I could earn for them. What possible advice am I asking? Can the trauma of a dead parent when growing up be overcome (and perhaps leveraged) when growing up with a substantial windfall? Appreciate your objective viewpoints. I am not looking for "it will be okay" advice. Thank you.
