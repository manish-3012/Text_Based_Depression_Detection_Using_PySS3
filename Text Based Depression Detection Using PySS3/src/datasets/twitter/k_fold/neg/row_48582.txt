My first time calling the hotlineI just got off the hotline and went and poured out my story to the lady on the other line who would hear me, and really just let her know why I wanted to die. I did most of the talking for an hour, but 4 times I was put on hold, and the 4th she had told me someone else was in a crisis situation and that she needed to take the call, and if I could call back or if I would be okay. I said it was fine, but it really wasnâ€™t. I was at the root of my problems and Iâ€™m here with them now, but anyone else wouldâ€™ve already bitten the bullet after essentially hearing â€œsomeone more important is callingâ€. Here I am laughing at what happened, and just ready to go to bed. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever call them again, but something just didnâ€™t sit right about being put on hold with thoughts of suicide 4 times and being replaced the last. Is this normal?
