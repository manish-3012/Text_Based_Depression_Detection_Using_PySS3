Message to my best friend: I'm sorry I might not make it to your weddingI left my parents' house to escape the emotional abuse and easy access to loaded guns. I thought it would be ok after I moved in with my friends. I feel as though my strength has run out and nothing even phases me anymore. I go through the motions. I share jokes, I laugh, I try to make everyone happy... but I'm not. I'm as low as low can get right now but have no easy suicide route at this moment (hence the reason I came here), but I'm planning nonetheless. I just want to sleep. I want to sleep forever. I want it to end. I'm sorry.
