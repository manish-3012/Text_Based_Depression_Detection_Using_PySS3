The End - Tex as RealityToday was supposed to be a special day for me the universe had other plans for me.   Anything that could go wrong did.   Waited hours outside of work since they told me my schedule was changed today and can't go inside and wait due to covid.  When finally got to work, I was finally ready to get out of the 100F degree weather only to find out there was no AC, add a lot of other stuff throughout the day and it was a very bad work day.  My driver dropped me off almost a mile away from where he was supposed to drop me off.   So I finally get home and it is already almost midnight.   My special day has become the worst day of my life.    And didn't get a message regarding the special day either from someone.

This was just the tip of the iceberg, worst of all is being betrayed by everyone.

 I have already fallen off a mountain so I'm not going to do that and already got hit by a car so I'm not going to do that as well.   I will sleep on what I will do.
