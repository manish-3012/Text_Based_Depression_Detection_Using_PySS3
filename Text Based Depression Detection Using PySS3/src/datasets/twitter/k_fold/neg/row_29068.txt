I want to want to dieI've been ill for a long time, and I suppose I just want to want to die. I've come close, but then it got a little bit better, that was about 10 days ago. Now I just want to go back to really wanting to die, so that I can actually do it. I know that rationally, dying is the right thing to do: I'll finally be free with God in heaven and I won't be hurting people on earth any more. I want to be able to make the decision and go through with it for those reasons, but I know that if I weren't really really wanting to (which I'm not right now) then I couldn't, because I care about my big sister too much. 

She's the only person I can talk to about this, she's patient and kind and would do anything to save me. I know I couldn't hurt her like that if I didn't really really want to. That's why I want to want to, because then I can go and not feel guilty. I can't do it right now because even though I know it's the best decisoin, I have this stupid instinct that doesn't really want to. 

So really: How do I want to want to die?
