How I feel every dayEvery day I wake up, no matter how much faith I have, how hard I work, how much I pray, I say to myself, how the fuck do I get through another day without committing suicide? I did my best, and received nothing I desired in return. I long for someone I can never be with, and I hate whichever entity is in charge or was in charge of this planet. I was faithful, I worked hard, all for nothing. I don't want anything I can't have. I don't have any desire to work, yet I have to work or go homeless. I see the world around me, and it's becoming more and more uneven. if I died tomorrow, I would be happy. At least Jesus got to die after he was killed. I didn't get to die after I was killed, I am forced to keep living for nothing that I want. Toss me another woman I have no feelings for, and then punish me for not desiring her. Keep doing it, life is so predictable, such bullshit. I've been checked out, I've been done for a long time. I can never get her back. It's like God recognizes none of my feelings, any of the deeply wounding pain I feel and have felt throughout my entire life, and to hell with you. You never helped me, and you never could. You're an asshole for keeping me alive.
