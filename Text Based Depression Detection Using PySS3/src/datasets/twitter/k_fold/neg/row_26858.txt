Iâ€™m done.I (22M) havenâ€™t had an easy life. My life has always been riddled with trauma but Iâ€™ve always managed to find my way through. 

At 16, my mother tricked me into going to Africa for holiday and planned to leave me there forever. After 2 years in a country I despised, filled with ignorant regressive people who didnâ€™t know any better I managed to gain back my freedom by convincing my relatives that I shared their beliefs in Islam although I despised the ideology. I prayed more than 5 times a day for a year to convince them, I was even sent to an â€œIslamic propagation centreâ€ for 6 months and I survived that &amp; im proud of myself. The horrors I faced I could never describe. 

When I landed in England, I knew what I wanted in life. I studied hard and got into a good university. I worked out so hard that I got the ideal body &amp; met plenty of women and generally enjoyed life. 

Now I face new challenges that have overwhelmed me. I broke my jaw over the summer and now I canâ€™t even breathe properly. My cognitive function is impaired, my speech is horrendous and my body is deteriorating. All Iâ€™m left with is back pain and a fucked up face. I went from an 8 with absolute confidence to someone who can barely maintain eye contact (because Iâ€™m aware of how ugly I am) my lower face has shortened and now all I do is look at old pictures realising il never look like that ever again.

I failed a module at university and now Iâ€™ve been withdrawn. my mother has disowned me because Iâ€™ve told her im atheist &amp; now Iâ€™m in debt, living alone struggling to even cover my rent. I have strong views against religion. My outlook on the world is unconventional. The more I learn about the world, the less I want to be in it. Iâ€™m disappointed in myself for giving up but this is simply too much to handle. I canâ€™t imagine living  life with the broken tools Iâ€™m left with. Even if I recover academically, I could never live life like a wanted to because of my other impairments.

Iâ€™m very opinionated but I like to think Iâ€™m open minded. I just canâ€™t stand my phone-fixed peers so I spent most of my time alone at university at the gym or studying etc, never needed anyone. Now that I canâ€™t work out &amp; im no longer studying I realise that I have no one. People were only around me because of the energy I gave off and now the aura is gone. 

Death is something Iâ€™ve always pondered during the rough times of my past &amp; I very had plenty of close calls; not on purpose, with the exception being the time I thought Iâ€™d never come back to England so I stole my cousins gun and held it up to my held. I didnâ€™t pull the trigger, the weapon was jammed with a larger round in the magazine which I had to remove before I could use it. Whilst doing so, I decided to go on my last ride and stole a motorcycle rode like a kid with a death screaming the pain out. I stopped and had the most intense conversation with myself. Told myself â€œyouâ€™re strong, no matter how hopeless it seems m, youâ€™re strong and youâ€™ll find a way out of thisâ€. 

This time itâ€™s different, I donâ€™t see the end goal. I just see a fucked up chance at existence. What is death besides from a release from existence? 
We tell ourselves stories to make the unknown bearable but I genuinely love it for what it is. A door back to whatever it was before I was conscious. Does anything come afterwards? If you cut the religious bullshit, nobody knows &amp; thereâ€™s only one way to find out. It has to be better than this, right?
