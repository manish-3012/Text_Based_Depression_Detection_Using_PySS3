The Man I Love is Questioning His Love For MeFirst off our relationship is complicated I live in Canada and he lives in Ohio. We have been flying back and forth to be with each other for the past year. A couple months ago we broke up due to some minor sexual assault stuff. I will never hold that against him I more so brought it up because it bothered me but he thought I was calling him a rapist. Which I was never saying, but this all ended up by me saying that we should go on a break and he was so mad I suggested that, that we broke up. Since then weâ€™ve still acted like a couple and due to it being summer break I suggested that I come up there about a month ago. He seemed totally on board until about two weeks ago where he out of the blue just said I donâ€™t think you should come up. Iâ€™ve eventually found out that heâ€™s been thinking about us not being us for like a month month and a half and he even has another potential love interest. I poured my heart out to him saying that I believe he is my soulmate and I wanted to grow old with him and I wanted us to have kids and etc. He claimed he had no idea that I felt that way which I admit yes Iâ€™m not very good at vocalizing myself. Although he damn well knew I loved him and he still claims he loves me, but â€œwants to see what else is out thereâ€. I have no motivation for life anymore because he was my only motivation. I donâ€™t see myself being with anyone else because in the past Iâ€™ve had a history of being a hoe. Iâ€™ve had my fair share of men and none of the guys Iâ€™ve slept with or dated in the past Iâ€™ve felt anything long term with or even really wanted to be their gf. I truly believe it will be impossible to find someone else I can be loyal to and will want a future with Idek how many I went through to find him and I canâ€™t even think of anyone who is atleast half the man he is. I lucked out finding him ðŸ˜­ but I guess I cashed out to early
