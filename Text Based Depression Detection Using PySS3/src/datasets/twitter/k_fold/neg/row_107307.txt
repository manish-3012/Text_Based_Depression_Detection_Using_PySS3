Saying I want to die is becoming less painful when I say it  About 4 years ago I realized I hadnâ€™t known what I wanted to do with my life, and ever since then the anxiety of falling in a rut in college and not knowing what I wanted to major in would lead me to drop out and I wouldnâ€™t amount to anything. This only becomes worse with the fact that Iâ€™m failing several of my classes right now and Iâ€™m so stressed about one of my classes that itâ€™s consumed almost every second of my life and has caused me to feel depressed. Every time I try to study I just canâ€™t grasp the concept and it leaves me with even more stress. 
  Failing a class doesnâ€™t usually hit me as hard as this has, because I can usually bring the grade up to at least a B+ but Iâ€™ve hit the point that it feels like nothing matters. I donâ€™t know what I want to do with my life and Iâ€™m certain I wonâ€™t ever amount to anything that would make me successful, much less happy. I have constant anxiety and I stay up until 5am trying to study but I canâ€™t do it. 
  Even trying to study feels like such a chore, my GPA is already dropping, my class rank is just getting higher, and Iâ€™ve realized Iâ€™m not smart enough to simply get by on good grades alone, so Iâ€™ve had to resort to trying to figure out what I want to major in and get by on hard work, but I canâ€™t even figure that out.
  Iâ€™ve been feeling depressed for about a month or so now and I canâ€™t tell if Iâ€™m subconsciously faking it to get attention or if Iâ€™m truly depressed. I just donâ€™t know what to do anymore. For years Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts, but when they first started I would break out crying because the thought of doing such a thing was too much, but now it just feels painfully easy to say and I canâ€™t even tell If I would actually do it or not. Itâ€™s just an empty feeling at this point and Iâ€™m sure if I didnâ€™t have family or friends who Iâ€™m scared to disappoint, I would have already attempted it. It feels like Iâ€™m just not trying hard enough and Iâ€™m weak but I can still work myself to exhaustion and fail at everything I do. I just really donâ€™t know how to handle myself anymore.
