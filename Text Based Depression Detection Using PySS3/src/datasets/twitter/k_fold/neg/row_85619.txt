Not sure what to say here, I'm just going to ventI've been suicidal for 17 years (yeah!). But my recent realization has made me recognize that it would be better for others more than myself for the first time. I work a lot, like before the sun comes up and lucky if I get home for dinner. It's a family business so I can't blame "the man", I just have to do my job. When I get home I often continue to work (I am actually working now at 1:15 am). I am also a drunk, I get drunk, like drunk drunk, at least twice a week, and drink like four times a week. This is partially because I have a serious medical problem that alcohol seems to cure. Maybe I use it as an excuse, but if I don't drink I am in major physical pain with every movement. My doctors have put me through every test and have come up with like 10 possible things.

So... I'm a drunk. A dad who works too much... no money to show for it... depressed at every moment, and in pain at every moment.. I know my kids are supposed to be who I live for but I am in so much pain physically and mentally that I just feel I need out. 

How can anyone expect someone to live like this? ever striving to bring a good life to their kids by working, yet that obviously takes time from them and even when you can you are in crippling pain... my wife is strong, holds me together but yet we haven't had sex in 6 months. 

I think I should just go...
