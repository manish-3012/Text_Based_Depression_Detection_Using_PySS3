Holding up. YetDunno where I should start.

I've got a sister and two brothers. Sis is 10 years older, bros are 6 years younger than me. I love them, I really do. But I have never had a feeling that any of them would ever treat me like a person, like a human being.

I have always had a feeling that  I am a plan B. A spare babysitter for the younger, a spare houseworker if mom's tired, a plan B for everyone around me. A plan B if my syster's no money for her own kids' babysitter, a plan B for my parents who never had any money, a plan B for my husband who never wastes an opportunity to remind me that I'm not so beautiful as he would want me to be, I'm not so smart as he is, I'm not fit, I'm not funny, I'm not kind, I'm not whatever whoever would want me to be.

So I've been thinking about shutting myself off for about 10 years, but I'm too much of a coward to do it. I'm not good enough even for that. Every fucking day I open up the window of my 8th floor and don't have courage to step out. 

 

For so many years I've been trying to prove someone (myself first of all) that I'm worth something - maybe some respect or compassion, but I've failed. I don't really feel something about people around me for now. 10 years ago a really felt something about my family and my husband, I cared about them, but for now I just pretend to and this pretending makes me feel even worse and more disgusted about myself.

I can't even ask for an advice or encouragement 'cause I don't know if I need any. So don't bother to answer, I guess reddit is just a place I can complain whatever without "youre an ungrateful bitch" response.
