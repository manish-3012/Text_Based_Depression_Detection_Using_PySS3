Low stakes, but the worst itâ€™s been in awhileI have persistent SI pretty much all the time, but even when Iâ€™m not feeling great itâ€™s usually easy to move on from. Annoying at worst.

Itâ€™s pretty bad right now. I canâ€™t stop thinking about how miserable I am and how Iâ€™ve failed myself and my loved ones in a bunch of ways. How thereâ€™s nothing in me as a person to grow into someone who can build the life I want. You know, all the usual stuff.

I more or less understand whatâ€™s going on in my head. That none of that is necessarily true, and that thereâ€™s no reasonable argument I could make for any of it. The problem is that my feelings do not respond to reasonable arguments. To my broken mind itâ€™s all brutal truth.

So here I am, miserable and pathetic again. I donâ€™t really want the other people in my life to know yet, but it would be nice to have some contact so that Iâ€™m not stuck trying to think about how to get out.
