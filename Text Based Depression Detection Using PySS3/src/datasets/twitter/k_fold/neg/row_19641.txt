I'm scared that I'm gonna snap at any momentI've had roughly 2 years if fairly bad counselling but recently I managed to hopefully find myself a better service. My appointment is in roughly 2 weeks time but I've felt so suicidal recently. I know that I most likely won't do anything but I'm just scared that I'll wake up and think "Fuck this shit, I can't take it anymore" and do something really irrational that I will regret. 
I'm not exactly in a crisis situation right now but I just don't have the energy to keep going anymore.
