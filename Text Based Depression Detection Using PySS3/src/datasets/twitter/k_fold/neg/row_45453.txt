The lowest I've ever been - I don't want to be here any more!I am scaring myself, I don't know if anybody read the post I made yesterday, but my Dog died, she had to be put to sleep suddenly, my mind is racing with everything I did wrong in her life, she deserved better than me and I am a fucking idiot for not realising what a beautiful Dog she was while she was here, she was perfect, and I simply was not good enough for her. I cannot see myself ever feeling better than I do now, I can never see my baby again and the pain of this is all too much. I know some people who have never loved a Dog will never understand this, but this is real agony, I have never felt like this before and I feel like I can't continue through this pain. I fucking hate myself, what is the point? 

I don't know what to do, my mind is torturing me, I've honestly never felt like this before. I miss her so much, and I hate myself for not realising and doing better by my best friend.
