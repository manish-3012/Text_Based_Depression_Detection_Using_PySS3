Friend left me, looking for reasons to liveI'm 17, exhausted with everything, school's finished so I'm wasting most of my time doing nothing and getting tormented by obsessive thoughts of a close friend who left me a month ago. I'm desperate for motivation to stay alive, every reason I see online somehow always manages to reach a dead end.

Some stay alive because of music, art, movies and what not, I can't feel much joy indulging in them anymore. By the end there's always this lingering emptiness and they just feel so repetitive, like they are slowly grinding away against my head.

Some live because of their friends, I lost all that and I have no one to share anything with anymore. I don't feel that I have anyone to call family, they are all strangers to me. Don't feel like anyone really cares about me anymore, no one to turn to, hence why I'm on here in the first place.

Some say it will get better, but how long am I supposed to wait? I've tried so hard surviving this long, thought I finally found some hope when I met some friends online 3 years back, now I'm at square 1 when I'm exiled from their group and worst than before. I don't even know the point in pursuing happiness when it's so fleeting and temporary.

I don't know, I just want it to end, can barely sleep yet I'm always exhausted, at least if I die my organs can be donated to those who will need them more than me, people with loving families and friends who are awaiting their recovery, people who will use this beating heart better than me. I will be helping so many people. I don't know anymore.
