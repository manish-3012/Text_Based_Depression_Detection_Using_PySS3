Why? Is life even worth living anymore?My life honestly doesnt have any meaning anymore. I am a student pilot about 250 hours in towards my 1500 hours needed for an ATP and I literally seem to fail at doing everything but these two tasks in my life. Flying airplane and watching/playing hockey. Every night I just want to die for one reason or another. Another friend abandoning me. Failing with another woman. Fucking up something else up. If I went on a solo tomorrow and I wrecked the airplane I could think of less than 10 people who would actually give a shit and my parents aren't even on that list. Each day is a repeat of the previous. My dad permanantly kicked my out of his house because I bought a hockey jersey he didn't like (T.J. Oshie Team USA to be specific) and my mom won't let me see her without a girlfriend fiance or wife. Honestly everything is in the shitter and my life isn't worth living. My only escapes are flying and watching nhl games or playing in beer league matches but that can only do so much. Do I go to a doctor or one of those people who give a shit? Just end it? Pull a germanwings?
