I don't understand how people are ok with existing then forcing children to existI've been depressed as long as I can remember. I first wanted to kill myself when I was 8. People always tell children they can do what they want as adults. I was miserable as a kid and hated being in school. I don't see how having a job could be better than school. Why can't I just opt out of existing?
