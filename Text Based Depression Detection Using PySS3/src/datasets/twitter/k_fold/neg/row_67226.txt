Iâ€™m not even suicidal but sometimes I feel like thereâ€™s only one way outFull disclosure: Iâ€™ve been medicated for a decent while now and no longer have constant suicidal/self-harming thoughts

But I feel like my thoughts of failure have become less of a painful burden on my mind, and more a fact of reality that Iâ€™ve accepted without much thought or sadness

Because it would be so easy to just go to college and live my life in the best way I can, but it would be so much easier to just lie down and go to sleep forever. Sounds stupid as hell but Iâ€™m sort of tired of playing this game and wondering what sort of bland happiness I could manage to squeeze from it when I could just leave all my suffering behind if I just shut myself off
