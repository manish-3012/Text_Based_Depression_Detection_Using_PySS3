My friend is talking suicide, what do I do?My friend is a recovering alcoholic. He's been sober for barely 10 days now, but he seems determined and we are here to support him. However, the effects of his alcoholism are (obviously) still following him around. He has a meeting with the HR department tomorrow regarding "unexplained absence" and "misbehaviour" and it looks like he's going to get fired.

He's telling me now how he's thinking about killing himself and how to do it.

I guess the fact that he's telling me these things is a good sign, in that he's clearly looking to talk rather than actually do this. Nevertheless, I am inclined to take it seriously, as I think one should always do in these situations.

What do I do?!?
