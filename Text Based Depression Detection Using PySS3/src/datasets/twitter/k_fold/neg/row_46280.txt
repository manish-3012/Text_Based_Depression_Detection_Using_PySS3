My bestfriend attempted suicide last week and I didn't knowGod, I feel like to worst person in the world. I am visiting my home state in a few weeks and checked in to see when was a good day to drop by my best friends' house. She called me crying and told me she was in the hospital for a suicide attempt and that she relapsed. I was shocked. I knew she struggled with a drug addiction but last she told me she was doing well and attending meetings. 

She's going to a treatment center next week so I will be able to visit her when I am in town. I feel so guilty that she didn't think she could talk to me. I haven't always been the most understanding about her addiction so that is on me. What can I do to help her? How should I be at the treatment center? 

I hate that I couldn't be there for her when she needed me. I just feel like such a fucking trash friend right now. I know this isn't articulated well but I just needed to tell someone.
