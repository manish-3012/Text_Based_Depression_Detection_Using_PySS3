An update for all that have helped me.Right now I'm laying in a hospital bed, not because of a suicide attempt but because of my seizures yet again. 

I don't know what to feel but frustration and have for my body for rebelling against me. I don't know what else to say but they are only keeping me for observation. So hopefully I'll be able to break out tomorrow. 

Just figured I'd put it out there for anybody who cares. 

Thanks
