confused.About 1 month ago i stopped feeling like i wanted to die, these thoughts were so bad that i would be afraid to go to school and do normal things but i noticed in the month that ive felt the happiest ive ever been. But about a week ago the thoughts came back and im stuck being tired everyday, feeling like i have no one , scared to go to school and suicidal thoughts and i just want to know if anyone knows whats wrong with me . The thoughts have NEVER gone before and a weight was lifted on me and i never even realised i wasnt feeling sad or scared anymore. Does this happen to anyone else ? And are their ways to stop this because i dont know how long i can cope with these thoughts again.
