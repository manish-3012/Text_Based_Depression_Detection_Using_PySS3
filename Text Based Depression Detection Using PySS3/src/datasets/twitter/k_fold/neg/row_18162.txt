Iâ€™m sick of it.I canâ€™t even remember when my depression kicked in. No social life, no job, poor hygiene, no training or employment, habitually play video games which I do NOT enjoy at all, literally one of the only things that keep my mind off of wanting to kill myself.

Psychologists donâ€™t help, got rid of 98% of friends because they were toxic and nothing changed from their behavior. Iâ€™m a 24 year old that has done absolutely fuck all with his life except eat fast food nearly everyday with the welfare money I get, canâ€™t hold a job down because I can only ever think of just fucking leaving the venue to go home, I have zero motivation or drive to do anything, girlfriend left me due to â€œmental problemsâ€ but goes out with another guy a month or two later.


Whatâ€™s the point of living? I legit see no purpose in someone as fucking hopeless and useless as me. I scream out for fucking help, I ask for help, I fucking express myself only to be fucking ignored by people. People can go fuck themselves. Fuck them and fuck this world and fuck me for exisiting for this long.

Cya.
