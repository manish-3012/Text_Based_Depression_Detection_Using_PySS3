It's getting pretty bad. Planning on ending it.My wife and kids left 2 months ago because my wife couldn't deal with my depression. I lost my job about a month ago. I'm surviving on severance pay for another couple of weeks. Drinking about 1/3 gallon of rum every night. My ex-wife is begging me to check myself into the hospital, but it hasn't helped in the past. I'm at the point where I don't want help. I just want it all to end.

I have about $60k in 401k that I'm going to cash... maybe take one last vacation, and then I plan on ending myself. I've been depressed all my life, but this last year has been excruciating. It's as worse as it's ever been and suicide is seeming like my only last option.

Any words of encouragement? I'm really in a bad place.

Edit to say, I have narcolepsy, and I only have about 2 hours a day when I'm feeling energetic enough to do ANYTHING, including getting help.
