I've come to an end.The "me" that used to exist is long dead. I broke things off with my ex. My family is dwindled down. I can't go back to school. I have a job that takes up all of my time.

I don't like games anymore. Music is beginning to bore me. I'd like nothing more than to take a bullet. I've been exploring methods of suicide.

Carbon dioxide inhalation seems to painful and difficult to acquire the tools for.

Getting a shotgun for home defense would take some time and money. If I'm gonna die anyway, I suppose it doesn't matter. I just don't want to wait.

Drowning is painless after the panic. And after all, I love the water.
