Thought I was getting betterI had an attempt in January and was sent to the hospital again and changed therapist and meds and was slowly starting to feel better. Then yesterday I pretty much woke up wanting to have another attempt again and find the best way to do. I slept for ~18hours to try and move past it yesterday and woke up today hoping I feel better and only believe that I should just end it all. I feel alone at school surrounded by people who seem to be having more enjoyment in everything while i sit in class trying to not stab myself. The only people the text me are asking for drugs or want me to hook up with their roommates just feel like a huge waste. I thought everything was getting better but now idk if I can get up to go to class. Itâ€™s been such a struggle to even shower today idk if I can eat. I just wanna OD and not have to deal with anything again. Help everyone out by not taking up opportunities that others should have. Iâ€™ve started making a list of reasons to stay alive and the only thing Iâ€™ve been able to come up with is to help my sister deal with the strife my parents cause her but doesnâ€™t feel like a good enough reason to not just take Xanax and OD
