I donâ€™t know what to doIâ€™m always told Iâ€™m not old enough to understand what I feel but I know for a fact that I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I donâ€™t want to live everyday knowing Iâ€™m putting on a fake face for everyone. I started cutting recently and itâ€™s feels good it takes my mind of everything and it makes me feel happy, my friend found out and he made me promise I would stop and I would talk to him if I needed it but itâ€™s hard. Itâ€™s uncomfortable for me to talk to people about how I feel because I feel stupid. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore I should just slit my wrist and bleed out.?Would my parents care? Would anyone at all actually care? I doubt people will genuinely miss me. I want to be happy, I really do.
