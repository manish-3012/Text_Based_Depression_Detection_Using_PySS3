I've decidedI'm too depressed and extremely suicidal 24/7 and I can't deal with this shit anymore, so I decided to give myself a grace period until December, I'm giving myself one last chance because honestly I don't want others to suffer the consequences.  So if I don't get better or if I continue to get worse I'll commit suicide in December 25th, because it's the day that Jesus was born, he swore to protect us, but guess what, I have sinned so much that they don't even give a fuck about me anymore. I already have a plan, it's a really horrible plan, which include beheading... well anyways ... guess I'll soon be finally happy or will I be guilty even after death ? 
The world doesn't need a scumbag like me.
