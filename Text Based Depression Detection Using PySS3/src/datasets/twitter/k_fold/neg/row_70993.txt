It feels like it's been a long time comingHi. So I'm a 19 year old uni student, I have the rest of my life ahead of me (supposedly) I have an incredible supportive partner and a nice place to live. But I just want to leave it all behind.

I've experienced depression, self harm and thoughts of suicide since the age of 12, relapsing into self harm last December after three whole years clean. As a kid, I promised myself that once I had moved out of home and my family couldn't blame themselves for my death, I would be able to commit suicide. I moved out, but now I have a partner who I love more than anything who I know would be broken by my death. I feel selfish and horrible, recently I told my partner that I saw them more as an obstacle stopping me from leaving than a positive reason to stay alive, and it crushed them.

I've called helplines, I have counsellors. Nothing helps. Recently I have been hoarding things that could be used to kill myself, each time my partner ends up finding out and breaks down.

I'm hurting people around me and I don't know what to do, nobody will support me.

I don't want to die.
But I really really do.
