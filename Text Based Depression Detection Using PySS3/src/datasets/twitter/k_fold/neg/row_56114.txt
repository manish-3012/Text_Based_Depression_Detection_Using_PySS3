28 M, no career of any kind, never been in a relationship, no friends minus a few onlineI am 28 I live in Canada and minus a few construction jobs where I made 18 or so an hour I have always worked for minimum wage, which at least I can survive on $14 an hour is what in getting right now. I have never done any post secondary because I am awful at schooling, I fail pretty much every year I have taken so I am not willing to risk the massive amount of money that post secondary takes.

The only redeemable thing about me that I can think of is that I am good with money, making $14 an hour I have no debt of any kind I live with a roommate and manage to pay all my bills.

But I am honestly at a loss for what to do with myself, I don't see a point in living another 50 years if i am just going to making just enough to pay my bills and be alone but I honestly don't know what if anything I am capable of accomplishing.
