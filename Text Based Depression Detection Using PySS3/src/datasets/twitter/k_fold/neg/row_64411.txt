I have no food and I can't starve anymore.I'm broke, someone stole my bank info so my check is being held until Monday. I'm so sick of living like this. I'm sick of hearing it'll get better. I don't have the time. My sister in law ate all of my food and refuses to put gas in our car even though she shares it and we drive 5 miles while she drives 35. I'm going to take the trazodone I've saved and get in the tub tonight. I'll drown and it'll be easy enough to clean up. I'm sorry to my husband, I love you so much. You're all I've had. I'm sorry to my parents. I can't do this anymore.
