Ok, so give me a reason that is possible in my reality, not to kill myself.Unemployed for years, depressed forever, never get to stay long at a job because in my country, chit chat is obligatory, so I always got fired because (and those were really the reasons given to me by my employers) I didn't laugh at other coworkers jokes, I didn't go out with them to socialize (I never had anything in common with them), I didn't chit chat.

 I have antidepressants resistant depression. I can't do therapy because the cheap/free ones in this city are all former students of my father and they always bring up how they loved him, even though this is totally unprofessional. I'm socially awkward (possibly aspergers which would explain A LOT) and I never wanted or sought attention. I don't want kids, never wanted, I don't want a boyfriend (it was always a waste of time and toxic for me) or a house or a car, never wanted these. The only thing I wanted in life since I was a 5 y/o girl was to live isolated from civilization, but to do so you need to have money to buy a property and money is something I don't have for many years.

"You are worth it" to hell with that sentence. No one's worth it, we are totally insignificant in this huge universe so stop pushing self help shit.

"It will get better". It's been 36 years things suck for me, when the actually hell will it get better? Because I honestly have no idea, I've been waiting and doing my best and it's not better.

"Your family will suffer/miss you" who cares? They will all die eventually, I'll die one way or another and probably first them my parents anyway since I'm always sick.
