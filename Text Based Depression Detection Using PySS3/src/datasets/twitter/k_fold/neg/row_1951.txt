Not quite at risk, but felt like this could be a safe place to vent.I donâ€™t know where to begin or what exactly to say.

I would love nothing more than to die, but I donâ€™t quite have the guts to kill myself either. I think Iâ€™ve been depressed for a long time. I donâ€™t remember ever not wanting to be dead and it took me until recently to realize that thatâ€™s not normal. 

Iâ€™m addicted to pornography. That might be a joke to some of you, but itâ€™s not to me. This brings a lot of guilt and shame into my life. I canâ€™t go more than a week without some form of pornography, and I donâ€™t know how to stop. Iâ€™m also very religious, but donâ€™t feel like this is the place to talk about religion.

Iâ€™ve never had a boyfriend. Iâ€™m young, 22, but I feel like a loser. Iâ€™ve never even come close to having companionship with the opposite sex. Never even held a guyâ€™s hand. I wish that guyâ€™s opinions didnâ€™t mean so much to me, but they do. I doubt anyone has even had a crush on me. It hurts to realize that youâ€™re just not desirable. Any time I was ever told someone was interested in me it was a joke, and I canâ€™t even being to describe the way that hurts. Iâ€™m not quite sure why Iâ€™m so undesirable either. I know Iâ€™m not a head turner, but I wouldnâ€™t call myself ugly either. Maybe guys are just intimidated by a girl who is 6â€™1â€™â€™? 

I just started university. I should have graduated in the spring if I were a typical student, but I couldnâ€™t start until this fall semester. Half the people I went to high school with have graduated, and the other half will graduate within the next year. I feel so behind in life and Iâ€™m not sure if Iâ€™ll ever catch up. I still live at home because I canâ€™t afford to move out and pay tuition. I have no friends my age around here. The friends I do have are away at their colleges. The only people I talk to are the moms in my neighborhood that I grew up around. I love those women, but itâ€™s not exactly socially satisfying to only talk with women who are more than twice my age. Iâ€™m lonelier than Iâ€™ve ever been in my life. When Iâ€™m not at school, Iâ€™m at home in my room. I donâ€™t even have a job because I was laid off and finding a new job makes me super anxious.

Thereâ€™s one person that knows all about my struggles with pornography and suicidal thoughts. Sheâ€™s told me to find a counselor, but I donâ€™t quite know how to find one and tell my mom that I need one. I donâ€™t want to disappoint anyone by telling them that I need mental help. I doubt a counselorâ€™s ability to help me anyway. I struggle with anxiety too, and ever since I was little I ripped my hair out (trichotillomania). It sucks to think that Iâ€™ve had a brain thatâ€™s never worked right. I told this person not to worry about me killing myself because my suicidal thoughts are passive rather than active. But Iâ€™m worried about what would happen the second I start having active suicidal thoughts. Iâ€™ve held on this long without trying anything, but the way my life keeps slipping, Iâ€™m not sure how much longer I can hold on.
