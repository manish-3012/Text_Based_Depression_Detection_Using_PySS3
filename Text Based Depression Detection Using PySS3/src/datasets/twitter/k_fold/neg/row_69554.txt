I can't talk to anyone outside of my family without having a mental breakdownI've had severe social anxiety due to trauma and attachment issues nearly my whole life and it keeps getting worse each year. 

I can only keep up the facade for so long but the truth is that I know I can't survive adulthood. I can't answer the phone without crying, I can't get through an interview without feeling like I'm on the verge of death. I can't even order food at a drive thru without having a panic attack. 

I'll never survive adulthood. I just need to be a man and kill myself while I still have a chance.
