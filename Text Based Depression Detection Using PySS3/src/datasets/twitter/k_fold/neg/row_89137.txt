is it possible to ever feel better?I was six the first time I thought about killing myself. I shoved myself into a Rubbermaid container and begged my friends to put the lid on. I do not know what it is like to live without wanting to die. I've done meds, therapy, and all I want to love life. But I hate myself. I hate feeling like this. I am lonely and cowardly and weak. 

I go to a top tier university on a full scholarship. I have a job that I love. I have a family that cares. But I want to die. I want nothing more than to never have to wake up again. 

Will I ever get over this feeling? Is a life outside of this misery ever possible?
