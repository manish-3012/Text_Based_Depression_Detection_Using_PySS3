its not really that urgentI in a pretty good situation really. I have a family and friends who care about me, i am relatively stable financially, i can talk to girls, and occasion spend a night with a girl. I would think i have a pretty good life, but for some reason i dont feel.. okay. I dont want to say im not but happy because there are points where i think i am but it times like now where i just to get everything over with.. I know there are people worst off than me but it doesnt make me feel like i should live on.. i really dont know why i am writing this.. maybe it cause i want to know that is normal to feel this way or that im not alone or some other reason.. but even if i know that there is someone that is out there like me, which there probably is, it wont make feel or become better.. i dont really know how or what to describe what i am going through right now.. i just want to assure me that these thoughts i have wont take me over.. idk cause sometime do really want to die but my principles and morals wont let me take my own live.. i think they will never be in control but its moments like this where i do things that i never thought i would do but here i am writing to complete strangers in hopes of finding some epifainy that will set my life straight.. i dont know  what wrong with me and i cant expect anyone else to help me if i cant tell them the problem.. but i just wanted to say that i have a problem, i dont know what it is, but i think i cant be fixed and thats all i just what to get it off my chest without worrying anyone..
