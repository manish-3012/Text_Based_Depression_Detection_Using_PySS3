Done800 miles away from any friends or family. Our phones are shut off so I canâ€™t text the crisis line and I have zero minutes on WiFi calling to call the hotline or anyone else for that matter. I canâ€™t talk to my best friend of 13 years because she has this other suicidal friend and went off on this huge rant the other day about how sheâ€™s so sick and tired and stressed of having to save people. My Dad wonâ€™t respond to my messages. Weâ€™ll be homeless in a week in 110+degree weather with a toddler. And I woke up this morning to find Iâ€™d been kicked and banned from all three of my depression support groups on Facebook with no explanation as to why.  My heart is shattered, Iâ€™m a failure and apparently Iâ€™ve driven everyone, even entire support groups, away. Iâ€™m not interested in trying to stay positive or fighting to get better anymore. Iâ€™m too fucking tired so just donâ€™t tell me to fight because I CANâ€™T. Please just tell me what the most painless way to die is? Iâ€™m so afraid of dying and it hurting, I just want to minimize it. Please help.
