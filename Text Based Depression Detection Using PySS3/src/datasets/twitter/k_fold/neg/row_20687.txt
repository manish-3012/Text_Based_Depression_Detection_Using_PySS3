The end of my chapterSo.. after years and years of depression and keeping it up with a semi stable job.. heres my story

From the beginning its been my dad and I going solo against the world, weâ€™ve been doing fine and got a big house where I rent off him.

Some years ago I was doing my own thing with drugs n alcohol so I decided to cut my dad out (what a fucking dick I am).. and after falling deeply into debt and issues I decided I wanted a quick buck and going debt free
I went on a run overseas and got a shitton of beer n booze of every sort (on my dealers bill)
I shopped for about $9k and filled an already rented van to bring this home

After a three day drive I got caught and spent 3 days in solitary meanwhile the court decided their part. I was after that allowed to drive and went home empty handed

I went back to my daily high on crack n booze for weeks until I decided to move home to my paps

Fast forward to the present
I have not had a stable job ever, the last week I got an amazing opportunity with truck driving and Im really good at it, comfortable and all.. until this day, I got a letter from the Police saying I gotta go get my penalty for the booze run.

As said depression and anxiety always were with me so at this moment Iâ€™ve made my mind at approximately 90% to commit suicide by hanging. I got no friends so this is where I seek due to my life where I could only relate to reddit mostly..

Thank you all, god speed
