I believe it's the right thing to end thisYou know what sucks being the nice guy. All your life you walk around doing things for people. When they need you, you feel obliged to help. You give so much so you forget about yourself. You talk pride in helping others and more or less not worrying what you get back from them. People take advantage of you and use you.

Sometimes we are just tired and want someone by our side. Then the realization hits in. People don't care about your problems. They might ask but no one has time for a person who's struggling. Eventually, no one wants a lingering guy who has really been struggling. All you want is someone to text you at times, just asking how are you, not when they need something. 

I always knew i wouldn't live long. I don't deserve this but it hurts so bad. That feeling in your stomach of always wanting to throw up. People noises just running through your head. The world feels the shitiest place, when you can't sleep and the mind wonders and when self deprecation is the only way you can describe yourself. 

People will say look for help. I have but you know what no one cares. People think i'm being melodramatic because a man can't suffer from this. A guy who has made people laugh all his life is having issues. BULLSHIT RIGHT!!

Why am i writing this. Maybe when its all said and done. People will say ohh well he really did have issue, now he's in a better place. One less person will not make a difference. And believe me, my existence does not make a difference in anyone's life i know. So, why hurt myself everyday when i can do it once.

To the people here trying to help. I appreciate it but i know what you'll say so maybe wise words for another person. Maybe tomorrow morning you'll hear someone fell on the subway tracks or jumped from the 8th floor of a building. Just maybe.
