It's really hard doing it aloneEveryone has always said that your friends will be there for you, or that the only wrong to do is to not tell anyone what's going on in your life. Time and time again I get proven wrong. Openly express my feelings of worthlessness and methods of suicide? Not a peep from anyone, like nothing was said at all. Let a close friend know in no uncertain terms that you want to immediately harm yourself? It all blows up in your face and everything turns out much worse than how it was before. Taking that first step of telling people how miserable I am has never worked out for me, the latter half of my life has been a slow snowball of losing touch with all of the people I know through my behavior and expression. I've honestly lost count of all the subgroups I walked away from because I didn't want to burden them and I with inevitably running my mouth. Now I sit around alone waiting for something to push me.
