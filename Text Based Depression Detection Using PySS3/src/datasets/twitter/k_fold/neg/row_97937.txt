what should i doi've wanted to die for three years but i've never done anything about it. most extreme things i've done is dunk my head underwater until i struggle for air and wrap a towel around my neck to strangle myself. didn't do it hard enough, and tbh i don't think i really wanted to go through with it. i also took five puffs of my inhaler just to see what would happen. nothing happened. anyways, i self harm sometimes. i always think about dying. i've written a suicide note just in case. i'm planning on overdosing on benadryl if my math grade lowers after a test in a few days. if it goes up then i'll just wait till finals and see what happens. 

i have had problems with eating for a year now and i'm tired of it. i'm tired of puking up food when i binge and i'm tired of binging. i'm tired of counting calories and only thinking about food. i hate myself. i hate my body. i want to die. it's frustrating because even though i say i want to die, a part of me wants to get help. maybe that's why i'm writing this massive rant (sorry by the way) but i just don't have anyone i can tell this to.

should i tell my doctor? my school? i don't want to tell my parents. they'd be so disappointed in me, i just know it.

i'm stuck and i have no where to go and i don't know what to do. this whole rant is all over the place...sorry about that.
