Iâ€™m absolutely lost.I donâ€™t know what the fuck to do with my life. Within the past few days, everything has spiraled out of control. I just want this to get better. I donâ€™t want to have to go back to drinking to hide the pain. I made a promise that I wouldnâ€™t drink anymore to an important person and myself and my dog (which sounds silly, but my dog is the only thing important in my life right now and Iâ€™m trying to be the person she thinks I am)

I fucked up with my shitty attitude. Iâ€™m just rambling, but I figured if I have an outlet to vent, it might help.

Iâ€™m so close to just ending it just so Iâ€™ll have some god damn silence, if that makes any sense. I just feel like itâ€™s the only way. I know it will hurt the people I care about, but Iâ€™m just so tired of feeling this way.
