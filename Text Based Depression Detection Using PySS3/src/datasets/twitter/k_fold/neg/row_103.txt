I feel like my girlfriend is pulling me downHi, Iâ€™ve been a long time lurker and finally convinced myself to post something too.

So, for start, Iâ€™m a 17 year old boy from Chech Republic. Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression and anxiety for about 3 years now, but Iâ€™ve never hurt myself. But since 6 months ago, when I met my new girlfriend, I feel like Iâ€™m too obsessed with her to the point where I started choking or even cutting myself when I felt like she was mad at me.

I have pretty fragile psyche so this shit can really put me on my knees. It happens daily. It got to the point where she almost broke up with me. But I knew that if she would leave me, I would have no other purpose in life. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m just too optimistic, but the only future I can see is with her. I have no friends, my family treats my like shit but she doesnâ€™t. Itâ€™s just my mind putting me in a state where I think she treats me like shit because I deserve it so I deserve to suffer.

Is this a healthy relationship? I know that if we ever break up Iâ€™m going to kill myself, but I want to change, I want to be the best she can ever have, but I donâ€™t know why.
