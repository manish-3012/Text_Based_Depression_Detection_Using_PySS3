I think I'm ready to dieWell, I am pretty much ready to do it. I've tried fighting my anxiety in every way imaginable. CBT, talk therapy, and now medication. All my medication has done for me is kill my sex drive, turn my memory to shit, and destroy my social skills. I don't know if I'll ever get those back now. Anyway, I have a date and time in mind as to when I'll do it, and a general plan. I just need to get the materials a week in advance and do it. I'm tired of feeling like a zombie, and if stronger medication or hospitalization is the answer, I would much rather be dead. I guess the only reason I'm posting here is maybe there's something to this I'm missing, because I see suicide as a pretty logical option right now.
