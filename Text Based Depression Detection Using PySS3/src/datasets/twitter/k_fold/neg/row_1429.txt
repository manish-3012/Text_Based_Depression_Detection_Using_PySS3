AM DONE, SIGNING OUT!!! :)Wake up every day and it just goes repetitive
Think I need to chill, Think I need incentive
I think depression's finally hittin' me
I think it's finally setting in
Drifting to my feet and settling just like sediment

Coasting and walking down this road called life blindly
Foolishly hoping for purpose to come and find me
In the depths of depressions is where I've been residing
That or in my room under my covers, just hiding

Put my in the grave today
Black suit, wet bouquet
Too scared to leave, but too tired to stay
Bullet in the chamber will stop all the pain
Blood on the wall drips, just like red rain

Feel my soul seep out from each line from the blade
No one sings along to the songs I have made
Deep in thought like Socrates
I am not your property
Treated like a mockery
Glad no one is stopping me
Not why you should idolize, this is my final goodbye
But if I ever hurt you, I truly apologize
