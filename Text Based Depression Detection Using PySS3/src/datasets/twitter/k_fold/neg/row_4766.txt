Iâ€™m a Christian agnosticIâ€™m having existential crisis.

I know I exist, I know absolutely nothing more. I donâ€™t know if everythingâ€™s a dream, itâ€™s probably not, but I donâ€™t know and neither do you. I canâ€™t know anything

As the world is something doesnâ€™t add up and Iâ€™m not sure what. The point is that something in the world isnâ€™t the way I believe it is because when has the world ever cared about what I want to be true? And everything Iâ€™ve been told has logical errors

**Problems with my current understanding God**

*  If God is real and cares why hasnâ€™t he revealed himself when I believe in him and beg him to to reaffirm my beliefs

I can look past suffering, it isnâ€™t gods responsibility to make everything good happen just because he can, but if he truly cares about his followers I doubt he just refuses to answer their calls, I donâ€™t understand why he would do that.

* Why would he want to be worshipped. I donâ€™t want to be worshipped by people Iâ€™m â€œbetter thanâ€ (tougher than, smarter than, etc) nor do I like people he want to be worshipped because they have qualities that make them â€œbetter than meâ€. Why should we be Godâ€™s servants and not his friends? And why does HE want servants and not friends?


* Why are there so many conflicting beliefs? If God wanted to be worshipped or even just wanted friends with the same views as him why are there so many religions with different views


**Problems with science**

* Everything has a creator. Why does the universe not need one? With an omnipotent creator Iâ€™m willing to concede that being able to create themself is one of their abilities but itâ€™s logically inconsistent to argue that for an unconscious universe

* When the DNA of an animal becomes drastically different it becomes infertile and fucked up. Thatâ€™s why mules almost never bare a child. I believe microevolution can happen, but when you look at humans with 46 chromosome pairs and other creatures with different amounts of chromosome pairs, the change in chromosome count should have made something down the line infertile

* Why are the most good people usually religious? Yes thereâ€™s exceptions, but I notice the people who achieve things I actually understand are usually religious. Not even the same religion but religious. I rarely see an atheist who I find personally admirable. Even people like Bill Nye or Stephen Hawking (rest in peace) have said things specifically with the intent of being edgy and triggering religious people.

The people who donâ€™t believe in God that I find respectable are all agnostic (Joe Rogan, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, etc.) who just donâ€™t care what you believe, and I think I personally fall into that category. Itâ€™s a spooky connection between atheists and having weird edgy traits trying to make other people feel bad and I donâ€™t think that can be a coincidence

* Why is the abrahamic God so much more popular than every other God ever despite the fact that itâ€™s been tried to be stomped out countless times?

If any of you are scientists or religious scholars and could help you with my crisis to understand why Iâ€™m here, please do. Iâ€™m not depressed, itâ€™s just scary and Iâ€™d like to know what I should be doing to make the world better before I leave. And knowing why Iâ€™m here is definitely a big part of that

Once again **I am not suicidal** this is just a sub where I believe people will read through and help because people understand the struggles of not understanding why they are here.
