In 26 hours it will be 1 year since I attempted suicide and I don't really feel any different1 year ago I was at Rock bottom and nothing was going good or right. After my attempt I went to therapy which helped and got some more friends, made more memories, found something to study in University (going next fall), my life is on track and I should graduate 2 years earlier than everyone else, I * almost went on my first date, and nothing bad has really happened. But I feel about the same as I did a year ago. I feel sad, empty, and hollow inside. Crying helps sometimes it feels good to get it off of your chest but I just dont care about it anymore. I think I might try again tomorrow but I'm not entirely sure. Don't know what else to say sorry.
