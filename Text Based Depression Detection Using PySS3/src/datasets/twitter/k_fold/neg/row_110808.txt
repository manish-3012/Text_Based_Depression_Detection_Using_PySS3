I hate everyone including myselfWhat's the point of living if no one gives a shit about you. I have no redeeming qualities, my parents don't care about me, I am not even trying in school, and I hate my friends. Everyone I meet is just the fucking same copy and paste generic person, I don't even feel motivated to talk to anyone new. I have never attempted suicide and I don't want to but, I just hate myself so much.
