Never thought I'd be here todayI was in a relationship with a girl since January and everything was going good. Then a few weeks ago she wanted no contact with me for 6 weeks as I had self harmed and she didnt want that in her life as she has a kid. 

I agreed and after 4 days she called me to let me know she was pregnant, and so we started dating again. 

This past Thursday she had called me up and let me know that we are done and she is aborting the child at the end of the month. 

I took some pills that night in an attempt on my life but sadly I woke up.

I feel like nothing is worth it and I feel I may try again to take my life.
