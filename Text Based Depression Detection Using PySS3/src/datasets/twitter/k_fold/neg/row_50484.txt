When Iâ€™m feeling suicidal, I write my suicide notes.Chronic suicidal ideations seems like a punishment for life. Itâ€™s not fair, itâ€™s so hard, every fucking day I have to wake up and convince myself life is worth living. In the moments that I feel suicidal, especially if Iâ€™m alone or at home or something, Iâ€™ll write my notes. Sometimes itâ€™s just one big note. Sometimes itâ€™s letters to everyone I would want to get to say one last thing to. Without fail, this calms my suicidal ideations and ongoing intrusive thoughts pretty well, and puts life into perspective for me. Staple those pages in your journal shut, or throw them away, whatever your heart desires, but they are not meant to be seen by anyone, even future you.
