I'm not really depressed or in a terribly bad situation. I think I have a right to make this choiceThis is going to sound very unorthodox. I'm not depressed I don't feel bad at all, really, I have just come to the realization that the life I want isn't one that's going to happen for me. I've tried to achieve a certain set of goals for a long time now and I haven't been able to reach them. I feel that if I can't have the life I want then I don't really want any of this and would prefer to opt-out of existence. Life doesn't have any inherent meaning or value in of itself. I think life's value is determined by how a person values their own life. I don't value my life and since my life is the most personal thing to me that will ever exist I think that I have the right to be the arbitrator of what happens to it or if it continues. I have simply decided that I want my life to end. There may be a moral objection about how this decision will affect my friends and family. While I don't want them to suffer I don't think they should really get a say over my life and its continence. However, since I don't want them to be haunted by my choice for the rest of their lives I will probably come up with some coverup story and move somewhere far away first. That way it'll just seem like we fell out of touch and that I'm still alive somewhere else. No one asks to be born so I think society's fixation on protecting one's life even if that goes against one's wishes is unjustified.
