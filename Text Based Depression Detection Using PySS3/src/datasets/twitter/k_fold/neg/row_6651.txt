Afraid to get helpAll my life I've been depressed and questioning suicide. I remember being in elementary school wondering if god would forgive me if i killed myself or if i would go to hell.

The only thing that would keep me going was thinking that it would get better. I would tell myself to wait another year. 

My life has gotten better, I'm a senior in my high school,  have plenty of friends and everyone that knows me would say that I'm happy and fun loving. 

I've never told anyone that i was depressed. I already planed how i was going to do it. the only thing is the when. I know its only a matter of time until it happens.

The only thing i do that makes me feel better is exercise. I wake up at 4:50 in the morning to lift everyday. and I wrestle after school.

I based my whole life on going in the Navy, and I'm afraid that if i try to get help then i won't be able to get in.
