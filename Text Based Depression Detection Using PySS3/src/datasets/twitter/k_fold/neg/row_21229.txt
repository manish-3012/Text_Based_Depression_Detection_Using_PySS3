Running away... to die?I was wondering what do you guys think about my plan. 

I'm planning on using rideshare from Craigslist to get a ride as far west as possible. From there, I'll pick a spot somewhere in the mountains or forest and hang myself. 

I've always wanted to die someplace in nature. It's so peaceful and none of my "family" members will ever have to walk in on my lifeless body. It will also decrease the chances of anyone trying to stop me, since I'll be in the middle of nowhere. Best case scenario, I'll never be found. 

Ive been thinking about suicide since I was 9. I've done countless of hours of research and planning to make the ultimate plan. I have also been hospitalized twice already, the most recent was about 3 months ago, yet I still feel like sh*t. In all honesty, I think this is the best way out. I could go into more detail on why I've come to this point, but I doubt anyone would read it. 

Anyways, I just need some advice. Thanks.
