Pain has outweighed hope. Any good videos or advice on suicide?All I have got to say is pain has outweighed hope. I can't imagine being happy. All the times I have been happy it has been temporary. There are certain realities of life that are just so unjust that convinces me living is pointless. The people I have let in have failed me. I have failed me for being unable to validate myself. I don't want to be on this planet it's a waste of time.
