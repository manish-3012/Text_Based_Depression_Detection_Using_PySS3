TiredReally want to kill myself. Lifetime of abuse, suffering from cptsd as a result, still no escape from the abuser no matter how hard I try blah blah blah you know how it is. I want to go out on my own terms instead of staying here to be used and abused forever. It's the kindest, most loving thing I can do for myself at this point, just trust me. 

Please respect my life experience and don't hit me with platitudes or try to talk me down. I know my life and I know what is and isn't possible. In the same way no one would tell a person in chronic unbearable physical pain to stay alive and suffer, don't tell me that about my chronic unbearable psychological pain. Please.

I'm just wondering if it's more peaceful to slice an artery (femoral or carotid) or to hang myself (to block the carotid, not for neck-breaking or strangulation). 

Sorry if this isn't the sub for this question. Please feel free to redirect me.

Thanks.
