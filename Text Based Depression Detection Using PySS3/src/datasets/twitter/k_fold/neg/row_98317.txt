Intrusive thoughtsSo the month of October was the worst month of my life. It started with my girlfriend of a year and a half breaking up with me because she had no more time to give to our relationship due to life choices that she had made involving prioritizing literally everything else over me. Ten days after that one of my friend who was 16 passed away after an a fall while hiking. Because of the stress and trauma my grades have plummeted and there is a class in college that I might fail and I not sure I have the energy to fix it. Additionally earlier in the year my high school band director who was like another mom to me passed away from cancer.

Because of all this I have had thought of suicide that frankly scare me. For example I would find my self wishing that some thing would accidental kill or hurt me. The majority of the thought have been passive ideation but there are a few times that have had thought of actively ending my life. 

I have friends that care about me but are not always available. Additionally I am scared to tell anyone of these thought. I honestly don't think I will do anything but I am scared none the less.
