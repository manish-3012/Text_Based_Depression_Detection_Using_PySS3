Coming to grips with the end of the lineHeaven awaits. It's so hard to come to terms with the end of life. I wish it was easier. I wish I wasn't afraid, but I know what comes next will be easier than living. It has to be. It has to be at least a little better than this. Better than love, better than responsibility, better than anything. Contrary to what many seem to believe, life is not full of surprises. It's full of disappointments. It's made up of struggle and the crushing reality of everyday living. There's nothing to look forward to except fear, monotony, sacrifice, and pain.  If only I could just come to grips with the end, I could be set free. As I am now, I am doomed to do nothing. I'm incapable of adding anything of value, following through with commitments, seeing the bigger picture, and taking care of responsibilities. I'm an embarrassment to myself, and this is no way to live. If I could only come to grips with the end, I could in turn tolerate the risk of a method, and take that shot in the dark that could lead me to oblivion.
