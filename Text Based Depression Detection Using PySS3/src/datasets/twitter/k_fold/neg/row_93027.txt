Bad Dark Day, Just Need Someone To Talk toEverything was going great, every part of my life was top notch and I was excited for the future. My SO is pushing towards a break up out of nowhere, even though I thought we had both been happy and it all started from some ridiculous, no sense making, thoughts. Basically in the end today was the day she said thereâ€™s no future in us. I feel like Iâ€™m left alone in an empty world. That now I am just an empty void. All my chances of future happiness and love are just taken away from me. Thereâ€™s no hope to ever be happy again in the world. I donâ€™t use social media and generally stick to myself and 2 close friends. I donâ€™t have any way of ever even talking to a future girl and I just donâ€™t want to because I know she wonâ€™t be as perfect and a close match. She wonâ€™t make me happy.
