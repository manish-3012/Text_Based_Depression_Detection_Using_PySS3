It came backI lie in my bed and it feels like Iâ€™m sinking, I really shouldnâ€™t have listened to Chesterâ€™s last rendition of crawling. I feel inept to deal with life, like I was born lacking to tools to integrate. I feel alone even though my friends are still sending me memes at 4AM. I often describe my depression as a surprise behemoth that throws itself upon me in a momentâ€™s notice but this time it crept up like a cute kitty and placed itself on my chest. I probably wonâ€™t off it tonight mostly because the weight of it all will not let me off my bed.
