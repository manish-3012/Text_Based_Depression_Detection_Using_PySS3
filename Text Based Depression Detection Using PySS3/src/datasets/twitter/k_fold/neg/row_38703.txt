Nothing is clear right now and i could use someone.It could be a normal thing or I could be going insane- I really don't know. 

I lost the only thing in my life that mattered a few days ago and its hard to put words to what im feeling at this point. For the first three days I felt nothing and did normal things. I made [a post on askreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/tf9ub/my_boyfriend_killed_himself_three_days_ago_and_i/) and really since then I haven't done anything but lay in bed. 

I don't have a future without him. The only real difference between dying soon and dying later is how long I feel this way. I don't know if I'm suicidal- its just logically attractive right now. I mostly came here because I thought there were usually people responding who might know something that I don't. 

I wanted to scream and cry for him but I thought that I felt nothing. I felt normal. I didn't care that he was dead then, I don't care about anything but him now. I still haven't cried. 

If someone could lie to me and say that it'll be okay it would help.
