So I just tried to hang myselfLike the tittle says I just tried to hang myself with my bed sheets. Everything was fine until I started to lose my consciousness. I don't know how I manage to get myself free. My body started shaking and for a good minute I didn't realize what was happening to me It's as if I was in shock. Neck and muscles hurts like hell now. Probably will do it again when pain goes away but next time I will make sure to do something to not be able to get free again.
