Not fair.My abusive ex who raped me, stalked me and tried to kill me and always had the charges dropped with help of his family has been using the police to harass me. He moved out after a long drawn out process fuck tenants rights in California. Youâ€™d think you can evict someone faster for having been arrested for hitting you but itâ€™s so hard. The last month the cops have been questioning me and treating me like a criminal for him saying I stole his property and everything. They never once helped with him. The DA dropped the charges on a plea deal for a dui and I had a scar for months on my head. Just fuck all this how am I ever supposed to be free of him. He sends threatening texts and the cops tell me itâ€™s a civil issue. Yet he can call them on me non stop. Then his mom goes and tells everyone Iâ€™m calling cops and harassing them. I just canâ€™t do it anymore. I canâ€™t.
