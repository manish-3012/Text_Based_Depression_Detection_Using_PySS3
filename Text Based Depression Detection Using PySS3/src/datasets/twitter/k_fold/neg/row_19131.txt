Hi folksI am suffering a side affect of the drug neurotin. The suicide sort of one's. I am a healthy sound adult and I know this is not forever. I am totally healing. What I need is information. I would like to speak on the phone with bored people in chronic pain. I can't use technology well. Picture a sick old man in the body of 34 year old man in tears. For tomorrow though. It'll be hard but I love the world and that helps.
