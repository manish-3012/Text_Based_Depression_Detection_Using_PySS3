Creeping thoughts.Suicidal thoughts keep creeping up on me... I posted here about a month ago saying how I want to die before I hit 18, so I don't have to lose my childhood... along with other things, insecurities, pain, loneliness, fear of staying alone forever, all of that good stuff. I get depressed a lot, but the suicidal thoughts are getting worse. I don't wanna be called an "adult". I'm responsible like one, but I'm not fully developed yet... I don't know... anyway, getting off topic... I want to die this year. Before 18, as things will get harder for me. I don't want to hurt my dad or people close to me but I don't want to live anymore. I'm sorry. And... I know legally... 18 is an adult... but what are your guys thoughts on that... cause I know it sounds stupid but I'm so depressed... do you think 18 is still somewhat not grown up?

Thank you everyone, mess of a post, I know. But I need help. I feel so desperate for comfort, yet equally desperate to die. From Josh.
