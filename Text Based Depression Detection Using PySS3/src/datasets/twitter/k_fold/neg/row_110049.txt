Completely alone struggling with declining mental illnessI'm so tired. I am not even sure if I'll have enough energy to finish this post. Basically, I am a mid-20s female with no friends or family. My parents have both passed away, and I've kind of just been drifting from place to place. I feel like I will never be in a stable home of my own, I'll never have a family, people who care about me.

It's hard for me to connect to people. I know it sounds weird, but I've always felt like I was a different species as everyone else. Like I was missing some gene that meant I was human. It's hard for me to process emotions and I hate being touched. I drop things and break things and people have no tolerance for me. My coworkers will laugh and tease me because I don't understand that they are joking. And other than that, people pretend I just don't exist. 

I feel like I am cursed. Cursed to always be misunderstood, disliked, unlovable. I am this invisible thing that exists just to take up space. And my whole life has been pretty exhausting. Being abandoned one by one until no one is left. Life has just always been hard for me. And I'm so tired. What's the point?

Sure, things COULD POSSIBLY get better one day. But why should I continue to suffer on a chance so miniscule? 

Idk. Even writing this out feels really dumb. Like, anyone will really care. Idk. Maybe I'll just kill myself. I think it will be easier
