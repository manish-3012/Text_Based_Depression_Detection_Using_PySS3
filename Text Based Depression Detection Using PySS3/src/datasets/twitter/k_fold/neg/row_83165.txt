Haven't revised for a college exam I have in 9 daysI had a month to do some solid revision, but I instead decided to use it up playing video games. 

I feel so pathetic. I feel like I can't change. I feel like I can't do the things I want to do.

I want to revise. I want to study and do well. But I have a feeling that I'll just go back to playing video games tomorrow, watching YouTube, and doing nothing.
