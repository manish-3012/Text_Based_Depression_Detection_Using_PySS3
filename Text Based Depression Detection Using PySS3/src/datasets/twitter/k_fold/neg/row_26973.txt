Feeling overwhelmed, would appreciate a little help.Hello. This is a throwaway account.

I am young, close to eighteen years old, and I have been having trouble coping with my own mental instability and outside sources of stress.

I hallucinate, badly--to the point of having full-blown panic attacks. I can force myself through a day at school, but being around people is not only nauseating, but terrifying. I know that I need some sort of help, but not only can my family not afford any sort of treatment, the last time I went to my parents out of concern for my mental health they didn't believe me.

I've had episodes of mild hallucinations previously, but they've never been so prolonged or so severe. The people I usually talk to have not been responding to my calls or messages, and the person I trust the most and who has seen me through this before told me that he didn't believe me anymore--about anything.

I'm feeling lost and alone, and I would appreciate some advice. Feel free to ask questions, I will answer them as best I can.

Thank you for your time, 

konvers8 or Sparrow.

**EDIT:** (Because I forgot to mention things.)

I have struggled with depression and self-harm before and have had thoughts of suicide, but they had gone away until the hallucinations started up again. Now I feel as though I have no other options and as if I deserve what I'm going through. I think about killing myself often now, because at the moment it seems like a better alternative than anything else right now.
