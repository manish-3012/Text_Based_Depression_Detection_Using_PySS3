Iâ€™m going to kill myself. Thanks COVID. I could have been so much but you have ruined the world.Fucking COVID. I could have met so many new people and had so much fun, but Iâ€™m shut in my fucking house all day doing online uni because of this FUCKING virus. And they say itâ€™s going to be like this forever?! Fuck this, Iâ€™d rather die. No point carrying on. I think Iâ€™d be better off ending it now.
