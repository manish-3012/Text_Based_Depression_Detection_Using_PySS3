I fantasize about suicide.I don't think I would ever put my family through the pain of me committing suicide, but I think about it a lot. I see things and think about how I could be killed by it. Cars, trains, electric tracks, guns, pills... etc. Some days/weeks are worse than others. But sometimes the first thing I think of when I wake up is ending my life. Honestly, I'm hoping for a terminal disease. Best of both worlds, won't have the guilt of fucking my family, and it would be my ticket off of this planet.

On bad nights, I come here and just read. It helps, and I just wanted to thank you all for the support you offer to complete strangers.
