I wrote this last night.. I don't believe in anything anymore. [NSFL]"I havent yet decided how to do it.  I could OD on those pills... which i doubt would happen.  I think i'll just take like 10 of them and either just go to sleep with my car running in the garage.  Or i could tie my arm up, pump my first to see where my vein is and i would have to cut damn near the wrist up to my inner elbow, untie the rubber tube/belt or whatever and the blood should just pour out of me.  I'm leaning toward falling asleep in my car simply because the 10 inch slice would hurt really bad  and if i stayed quiet i could bleed to death over night. I hope i don't wake up tomorrow."

Those were my thoughts right before going to sleep last night. For background information i'm 24 male student.
