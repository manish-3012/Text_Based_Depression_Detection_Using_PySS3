They say turning 18 is one of the things to look forward to..How I spent my 18th birthday a few weeks ago? On my knee, praying for hours that my friend that got shot is safe and makes it out alive, but sadly she didn't. and ever since that day i've been hoping to see the bigger picture.

I don't think I can live with this grief for longer.
