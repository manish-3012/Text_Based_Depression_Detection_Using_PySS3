Please, please let me pass away in my sleep tonight.I've been through the whole process: therapy, medication, self help books, exercise, whatever. None of it helps. 

I've dropped out of community college 3 times because I don't have the motivation to do the work. I'm just realizing after 5 months that I hate my esthetics school. I'm broke, I have no lucrative skills, I'm gaining weight because all I do is eat and sleep.



I'm 22 years old and feel like an 80 year old on the inside. I'm always fatigued. I feel like any day could be my last and I'm surprisingly okay with that. I just don't think I was made with the same mental fortitude most people have to push through hard times. I can't do it anymore. I've given up. I am constantly sad or empty inside and I am so sick of it. So fucking sick.


I would end it all today if it weren't for my crippling fear of death. I'm too much of a coward to even make that decision. I did take a considerable amount of my clonazepam but I doubt it'll do anything. Here's to hoping.
