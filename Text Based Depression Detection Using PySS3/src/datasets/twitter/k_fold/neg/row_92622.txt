To me, suicide IS the answer.I'm 20 years old and going to college. Been depressed since I was in second grade but have only recently gone to counseling (which has done nothing for me as the therapist I have, as well as the last only tried to push their own ideals into my life without really getting to know me.) I've been EXTREMELY depressed ever since sometime in the summer and I've created a good list of reasons for me to kill myself, and to me, they greatly outweigh the reasons I shouldn't.

Why I Should:

1. I'm Unhappy

2. My EX Girl Friend dropped out of college, possibly because of a fight we had on Facebook, haven't talked to her since, she has depression problems too and may even hurt herself, if she does I feel no reason to live as I am still intensely in love with her.

3. An old friend from elementary school told me that I ruined his life by getting him into drugs, (weed), which he claims made him a drug addict.

4. I have extremely terrible soul crushing OCD and violent intrusive thoughts.

5. All my friends have left me.

6. Doing poorly in classes.

7. Know that if I don't do it now I will do it later when I'm in inevitably worse situations.

8. Running out of money, I only have about $200's left for this year.

9. 20 and balding already.

10. I find it nearly impossible to talk to people anymore. People I knew last year, when I try to talk to them I get all mumblely and quite. 

11. It will prevent all future pain.

Reasons Not To.

1. It will hurt my family

2. It will get better (DANGEROUSLY OPTIMISTIC)
