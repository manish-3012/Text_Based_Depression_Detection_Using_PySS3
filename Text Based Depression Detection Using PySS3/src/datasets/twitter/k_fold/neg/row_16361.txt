What is the point?What is the point of going on... Seriously...

I've already survived one attempt, nothing has gotten better. Still alone, no one cares, absolutely NOTHING has changed and will ever change. Why should I live? Someone else could have my job and live in my flat and actually enjoy life. I'm just a miserable waste of space and air. 

Sooner or later I'll try again and hopefully succeed, just feel down as fuck atm and felt a vent was needed... No one listens or cares anyway so this place is as good as any...
