[21M] Kinda just wanna take a drive and just not comebackTo be honest i dont know why im writing this. But im just tored of everything. Constant never feeling like im good enough and constant overthinking of every minor detail but absolutely no thought put in to my future or anything that does matter. Im tired of feeling like i have to try to get peoples love or im just gonna forgotten about. Im tired of feeling like i have to be the voice of reason when my friends have their issues but no one seems to actually give a shit about mine. Im tired of the insomnia followed by sleeping for hours. Im tired of drug abuse just to try and feel good for a night and then being fine for a week and then going back to my depression. Like I just dont wanna care anymore. I know the reason i do half the shit i do and anytime i try and help my friends with their shit its just to try and convince myself it makes me happy. I have work at 4am and litterally all i wanna do right now is take a drive on this sketchy ass highway and just pray that my car finally breaks and just takes me off it.
