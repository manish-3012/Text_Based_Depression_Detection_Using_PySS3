No one understands how much I need to die I have to. It's the only way. There is nothing on earth to live for. I have nothing. Nobody. All you fuckers will say I have family or friends I DONT. you can't lie to me and say that.  I don't want to meet someone worth it either.  All the people i like end up making me feel miserable.  I can never be happy. I am nothing. I have no skills, no talents, no remarkable traits.  I don't want a job. I don't want a home. I just want to die. That's it. That's all I want. That's the only thing.
