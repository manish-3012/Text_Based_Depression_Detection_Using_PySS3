Pros and cons of killing myselfHello everyone,

I am at an extreme loss. I don't know what to do with myself. I have just been in this funk for too long. I feel so spoiled for considering suicide as an option. I am not good at anything and I'm a financial liability to my parents. I'm getting mediocre grades at a private liberal arts college. They have sacrifice their lives for me and I just feel so selfish. Why am I existing? 

I just feel like I cannot get out of my current situation. I'm also unattractive so I am tired of people treating me like I am subhuman. People always tell me it gets better but it's getting worse and worse for me. No one else cares that I am alive. That is the reality. I feel like I can't breathe anymore there is no room to live a life.

Here is my list.

PROs

I will be saving my parents money in the long run.
I won't feel depressed living this life anymore.
My siblings won't have to live with a depressed failure.
People won't have to be around me.

CONs
My mother would be hurt. 

I don't know. I'm at a loss.
