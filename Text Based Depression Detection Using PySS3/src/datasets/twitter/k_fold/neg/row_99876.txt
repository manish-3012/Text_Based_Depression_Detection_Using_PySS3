I want to dieI've always felt like there was something wrong with me. When I was a kid my dad used to beat up me and my mom and when he finally left both he and my mother blamed me for everything. I always grew up with the thought that if I didn't exist my parents would still be happy together you know? That if they had any other child but me it would have been different. I know that that is really stupid to think about but I find myself unable to think differently no matter how hard I try. When I was 14 I was diagnosed with bipolar type 1 and depression after I tried to commit suicide after losing my first love.  I was in and out of mental hospitals and rehab from 14-18 but through it all I always figured life was eventually going to get better and things did get a little better. I was still behind when it came to school but I met the girl of my dreams and it was great until my self destructive habits came back. I started doing drugs again and I treated her like shit. I hurt her terribly and we aren't even really friends now. My life came crashing down almost immediately after. I got kicked out of my house for a time and dropped out of school completely until recently when I decided to re enroll. I decided to go somewhere out of town because i figured with a fresh start I could make things different and I currently live alone I am 21 and I've developed a hardcore pornography addiction that I just can't seem to break and have more recently ventured into dangerous territory with rape and pedophilia which I know is extremely wrong. I don't know why I am suddenly into these things and it makes me feel so much like i'm a piece of trash. I have really poor social skills and with my recent interests I have stopped going out all together for things not work/school related. I am at the point where I cannot look at a woman or a child without feeling shame in myself and I have chosen to lock myself away for the most part to avoid it as I have no idea what to do about it. I used to love to play online video games but i'm actually so afraid of speaking to people that I find myself unable to play anything at all recently. I am currently at a point in my life where I feel like I must be one of the worst humans alive. Due to my poor social skills and since I am so far from the rest of my family I really feel alone all the time. I really don't see how I can fix myself especially with my recent interests I feel like people like myself don't deserve to live. I don't know what to do anymore and I have lost almost all hope.
