Only now realizing that I've already given upNow that I'm a legal adult I feel even more pressure to succeed than before, and yet constantly I feel as if I cannot complete the simplest tasks. I can't get off my ass and write my resume. I can't go out and get a job. I can't find someone who understands my situation as well as maybe two or three friends and even they can only help so much. And I realized, on the way to ask my dad for money to go to the movies, that I've already given up. I can't see myself getting a job and moving on because I can't see myself doing ANYTHING. I don't feel like I can make myself a future. I don't think I can do anything to save myself anymore. I honestly see myself dead soon if this keeps up, because I feel no drive to do anything except to escape this fucking farce of a life.
