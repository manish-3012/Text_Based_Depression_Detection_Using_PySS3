I don't know how much more I can handleThe constant rollercoaster we call life seems to have almost reached the end of the ride. While waiting for my girlfriend to have surgery done due to a miscarriage, I was looking at pictures on her phone of our first and only born child. I came across videos of her and another man. I am completely numb and have been think of ways to end it. And on top of this I'm about to get fired from the best job I've ever had due to a technicality. I just don't see life getting any better, and I don't know if I want to wait on it to get better anymore. Please help me....
