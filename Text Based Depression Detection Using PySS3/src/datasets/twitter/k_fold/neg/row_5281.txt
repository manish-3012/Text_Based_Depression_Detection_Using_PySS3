Absolutely freaking out right now with no one to talk toIt's the finals period and I'm so stressed out there's nothing I can do about it. I want to slice my thighs up so badly to chase that dopamine rush but I simply don't have the time to clean up the mess. And I'm certain no one I know wants to hear about the bleak thoughts running through my head so I'm stuck here bursting at the seams while doing calculus. I really can't watch myself descend to the point I lose my scholarship and get kicked out of university so I'm going to just kill myself if I can't get decent grades this semester. Say all you want about me feeling entitled or how this is a first-world problem but I'm tired, really fucking tired, and irredeemably broken with no actual purpose, motivation or function. I'm not a good person nor have I ever wanted to be one, so I'm not even someone people want alive in this world. In the end I'm just a bag of flesh and blood and bones so it'll mean absolutely nothing if I offed myself. But then again, I'm too afraid of not existing so I'm probably going to chicken out and continue suffering until I get lucky and a freak accident takes me out.
