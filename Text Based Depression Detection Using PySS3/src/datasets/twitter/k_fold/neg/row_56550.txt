I'm fucked. I'm completely fucked25 year old male, never had a girlfriend, porn addict, repo'd car, no college or skills, work a part-time minimum wage job, no social group, short, overweight, mediocre IQ and a very passive person.

My only redeeming quality is that I have a pretty good looking face. Women are attracted to me, but I'm a spineless, coward. The only time I'm ever approached by women is at parties or bars(which I barely go to, unless my brother offers).

I can see it now. Me going through life, never actually getting the chance to say that I dated a girl who I found attractive, in my 20's, doomed to spend the rest of my life in regret and anger. I'm a chicken, though. Even if I read a girl and see that she's totally into me, I NEVER grow the balls to say anything, cause rejection would actually destroy the little piece of me that I still like about myself. 

Suicide is on my mind everyday. Just feels like I have nothing going for me. I'm a fucking loser. Just seeing happy people out there with social lives and dating options makes me boil with anger and frustration. I just wish I was born a different person.

I'm a subhuman who deserves to die
