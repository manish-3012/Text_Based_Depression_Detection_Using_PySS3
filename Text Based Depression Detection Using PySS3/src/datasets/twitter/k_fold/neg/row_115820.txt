anyone else numb?anyone else just don't care? Like, its hard for me to explain but like, i hate my existence and its one big circle i want to put an end too... but it doesn't feel like anything. I don't have any emotion or feeling anymore I have no energy like, most of the time i don't know what to do or how to react. I am also starting to notice im getting more and more insecure about my body and saying"im too skinny" bc thats what everyone tells me, it triggers me and holds me back but im not going anywhere in life so why let it? lmao. i needed to write this so at least someone knows how i feel
