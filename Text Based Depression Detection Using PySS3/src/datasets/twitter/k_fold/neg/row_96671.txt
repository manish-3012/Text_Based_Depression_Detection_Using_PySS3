I'm going to end my life if I'm alone again on Valentine's DayI know it seems minor or stupid to others. I've been told that. But It's not just this Valentine's Day. It's every one for over 40 years. It's every birthday, every Christmas, every single holiday. I've never been with someone, never had a gift that I didn't buy for myself. If that's what makes you happy, great. For me, it's excruciating. 

I've lived as fully and gone as far as I can alone. The only thing I ever wanted from life was to be loved by a significant other and bear a child. Neither of these things will happen, not for me, not now. It doesn't "get better." No amount of time changes anything. In fact, a lot of things have gotten worse. 

I bought a gun and closed out all my accounts, as of the end of the month. No one real will miss me or notice I'm gone. It's not really that comforting to have a hard stop and know when it's coming, but at least I know it is and I won't have to be alone for much longer.
