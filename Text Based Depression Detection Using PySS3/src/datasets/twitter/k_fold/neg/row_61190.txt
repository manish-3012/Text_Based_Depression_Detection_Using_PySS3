I found a letter today.I've tried to commit suicide 4 times this year, the latest being 10/11. I'm cleaning my house because I'm moving soon and I found a hidden compartment in my closet. I had totally forgotten it. It says 

"1/25/18  almost 3 months since the mental hospital. Things are slowly getting better. I found love but realised it was only my crippling need for attention. Theres not much to live for. But I promised dad I'd stay around for a bit. Till next time 
~â™¡ B" 

To think just 3 days later I tried to kill myself. This is honestly a wake up call to me and I don't know really.
