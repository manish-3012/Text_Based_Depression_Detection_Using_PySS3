Tired of not being normal like everyone else.I genuinely think my life is not worth as much as anyone elseâ€™s. I have so much shit that I have in my head that makes it so fucking difficult for me to even function in society. I feel like itâ€™s not even worth it at this point to go through so much fucking trouble for me to just plain live. 
I have issues with my health that probably should be seen by a doctor but nope. My anxiety prevents me from doing this shit. My depression tells me thereâ€™s no fucking point either. 
If I was a normal person, Iâ€™d be able to see a doctor, a dentist, a fucking HAIRDRESSER with no issue. 
But these are things that are genuinely so hard for me to do that I just say forget it. 
There are so many other things contributing to my general unhappiness with life. So basically, Iâ€™m exhausted with living. All 2 people in my life (my parents) would probably be happier without having to treat me like a fucking five year old. 
I wanna be gone so bad.
