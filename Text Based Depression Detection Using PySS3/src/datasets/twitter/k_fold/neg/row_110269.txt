Anyone else feel at ease knowing youâ€™re going to kill yourself?I am going to kill myself fairly soon, I just have to finish sorting out shit for the aftermath such as my debts and personal items. I donâ€™t want any burdens I have to be put onto a family member so I am making sure everything is straight. I have also been writing down my thoughts for them to see and hopefully understand why I had to kill myself. 

I feel very much more at ease knowing I will end it all. Iâ€™m less stressed, I feel at ease and more comfortable. I feel great knowing that there is indeed an exit button and I am going to soon be out of it. Any inconvenience  I have now, I brush off because it really wonâ€™t matter soon! 

Does anyone else feel this way?
