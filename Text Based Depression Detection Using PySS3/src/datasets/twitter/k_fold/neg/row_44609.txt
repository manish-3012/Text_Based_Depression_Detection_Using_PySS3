Am I ungrateful?So I've been reading through some of the posts and I've noticed that a lot of people have some very real problems and reasons for feeling that ending their life is the only way. Then I compare my own issue and feel as though I have zero reason to feel the way I do. You see I am completely healthy, I just finished this semester in college with a 4.0, I have over $12,000 in the bank and a full ride scholarship. My family loves me and I really have no other problems except for one. My first girlfriend whom I dated for only 3 months recently got into a new relationship a year after we broke up. I reached out to her telling her that I love her and am sorry for all the mistakes I made. She ended up blocking my number and all social media even though she called me right before and made me promise that I wouldn't hurt myself. All I want to is be back together will her because I love her but I can't bring myself to come to terms with reality. I don't want anyone else and the thought of her with someone else gets to me. I've stopped caring about anything, choosing to be alone most of the time and barely eating 1000 calories a day. Everyday I think about ways I could kill myself but then I think wow besides this one thing, millions of people would kill to have my life (no pun intended). Problem is I cannot go to any therapy or get any medication because for one thing I don't want to worry my mom, she already worries enough and can't sleep at night because of it. And I can't get medication because it will ruin my career in the Army. I've tried talking to friends but they just either get sick of how pathetic I seem or give me the same generic "It'll get better". I honestly don't know what to do with my life. My faith has certainly been tested. On one hand I want to believe God has a plan for me, on the other hand I feel as though the solution is in my hands. All I really want is for my ex to talk to me but she just won't, and its all I need.
