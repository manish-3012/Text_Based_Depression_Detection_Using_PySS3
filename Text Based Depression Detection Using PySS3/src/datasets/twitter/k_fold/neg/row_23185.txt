welpevery day i find it harder and harder to keep myself from jumping off my balcony. im not interested in the things i used to pour my heart and soul into. im failing all my classes. not sure if iâ€™m isolating myself from my friends or if theyâ€™re doing it to me. i actually self harmed for the first time in 4 years a month ago and iâ€™ve been doing it ever since. i havenâ€™t had a low point this bad since i was 14 LIKE EVERYTHING FEELS LIKE ITS GOING WRONG 

i honestly donâ€™t know what to do at this point. maybe dropping out of college will help me because that seems like my only option at this point, thereâ€™s no way i can bounce back based on how iâ€™m doing now...
