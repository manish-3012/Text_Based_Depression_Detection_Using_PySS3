Can someone please help me?I cant stop crying. 

Backstory: I lost my virginity last year, i hooked up with about 30 guys with a couple that almost turned into something. I was raped during this time and a lot of memories from childhood molestation came back. I decided to stop sleeping around and started using exercise to deal with my depression and I went on some dates, went out with this guy for about a month and it just ended last night. 

I was so happy while we were dating and it felt good to be in a relationship. It was great having someone to go out with and go on double dates with and dance with and eat and watch Netflix with. And now I'm alone again.

This time it's different. A lot of guys have used me for sex and one guy even called me a sex toy before ending things with me, but I felt like things were working with this guy.

I felt like I was going to kill myself last night but normally I can sleep it off, but it's almost noon and I'm still thinking about it. I've been crying through my classes and I'm so overwhelmed. If no one finds me worth more than sex, how am I supposed to feel about myself? 

I think im ready to die.
