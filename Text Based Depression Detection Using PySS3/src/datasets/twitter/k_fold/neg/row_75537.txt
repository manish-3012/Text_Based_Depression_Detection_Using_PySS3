I don't want to kill myself anymore. But I'm the worst I've ever been.I realised that I am going to die.  
  
My mum died at age 18.  
  
she was my entire world.  
That is 18 years growing up with someone that loved me more than life iteself.  
  
before I turned 23 (age now)  
i expected everyone to love me unconditionally.  
  
i learn now that not everyone loves unconditionally.  
i will never replace my mother.  
i will never replace her love for me.  
i will never replace the home she gave to me.  
  
i cling to my childhood memories.  
it is hard to accept that the world i grew up in as a child,  
that the world my mother presented to me,  
that the things she said were true,
are not in fact true,  
and i am alone,  
it is up to me to make the life i want for myself,  
and she is gone.  
she is never coming back.  
i am alone.  
i am alone to make a world that i vision for myself,  
and one day,   
i will die too,  
and the world i envisioned for myself,  
in the world i created in my mothers place,  
will also mean nothing.  
i will mean nothing.  
my mum will mean nothing.  
the last atoms of our existence will be burned up by a fuel of hydrogen.  
  
i want to die.  
and i want to mean more.  
someone help me  
please
