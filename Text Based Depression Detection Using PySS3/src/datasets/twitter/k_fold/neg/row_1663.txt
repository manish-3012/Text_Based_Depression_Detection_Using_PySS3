I'm not doing so well, just thinking of how much time wasted dealing with my migraines, panic attacks, anxiety and wasting my wife's time.I'm not at a good place right now. I suffered a injury 2 years ago and feel like everything has been put on hold and now having a kid is out of range as we are in our late 30's. I've mistreated my wife by ignoring her needs and basically not doing any of my husband duties when it comes to affection (no sex drive for me and the medication makes it so i can't even finish. My wife deserves better than me.

She deserves to be happy and I know she is not wife how I've been MIA for the last 2 years and I feel like our conversations only involve my problems and never my wife's. I have been having extreme difficulty speaking to people over the phone. I start having shortness of breath and start basically stuttering to the point my wife has to speak to the person.

I've been kicked off of WorkSafe (workers compensation) for the last year and was told that my medical problems weren't work related even though I've never had a panic attack or migraines before my accident (fell at work)

I just feel like if somehow we can get pregnant then I can just bow out and end it as I know I'm just a burden to my wife, so she can focus on being a mother, something shes always wanted.

I just broke down today, my wife's been working from home due to COVID and she went to the office for the first time in a long time. I can't do this.
