I don't believe there are "good" times AND bad timesI'm sick of the "change your perspective". I'm really pissed right now and I want to phlebotomize myself. Life is shit! It's been fucking shit for a long-ass time.

Yknow how therapists ask you how you would like to be in 5 years time? 
At this point, I can't even see a tomorrow.
