Got word about transferThey are working on getting me into the hospital I want to get into but I'm not medically cleared yet so I wait. I am still refusing to eat. I haven't had a morsel of food since lunch yesterday. Wondering how long it will be before they notice. 

Feeling numb and suicidal but...calm at the same time.

That is my update for now. I am talking to my "sitter" now and having a nice chat. We are talking about life and stuff...and credit cards.

I need to go for a walk and chill.

I Will update later.
