I cannot see the pointI made a new account for this. Life is just shit and I hate living. I just want to die and I think the only reason I haven't just killed myself already is because I can't do it to my parents. I am a teenager in Sweden and I barely have any real friends. I hate just about everything, myself, almost all fucking people. Everyone just sucks, I don't want to be around people but I don't want to be alone. I want nothing, nothing more than to just die. It's almost 4 in the morning and I can't sleep.

I constantly think about how I would kill myself. I don't want any chance of survival because I don't want to survive and deal with the aftermath. All relatives I hate feeling sorry for me and being sad. I know people care for me but at the same time I don't. Life just sucks. I also think about what i would write in my suicide note aswell and how I would say goodbye to everyone without giving anything away.

I don't think I will ever kill myself because I don't have the balls. I just wish more people would invite me to stuff and want to do things with me. But I am just a fat lazy fucking loser playing video games all day and talking to my one of my few real friends on Skype. When he isn't at parties and shit that I don't get invited to. I mean sometimes I do but not very often. Well this text is just I fucking mess but it's mostly for me to read to myself to see how I actually feel, I  think. Good luck with life everyone, I think I failed it
