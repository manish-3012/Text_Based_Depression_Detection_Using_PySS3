I don't know what to doMy problem is that people love me but i don't love them. I don't think i want to kill myself but i don't want to live. 

Heres the thing. I'm only 12. I'm really mature for my age, but my life sucks because everybody treats me like a retarded 4 year old because i have ADD. Mabye i'm too young to have these feelings, but i know i need help, though i don't want to go to a theripist. I don't need help from sombody, i just need sombody who can truthfuly say they understand my pain.
