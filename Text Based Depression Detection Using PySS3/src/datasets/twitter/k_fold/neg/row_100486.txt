No one wants to deal with sad people, but get angry when they decide to do something about it.Iâ€™ve reached out to people before and they just get hurt. They canâ€™t handle it because itâ€™s too much or too sad or they donâ€™t have the time. Itâ€™s honestly fine. I understand that no one is obligated to listen to me or give me any of their time, but I know these will be the same people who will be upset if Iâ€™m gone. My sadness is so inconvenient that theyâ€™d rather me stay sad and destructive for the rest of my life than have to deal with any of it. There is no fix for my problems and I feel like itâ€™s selfish for them to want me alive when they know just how awful I feel. They donâ€™t have to help me, but they shouldnâ€™t get mad when I try to help myself.

More context: Iâ€™ve also done therapy for 3 years and been on multiple meds for depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I exercise, practice self-care, and try to do my hobbies when I can pull myself out of bed. I have tried everything else to fix myself. I worked really hard just to keep falling to the same low point.
