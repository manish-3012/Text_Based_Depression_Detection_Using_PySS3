I hate the hypocrisy of "My body, my choice". We can commit a genocide against unborn children who cannot consent. However, when I consent to ending my life, I'm a bad guy.We need to either have universal healthcare where everything is covered (dental, mental, etc), or assisted suicide.  These two cannot exist together, for one cancels out the other.  Allowing people to end their lives on their own terms should be legalized and okay.  This double standard is inhumane.
