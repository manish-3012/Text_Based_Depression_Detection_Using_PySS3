Merry Christmas! Please open this thread up!Suicide is my song
Every single day
Dreaming of my death
Faking all the way

My face just makes me sick
I just want to die
What fun it is my slit myself
On this day tonight

[Chorus]

A day or two ago
I thought i'd take a ride
And soon, Miss Afterlife
Was seating/ed by my side!

I'm thin and frankly plain
Misfortune is my lot
I wish I was just dead
And never ever born

[Chorus]

A day or two ago
The story I must tell
I went out on a whim
And oh fuck there she was

She was with a "friend"
While holding hands with him
She looked at me and said hello
But quickly walked away

[Chorus]

My friends are all alright
They are outside tonight
With their Special Ones
Cuddling tonight

I am all alone
Without any pride
Making sure I won't surivive 
Every single night

Chorus:

Kill myself, Kill myself
Suicide all the way
Oh what fun it is to cry
On a fine and sunny day, hey!

Kill myself, Kill myself
Suicide all the way
Oh what fun it is to cry
On a fine and sunny day
