No point anymoreItâ€™s been years and I still for some reason just do not like myself. Iâ€™ve lost everything and still hate how I look. Iâ€™m fat at 140 have wide gross hips for a guy I have no future ahead of me. After everything Iâ€™m surprised Iâ€™m still here but I always imagined my death would be peaceful and fast. At this point Iâ€™m fine with my fate being tonight or tomorrow. Im currently researching good pills to get to sleep and hopefully forever
