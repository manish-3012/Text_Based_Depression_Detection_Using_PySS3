Hotlines and chats donâ€™t work for me. I donâ€™t want to talk to a stranger with canned responsesI donâ€™t have any friends anymore and my family and I are estranged. I canâ€™t afford therapy since Iâ€™m turning 26 and I donâ€™t have anyone to listen to me. Iâ€™ve thought about using a hotline before but even posting on reddit for help seems tiresome and pointless.

I get why suicide hotlines are so popular but it just isnâ€™t for me. Itâ€™s just not possible for a stranger to give a shit about another stranger and I canâ€™t vent knowing on the other end they really donâ€™t care. And if they did itâ€™s shallow because they donâ€™t actually know me. Iâ€™m not in their monkeysphere. I need someone to listen to me but you canâ€™t do that with someone youâ€™re ready to forget about and wonâ€™t care to talk to again. 

Iâ€™ve tried using online chat and they take so long to get connected or even respond. Half the time theyâ€™re completely useless and canâ€™t even think of a response that isnâ€™t an obvious solution or anything that makes me feel better.
