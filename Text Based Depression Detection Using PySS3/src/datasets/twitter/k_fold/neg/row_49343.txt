PTSD and discovery. Time to go.I was diagnosed with PTSD ages ago but I could never figure out what the he'll triggered it. No one traumatic had even happened.  I couldn't place it until my mom fell out of contact. 

She used to be deep in drugs and disappear for long times. I was about 3 when this started. My grandmother who help raised me just made it worse with her negative talk. I would spiral into intense anger and depression. It was a sight. 

Today, things are a lot better. I'm pretty sure she's clean from the hard stuff but she still occasionally vanishes. 

I want to die than relive this shit.  If I had a method I'd do it. I am considering alcohol poisoningbecause that is all I got.  It's shitty but my only question option. Im hurting so much, I can't do this forever. 

 I'm gonna run out.
