Lost my wallet, lost my keys, lost my girlfriend, pretty damn close to losing my mind.I was way depressed over losing my wallet, with $1100 in it, so my friends kidnapped me and got me drunk. Somewhere in that foray, I lost my keys. Then the next day, I wanted some sympathy snuggles, and just totally got shunted into the friend zone.

I have bipolar disorder as well, and was already on a downswing to a depressive phase.

I'm actually afraid of myself right now. They say once you start making plans, you should worry. Well, I have a plan and I've already put it into motion. I need a serious hug.

EDIT:

Thanks for your support guys. I think the crisis is over. I was able to talk it out, and I got a hug.
