I have a lump on my neck and I kind of want it to be cancerousOver the past week, a lump has grown on my neck pretty rapidly. Most likely it'll be a swollen lymph node that's infected, but I'm secretly hoping it'll be cancer. It'll be easier if that kills me instead of myself. At the very least, I'll have some more time to think about shit. I don't think I could ever go through with killing myself even though I want to so badly. I've had frequent suicidal thoughts for the past six years and I don't have any motivation for anything. Literally all I enjoy anymore is t.v., reddit, and videogames. I'm 24 years old and I just want to play videogames all the time because it seems to be one of the few things I get some enjoyment out of still. I've tried connecting with people over the last few years, and I had a gf for a little while. None of it ever really satisfied me. There were a couple of people I've found myself really drawn to that I wanted to spend way more time with. Unfortunately, the feeling has never really been reciprocal. So, I just end up being alone. And I'm fucking lonely. I know how I'd like to go if I ever did decide to off myself. Some days, it seems I'm a lot closer to that point and then other days I just lay in bed hoping for something better, dreaming for a better life. I want a better life somehow, and I've had opportunities to do so and some major support from my parents. What else can I say? Probably a lot but none of it really seems to matter. Just a bunch of trivial details and me being whiny.
