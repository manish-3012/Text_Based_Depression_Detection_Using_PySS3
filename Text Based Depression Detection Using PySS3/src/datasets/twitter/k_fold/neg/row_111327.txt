I feel like I was never supposed to be aliveidk I just feel like some people were put on earth by mistake or something and I'm one of these people. I've never been passionate about anything, I've just floated around. Never had a best friend or anyone who truly hates me, just nothing. I feel like if I left I wouldn't miss much. Nothing particularly bad or good has happened to me so I don't know what's happening. I don't feel strong emotions 75% of the time and then there will be a week to a month or so where I feel EVERYTHING and I make plans to kill myself but by the time I have everything in order I don't feel so emotional and I'm not even 100% sure I even felt that way in the first place. I might end it just so I can get out of this weird cycle :/
