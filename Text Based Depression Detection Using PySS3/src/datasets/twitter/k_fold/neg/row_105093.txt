Chronic pain and drugsI am a single 27 years old decent looking man. I love my job and make a living far above the average.

I started suffering from chronic headaches about 2 years ago. Because barely any medication worked I began taking opioid-based pills as a distraction. Time went by and two things happened:

1) The never-ending pain drove me literally *insane*. I now spend 99% of my free-time home alone, and while the pain gets my brain focused 24/7, I forget more and more things every day.

2) My entire perception of happiness got teared apart. A few pills giving you pleasure far beyong anything you ever felt makes you question everything you have ever dreamed of and fought for.

I reached a point where I feel I lost interest in everything. Nothing makes sense anymore. Life is pointless. I an empty. And the idea of dying doesn't scare me.

Now, this is the question I ask myself: "Why not?".
Why not spend all my money then happily overdose on heroin? Why stay in this painful empty world any longer when I can just leave anytime I want for a place where regret doesn't exist?
