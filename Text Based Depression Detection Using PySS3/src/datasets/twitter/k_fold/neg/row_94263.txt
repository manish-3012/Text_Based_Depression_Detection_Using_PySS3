I keep wanting to comment on everyones post saying that I'm in the same boat as them. So, ill just do it here:I'm an awful person undeserving of the love that I have and I want to die. I, however have a kid that I think would be crushed if I died, regardless of the circumstance. So, I'm stuck in an endless spiral of depression, anxiety, failed promises, lies, and deeeeeep sorrow. I dont deserve this love and I keep telling myself that I'm here for some grand reason but, everyday I feel like thats becoming a bigger and bigger lie.
