Serious fear of diseases: I am considering suicide.I have had numerous complaints for just over two or three months now.  What troubles me most, however, are speech disorders, difficulty breathing and numbness in the fingers and face.  I also have difficulty swallowing.  I am incredibly afraid of ALS or MS and now I only wish for death.  I can't live like this anymore, in constant fear.  

What would you say to someone who was just diagnosed with a disease that will only lead to a long and painful death?  How are we talking about suicide prevention here if suicide is the only way out of a life that gets more and more miserable?  If I had a little bit of courage I would've killed myself already.  I'm hopeless.
