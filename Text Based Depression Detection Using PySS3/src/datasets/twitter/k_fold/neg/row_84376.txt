I feel like I am going to do something really bad in near futureJust a bit of background info, I've probably seen about 16 different people (ranging from counselor to psych registrar at the hospital) and they all sort of look blankly at me and just say things like "in time things will get better" etc. 
one time I was sectioned and I laid it on a plate to them about exactly how bad I felt and they just sent me home and said "try this app called headspace...."
I haven't seen anyone recently (mental health services discharged me and told me that they couldn't help me) and I haven't been on medication for about six months (I've taken a wide range of anti-depressants to no effect) and things have become even worse. 


Lately I have had strong feelings of hurting others. These are new as for years I have felt suicidal though homicidal. All these thoughts of hurting myself and others continually rampage around my brain and nothing slows them down or makes them go away. I feel like very soon I am going to cause serious damage to myself, someone else or something else. 

I've also developed this concept that everyone I have ever met is in a conspiracy against me to hurt me, use me and mistreat me. I imagine all these people sitting round a huge circular table discussing me and laughing at me. I used to think about this in a joking sort of way though now I genuinely believe it's true. I call it the "I hate (insert my name here) league".

Therefore if you combine those points of feeling like I am going to do something rather bad, that everyone I have met is in a conspiracy against me and that in the past people time after time after time have shown no interest in taking my issues seriously &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it's all too much to handle and I have no bloody idea what to do. I'm scared.
