I want to dieMy parents use me to vent their anger. My dads an angry alcoholic. Iâ€™m bullied at school. My body is disgusting and ugly. My mom has an immense smoking habit. Itâ€™s not much for most people, but for me itâ€™s too much. I canâ€™t handle it. Itâ€™s too much pain. I want to die everyday. Thereâ€™s no reason for me to stay. My life sucks. And even worse, I donâ€™t have the guts to do it.
