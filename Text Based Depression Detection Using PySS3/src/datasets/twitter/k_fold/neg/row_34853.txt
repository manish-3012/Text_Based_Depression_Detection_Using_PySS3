I'm confused.I need to put some thoughts into writing, as I'm sitting on the floor in the corner of my bedroom. I've finally put my keys down, so I'm not cutting into my forearms anymore.

I'm 26 now. My first suicide attempt was at 17. Ever since my failed attempt, I saw a new outlook on life. I started taking care of myself, I started working out, I pursued an education, I met people, I did things I enjoyed, and slowly those dark thoughts faded away.

After leaving university I now have a stable job and I'm doing very well financially. I've thankfully been able to maintain my job during the pandemic.

I have no struggles other than the fact that I'm extremely lonely. I feel like a selfish asshole for feeling this way.

I sent a few messages to family members and old friends to maybe talk and forget about things for a while, but I got no response from anyone. Understandable, it's a Sunday. The world doesn't revolve around me.

I've gone through psychiatric treatment, I've been on pills for two years up to the point my doctor and I both agreed I was good to stop.

I should get to the point. I'm considering suicide again, even though I've improved myself, even though I did things I always dreamed of doing, even though I've found friendship, and love, and financial stability. Despite everything, here I am, still wanting to die. I hate myself even more for this. I feel like a complete fucking asshole for having a somewhat normal life and STILL, after everything, wanting to commit suicide.

Is this normal? After all the progress I've made, I still find myself wanting to die.

Today more than ever. 

Apologies for the long post. Writing things down helps sometimes.
