Feeling somewhat normal after suicide attemptI tried to slit my wrists last Wednesday. 

I didn't manage to cut myself deep, the blood stopped dripping after few minutes. I've tried but I didn't have it in me to cut deeper (properly). I don't think I'll even have some scaring, it almost healed completely already.  When the wound stopped bleeding I cleaned the mess and went to sleep. I was tired. Afterwards I go on with my life as nothing happened.

My husband didn't even notice, I've told him on Saturday because he noticed that I wear a jacket and it was hot outside.

I was considering going to a mental hospital. But I am not sure if it is not a laziness. Because it's not that bad: I have an appetite, I still go to work, I do sleep. I can still do my everyday chores. Like nothing happened. I can even laugh. I do not feel 'privileged' to take a space in the hospital in the time of COVID, when it's been few days ago and it wasn't even that serious because I've chickened. I feel somewhat ashamed that the situation from Wednesday doesn't qualify for a proper suicide attempt - I did not end up in an emergency room and nobody rescued me. On the other hand I am a bit proud of myself - for the first time in my life I've found a courage to try it, not only think about it.

I just have moments when I just have enough, when I prefer to be taken care of, to be sedated with drugs, have finally some diagnosis, maybe I will finally know what the fuck is wrong with me. Or maybe I have a wrong image of the mental hospital.

I don't need nice words or buzz-advice. I've been struggling with depression almost my whole life, attended psychotherapy for years, taking some venlafaxine prescribed drugs (I visit a psychiatrist quite regularly)... I just wanted to rant a bit. And want to know if anybody else feels somewhat normal after an attempt. If I am really that alone. If it is really that bad.

Thanks for reading.
