How long would your suicide note be?I can't decide between writing a short note, just telling some people that I love them and that it's not their fault, or writing a long letters. I want my friends and family to fully understand myself but writing long texts has some downsides too... Not leaving anything behind is out of question for me
What would you do? How much would you write in your suicide note? Would you even write one? 
I'm interested what you guys think about this
