Thanks for trying.I don't really know what else to say here. This feels a bit like shouting into the void honestly... I planned on killing myself last October everything got too overwhelming, but a few of you guys/gals on here helped talk me through it. I decided that if random strangers online could try and take the time for me maybe I was actually worth it, maybe I could actually do something if I tried my hardest. Well, I gave this semester an honest try I really did. I pushed as hard as I could and I'm doing pretty well in the classes high B or A in all of them, but my will to live has never actually been lower. I cant do this anymore every night I lay awake sobbing and every morning I barely drag my lifeless husk to class. It hurts, and I'm too tired to do this anymore. I'm sorry I really am. I'm sorry for wasting your time, I'm sorry I wasted your help, I'm sorry if you read this. I really appreciate anyone who cared enough to try and help. I really am sorry goodbye.
