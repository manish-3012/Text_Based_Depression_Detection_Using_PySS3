I just canâ€™tI canâ€™t cope with this life anymore and I donâ€™t want it, it has been nonstop pain and I have lost everything. My life is over. I have no reason to stay here and keep suffering through this. People call me crazy all the time and I spent most of my time alone. I donâ€™t understand what I did to deserve this life.
