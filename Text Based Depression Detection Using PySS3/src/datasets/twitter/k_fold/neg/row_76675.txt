"Why should I keep going?" "Cause you should"What a great response. It holds no weight at all. Anyway, decided to write a little even tho nobody even responded last time. All I do all day everyday is think about suicide and occasionally play a game. Sleep, suicide, game, suicide, sleep, repeat. My friend told me today I should try again to find a job but all I really have to say to that is that the only jobs I would be able to get would be shit like washing fucking dishes, again. And besides the fact that jobs like that have no future at all, they make me want to kill myself more than I already do, so whats the fucking point? She was like "yea but at least you'd have money" to do what with?? To buy more games on steam? Is that whats going to lift me out of depression and fix my life? I don't think so. I just have nothing. No real life friends, no gf, no money, no car, no job, no life really, and all I can do all day is think about dying. I'm not meant for this life, and I just want it to end.
