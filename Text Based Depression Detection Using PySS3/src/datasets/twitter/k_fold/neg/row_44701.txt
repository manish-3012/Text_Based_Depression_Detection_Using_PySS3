Ending a relationshipI've been in a pretty stable relationship. My boyfriend makes me very happy. He makes me have hope for the future and he supports me. He makes me want to live. Since i met him, i cut less frequently. 

The only thing is that I can't expect us to last forever. We're both young. How do i keep myself from wanting to kill myself if/when the relationship ends?
