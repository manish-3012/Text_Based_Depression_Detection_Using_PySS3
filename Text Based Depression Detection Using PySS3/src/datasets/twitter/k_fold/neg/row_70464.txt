Have no reasons to live. Of course you don`t think so, could you convince me plzHi! 24 yrs, unnenployed but getting a job in about 2 mounths, that's sure. 
My life now is very boring. Live with my dad, he doesen't really like me I know. Barelly speak with anyone, spend most of my day quiet, maybe that's not very nice. I love science, read a lot every day. I'm studing to apply for a masters course in cognitive psychology. 
Life seems very unporpousefull, why live if eventually we get stuff we want, meet people, do things, and, that's it, and endless cicle till +-90 years. We don't have to do anything, why not end life now? Science was keeping me up. What's new? I want to know. New stuff, new discoveries, new places. But, eventually, even it is just anwering humankind's questions. And new anwers, new questions, and goes on and on... Don't know, life seems dull and idiot for me. I really don't like people too. People just want to have conversations, be happy, laugh. Unfortunatelly, I have to question. I inquire, do research, like to read phylosophy, physics, psychology, and everyone hates these kind of things. Academia doesen`t help either. They just want papers, publications, a name and stuff, I'm very disapointed the way science is made... 
So, no reasons to live. Any comments? Thx for your time reading this.
