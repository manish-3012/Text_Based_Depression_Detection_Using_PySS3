Stuck - is it time to give up?I'm fucking over it. I'm only 17. My mom and I can hardly afford to put food on the table. I live in a shitty, tiny, disgusting, black mold infested trailer with no A/C that's falling apart. We can't pull out a loan to buy a better place because our income is so low that we get rejected. 

My dad is stealing my money and has treated me like shit and taken everything from me ever since I found out that he cheated on my mom several times. He still manages to make me feel like shit even though I don't live with him anymore.

I've stopped my mom from killing herself several times - forced her to puke up pills and all that good stuff.

I dropped out of high school to live with my mom after the divorce since my dad started abusing me after my mom left. I have no chance at life.

I'm tired of suffering. I'm tired of watching my mom suffer. I think it's just time to give up. I want to fucking off myself.
