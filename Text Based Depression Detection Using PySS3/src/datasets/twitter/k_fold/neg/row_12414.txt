Can't think of a title, sorry.I know that stuff like this has probably been posted a lot, but I needed to say something somewhere. Sorry, I meant for this to be short, but yeah...

I posted here earlier this week under a throwaway. No throwaways this time. Fuck it.

I've struggled with self-harm for a few months now. For awhile I did that butterfly project thing. My mom knew about it, I didn't try to hide them. I stopped however because I felt so guilty every time I drew a new one because my mom would always react so strongly.

I felt like I was burdening her, so I stopped. I lied and said that I didn't feel a need to any more.

The urges got too strong. I started cutting.

I like cutting. I'm not sorry that I cut. It works.

But tonight my mom saw my cuts and scars. I feel like such shit. She got so upset. I feel so guilty. I'm the worse. But she can't know. She can't know how twisted my mind has become.

I lied more. I don't like to lie, but I did it. I told her that I was making an effort to stop and that things are getting better for me and most of the marks are old.

Things are getting worse. So much worse. I dream of death constantly. At first they were intrusive thoughts and I didn't like them. But now they are not so intrusive and I welcome them.

I'm on medication, in fact the does just increased and I am in therapy. I just don't understand what is happening to me. I could really use a friend right now.

**Edit:** Thank you all for the support and replies. I don't feel suicidal anymore, just exhausted. I'm scared to do it, but I think I might throw away all my self-harm stuff. Maybe. Anyways, I'm going to sleep now. Thanks again. I really appreciate it.

**Update:** Thanks again everyone. My mom and I are on good terms again. I threw away my blades. Here's hoping I can stay clean.
