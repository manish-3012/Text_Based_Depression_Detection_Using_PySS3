This breakup is crushing me. Suicidal thoughts constantly.My girlfriend of 2 years recently broke up with me. It was my longest relationship. We've had SO MANY things in common that I feel no one else I meet will ever be the same, especially since everyone I've talked to, and I mean EVERYONE, said we were soulmates. The worst part is when I picture her with someone else. The other day I saw her laughing with another guy, I almost ran up and choked him. Now I really want to kill myself, but I'm afraid I'll fuck up and just make my life worse. So now I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I either suffer thinking about her, which I cannot for the life of me get out of my head, or I attempt suicide, possibly mess up, and be immobilized for the rest of my life. What the hell do I do?
