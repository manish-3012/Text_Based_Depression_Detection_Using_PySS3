looking for adviceI've followed this sub for a while now, never thought it would be my turn to make a post about wanting to die lol

I'm really struggling with suicidal thoughts, i have financial problems, no parents or other family, i haven't left the house in a month and im tired of living this way. Sadly there's nothing I can do to change this.b
