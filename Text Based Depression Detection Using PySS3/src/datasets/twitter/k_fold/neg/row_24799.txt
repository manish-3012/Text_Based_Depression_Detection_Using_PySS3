Being transgender and in college fucking sucks.I'm doing very well in school, but I can't stand being in this environment. My environment is mostly comprised of normal, young college students that are social butterflies and enjoying their undergrads. If I decide to be "out" I will be one of those disgusting "man in a dress" types. Suicide is the only logical choice given my scenario but I can't afford to do it right now... I wish I had the strength to just call it quits but my personal goals and family are binding me to stay alive. I have to rise to claim what rightfully belongs to me... My achievements, happiness and stability even if it means never coming out of the closet.
