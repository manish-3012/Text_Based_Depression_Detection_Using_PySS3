I think I'll do it. You are supposed to throw away trash,right?I have nothing. Nobody truly cares. I have a note ready and I'm not afraid to do something. I ran away once and was caught. My mom acted like she loved me when the cop was there,then she screamed at me to go to bed. She says for me to act like an adult but when I do she says I'm just a kid. I'm 14, godammit. Also, custody battles are going on. I have nothing. Honestly, life is a game and I just suck at playing. I wanna quit
