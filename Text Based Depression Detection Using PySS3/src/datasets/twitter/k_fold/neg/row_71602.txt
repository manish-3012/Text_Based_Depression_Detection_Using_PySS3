Wonâ€™t be here next weekThis is a burn account so Iâ€™ll put a bit of detail in here.
Iâ€™m 19(M) military AF and an E3, Iâ€™ve been in for almost 2 years never deployed or TDY. My shop(Iâ€™m maintenance) treats me like garbage everyone else gets treated better even lower rank with less time in service. It hurts and the way I am treated made my depression get to the point where I started to self harm. Not a few cuts, my thighs and upper legs are covered. No one has taken my mental seriously, they always brush it off. They are trying to find more ways to give me bad paper work (being in our tool section too long) just being very petty about it. My breakdowns are getting more frequent, to the point where 2 times a day Iâ€™ll be in the bathroom quietly crying to myself trying to pull it together and get back out there. Iâ€™ve been inpatient twice, didnâ€™t do anything I still  am going to therapy and it does nothing but give me an outlet to rant. The outpatient facility Iâ€™ve been going to thinks Iâ€™m faking my mental illness, now They wonâ€™t let me go back. Iâ€™ve had a lot of childhood trauma, and it seems to all be surfacing now and Iâ€™m not sure why, it seems like the people who I work for favor the immoral. Iâ€™m tired of all the disrespect, side eyes, laughing at me, and isolation.  I donâ€™t have a support system, all my friends never text me first, why do I always have to initiate a conversation? Why canâ€™t I feel okay? Iâ€™m getting less and less sleep every night. Maybe Iâ€™ll get enough rest and finally feel okay if I never woke up.
