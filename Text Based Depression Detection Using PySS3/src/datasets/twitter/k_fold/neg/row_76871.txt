Because I have no one else to tell: Iâ€™m finally killing myself.I just need to get this out into the void. Itâ€™s been years and years and Iâ€™m finally ready. Itâ€™s time. Will not mess it up. Will succeed. I donâ€™t care anymore. After medication and therapy and hospitalization Iâ€™ve realized that all I can do with my PTSD is commit suicide. My mind is so out of it. Nothing feels real. Iâ€™ve attempted before but now I know what to do. 

I reached out one last time earlier today with a counsellor at college. It was ok but made me really realize I have to go through with this.

I feel free. I feel at peace. I am ready.
