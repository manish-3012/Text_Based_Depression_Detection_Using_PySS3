My friend is suicidal but doesn't want helpBackground: My friend (M15) has been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and frequently talks about suicide. He had a crush on me (F14) in 7th grade, and we'e currently freshmen in high school. I came out to him as gay and I was pretty nervous and this conversation ensued:

By the end of that I was crying. I have no idea how to help him get better. I'm extremely worried about him and I don't want him to commit suicide. What do I do in this situation? Do I betray his trust and get an adult involved? If so, how? What can I say to convince him not to kill himself or push everyone away?

TL;DR: my friend is suicidal and i'm extremely worried and don't know what to do. please help.
