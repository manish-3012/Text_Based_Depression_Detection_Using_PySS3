it's been going on long enough.that being my life. 

yesterday i started selling my things. my piano, ukelele, and some other things. something about doing it saddens me, but another part of me is totally apathetic towards it. 

it sucks too because i've just began a relationship on December 1st. i really like her, but i just don't want to put her through the train wreck which is me. i have so much shit that brings me down and i can't bear to burden her with it. i'll probably break up with her this weekâ€”depending on how everything goes. 

i've written so many scripts that deal with what i'm feeling but they never have a happy ending, or an ending to begin with. ironic, kinda. 

i'm so tired. i'm so tired.

2019 is a weird number anyways, i don't want to live through that. 

my firstâ€”and last post, cheers.
