There isn't a point at all to stay aliveIt sucks to have been suicidal since I was around 12-13... Going through puberty is hard enough, add depression and suicidal thoughts to that and you get a horrible mixture of angst and pain. Every now and then I get these so called "illumination moments" where I see the "good" and I try to get better... It's pointless, I don't think it's related to my mental health. I just think I wasn't supposed to be born at all. It doesn't matter how many of my problems are fixed, it does not matter what I achieve even if it's the best of the best, I still don't wanna live. I don't think I'll ever want to be alive. I want to kill myself, every single day. I don't have the guts, every single day. It's like my body is playing a sick joke on me over and over again and I just pray that something kills me fast because I know I can't do it.
