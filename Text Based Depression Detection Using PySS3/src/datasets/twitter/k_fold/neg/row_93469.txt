Everyone keeps attacking me for something I didn't doAs the title says, I've been getting harassed for something that I didn't do. Someone who's mad at me, an ex friend, started saying that I called my ex a slut and bragged about how I was gonna sleep with her. This wasn't true, I didn't even sleep with her at all. Of course, she believed him and now she's pissed at me. She told all her friends that this happened too, and now I'm getting messages and threats about it. I still really care about this girl, and I'd still literally die for her. She doesn't realize that she's really hurting me. She's blocked me on everything, her friends won't listen. I'm starting to think that a well written suicide note will leave a message. I haven't felt this bad in years, I want it all to be over. Nobody will listen to me.
