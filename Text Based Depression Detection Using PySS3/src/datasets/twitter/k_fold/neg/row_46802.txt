Iâ€™m so tiredIâ€™m tired of feeling unwanted. A constant cycle between having hope and falling into despair. Not knowing if Iâ€™ll ever be good enough for anyone to love and want me. If I am good enough for that. Will working hard even pay off? 

A few hours ago I sat with a friend of mine and her friends. The way she touched one of their hands just reminded me of the things Iâ€™d never have. That human affection. I felt so alone in a group of people. They were all super close from knowing each other for years. The way they interacted with each other was something I wish I had with someone. 

I wish I could save myself, but I donâ€™t see any other options. Iâ€™ve been told before to go to therapy, but that would destroy my career and reputation. In two days itâ€™ll be a month since the deadline I gave myself. The date where I wished I wouldâ€™ve ended it. Oh well, itâ€™s never too late, as they say...
