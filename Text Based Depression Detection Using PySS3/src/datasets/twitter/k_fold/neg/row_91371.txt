Im.....Im so tiredIm...im 17...and I have been dealing with these thoughts for..as long as I can remember really.....I can remember nap time in kindergarten...i would sit under the covers and cry...and want to hurt myself. I have had a few unsuccesful attempts but....once was really close and would have worked if not for someone finding me. I feel worthless....like none of this matters....and...like everyone would be better off without me. I hate every single thing about myself....and I want to die more often than not. I am tired of this...of life...of everything. I just want to sleep.....forever.
