What good comes out of 26 wasted years of a shit excuse for a life?I've done nothing, wasted all my money on a college degree which means jack shit,  I will continue to do nothing because I suck at anything I actually have credentials for.  I just amassed almost all of the pills in my cabinet to grind up and consume, but I put them aside.  What the fuck is the point of living if you suck at everything you want to do.
