I'm strugglingHello all. I have dealt with suicidal ideation since fifth grade; my mom used to find my suicide notes around the house at that time and around seventh/eighth grade I started seeing medical professionals. That all helped for a while but as I grew up (am 26 almost 27 now) the feeling has returned and become more pervasive. I am certain I'm not alone in this feeling but I am so stressed out. I live with my partner and his parents. Money has dried up significantly and I am paying my fair share of bills &amp; whatnot (including my own). Is Christmas just stressing anyone else out immensely? I'm not on the total brink of breakdown but the idea of suicide is creeping back into my daily mental state regularly and I don't feel like I can talk to anyone about it.

I dunno what to do. I've spent the last hour and a half just bawling my eyes out.
