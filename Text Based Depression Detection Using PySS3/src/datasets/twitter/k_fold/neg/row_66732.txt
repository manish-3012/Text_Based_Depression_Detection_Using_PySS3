Im sorryI just left a chat where people told me to kill myself even though they know I've attempted suicide before. I feel like shit and I'm going out to get hit by a car. I hope I die. To all my friends sorry I was being such a asshole, I just wanted attention because I don't get it much and I'm depressed and to have people care feels good but you all wanted me to die and I'll fulfill you guy's wishes. I wish you all a good life. To my family... if you're seeing this dad I can't live like this anymore, I'm so paranoid and angry dad..I wish I could talk to you about this. Please don't cry, I'm in mental pain and I want the pain to go away forever. To my friends at cali, the world, twitter, and wherever you are.. please don't feel guilty, please don't be angry and please don't feel sad. If you think I'm doing it for attention, that's also one reason but I'm in pain guys. This year has been not so good and a lot of bad things have happened that have never happened in my life before and I hope they don't happen to anyone. I'm crying as I type this right now, I'm sorry my friends, my family for the pain I'm about to put you through for doing this but I am not a normal guys no I'm not I wish I was normal like everyone I wish I didn't had so many mental issues. I'm sorry and I love you all, all of you. I hope all of you get better, your lives get better, this world gets better and I wish you all a happy and prosperous life. Goodbye now and forever.
