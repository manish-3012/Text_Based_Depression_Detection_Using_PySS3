There's no way out. There's no way to explain how I feel.I can't put in words how I feel about existence. There are so many thoughts in my head...I can't sort them. This is the first time I've tried to communicate them, ever.
I dont think I've ever stopped thinking before, and not a day goes by where I think about things that i can't explain. Existence, social standards...
I think I'm Bipolar.
None of my friends get my. My mom is impossible to communicate with at night, my sister is an arrogant bitch, and my dad has his own problems, living far away.
The things that, most of the time, make me thing is that it's fucking impossible for us to exist. If nothing existed at one point, nothing could have existed. It makes me want to brain myself right then and there with a rusty fucking spoon, the impossible loop that we exist in. 
I hate people so much. I'm afraid. 
I'm afraid that I'm going to lose it and I'm going to kill someone. 
If I kill myself, existence will stop and I won't have to deal with my thoughts anymore. I won't get too mad to easily at my friends anymore. I won't *be* anymore.
Besides, what good has ever happened in my life, anyway? The highlight of my fucking life was living in Oklahoma, going to my old school with my best friends, playing Naruto with the middle schoolers everyday and playing legos with everyone else every day. 
Now where am I? An uptight religious shithole of a school filled with dicks, assholes, and the closest thing I have to friends, which isnt much. 
If there is a god, I'm going to go to hell according to the bible. I would have lived a life of misery and confusion just to live in an eternity of pain.
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE POINT, ANYWAY? Why the fucking hell would you put people on a planet where they can do whatever the fuck they want when there's an eternity of bliss you can put them in?
I can't stop thinking. My thoughts haunt me every second of the day.
The only way out is suicide. I'm not exactly depressed - I'm trapped.
