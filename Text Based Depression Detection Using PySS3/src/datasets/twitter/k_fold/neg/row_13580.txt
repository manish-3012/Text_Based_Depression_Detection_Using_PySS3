I'm done. I'm doing it tonightOnce i write my will, I'm offing myself. I'm a twenty year old shopping addict who just got told that I am being made a floater teacher at my job so that I can get more training. as of may, I would've been there a year. I love the job, so the fact that this is happening among other things today is just making my life hell on earth. I'm done. I give the fuck up
