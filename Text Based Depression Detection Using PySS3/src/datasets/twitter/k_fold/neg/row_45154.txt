Might pull a popcorn.A while ago I was fired from a shitty job and long story short I wrote a nasty email afterward basically ranting about the place and telling them to fuck off. I have mental problems and was manic and intoxicated at the time, so I don't remember exactly what I wrote. But I'm being charged with terroristic threats, harassment, and disorderly conduct. I can understand the disorderly conduct, I was misbehaving, but the rest is a load of crap, I have freedom of expression and I only sent 1 email, and harassment is something that has to be repeated. But if I'm convicted of this shit, I'm firing up the engine in the garage I mounted to a board and filled with a mix of kerosene, gas, and heating oil for maximum carbon monoxide output, and sitting in a chair till I'm dead. It'll ruin all my career prospects and I'll be stuck working shitty jobs when I have the mind of a scientist. I only sent a pissed off email, but since this 9/11 shit anything gets you ruined. Freedom of speech is bullshit if you ask me.
