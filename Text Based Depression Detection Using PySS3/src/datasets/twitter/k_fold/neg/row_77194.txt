Tired...please God end me nowIâ€™m 18 and have been tired for 5 years now. Cutting myself didnâ€™t work. I donâ€™t have any friends. Iâ€™m not in college. I donâ€™t have any goals. I have no idea what to do with my life 

I just wanna die. Iâ€™m scared for my future.i have no sense of independence. I canâ€™t drive yet. I can barely communicate with adults 

I havenâ€™t had any interaction with people besides my mom, sister, &amp; some coworkers and I was suppose to go out with â€œfriendsâ€ Friday and I started throwing up all day yesterday. I guess itâ€™s a sign in suppose to be alone 

Iâ€™m tired of living a life I didnâ€™t ask for.
