the system won't let me die, but it's not helping me live eitherDoes anyone else have this experience?
Don't have the energy to type up my story right now but I'm frustrated and stuck in the middle. Health care system freaks out if I say I'm going to kill myself, but doesn't give me the resources I need to actually recover.

Don't know what to do anymore
