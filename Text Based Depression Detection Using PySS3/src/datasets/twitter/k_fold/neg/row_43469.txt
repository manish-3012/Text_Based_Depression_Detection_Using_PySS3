Ghosted by an ex.TL;DR: I have been ghosted by my ex, and my mental health is suffering greatly. Very unsure what to do.

Also - was published to the r/relationship subreddit, but got messaged and told very crudely this should be here. Apologies if this is triggering.

After a period of 8 months, during which they (20F) also Isolated with me (27M) and my family, things took a strange turn. 

We were relatively happy (or so i thought, circumstances notwithstanding) but she eventually decided to go back home after a period of a few months following restrictions being lowered. 

Very unceremoniously I was dumped via text message not long after, then ghosted. It took a long time to organise getting things back etc, and had to go through a mutual friend (who has since fallen out with me, due to me messaging constantly for my stuff - my argument is that I had literally no other way to get my stuff back.)

I'm now very isolated and alone, and essentially from my understanding they are saying things about me - but dont know what. I fell out with a few friends during this as they were against me going out with her an dating, as she was a mutual friends ex (although they had been broken up a bit beforehand.)

Since then, it has been about a month or so - however due to my isolation and other mental issues, I did have a suicide attempt on the 28/29th of September. 

I am currently working from home, however this means I do not socialise with anyone other than my family.

My drinking has escalated, as I feel like there's a bit of comfort in getting distracted, and not thinking about her. 

I guess I'm needing help. I have been referred to a counsellor due to my attempt, however I am still struggling. I carried until today a letter that she sent me less than a week before she broke up with me - I cant bear to throw it away.

Any advice?
