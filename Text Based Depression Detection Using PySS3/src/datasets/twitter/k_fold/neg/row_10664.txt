Cheaper.With my first suicide attempt back in January. Now, I have a flood of medical bills come in and one of my friend's committed suicide last Friday. I just look at these Bill's and just told myself going through with suicide and making her I am dead is cheaper than surviving. It's so stressful. My husband comforted me and told me it will be okay and we will work together.

I just got a job after 6 months and had to take off and it's been only the 2nd week. I couldn't handle the death of my friend and I am starting to feel feelings that I used to block out..

Maybe this is a type of healing..

I don't know..
