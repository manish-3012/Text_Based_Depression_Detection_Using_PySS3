My childhood best friend told me he wants to end his life.Hi guys. I'm new to Reddit and I'm not really sure what I'm doing or if this is even the right place for this. 

My best friend growing up texted me saying he is done trying and that the only reason he isn't ending his life right now is because two of our other friends are with him right now. He's open enough about his chronic depression that we can be there for him but I don't know what to do. I called him and we talked. I asked him about how he was feeling and told him I related (this is true, I suffer from a lot of anxiety and depression as well and similarly reached out to a friend recently) and we talked about that for a little while. Eventually, we started talking about other things (jobs, tv, plans) and moved away from his suicidal thoughts, though it was sort of the unavoidable context everything was being framed in.

I just want my friend to remember that we care about his life and that there are things to be happy about and laugh at, but did I steer the conversation away from what he was really feeling in a misguided attempt to cheer him up? A lot of these posts on here seem to show that guys have a hard time opening up to other guys and I don't want him to feel that I am uncomfortable with what he is dealing with. I just wanted to make him laugh.

He's with friends right now who will take care of him. His brother is on Facebook and I considered messaging him to tell him what is going on but I have no idea if that is ok- I don't want to spread it to everyone what my friend is going through if it will make it worse; that happened to me once and though I knew their hearts were in the right place I felt embarrassed and terrible for a while after.

Please help me.
