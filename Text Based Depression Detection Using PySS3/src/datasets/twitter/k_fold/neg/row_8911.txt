Can't accept who i amI'm a 14 year old Belgian kid with a normal social status, but i feel like my life is the same all day, go to school, eat, relax, sleep and i think i'm gay, i'm in love with my best friend, but i don't want to... i know he isn't gay and never talked to him about it, i din't think i really can. He is always ironic or funny about stuff about everything if it's depression or sexuality, he's just like all my other friends i don't really like them, i don't trust them i din't really like them but i din't want other friends, i just want them to act like friends, but i know they won't i took a painkiller pill today, 9 pills are letal i still have 14 in the box so i'm gonna wate 4 days longer...
This may be my suicide note, if anything i want all of you to know it wasn't my parents fault
It's just me and my friends...
