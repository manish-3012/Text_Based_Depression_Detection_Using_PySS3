I'm going to do it.I'm going to kill myself. Nothing is getting better, if anything, I'm getting worse despite the antidepressants. I tried to kill myself a month ago, and haven't been in school for over a month. In that time, my two closest friends have moved on. They called me up yesterday claiming that they were going to join the popular group. And I couldn't. It's not that I'm upset about not being included, even if the group accepted me I wouldn't want to join. But that friendship group has put my friends through so much misery, and I've been the one drying their tears. Me trying to kill myself is the best thing that's ever happened to them, as they've finally got what they've always wanted. So surely if I go ahead and successfully do it then they'll benefit even more so. I now have no friends to return to if I go back to school. I'm just going to go ahead and do it, it's clear no one cares.
