Bad nightIâ€™m sorry that this probably isnâ€™t the right place, but my best friend passed away from suicide 2 years ago and Iâ€™ve never understood depression before that. But I have since, and Iâ€™ve been doing well, but tonight is just a bad night and I donâ€™t want to actually die but I want to hurt myself. Iâ€™m sitting around people right now but they are fake ass friends and I want to go home and hurt myself. I never thought I would be this way and I hate that I am. Iâ€™m sorry this is just a rant but I needed to get it out to someone that might understand.
