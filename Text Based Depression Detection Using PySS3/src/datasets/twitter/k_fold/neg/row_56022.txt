ready to dieIn the last two months I've had a horrible reaction to medication (antidepressants); seen the end of a loving relationship; been forced to drop out of school; been in and out of the hospital, where the never tried to help me; and now my parents hate me because I've been having a hard time coping with all of this.

I think I'm ready to die tonight, I just want this pain to be over.

Update: I'm not going to kill myself tonight, I'm going to sleep on things and keep trying.
