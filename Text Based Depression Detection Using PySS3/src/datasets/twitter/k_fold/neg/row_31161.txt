Planned to live whole life as a loser and after mom's death i will kill myself!Call me selfish or an asshole. I am ready to wait for years for my mom to die. Until then I will just live a life of pain and misery being a loser. I know my mom will die one day. So, after her death I will kill myself. I know she will die knowing that her son is a failure. I will just repeating the same lifestyle 1. Overeating 2. Fapping (12 times a day)
3. failing in education 4. Staying in my room for hours. 
I am a loser and I need to do what I am born to do. There is no point in improving. It's my job to be a failure. I am just born to watch people get succeed and then turn on a song and daydream about being successful.
I know I will soon end up homeless or get diabetes, but  I don't care. What does a loser do? He loses in everything. That's me.
