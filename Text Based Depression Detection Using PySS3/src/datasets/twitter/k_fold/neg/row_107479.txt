Do antidepressants really work as advertised?It would be until after I graduated college that I would see if I could be placed on one. I need to get off of my parentâ€™s insurance first - donâ€™t need them knowing Iâ€™m on drugs and that I want to blow my brains out.

Talked with someone for a long time about how theyâ€™ve helped them and wanted to get some input from you guys.
