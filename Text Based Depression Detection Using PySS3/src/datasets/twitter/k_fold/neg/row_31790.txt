What even is the point?If it's not one thing, it's another. The world is horrible. People are all fake. Even me! I pretend to be okay. Pretend I can see beauty and happiness to live for.  Everything is awful. 

 I turn 28 in a couple days.  I thought I would kill myself on my birthday for the last several years. And I know I won't again this year. Not because I generally find something to live for. No. Because I never get around to doing the paperwork. Writing my will, adding beneficiaries, etc.

I do have one person that usually makes me happy and I would be sorry to make him go through that.  But I'm afraid he wouldn't be able to handle me if I told him any of this. Knowing I think about suicide almost every day.  Even if it's a good day.  There's usually some intruding thoughts of ending my life.

How could I ask one person to help me hold the weight of the world for the rest of my life?  

It'd be easier if I just died. There's no point.  But I'm  still here just going through the motions and sometimes good things surprise me.  Like meeting my person.

 Someone told me once that you don't have to want to live.  It's enough just to be curious. To hold on for another day/week/year just to see what happens.

And that's fine.  I can kill myself anytime I want.  So no harm in being curious, right?

But what if I do marry my person and find happiness and I still kill myself?  What of that?

I am in therapy. My therapist and the people of Reddit are the only ones I have been able to be honest with. Because confidentiality and being somewhat anonymous here.  I don't have to lie and say I'm having sort of a bad day.  I can say I've imagined my own death four different ways today in great detail with some light planning.

I'm too curious right now to kill myself.  But the things I think about are just not things most people are comfortable talking about. And sometimes you gotta get it out into the world even if no one responds.
