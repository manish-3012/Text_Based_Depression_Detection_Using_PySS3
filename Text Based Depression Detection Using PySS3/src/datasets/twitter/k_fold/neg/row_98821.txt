tell me why i shouldnâ€™t.iâ€™ve lost my jobs. iâ€™m losing my home. iâ€™ve lost my friends. i canâ€™t go anywhere or do anything because of my physical disability. iâ€™ve spent my entire life up until recently working full time to support my parents and never had time to build skills or have hobbies. iâ€™m in chronic pain 24/7. sleep paralysis every night of my life. dissociation every day. panic attacks too. i do not have one thing going for me, at all. not one. i have no one to speak to and all my therapist says is â€œthat really sucksâ€. what am i to do? why should i bother when i have nothing?
