(Kinda long, sorry) I am a chronically-ill, barely-functional, impossibly broken mess of a human being. Death seems the only solution.I think I need to kill myself.  

While it's not a new thought, it's one that's been loudest in my head above all things, lately. I'm not even sure how to say what it is I want to.. so let's start with a list..  

* I've been chronically-ill for 30 years.  
* I still live with family, have never lived independently. I still very much feel like the teenager I was when I got sick, except.. older.  
* I never got to experience "real" life beyond my teens, except vicariously through others that I knew before they all disappeared from my life.  
* I have no higher learning, no marketable skills and physically not reasonably-employable.  
* I'm a financial burden on my family, and will likely remain so until I'm dead.  
* My illness has taken several bounding leaps for the worse in the last decade, most especially in the last couple of years, mostly induced by circumstance.. but it has left me far less capable of distracting myself successfully with long-established "light hobbies" that could fill my time.  
- I am soul-rendingly lonely.  I have only a **small** handful of friends, and no realistic romantic prospects or hopes. This one bores particularly deep. Not that I would want to use anyone for purely validatory purposes, not at all... but it feels like I'm built or programmed to need to share my life with someone. It's especially cruel, that, given my circumstances.    
* What I can see or rather predict of my future is at BEST, pathetic.  And at worst, awful.  Life has been taking things from me at an increasing pace and nothing is returning to fill the voids. While I get that can be true of anyone anywhere, I am especially powerless to actively fight this or otherwise counteract it.  
* Years of illness and dependence on others for the bigger things in life have fostered in me nearly zero appreciable ego, mountains of anxiety and uncertainty and a self-image that may as well not even exist, it's so terrible.  While my dependence is still largely based on finances, I can see a time before long where it'll start shifting into the more physical areas.  
* If I could wave a magic wand and cure myself entirely right this second.. I would STILL be an impossible mess to fix with far too many years behind me to salvage anything even close to what I want out of life.  

It hurts me, daily, to see life passing before me, life going on around me.. and me being more and more a fixture (think: coat rack) in my home.  A kind of family pet.  With absolutely nothing to look forward to.  I have interests I can't pursue.  I have needs I can't meet, desires I can't even begin to fulfill.  

When my last parent is gone, my 'care' will pass to my siblings (whatever unlucky one(s) draw the short sticks I guess).. and the cycle will continue as the family shrinks.  

Gone are my dreams of having a career, a spouse &amp; kids, home of my own, building or continuing a legacy.  Living a quiet, modest life with someone I love.  Instead I'll be nothing but a footnote on the family tree.  

I am tired of feeling like a burden.  Tired of feeling like I can't begin to measure up to ANY standard society has in place for nearly anything.  I have little-to-no social 'worth' (and unattractive in addition, go me..) and definitely no financial worth.  I am an anchor, a disappointment, a dreary-reminder of what I could've been.. but I'm not.  I have been rejected, mocked, ignored, put aside, forgotten, all because of my illness and what it's made of me and my "life."  

I mostly haven't been able to put on a happy face and 'fake it' for a while now, and it's getting close to impossible to EVER do it.  The dumb part about all this is that I KNOW I'm a great fucking person.  But it simply doesn't matter because "oh, you still live at home?" or "you have no income?" or.. well.. whatever.  I'm sure you get the idea.  

Besides which.. just from a purely practical standpoint, I don't see the value in continuing to live.  I don't mean that to sound flippant in any way at all.  Because there's plenty *I* value about life and the world.. but nearly all of it is walled off from me.  There's only so much window-shopping I can do before it's time to move on.  

I feel as though true hope has been removed from my equation and I've been gasping for air ever since, it finally dawning on me that maybe I only have one path forward now, and it's, well.. death.  

**I don't want to die.**  But I can't keep living like this anymore.  *I just fucking CAN'T.*  

Thank you so much for reading this mess.
