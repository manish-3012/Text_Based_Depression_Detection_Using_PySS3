I think I might die on SaturdayI got the lowest grade on my second accounting midterm. I already failed the first one badly. 29% on the first exam and 15% on the second. I'm going to drop the class. I don't know how I would tell my family. They'd be PISSED. I already had to take the prerequisite class twice, and now I'd have to take this class twice. More money going down the drain. Don't tell me to change my major. I changed it twice.

I feel so bad about dying because 1) I have a very nice internship lined up for January that pays pretty well, and 2) my best friend, who is also my roommate, is throwing a Halloween/birthday party for me on Saturday. 

I live on campus, and my hometown is about 30 minutes-1 hour away. I think I have a doctor appointment on Saturday. If I do, then I will try my best to die at home. I have a method in place. If I don't have a doctor appointment on Saturday, then idk what I'll do. Maybe sometime before the semester finishes, I'll go home, wait for my parents to leave, and then do it. I'm wasting their hard-earned money.

This really sucks. It really seemed like I was going places.
