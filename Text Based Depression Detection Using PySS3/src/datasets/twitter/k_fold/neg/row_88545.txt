Thank you.... my letter to you.Before I go anywhere with this letter I would kindly like to thank you, my fellow redditer. To thank you for what I may not know but I do know that you have had some effect on the internet that I have perused for the years of my life and without a doubt you have added a slight bit to what has made it such an interesting mash up of opinions and viewpoints. A melting pot if there ever was one._x000D_

Dear,_x000D_
Reader_x000D_
_x000D_
Yes, I am posting to /r/SW but I carry a different message. Not one of hope or depression but one that simply is a story and a hopeful lesson. I am someone who has had a good life in a sense. Do not get me wrong here, I have had my fair share of negative moments [girlfriend dating my best friend, parents getting a divorce, being kicked out of my home]  that have brought me here but they were not the reason for me writing. I am writing because I made a mistake and I do hope that I can dissuade you from making the same._x000D_
Also keep in mind this is all coming from a man who is, once he is finished writing, about to go hang himself with a few letters stowed in his pockets. There is your grain of salt. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
There are those of you who are out there and may be in pain. There are those of you who are out there that may wallow in sorrow. This letter is not addressed for you; no it is addressed for all. You see every person, the depressed and content make the same mistake so please give me a moment and listen all the same. _x000D_

To start off I will give you my story. I am a simple 18 year old who instead of going off to college decided to take a â€œGap Year.â€ _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
A spent time working at a few local stores and taking the odd class here and there at a local college. Not a hard lifestyle in the least but I was trying to take some time to examine who I was as a human being. â€œHell,â€ I thought â€œI hear people all the time trying to figure out who they really are why donâ€™t I. I am sure it will be so easy.â€ _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Well as most thoughts that come out of the average teenage mind I was far from correct, at least in my situation. You see I am the kind of person who bottles up everything in their life and never letâ€™s people in. Now I do not do it in the traditional sense where I bottle up and explode after a period of time. I took another route, lying. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I am damn good at it too._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I was so good that I would convince everyone around me and even convince myself of these lies, or so I thought. The people around me had known I was a big liar but I had convinced myself I was the most suave guy alive. No one could touch me, and if they did I was only made stronger through it. The videogamer in me almost viewed it as experience. An amazing writer known as Charles C. Finn wrote a poem called â€œPlease hear what I am not sayingâ€ which aptly describes the feeling in better words than I ever will be able to wield. Because of it all I was now alone. So I opened the Pandoraâ€™s box of my head and this weird magical demon had flown out and then a unicorn._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
No, nothing like that happened. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I simply discovered I was faking the steps of life and more importantly faking the emotions. That is not the scary part people. Oh no, the scary part is what comes up next. The climax lies in the fact of one damn woman who made me face myself. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
Leah._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
A tall girl who had taught me about compassion, passion, and that human beings can feel empathy for each other. Someone who held the greatest outer beauty but only seemed insignificant for the caring she held for others. She had fallen in love with my best friend as I had fallen in love with her. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
That was the crux of my life. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I had opened the Pandoraâ€™s box of my head and emotions flooded out. For the first time in my life I had to face things called anger, fear, pain, happiness, and love. I did not know what to do so I hid again. I could never really hide again though. I started to notice the honor and care that came from my best friend. I could only not pay attention to the love my mother held for me even though she kicked me out of the house. I never could run away again from the fact my father viewed me as a dollar sign. More importantly I had to deal with the love of the beauty I could never be with. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I now a few months later have taken some time to think and have come to peace with myself. Sometime was spent in meditation and I know I have helped many in their lives but something else was need to be done before I left. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I decided I should write a letter to all those whom have helped me in thanks. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
I am writing a letter to Zack my best friend, to Leah the one I loved, to my parents to know I appreciate all they have worked for, and to a man named Dan whom I had met in the park, and I am also writing a letter to you. I am here to say a few simple things._x000D_

If you follow these things, that would be great. No really, that would be cool, and your life will most likely become easier if not happier. _x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
But reallyâ€¦_x000D_
_x000D_
â€¦please never hide._x000D_
_x000D_
_x000D_
So as I sit here wrapping up my final letter I do not so out of sadness, or fear, or anger, or happiness, or love. I do so simply because I feel the need to do so. Please I must beg that I do not ever want this to be a sad message. I donâ€™t want this to ever be a message of hope either. If you want some hope look for that inside yourself through the actions you take. No this is a message of acceptance and I simply want to pass on that I can not accept the fact that I never learned anything of importance in my life. _x000D_

So thank you, fine reader. Thank you for being apart of the internet that gave roots to sites like Redvsblue.com or Reddit.com. You are the kind of person that helped foster communities that help breed happiness and help care to those who are in need of it. You are the player of the games, you are the trolls of the forums, you are the voice of reason. You all are apart of a generational and cultural phenomenon that may last for generations to come. So thank you for being you.  _x000D_
