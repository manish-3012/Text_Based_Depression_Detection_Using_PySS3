I'm pretty much done.Hi. 
I'm 17.
-6 members of my family killed themselves. 
-An idiot stalked me for three whole years (by getting my address&amp;phone number, approaching me every time I was walking to aggressively talk to me, forcing my friends to bring me letters, steal stuff from my desk and threaten me...) which triggered severe anxiety
- I have diagnosed BDD, Bulimia and depression.
And here's what pushed me over the edge:
- I was in love with a guy. No, it was not a crush. I loved everything about him, both his qualities and his flaws, and during the first three years, he was the one to cheer me up when (some of) his friends bullied me. He never showed any signs of liking me (I didn't speak to him about my feelings) until the fourth year. He then started to speak about me to his friends, and was overheard saying that he found me cute and liked me. During that whole year, not five seconds passed without him turning back to look at me in class (private school: we all have the same classes except for optional ones). He'd stare at me, smile, etc. And I personally heard him talk to one of his female friends about potentially going out with me. Then summer came, and when we came back in September his interest didn't seem to have diminished. But it was the last year and that meant our class was "broken" which meant that I'd only be in the same course as him twice every 9 days. We've had a very long story of love-hate relationship. I've said things I shouldn't have about him and he sure as hell did too. But we also both gave each other clear signs that we wanted to be together. However, most people assumed we hated each other because of our friend groups (that really hate each other). Whatever. I did notice we were getting closer, and I worked with counsellors for moths trying to build up the courage to ask him for a date during the after-prom (it was the only option: if I did it earlier and was rejected I risked being extremely bullied by some of his friends, and I knew I couldn't handle it...) And then...

He got depressed and dropped out. If I wait until prom night to ask him (via text), his interest would probably have already shifted as he would not have seen me for months. I can not ask him now for the same reasons why I couldn't ask him before prom... I can't handle this.  I don't care if people love me. I have huge empathy issues  and to be honest I only feel affection towards two people: him and my niece. He's not even my friend in any of the social medias. And following him would result in his friends trying to harm me...

So many people in my family did this. I know what kind of impact a suicide has on close ones... I don't care anymore. I wished I had a gun... But I guess I'll have to take the longer road by OD'ing on some of the several pills that I need to take on a daily basis. I'm so sorry. Jay. I love you so much.
