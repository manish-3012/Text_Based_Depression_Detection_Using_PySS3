Suicidal FriendI have a friend who's been scorned by everyone he's known and loved.  He's told me about people 'trying to push him over the edge' and that everyone's given up on him. I know he's talked with others about this, and a few of them have sorta let him go.  He's talked like this before, but this time seems very serious.  He's told me he wants to find people who want to show him affection, and that he knows nobody would ever love him. "I'm okay with being alone, I'm okay with being ignored and invisible because if nobody knows you're there in the first place, no one will know you're gone"

Please Help
