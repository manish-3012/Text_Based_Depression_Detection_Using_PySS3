I hate all my friends and myselfBasically nothing of worth makes me happy anymore, and recently one of the things to leave me is the love I had towards my friends. I used to adore my friendship group and enjoy talking to and doing things with them all, but now even just talking to them ends up annoying and upsetting me. It's like I'm starved of attention and love but at the same time I resent them for trying to give me those things. I simply don't know how to combat it, and like many other points in my life feel like running away from it and just killing myself.

I've been struggling with other things recently such as delusional thinking and lots of depressive episodes, and just don't know how to deal with it anymore. I feel like i have no one who loves me or even simply enjoys my company. I just feel like a downer of a human being who doesn't deserve attention. Idk what to do anymore.
