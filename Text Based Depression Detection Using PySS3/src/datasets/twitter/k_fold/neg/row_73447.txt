29 and doneI'm almost 30 years old and have struggled with bipolar for more than half of that amount of time. Nothing is working. I gave up the 'greys' of being on meds last year when I realized that they weren't doing their job. I simply cannot cope with life. My father commit suicide when I was a teenager. Several of my friends have. One friend did it last year and she used a method that I am sure I am going to use. I have a turbulent relationship with someone who is just as bad off as I am mentally. I have a child. I am not self sufficient. I have extreme self esteem issues and self image problems. I am almost constantly sick. I've tried twice to kill myself in the past and have been in a mental ward the same amount of times. I just cannot do this anymore. I feel like I am not meant for this place. I am a waste, a drain on society and its resources. The only salvation I ever had was my art and I have lost all drive for that as well. The only reason I've yet to off myself is that I want to do it when I am home alone, which is not often.
