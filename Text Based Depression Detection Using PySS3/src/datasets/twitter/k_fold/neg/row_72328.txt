In a room with a crazy momWe're financially poor to the point where we have to rent out a small room because we can't afford an apartment. My dad left me because my mom is too much to handle and I have no family to stay with. I'm a high schooler that isn't allowed to work. I'm stuck quarantining with this demon and I can't take it anymore. She used to abuse me with knives and shit when I was young until I was old enough to call the cops but she continues to mentally abuse me. Why can't she beat the shit out of me so I can report her??? She sometimes sneaks out at night to sleep with men and recently I've been coughing and choking. I donâ€™t know if I have the corona because she won't take me to the hospital, but it doesn't matter because I can't die from it though I wish I can.
