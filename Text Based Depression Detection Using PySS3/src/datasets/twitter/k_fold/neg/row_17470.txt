Disappointed I didnâ€™t die in my sleepIâ€™m tired of being alone, having no one to talk to everyday and being trapped in my own head is exhausting. I had to get rid of all my social media because I get too jealous of seeing my â€œfriendsâ€ having a great time with people.i know itâ€™s not right,I know I should be happy for others.it just gets hard not to be jealous of others who have a relationship or friends,I think about suicide 24/7 and itâ€™s fucking exhausting.
