Feeling so lonelyI'm halfway through college and I'm already miserable. I never had deep friends during HS either but we at least hung out during before school and during lunch. But now at college I have absolutely no one, and most days I just go to classes and come back to my dorm, eating lunch/dinner by myself.

I met a bunch of people and know their names and all, but that's about it. I feel that there's no one who actually wants to see me and cares for me; that is, someone who actually takes time out of their day to hang out with me or chat with me out of their own accord. Who would actually feel some sense of loss if I were to just die.

Sure I could probably message one of said guys above and chat about stuff (which is in fact pretty much all my social interaction is these days, but it's never the other way around. They never send me a message asking me about my day or anything. It feels like they're just responding back to my messages out of some obligation and then going on with their lies.)


And I know someone's going to post a comment with the generic "everyone cares" or "I care" but that's clearly not true.

&lt;rant&gt; How could someone on reddit care for a person they've never met and never will meet. If I hadn't made this post and just necked myself, there's no way you would have known. &lt;/rant&gt;

So if I have no one who genuinely cares about me then I feel the need to live diminishes significantly.

And I do feel it is indeed kind of selfish to want validation, but at the same time what I want isn't superficial validation but a friend that genuinely cares enough to want to take time out of their day to chat with me. Maybe the problem is on my end -- that I don't inspire anyone to do that, in which all the better that I die.
