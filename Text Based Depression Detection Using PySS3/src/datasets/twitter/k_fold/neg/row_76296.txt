Want to end itMy family doesn't care for me
My friends don't care for me
Not doing well in school
Starting to do poor at work
I have done everything I have ever wanted
I just wish I could have known what love felt like
But no one ever gave me a chance
I am probably going to bitch out like I always do
Why can't I just be happy
