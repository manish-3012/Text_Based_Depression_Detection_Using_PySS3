I've officially lost everything and my only hope is being able to afford a gun or something.I'll try to explain a bit.

What I can at least.

Recently I've lost every single thing I own aside from my gaming PC, a box of memory items (like keep sakes) and roughly 3 outfits. The reasons why I can't legally go into, but it was all stolen, given away, or destroyed. This includes several computers a retro gaming collection, a fucking house, many, many monitors, all six of my exotic pets, various aquariums, my friends, furniture most of which was antique and belonging to my mother, etc.

It's well over 200K at this point. And that's just my portion of things lost. My disabled friend was also hit p fucking hard. He too lost everything including the knife his almost dead father gave him.

I was date raped this past week. I don't want to talk about it much, I should have just left her at the club but she like 40 minutes away and I didn't want to be rude. I should have. She pissed all over my fucking car.

I lost all of my pets. My grandfather died, and then my dog. The two things on earth beside my ex girlfriend who I ever felt like actually fucking loved me. She also said that she never wanted to have sex with me aside from the first few times even though she lied throughout the whole relationship as to not disappoint me.

The girl who took my animals got them all care, which I guess is the only silver lining to this story. Except they aren't near well yet. They were heavily affected and I feel terrible about it. She says its not my fault, and despite logic backing up this fact, it still is. I owe her and her family a lot of money for doing this... Well over a thousand dollars.

I owe my ex girlfriend over 400 for the leftover bills on the house.

Just tripped over a cord and now I owe my boss $200 for his speaker when I had planned on quitting not even 10 minutes later. Now I have to work at a job where I am verbally berated for another two weeks.

The cute girl I matched with on tinder today turned out to only want my bank account info so I could watch her cam show. Not a bot, an actual person that lead me on and tried to get my bank account information to set up an account on a website to watch her... Aka, to just steal my fucking money.

Speaking of matching on tinder, the other girl I matched with told me that she was already going to the show I invited her to... But with someone else. The only other online dating person, aside from the one who covered my car in cum and piss unwillingly, is pregnant with twins.

The list goes on and on.

My business failed after having 4 3D printers stolen from me, and with one being held over my head and teased for sadistic delusional purposes.

It literally just goes on and on. I'm not making shit up here. It's p fucking bad.

Honestly I hope I survive the next few weeks. After I hopefully pay off this debt to my boss, then I'll give my car to the shop and be without transportation, alone, with my abrasive family, for possibly weeks if not months.

Hopefully I'll be able to afford a gun by then. Hopefully I'll be able to pay back my debt, which isn't even calculated for my mother but it's probably well over 40thousand dollars. Plus the roughly 5K I owe to friends that are not disabled and I don't even want to know how much I owe that guy.

And before someone says, go to the cops. I have. I did, way before any of this ever started spiraling. They were the most unhelpful. Then later they laughed at us, encouraged more violence and stealing, and then straight up lied everything on their end.

So yeah. A noose is less expensive than a sandwhich right?

And these are mostly all just money things, physical losses. We aren't even going to go into mental or emotional ones. Nah I'll just stop here.
