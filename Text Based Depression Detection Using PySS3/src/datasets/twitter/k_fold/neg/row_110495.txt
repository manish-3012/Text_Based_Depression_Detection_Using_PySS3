I dont know,Everything was okay. I had my thoughts under control and today... well, everything just sorta downgraded. 
I feel as if all my agency for myself and self confidence is faked. My entire life outside my room feels like a fucking dream. It feels hazy and i say whatever is on my mind and im relatively vunerable to the world.

What happened today? Why do i feel like taking a bunch of my fathers heart meds and calling it quits? Why wont these thoughts go away? I try so hard every day for them to leave so i can live a happy life but nothing is working. They keep coming back. I keep finding myself in a depressed haze. I'm getting tired. I'm losing interest in my boyfriend and my hobbies again. 

Why is it coming back? Why wont it go away? If it comes back one more time im going to stop trying.

I hate myself.
