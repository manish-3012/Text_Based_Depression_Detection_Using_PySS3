Not like you guys will care about me, but w/e...*sigh* last time I came here for help, nobody cared, nobody even took a look at this, and while I got better for a little bit, I'm back here, doing the same think I used to do.

Point being I'm not worth it anymore, I used to do so well in school, and now I can barely hold on to my schedule. I'm unstable at best, horrible and deadly at worst. I'm worried that if I don't kill myself first, I'll end up killing someone else :/

You guys probably won't ever see this, but...

Goodbye reddit, and thanks for nothing, SW.
