I hate myselfI donâ€™t know what to say. 
I recently graduated from college and I feel even more lost than I did in school. 
Iâ€™ve had so much free time to think and have been getting off my medication till I find a competent doctor and support ( I want to make it clear that I didnâ€™t feel any better medicated). All this thinking has landed me in a very dark place. 

Iâ€™ve been avoiding confronting it but obviously it comes out in actions and I feel my friends are tired of my mental health problems and are starting to distance themselves. It hurts but I guess I understand. I tend to be a bit eccentric and seemingly chill but once people get to know me I think theyâ€™re super disappointed that I have problems. 

I wish I could live up to the idea of me. 

Iâ€™ve struggled with body image my entire life, and a medication caused an enormous amount of weight gain which has really furthered my social anxiety. There are days when Iâ€™m terrified to leave the house because of this. 

Iâ€™m 23 year old woman whose never been in a relationship, and I feel out of touch. Iâ€™m 23 years old and I donâ€™t have a job, and I feel like a burden. 

I feel undeserving of the good things that have come to my life because I canâ€™t appreciate them. There are so many people in the world that are struggling and would kill to be me and here I am moping. If there was a way I could give my life to someone I would. 

I just see my existence in a very bleak and ugly way. I feel bad for existing. I feel bad for taking up space. 

I donâ€™t know what to do.... I think everyone around me is tired of me. I think itâ€™s time to exit. 

If youâ€™ve found yourself in a similar place but things have gotten better for you please help me out. I donâ€™t want to feel this way anymore.
