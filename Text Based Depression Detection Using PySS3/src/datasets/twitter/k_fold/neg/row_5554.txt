Getting better was a lieI was doing better for so long. Now I see that it was just an illusion, some wasted time trying to put off what I was supposed to do in the first place. God I'm so pathetic that whenever I hear about someone dying the only thing I feel is jealousy. No amount of medicine or therapy will ever fix me, it's always one more obstacle after the other and for what, to waste away by myself still having no friends and being regarded as an awkward creep forever.

Why the hell is it so hard to kill yourself? I would legitimately offer someone my life savings if they could guarantee a way to kill me painlessly or instantly but it's just a pipe dream. I'm going to fucking do it for real one of these days. I constantly feel like a ticking bomb. 

at least maybe people will like me more after I'm gone.
