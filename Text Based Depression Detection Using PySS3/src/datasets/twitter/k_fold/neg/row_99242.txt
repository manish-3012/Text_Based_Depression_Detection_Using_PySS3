Why? Why are we here? Why everythingWhat the hell is the point of life? Like if I seriously think about it all I can come up with is to be happy and make good memories. 

What do you do when you aren't happy, just sit back and hope you can find something that gives you pleasure? I'm 16 ya ya I'm young have a long life ahead blah blah. I don't want this life. Every day is a struggle, every thought is pain. I don't want help. I want out. 

The urge grows every day to just end it. I don't fear death, when the day finally comes I'm going to go outside grab the rope and jump 20 feet from a tree ripping my head off killing me. It should pop my head off like a cork on a bottle. 

I don't ever want to wake up, I want this life to end,
