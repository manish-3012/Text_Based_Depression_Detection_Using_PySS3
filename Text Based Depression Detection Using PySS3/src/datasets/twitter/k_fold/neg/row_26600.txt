What's the point?I never asked to be here and yet there's this whole list of expectations I was supposed to meet and since I didn't now I'm less than... Since I stopped caring about such expectations I'm the one to be sorry for... 

I'm really tired of being here, this year I tried for the second time to commit suicide and failed (another thing I suck at I guess) ever since I stopped actively trying to I said "hey maybe there's a reason" but it's still the same crap. 

As days go by I hate this life and people more and more. I know people are not to blame but damn the hypocrisy is amazing, I have to be empathetic but no one is actually willing to listen or even ask why or how I am feeling. 

I'll be here tomorrow and the day after wishing I wasn't here at all. So, help me understand please.... I never asked for any of this why can't I just quietly go? Why do I have to try/live? Who said I cannot simply fall asleep and turn the switch off? After all, it's not as if I'm making any contributions big or small. 

Seriously, what's the point of being alive?
