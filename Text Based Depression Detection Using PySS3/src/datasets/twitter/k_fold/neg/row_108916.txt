This is the breaking pointI don't know where else I can put this, I know that I can't keep it inside me anymore. I can't confess about this to anyone who knows me, or has a way of finding me. 

I got back from college today, and I've never felt this sick. This was the worst semester I've ever had, and I'm only a sophomore. I had to drop a course altogether halfway through, and I'm gonna take a summer course to make up for it, since it counts towards my major. Resultingly, I had to pass all of my classes this semester to still be considered a full time student and live on campus next semester. I don't think I've done. I'm almost entirely convinced I haven't, I've gone over the math. Either one or two classes have been failed entirely, I can't even be sure if I attended one's class to take its midterm, so I probably didn't.

I have no options after this point, everything I am has revolved around going to college, and this embarrassing performance is its breaking point. I can't explain why I didn't try harder, why I always slacked, why I didn't attend classes, only that I didn't and I have no excuses. I need to be full time so my tuition can be paid, otherwise I can't afford it. I'll also be kicked off my insurance and won't be able to afford the medication that's kept a long-time illness from flaring up, the last time it had done so made me drop over 30 pounds.

I don't have any goals beyond college, I have no pathways, no avenues, no ambitions. College was everything, it was the pin holding everything together. It was the road to the only future I have. If, and when, those grades come back, I don't have options. I can't even look at my parents, I can't talk to them. It would destroy them completely, and I would have no options left. I've always lagged behind my siblings, and this is the final nail in the coffin. I can't overstate how much college mattered and how much of a fucking joke it is that I let it slip past me like this.

I've considered suicide for a long time, but this is the first time it's felt so immediate and physical. It feels like a wall being pressed on me. It fills me with the same feeling of being dragged to the doctor's as a kid. I feel like it is the only reasonable avenue for me. If I can't succeed in the single, bare bones thing that my future depended on, what kind of person am I? What kind of future would I lead? I've done nothing but bring unnecessary stress and financial pain to my family.

I've never felt like this before. So claustrophobic and anxious. It's a burning sensation in my chest, a numbness in my jaw, and a shaking in my hand. I've never felt so trapped in my own skin. There's no way out. I have think about the reasonable ways I can go through with this; the methods the ensure success, I've failed so many things I'm terrified this'll just be another. And I'll have to live with my family knowing that alongside all my other failures. The person that never amounted to anything, wasted their money, and failed suicide. I'm afraid of even posting this, instinctively nervous about someone seeing something this embarrassing and low.

I can't even fucking listen to music or watch a funny video without feeling guilty and sick inside. I feel like my death is necessary and urgent. And every time I think about it, I remember that I only have myself to blame. At the end, it's always been me.
