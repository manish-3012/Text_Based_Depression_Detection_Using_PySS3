Thank youA few hours ago I wanted to kill myself. But I started looking around on here, reading replies and comments, and I honestly don't want to anymore. Just knowing that there are random people out there in the world who devote their free time to helping out people like me, is enough to truly make me feel happy. If we have people like you guys in the world, maybe it isn't such a bad place after all.
I think now, whenever I feel sad, I'll talk to you guys. Whether it be helping you out, or you helping me out. Thanks again for being amazing people.
