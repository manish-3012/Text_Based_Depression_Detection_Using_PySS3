Dear M,Youâ€™re a good friend. I know it can be difficult with me sometimes. Not difficult in the sense that Iâ€™m stressful or straining to be around. But, difficult in terms of being unmotivated and cumbersome to be with me. I know I try to be a good man, but I know that Iâ€™m boring as hell too. I know that we werenâ€™t really close or very far. That I was just... there. Just a warm body. I wish we were closer friends. I know it can be a chore around me. I feel that after you hang out with me, you check off this â€œHung out with J this weekâ€ and thatâ€™s that. 

And I know you donâ€™t think that way, you never would. 
And I know itâ€™s my fault for not being able to hang out, Iâ€™m working all the time.
And I know that we arenâ€™t closer because I pushed you away when Iâ€™ve had bad days. Now it should be up to me to make things happen, but I donâ€™t want to make you uncomfortable.

Itâ€™s my fault for being so unmotivated, for not getting my shit straight, for not helping you when you needed it.
Thisâ€™ll be my last bad day, I promise.

-J
