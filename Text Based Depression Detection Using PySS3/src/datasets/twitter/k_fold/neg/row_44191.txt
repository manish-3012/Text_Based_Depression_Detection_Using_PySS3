Should I even bother to live anymore?I just failed an exam in medical school and is on the verge of getting kicked out (they marked me very hard and this lecturer hates me for no reason.....she is a well known racist) and I really should have passed as aced the final exam.

My gf of 3 years left me for one of my best friends a couple months before my exam (out of the blue)

I got in an accident, my car got hit bad but no injuries.....alot of money to fix.

I lost my best friend

Those two were my closest friends.....now I have none.

I stand to lose about half a million dollars in school if I get kicked out
My parents have basically disowned me

I lost my apartment
I became addicted to alcohol and cigarettes and anti-anxiety drugs to help me through this time and I can't get out of it (the last 2 months or so)

This all happened in a period of the last 10 months.
Really, I did nothing to deserve this and I don't see the point that I am going through this. What really is the point of life when you try so hard and something else is in control and you can't do anything no matter how hard you try

Is there really a God? Why do I have to go through this?
