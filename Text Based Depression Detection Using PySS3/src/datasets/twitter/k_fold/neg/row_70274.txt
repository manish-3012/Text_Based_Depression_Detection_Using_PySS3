Anyone join the military?Hello fellow redditters, have any of you who have been depressed and lost meaning in life joined or thought about joining the military? I've been looking at this option for some time and trying to enlist but there have been a few snags. I think it might be good to dedicate myself to something greater than myself and focus on that lifestyle for a time, being able to travel outside of my home state, try new things, and meet new people; also, the benefits aren't bad. Perhaps military life can fill me with renewed purpose? I've heard a few stories however about people joining up and being pretty miserable and even suicides. Anyone have any experience they could share?

Airforce by the way, I did pretty well on my ASVABs but I need to retake them, maybe I can do even better this time around. Looking for a position in Cyber Systems or Space Command.
