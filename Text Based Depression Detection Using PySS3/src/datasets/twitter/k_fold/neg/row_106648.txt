Just read I have bad grammar so excuse thatEver since I was in primary school I've been bullied, the first instance I can remember was being pushed over by a kid called Mathew, I was walking down a path and all of sudden he just shoves me, I don't react other then with just laying face first in the ground crying, I for sent too the principles office and got told it was my fault. I remember being stuck in what's essentially a glass box for the whole day, and throughout my primary school years this would happen nearly on a daily basis just being locked up in this glass box I never got school work in the room so I was weeks behind in school work, one time I remember I was in that room for 5 school days straight because I couldn't do my maths work, it was there fault I couldn't do it yet they blamed me, another time when I was actually out of that room I got mobbed by about 20 kids , I was in I think year 5 and they were in year 7. I tried too run but I just couldn't get away from them, I did smash one of there faces into a drink fountain, knocked both his front teeth out. The rest I don't remember because I think I got knocked out. But I remember after being in the office with a bloody nose and cuts and bruises all over me. Now at home during this time it wasn't much better both my mum and dad were addicted too Xanax and various other hard drugs like heroin one day my dad killed a aboriginal guy, he fell asleep while driving my mum's car and hit and killed him, when the police raided my house they found a meth lab and we got kicked out, I also watched my dad beat the shit out of my mum more times then I can remember, he broke her nose multiple times and then would direct his anger onto me when it wasn't my mum, my brother was treated like a golden child and he got everything, I was alone and had no one so I would go out the back and climb this massive tree we had just too get away from everything. Now as I entered high school the bullying got worse I was basically bashed on a daily basis or I would get help up by the throat constantly as well. I remember one time I got hunted by about 5 kids from various years some of them were year 12s. Luckily I hid and then left school that day, I can't imagine what would have happened if I didn't. I got myself kicked out of that school because I couldn't handle all the bullying. I then moved too a different school and the same bullying happened I had people throw chairs at me push me down the stairs and just hit me for nothing, i cane home crying every single day with bruises all over my body around the time I was in year 9 my dad got out of prison, and it was great he hadn't changed but I missed him, but then he started getting violent again about a year after he got out he tried too bash me he is much much bigger then me and I just ran down my street and stayed in a park for the night, I came back the next morning and everyone acted like it didn't happen, another time he cornered me and just started swinging, and didn't stop my mum tried too pull him off me and she got smashed into a wall, the police did nothing because we had no proof, bruises weren't enough. 

I'm gonna leave this here because this is already really long but if you want the rest message me and I'll tell you what happened after.
