Feeling disconnected and a failureWent through a messy breakup three years ago which did a huge number on my confidence. I dealt with that by working long hours everyday and neglecting my health. I became mildly successful at my job. After two years of using my job as a distraction I realised it doesn't fulfil me. Figured I'd try and connect with people in hopes of feeling a little bit less lonely. I had plans with my colleagues to go to a bar tonight but they blew me off. I also made an attempt of putting myself out there. I met someone and we planned our first date tomorrow. Two days ago she texted me saying she wasn't sure if she'd finish the assignments for her thesis so she cancelled. I just found out she spend the entire day sightseeing in Brussels. I feel like shit. I feel treated like shit.

I've had suicidal thoughts before. This time I'm going to act on them. I should just accept that I can't change and just end it.
