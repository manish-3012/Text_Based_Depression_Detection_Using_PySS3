I plan to do it, but I'm scared of what my fiance might do.
I've been depressed for so long and I feel like I'm dragging my fiance down with me. I had a horrible week in which I cried and was irritated the whole time. And at the end of it, he made me go back home by train with 2 other guys, which ended up being an awful day, because I heal by being alone, away from my shitty family and people in general, so that just made me feel worse. So I made him cry and feel bad and he says he hates the way his life sucks and I can't stop thinking that I'm the reason he's unhappy.  With my eating disorder and depression, I barely have any will to live. I don't care if I died rn. I'm unmotivated and I just play games on my phone as a distraction. But my fiance isn't into this, he doesn't like staying inside all day, and I understand that. He hates himself for not being able to help me (when I don't want help) and I just think he would be better off without me. And since I have no goals and aspirations besides maybe being happy with him...I plan on killing myself next week. And I'm not sure about it yet. He's going to be on a vacation with all his male friends (which I'm supper happy about, I really want him to have some fun) and I plan on doing it while he's gone. I just spent the last few days purging all day. I'm tired. I don't know what to do. I don't know if it will affect him. He cried when his work colleague got fired. I don't know what he,ll do when he,ll find me dead in the apartment ): 
A part of me doesn't want to do it, a part of me thinks he deserves better
I don't know if this is a cry for help, or not, I just...needed to tell someone
