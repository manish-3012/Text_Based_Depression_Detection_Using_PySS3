I really want to kill myself but I canâ€™t. And I donâ€™t know whyi know that in a year or two everyone will forget about me and donâ€™t try to tell me otherwise. my mother would honestly make some joke about how she doesnâ€™t have to pay for my shit anymore. my father and i werenâ€™t that close and my sister never really cares about what i have to say or what iâ€™m doing. nobody does. everyone interrupts me, forgets iâ€™m there and even forgets my name. i donâ€™t have any close friends and all of them forget about me even if iâ€™m right next to them. 

iâ€™ve wanted to do it for a while but iâ€™ve never had the guts and i get a sick feeling in my stomach every time iâ€™m suicidal. i dont know what to do because i canâ€™t keep feeling this way. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s preventing my from just doing it.
