How do I feel better?Well basically I feel like shit, like all the time.  Most of my time is spent fantasizing about killing myself.  I visualize sticking a knife into my neck, or how my blood would feel leaking out of me after slitting my wrists.  Right now I have a strong urge to drive around looking for a very high bridge to jump off of.  I'm worried that I'll lose control soon and follow through with my fantasies.  I need to feel better, and fast, or I may lose my life.  I realize posting to reddit probably won't help me find the answer but I'm at the end of my rope here, and I don't know where else to turn.
