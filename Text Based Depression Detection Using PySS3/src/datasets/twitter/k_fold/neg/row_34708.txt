iâ€™ve never been worse but iâ€™m so scared to reach outim suffering and im so fucked in the brain this time i think i need meds. i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me and i feel trapped and so alone in my own mind i just have nothing as a distraction anymore. i thought art was helping me hold on but i feel like nothing i do can help me now. i feel like hell but i find it so hard to talk to my mum about it to reach out so I truly think im gonna die. i had a mental breakdown last night and relapsed (c*tting) and itâ€™s NEVER been more hell since then. i had a panic attack earlier actually thinking i was going insane and then i passed out and almost threw up. absolutely no one knows whatâ€™s going on in my brain. iâ€™m so mentally sick this has been building up for the longest fucking time i have been through so much shit my brain just canâ€™t take it anymore. im struggling more than ever now and i need it to just stop. i need something to save me thereâ€™s just way too much going on in my brain it wonâ€™t stop. it never has and it never will.
