Please help me I don't know what to doMy brother shot himself in the head and my parents rushed to bring him to the hospital. I'm staring at his room, where the gun and the blood splatters and puddles are... I don't know what to do.. should I call the police? Should I clean up the blood off the room to spare my parents when they come home? Please, please help.
