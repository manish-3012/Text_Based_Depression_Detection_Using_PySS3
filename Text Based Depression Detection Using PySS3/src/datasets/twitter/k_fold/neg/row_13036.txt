I want to die but I don't want to do it myself.Sometimes I get the feeling that Iâ€™m never going to be that picture in the news, of the kid who died because of an accident or a fire or a murder. And most people would say that's a good thing. But I feel guilty. Because those people wanted to live. And I just want to die.

I don't know if I could ever do it.. I've thought about it..my brother has a gun in his closet. But I don't know if I could be that person. But if someone did it for me, or if there was an accident.. I think I would be alright. I have nothing to live for. I feel worthless and useless and the few people in my life would be better off and no one else would notice. But I think deep down I know I won't off myself.

Sorry if this is the wrong place for this.... I'm kinda new to reddit and didn't really know where else to put it but I needed to say it.
