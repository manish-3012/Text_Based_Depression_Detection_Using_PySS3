I don't want to be alone.I'm sick of having a shitty life and being alone ALL the time. I've just reached the point where I think I'm ready. I have cut a couple of times now, and I think I'm able to cut my arteries in my wrist. Did enough research to know exactly what to do. I can't stop thinking about it.

I'm home alone for some hours and I don't know if I can keep myself from just doing it. Does anybody want to talk to me? I just don't want to be alone anymore.



* EDIT: I really appreciate that you people want to talk to me. Out of nowhere, my sister just called me. It's almost as if she felt I needed somebody to talk to/to be with. So now I'm having dinner at my sisters' place. I wish I could talk to all of you, but now I can't, please forgive me. Thanks so much to all of you.

p.s. I will respond to all of you whenever I can!
