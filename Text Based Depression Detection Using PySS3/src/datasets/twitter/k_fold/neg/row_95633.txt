hopelessI have been disassociating so much recently I cant remember what's dream and what's real. Everything is so stressful. Medical Bill are piling up and my work isnt scheduling me enough hours to get by. I have been too depressed and and anxious to leave the house and my room is getting hella messy. I cant go outside without having dysphoria because of my female body.
