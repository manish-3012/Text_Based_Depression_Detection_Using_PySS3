The KÃ¼bler-Ross ModelI think I'll never reach acceptance, no matter how many times I bounce around from denial, anger, bargaining and depression. 

I've been harbouring these thoughts of wanting to kill myself since I was 12. Every time I say anything that even alludes to my real emotions, my parents would tell me to suck it up and deal with it because my problems aren't problematic enough for me to want to die. They said I'd grow out of it, but 5 years later I'm still here.

I've tried everything to break the cycle. I began to draw, write, dance, picked up sports, made new friends, but it's not working. I don't want my friends' concern. I am undiagnosed and I don't want them to think I'm a snowflake. 

Going home is hell because even if my grades are decent, my parents would say things about my weight and appearance that put me down. 

Last September I thought I found someone I could finally speak to. Speaking about the things I loved was great until they grew tired of me and left me in February. 

I hate everything there is about me. There's nothing in me that anybody will love. My parents say they love me but when it comes down to it, they'll turn my sadness into a situation all about them and how they're the victims. I know I have friends but I'm too scared to open up to them fully. I just want to accept myself.

I stopped caring about being fat and ugly. I don't even want to think about my future anymore.
"Your life is so great! Think about all the other..."
How about this: accept that there is no acceptance.
