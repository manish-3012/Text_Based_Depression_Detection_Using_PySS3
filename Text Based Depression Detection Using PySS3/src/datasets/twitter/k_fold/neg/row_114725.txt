I'm Out.This is my goodbye.

I have a beautiful partner, a gorgeous three month old daughter, a good job, a house, and a car - and I have never been more unhappy than I am right now.

It has been a very difficult decision, but I can't live with my depression anymore. Everyone, and I do mean everyone, will be so much better without me. My partner will be okay in time, my daughter will never know I really existed, I have zero real friends so no worries there. 

I've decided how, and when, I'm going to go. And where. Where was very important. Not in the family home, as I don't want to leave that kind of burden there, but near to where I grew up. I'm going to act on my decision in two days. I have already bought the prescription drugs to complete the action. I know that they will work. 

Goodbye.
