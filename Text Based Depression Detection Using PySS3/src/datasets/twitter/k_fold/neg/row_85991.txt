I can't take this anymore. (And some questions)First of all. I don't care about your hotlines, meditation, counseling, or antidepressants. Maybe they work for others but not me.

You have no reason to consider anything I say or ask of importance, feel free to ignore. No reason to waste your time.

I'm committing suicide but want to minimize the fallout to people who did nothing wrong. Sure, people who deserve it can feel bad and I'd just be giving them what they asked for: being gone.

I don't want my family to feel bad. Or some other people in my life who are depressed and don't deserve extra pain.

People keep telling me I'm stupid, annoying, and ask others to my face to get rid of me, and that they want me gone. Don't tell me it's just joking. It's not. All they do is make fun of me and ask me to leave. I wish I could have friends but the people who pretend they're friends with me just use me as some sort of autistic clown to entertain them.

I know they're right. I'm just a burden, there to make both them and me suffer. I'm doing them a favor. 

I hate my life. I wouldn't wish my life on anyone.

Just let me go. Give my organs to people who need them and deserve them. Might as well make me useful for something.
