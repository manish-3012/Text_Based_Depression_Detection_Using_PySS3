strange realisationIm 17 and I am probably not gonna be here for very long. Ever since I was little I always had a plan to go before 21. 

And like this year people have been like "So what are you gonna do after school?" and "What are your plans for the future?" - And I have just understood...I don't have any plans for my future *because* I don't intend to be around for that future. 

I'm not sure if this is worrying or actually reassuring.
