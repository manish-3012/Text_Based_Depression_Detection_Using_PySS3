Suicide is inevitable for me2 years ago I picked up a stray cat, she was really small and boney so I decided to take her home and feed her. I ended up keeping her and named her Berry. Back then I was still depressed but it's gotten worse since. I've lost my best friends because I shut myself away from them. Every time I think about the memories we made together I start crying and I think that I'll never be able to see them again. It took me a long time to build up the courage to talk to someone about my suicidal thoughts but I finally decided to talk to my mom because she was the person I trusted the most. When I talked to my mom about my depression she said that she would get me help. It's been a year since I first talked to my mom about this and nothing has happened.  Everytime I would bring it up again she would tell me that she was going to get me help but nothing ever happened. A couple years ago my sister was having suicidal thoughts and my mom was able to get her the help that she needed so why wont she help me? I feel like my mom has abandoned me and I feel completely worthless. I dont know what else to do. Berry is the only thing I have that's worth living for and she is going to die one day. The only thing I can see myself doing in that situation is killing myself
