I don't want to dieI have been thinking I'm okay but I'm not. Every day I feel so tired and meaningless. I try to be busy all day until get night and then I think that I'm just waiting to the day my life ends. I don't have real problems, I have family and friends (not many, but good friends) but I dont know why I feel like this. I'm scared about death but at the same time I don't want to feel like this. And I can't tell nobody because I don't want to bittersweet anybody.  I read many comments in here and I feel so sad, there are so many people feeling life is no sense, and misunderstanding that I just think it's not fair, I would like to help everyone and I can't. I feel so blame. I hope with all my heart everyone here gets better and could be happy. In my case, I just feel there's must be something wrong with me, maybe I can't be happy. I don't know what to do, I don't want to die, but I don't want to live my life waiting to die.
