Life sucks when I wake up.Iâ€™m 18.  Iâ€™m in physical pain every day due to physiological anxiety and a thyroid disorder. I drag myself to class everyday but I have no friends at college. The only thing that keeps me alive is my family. I am fairly attractive, athletic, and intelligent, yet romantic love has never been reciprocated toward me. I feel as if nobody will ever commit to me or enjoy my company. I spend every day alone writing music and playing video games, swallowing my sadness. Today I start a new antidepressant. The one I was on before gave me a bunch of weird side effects. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. Please help me.
