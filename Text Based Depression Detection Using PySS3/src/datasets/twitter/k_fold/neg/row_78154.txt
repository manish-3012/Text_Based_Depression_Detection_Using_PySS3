No money, no options, history of abuseSo I've read a lot of posts and notes from suicidal people, and usually it's pretty obvious that they have plenty to live for. A loving family, a bright future, etc. So when they say they want to die you just have to remind them. But what do you say to someone like me? College dropout, shitty part time job, no options or prospects. I live with my mom and abusive step dad and four siblings. I have a wonderful girlfriend but she's going a lot farther than me in life and only stays with me because I'm her first. I can't even move away because I can't afford a car. And maybe it's the abuse but I've never felt that life was good, ever. Life is suffering. I don't enjoy waking up every day, it's just painful. I don't know. Thanks for reading.
