I don't think I can survive on this planet.I can't stop reminiscing about my past; a not so happy, penniless family with ignorant, hot tempered parents who not in the slightest, physically and mentally prepared to have children. I'm not proud of being indoctrinated as a Muslim either. But still, I tried to keep my chin up.

Finished high school, got a degree, and tried to get a job while at the same time invest on my passion. I tried, oh believe me, I tried my ass off trying to achieve success. Alas, it went backfired. Just what I need.......being broke, useless, hopeless and nobody giving a shit about you. I'm at my breaking point already. I'm done.

I just hope my family will be able to move on with their lives without me........
