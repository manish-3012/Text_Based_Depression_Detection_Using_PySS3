I've been overcome by these thoughts for too long..I figured when I got my life back on track that they would end. I got the pills, a new job, a new bank (may seem small but it means alot to me), a new girl who cares alot about me (that I'm to afraid to ask out because I don't want to get hurt again), I started hanging out with friends again and ultimately a 'fresh start'. For a time it felt like I was in control again, my doctor even said I was getting better and would slowly be weaned off. 

Even though I'm 10x better than what I was like before I still feel like the world would be better off without me. These feelings aren't out of depression either. I've started to put 'the mask' on making people believe I am better when I'm still struggling. I feel quite weird for still thinking the world would be better off without me. I have enough saved up so I could even pay for my own funeral if I wanted to.

 I even turned to religion looking for a answer, but because of the depression I had before I know everyone's true intentions. I went to a Christian school for most of my life until I graduated a few years ago. I know all about "god being good" and such. But it all seems highly fabricated to be (I apologize if that offends anyone, that was not my intent).

TL;DR: I don't know why I'm still feeling this way, I've tried so hard to get better. I broke down most of the walls and am rarely depressed. Yet I still feel like my life isn't worth living even tho it's getting better. I guess you could say I feel 'bored' of living. Like there's no reason I should continue. I know I'd miss out having a family and stuff, but that doesn't bother me.. Only reason I'm still here is because there are people that care about me that I wouldn't want to see sad.
