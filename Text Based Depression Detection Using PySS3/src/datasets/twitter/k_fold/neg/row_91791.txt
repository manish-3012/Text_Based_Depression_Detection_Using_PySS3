Persistent thought running through my mind for a good part of the day. "I'm what happens when an egg and sperm meet and later wish they hadn't"I can't look back on my life so far without seeing it as a comedy of errors which has led to my being an eccentric, introverted, irrelevant misanthrope trying to get by in a world where self confidence, extroversion, obedience, ongoing bureaucratic 'skill' acquisition and optimism in spite of evidence are the most important personality traits one can have. I cringe thinking about the length of time this farce of an existence may go on if it remains unchecked. Also, philosophically speaking, I'm a reductionist, and yet I'm extremely uncomfortable being closely monitored and reduced to performance statistics and reviewed by an authority figure, with a generic "leader" personality at best, trained to manipulate the lowest common denominator, who barely knows anything about me, takes themselves way too seriously and whose authority I don't necessarily respect. Seems like that's "work" though, and we all have to spend most of our daily time and energy doing it.

So jaded and cynical. I know. I just can't help it. I feel like it's where my experiences have led me.
