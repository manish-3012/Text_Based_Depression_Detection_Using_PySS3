I'll be 27 next monthHey, i just want to off myself lately. Recently, I've had several good opportunities to jump out my window or hang myself. I don't have many positive interactions with people, and people are moving on to their better chapters while Im not. Im depressed about job opportunities, my height, women. If i died not many people would know or care at this point. I guess people walk on eggshells when they talk to me, i didn't know that. I blame my Mom. She always was like that. Well it's me now and i have to fix all of this and fend for myself. Idk. I feel like my life's falling apart. Maybe that's my overreacting mind. I haven't found much success with women lately, and there's pretty couples everywhere so i feel horrible about my life like i fucked it up. I never hurt anyone, or at least not with any bad intentions.
