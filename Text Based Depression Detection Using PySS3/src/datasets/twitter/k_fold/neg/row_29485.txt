SuicidalIâ€™m done with life. I tried everything I give up. My parents divorced and my dad went to jail I was in foster care and this was all when I was 5. After I got out of foster care I would live with my dad and never see my mom. And then when I was 13 I was allowed to see my mom again and she made my life miserable. I get yelled at everyday from both parents and all they care about is my grades and my dad says Iâ€™m a disappointment and my mom says I will never be anything. Iâ€™ve been wanting to kill myself for a year and a half now Iâ€™m 14. I Might just runaway instead. I need where to go after I runaway and how to have enough balls to suicide.
