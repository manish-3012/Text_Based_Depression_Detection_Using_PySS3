Kill me now, I want and need to dieI can't do this anymore. I'm done fighting. I'm done trying. I'm done hoping. I have nothing left, except the will to die. I have a rope in my hand, and I am going to hang myself. If that doesn't work, I will poison myself. I will try anything and everything, and if all else fails, I will get a gun and shoot myself. NOTHING IS GONNA STOP ME. I WILL DIE!!!!!
