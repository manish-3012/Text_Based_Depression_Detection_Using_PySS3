Last night I attempted suicide. I failed.I spent this morning cleaning up blood, and sanitizing my wounds. I took a shit ton of sleeping pills so that I would hopefully pass while asleep, but I actually woke up this morning. When I first stood up, I didn't know what was real. I've been having mild hallucinations and I'm not sure if it's from a non-lethal overdose of over the counter sleeping tablets, a bit of psychosis, or a  a massive amount of blood loss. All that I achieved from last night ended up in me being sore and thirsty as hell. 

I don't want to die, I never did, but it was the preferred option compared to living. Now, I'm not so sure. I don't know how, but I suddenly have an intrinsic motivation to live. I want to rebuild, I don't want to leave yet, but the actions of last night really screwed things up. I lost and scarred the best friend of my life, the person I loved more than anything, and now she only interacts with me using a five-foot stick. The only thing that anchored me to living for the last seven months was her, and now that I lost her, I don't understand why I actually want to live. I have virtually no family, and I have no other friends that I am nearly as close with as her. I'm kinda lost, but as stupid as it is, hopeful at the same time. My attempt to kill myself really opened my eyes to the world around me, and I just wanna be happy for a little bit longer before I exit this place.
