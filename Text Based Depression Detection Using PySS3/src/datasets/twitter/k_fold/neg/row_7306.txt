My friend doesn't love me anymore, and its broken meI made a post a monthish ago saying that my friend was the only thing keeping me from suicide, and that we were drifting apart. One of you guys said to talk to her about how we were falling apart, and that she probably cares for me as much as I do for her (plutonically). So I talked to her, and she doesn't anymore. I had called on her to many times for mental health help, and for her own health, she had to stop being my friend, which I totally understand, and I forgive her for. But now I have no one in my life that I care about enough to stay for, and all I can think about is suicide, and her. And I can't cope, and I don't know what to do, and I'm just so scared.
