Another sock puppet account. Another person thinking about it.I was once the person in here with my normal account helping others. But I feel out of options. I'm 50. So yeah, I'm old. My career in the entertainment industry was just about over despite an amazing resume and an Emmy win. But although my career took an upswing, the other person who does what I do on the show, (it's complicated,) go me fired. And my talent agent is out of town and I'm sure he'll drop me after this when he gets back. I just don't know what to do anymore. This was my one shot and it was going amazing. And I was let go 1 week before health insurance would have kicked in. One week before I was eligible for unemployment. And trust me. I'd be thinking the same thing. He must be difficult to work with or some other problem. But no. A friend whom I wish not to burden with my plan to end my life said they should make a movie about how unbelievably unlucky I've been.

I'm too young and poor to retire but too old to reinvent myself. I'm in a shitty hotel scared to death of taking my life, but scared to death of living anymore. I just don't know what to do anymore.

I have a 16 year old niece who worships me. I don't want to hurt her but I can't live this life anymore for others. If I do it quick and get it over with, she'll be devastated, but she'll survive.

I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm so ashamed of my life and I don't want to kill myself, but I see no other options. So I'm here. Just like I've been in the past helping others. 

My hotel is within earshot of the freeway. It's the only thing I can think of. Jumping off the overpass. But I hate to do that to another person.

Idk. I'm just rambling. But I'm scared. And I'm lost. And the suicide hotline, as well-intentioned as they are, didn't do much. 

I'm just clicking send now. Out of ideas.
