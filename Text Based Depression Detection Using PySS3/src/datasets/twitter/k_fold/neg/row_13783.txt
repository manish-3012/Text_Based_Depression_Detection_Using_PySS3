A need to communicate.I have been writing there a lot. The thing is I am going through a very rough time, slowly getting professional help. I feel constantly terrified and suicidal. Each time I get home I break down. At night too. I am very isolated. A lot on the internet has been very toxic to me but I have nowhere else for now. All the negativity is pulling me down and producing more stress. I feel too lonely in my breakdowns. They seem unbearable and last until I get sick or sleep. I just wish I could feel safe somewhere instead always being in a state of fear and need to hide from everyone or be prepared to fight back. I need some good people around me. I'm going crazy.
