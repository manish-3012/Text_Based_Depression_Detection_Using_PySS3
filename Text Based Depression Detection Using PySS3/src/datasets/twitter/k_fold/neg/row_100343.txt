In a rut, to say the least.To give some background: I am diagnosed Borderline Personality Disorder with comorbid Bipolar, aged 22 and a current university student that lives alone.

 Since I was little I had the urge to destroy things that I loved, not people, it'd never be that. Maybe toys, tearing apart my favourite soft toy for example. I've always been a very negative person. When I began to grow older this really came out and I suffered (and still do) prolonged periods where I would almost habitually self injure, but I would never think of killing myself.

Things were looking up, moving away to a new place and getting entered into the mental health system, a mixture of Cognitive Beavhioural Therapy and a regim of Venlafaxine (An SNRI). Recently things have fallen apart. My Psychotherapist missed an appointment in November as he was ill. I have phoned and phoned to rebook it but this never happens, despite being told it's important and that I'm definatly not struck from the records. Likewise my psychiatrist sent my appointment letter to an address I haven't used in year, casuing me to miss an appointment with her. I have tried to contact her but my GP can only do so via mail. I'm so scared that I wont be able to get back in to this health system as I think I still need it. To make matters worse I recieve a letter today, telling me to come to an appointment on the 15th of February, I don't know why it didn't arrive here but I think this might've been the last oppertunity to get the help going again.

I'm sick of not sleeping, I'm sick of my meds not working. I'm sick of needing to take either Temazepam or Zopiclon on a revolving basis just to get the tiniest semblance of sleep.

This worry has all piled up and I pushed beyond my usual threshold so I guess now I'm the polydrug abuser that everyone always knew I would be. I made myself a series of (no doubt stupid) promises, and even touching heroin was on that list. The person I was, or should be, isn't the person that's writing this. I mean, I am, but it's not [my name]. I can't convey this.

I don't know if I can kill myself. The occasional negative thought becoming overwhelming has had me consider it before, but for the last week or so all I can think about is suicide. It seems like a practical choice for me. I've been abandoned by both my psychiatrist and my psychotherapist, I doubt university will ever amount to much for me, I've finally come to that level where I've taken the drugs I promised myself I wouldn't touch. 

I've lost all the love for everything I once had. It's not just an apathy. Music, reading, writing, films. They all seem like I'm being bludgeoned with something but the only other option is the intense, crippling silence which gives my thoughts free reign.

I honestly don't know what to do.

I'm sorry to waste anyone's time that would read this scrambled mess.
