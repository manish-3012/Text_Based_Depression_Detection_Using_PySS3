Frusterated, Angered, I just want to end myself brutally but I can't.I'm stuck in a limbo. I've tried killing my self once a long time ago but I failed like everything else I've ever done in my wasteful existence. It got even worse when my parents came home to the bloody mess I made. I'm absolutely disgusted by myself. Seeing them confused and in tears. What the fucking hell am I doing. I now promised them that I wouldn't ever try anything like that again. I know I can't keep that promise. But I can't do it anymore. I want to just destroy myself. I'm sick of existing and this feeling of restriction makes it worse. Like a cooking time bomb. 

Writing this makes me so tired... thinking about this makes me tired but I can't stop. Sometimes I take a walk around my town looking for some way out but all I come back with is distant stares and a feeling of emptiness. Seeing a long drop makes me feel sooo good but the pain and mess worries me. Like always i'm a coward. I don't want anyone to see me like that. 

Walking around I sometimes wish I just grab the nearest person and just pray for their help. It's insane. I don't want to be seen as insane. Leave those people out please... it's so FUCKING ANNOYING. 

I know one day. I'll die by my own hands. I don't know when but it'll be good. It feels so good knowing that. It's the only thing the really feels good anymore. Everything feels like a chore. Like some tired charade.

I can't fix this. It's like being crushed under something. I want to just carve myself up. Somewhere where no one can find me. I want to go cry somewhere but I feel incredibly lightheaded... guys. I just hope someone reads this. I feel disconnected. I feel like i'm part of nothing. I was fucking mistake.
