I'm still fighting but it's difficultSo to sum it up I've finally been in treatment for what I actually have (bipolar) since last July...I ended up in the hospital where I'd end up getting 2nd, 3rd and 4th opinions...and stopped fighting the whole thing. Things have actually been really good for me for about seven months when I hadn't been able to string together more than three or four in any given year for the past twenty or so. 

Now I'm under a lot of stress and what's going on IS situational, I know that intellectually but my brain screams it's never going to get better. I have my job woes...mostly due to the fact that I'm fighting a whole lot of paranoia. I'm fighting through anxiety and some depression too...more anxiety than depression. I'm worried about my husband's job too because there have been cutbacks at his work. I'm trying to figure out how to deal with the fact that I'm stuck doing things I don't want to do anymore...I just don't know what to do period. 

The paranoia especially but the anxiety also and to a smaller extent the depression....are making me want to quit....my life. I'm tired of things getting bad over and over and over again. I don't think I'm going to DO anything and if I get the least inkling that I might I'll have myself readmitted but I'm fighting the thoughts. I'm fighting them hard and the fight is tiring and I just want to give up. I want to lay down and rest and never have to get up again.
