Could someone help convince me not to kill myself?Iâ€™m 21, Iâ€™m an undergrad. I was doing great for a year as a pre law political science major, I fell in love with math and coding during my sophomore year, but my grades have been taking a hit (dropped from a 3.9 to a 3.2 in 2 years). I just found out that I failed calc 3 and I donâ€™t have the wherewithal to retake it next semester. Iâ€™d be embarrassed and I feel like a failure. 

I know itâ€™s probably selfish. I have a girlfriend who loves me, a family who adores me, but I really feel like Iâ€™m nothing. I donâ€™t have any more options and Iâ€™m gonna disappoint them alive or dead, and I canâ€™t shake this urge to throw myself off a building. I donâ€™t know what to do or who to talk to, could one of you please help me?
