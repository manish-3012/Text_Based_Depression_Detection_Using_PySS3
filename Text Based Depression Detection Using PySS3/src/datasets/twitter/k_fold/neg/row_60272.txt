I have no idea what my future holds, or if I even have a future.I don't know myself or what I am capable of. If my past is anything to go by, I'm looking at a constant cycle of self-destruction, recovery and relapse. 

I got drunk tonight, just kept drinking until the bottle was empty. Then I grabbed my pills and just swalled a few too many. 

I don't even know what the reasons were. At this moment in time I know I don't care for the consequences (spelling) of my actions, what I do know is that 'future me' might care a great deal tomorrow. 

To save anyone worrying by the way, I'm fairly confident that I'm in little danger of harm from the tablets. (Pregabalin 600mg, Amitriptilyne 20mg, Escitalopram 20mg) - just more than my usual dose. 

I'm not really thinking about what I type. But I need to vent some hurt. I can't escape my past, the experiences I had in my teen years haunt me on a dsily basis. They have defined me as a person now and I am still working at overcoming them. 

I'm just so tired of it all.
