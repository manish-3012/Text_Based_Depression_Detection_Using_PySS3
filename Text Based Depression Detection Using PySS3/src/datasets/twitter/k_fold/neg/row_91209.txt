Suicide HotlineI called the hotline for the first time in my life tonight. It was completely useless. â€œDrink some water and watch your favorite tv show before bed.â€  Like hereâ€™s the thing lady, I havenâ€™t been able to stop thinking about killing myself for the last week. I wanted some help not some bullshit about watching tv. Goddamn. Has anyone else had this problem? Should I call back? Are there other lines I can call with better people? I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™m grasping at straws here. I want to die and literally have not been able to think about anything else for days now. Iâ€™ve never felt like this before. Iâ€™ve been depressed for about a year and Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts before but nothing this serious or persistent.
