My life feels like itâ€™s falling apart.My name is Jacob. I graduated college in the spring without a job or a place to live due to medical/mental health stuff getting in the way of recruiting. I found a job in my home town and live with my parents, but I have no one to talk to and support me. 

I met a girl that developed into a long-distance relationship. She was the first person in my life that I truly felt comfortable around and could be myself. I could wear piercings, express my bisexual side, and felt so content with who I was. A few weeks ago she stopped texting me as much and was much less responsive. It felt like things were falling apart but when I brought it up she said she was just stressed with college and life. We had a weekend planned together and last night she texted me and told me we are over. I no longer have anyone in my life that I can talk to or support me, and because of previous relationships where Iâ€™ve been raped, abused, I donâ€™t think I am capable of letting anyone else close to me. 

My job isnâ€™t something I enjoy. It barely pays the bills and doesnâ€™t push me. Iâ€™m from a top university and all of my peers are making so much money with jobs they love and seem so fucking happy. I donâ€™t have anything anymore that will motivate me to get out of bed in the morning. I donâ€™t have anyone. I am no longer comfortable expressing myself. I removed my piercings, pride stickers, art, and everything on my Instagram. Nothing has brought me joy in the past year that used to: games, movies, photography, art, music, nothing. My life has been spiraling again for the past two years, and this was kind of the final straw. Iâ€™ve been telling myself that life will get better. But it doesnâ€™t feel like it. 

I tried to drive off a bridge today and stopped myself before calling a suicide hotline. I want to go to therapy, but I donâ€™t want to live forever. I am not capable of letting another person get as close to me as she was. Before I met her, I decided Iâ€™m going to give it one last go with someone I develop that much trust in. Iâ€™ve been hurt so much by people I trusted (rape, physical/mental abuse, ghosting, theft, drugging, blackmail, etc.) and I canâ€™t put myself through it again. Being alone sucks and I feel like I am unloveable and unwantable. Iâ€™m lost and donâ€™t really want to be here anymore.
