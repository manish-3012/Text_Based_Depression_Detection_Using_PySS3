This is getting really hard againTwo months ago my life changed. Iâ€™m a 22 year old guy who apparently developed a medical issue, and will likely have permanent ED. Iâ€™m pushing my friends away, pushing my family away, and worst Iâ€™m pushing my very supportive GF away. I really canâ€™t help but feel the best decision for me is death. I understand that everyone has problems but this just feels like itâ€™s too much. This is not the life I want to live. I was doing slightly better for a while. Nothing I would want to live with long term, but at least I wasnâ€™t suicidal. I hate thinking this because I know others deal with worse, but this just isnâ€™t fucking fair.
