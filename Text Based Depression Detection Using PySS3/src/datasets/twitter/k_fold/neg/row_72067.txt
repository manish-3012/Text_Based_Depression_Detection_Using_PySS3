Before I kill myself..I've decided to kill myself... But first, I have to complete my list. I'm calling it my Either/Or List, this is not a bucket list, this is a checklist of things I need to do to help out the people I leave behind. 

My theory: Either I will complete my list and by that time I'll be happy/content and continue living. Or I'll still be just as miserable and depressed and take my life. It gives me piece of mind to know that my suicide won't be impulsive. And it gives me time to think everything through. 

Now every time I think about killing myself, I think 'Not yet. Not until my list is done'. And I find something to check off of my list

My list contains things like:

Gathering paperwork: Marriage license, mortgage and credit card info, birth certificate, SS card, passport. 

Collecting digital information: Passwords for all of my online accounts. 

Cleaning: Deep cleaning everything, every room, every piece of clothing, every bit of dust and clutter, purge all notebooks containing dark thoughts. 

I know I still need to create a will and write notes to those I love.

Does anyone else have a list like this? Am I forgetting anything?
