Have to catch COVID to end my miseryI've posted before but I believe I caught and spread HIV through a toothbrush. It is my worst fucking nightmare and I've been living it out for 4 months. I can't seem to find thd courage to kill my self but I believe catching the coronavirus would do it for me. Is it ethical if I Ttempt to catch it then self isolate and accept what it brings me?
