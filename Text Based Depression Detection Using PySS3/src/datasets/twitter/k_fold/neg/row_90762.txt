Is anyone available to chat?I feel bad because I just wrote a post here one hour ago - I don't want to monopolize the page. Someone very nice on here chatted with me for a little while. After I tried to talk with a proper suicide chatline. When I connected I asked if they were paid or volunteer and they wouldn't disclose. They said they couldn't give out private information. I felt frustrated because I felt like this is a fairly straightforward question to ask of a professional service. I just want to be able to chat with someone who treats me like a human being. 

When I was young I had a very dysfunctional relationship with my father and other things went on with other people. In my late teens I ended up going into hospital for two years. I had ECT many times and have memory problems (although it says in science there are no issues from ECT) Since then, I've done a lot of good things in my life but I have never been able to have a relationship. I am 44 yo and am realising I will never have children of my own. No one has ever loved me or been attracted to me and I feel worthless. I feel unlovable. At work, I feel constant anxiety, like I have done something terrible and I am going to get in trouble for being bad. Friendships also cause me anxiety. I am tired of feeling worthless and bad all the time. I also wish I was over my childhood by now and am tired of carrying it through life.

Anyway, if you have the time I would be very grateful. Thank you.
