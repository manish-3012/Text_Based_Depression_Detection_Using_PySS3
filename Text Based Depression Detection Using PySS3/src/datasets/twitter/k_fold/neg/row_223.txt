Sick of everythingI'm suppose to go visit my friend this weekend who lives two hours away - and I keep thinking of the drove home about just ending it by aiming for a tree and hitting the gas. I can't stand everything right now. I just really want a reset button but I can't so I have to deal with it but I've been dealing with it for years and I can't take it anymore. It's one thing after another and it piles up.
