I think I'm ready.Im older than most people who post here, but I think I might be done. My job is a dead end, I live in a shit apartment, have barely any family, no friends, no girlfriend. I'm 40. Have mental illness. I gave it a shot, but between that and everything else happening I don't owe anyone a goddamn thing. I just want to check out.

I don't remember what hope feels like.
