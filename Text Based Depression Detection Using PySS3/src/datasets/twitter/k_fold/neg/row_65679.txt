Why can't I take the hint.Life is just pain. When you think something is going well it gets ripped away from you. In life it's nearly impossible to actually accomplish anything worthwhile. I guess my family cares about me but I almost wish they didn't so I could die without worrying about how it would affect others. Online university is insanely difficult to "prevent cheating" and I'm failing classes which has never happened to me before. I'm so socially isolated now because of corona and I lost the only friend I talk to on a regular basis yesterday. Plus I can't get an internship this fall that I was relying on not to go broke. I watched this documentary on the science of consciousness yesterday and the guy was saying that being dead is probably like when you get put under for general anesthesia, I've been put under general anesthetic twice. And hope death is just like that. I'm longing for that nothingness. If I fail my classes I'll probably just get it over with and end my life. Besides I doubt I'll ever really be happy anyways.
