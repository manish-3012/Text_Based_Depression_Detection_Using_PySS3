I still don't feel betterThis is a throwaway from a long, long time ago. If you check into my post history, here's a quick update: I kept the pregnancy and now have a 5 month old.

Ever since she was born I've been suicidal. Every day since the day she was born. I've been hospitalized twice, I'm on medication, I see a psychologist every other week and a psychiatrist every month.

I get out of the house often enough. Go on dates, have sex, go to work, make positive changes towards myself, but I'm still stuck in this rut of "I want to die, I want to cut myself, I want to disappear, I want to die" just over and over again.

I don't know what I'm doing anymore. I gave it a really good effort to get better but 5 months later, here I am. 

I'm so tired. I don't want to keep going. I want the pain to stop. I want the everything to just stop.

I haven't felt happy in 6 or 7 months now. That's such a long time to be sad.
