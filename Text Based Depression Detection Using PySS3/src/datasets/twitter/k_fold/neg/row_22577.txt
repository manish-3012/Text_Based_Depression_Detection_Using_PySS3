Not to day...Me...28F

Refugee on a raptured small motorboat leaking water and my dad seeing death in his eyes

I was severe violated from 6-15 year old by my dad, mom also, but my dad 99% of it

I was bullied from age 10-14 and my self esteem and self image totally broken 

I developed anorexia since 15 year old and still struggling with it to this day

I went trough an abortion since I didnâ€™t want to bring a child to life when I was so deep down in depression and anxiety (both diagnosed from a psychiatrist)

Iâ€™m a huge self sabotaging person - I donâ€™t got any hope Iâ€™ll ever make my dreams come true 

I have broken up perfectly fine relationships (2 in my life) because I genuinely felt they could find better than the broken pieces I was then. I regret it everyday 

My dad telling my brother a ton shit about me so my brother calls the child service and the police to get rid of me. It stil to this day traumatized me (over 10 years ago)

 Being forced into mental asylum even the doctor told my parents Iâ€™ll get worse if Iâ€™ll stay there as the place is for mentally abusive and unstable persons. The place really broke/damaged me so bad that even itâ€™s over 10 years ago, I still have nightmares about it and I canâ€™t have body contact with anyone for over 7 years, I donâ€™t even touch myself without having to use antibacterial rubbed in each time I have to itch myself, I shower in completely dark bathroom and I never touch myself or even look in the mirror. They were 4 men lifting me up
and holding me down forcefully so the nurse could force freed me the calorie-energy drink down my mouth trough a tube. The second they sat me up I throw it all up as a shock-response my body got and they did it all over again but I had to drink it in a cup so I didnâ€™t throw it.



Shit...this isnâ€™t even the worst part of my life and I just wanted to show you what Iâ€™ve been through 

Iâ€™m suicidal most of the time...I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s keeping me alive ...I havenâ€™t showered since November 2019...I feel dead in a lifeless body
