I just wanna turn offSince I was very young I've been extremely anxious. My first memories are of traumatic events from my childhood and even thinking about those things makes my stomach turn. Since I turned 13 I started having panic attacks, the worst ones are in my sleep when I wake up covered in sweat and crying a bit. I've felt like things were turning around for me a few times but they really aren't. I feel so stupid or less than everyone else. I hate myself, I hate these thoughts I always have.. I don't think anything is ever going to get better. I really wish I could just kill myself but I feel so guilty about what that would do to my loved ones. That guilt is the only thing keeping me alive.
I've been sick for the last 3 years with a skin condition and arthritis and before I just thought I'd feel better if that was gone but really now that I'm finally starting to feel better physically, I still just feel beat and tired mentally I feel like I've lived enough of life and I just want it to end. I'm so numb to everything that I can't even celebrate or be sad I'm just a idk I should just stfu.
