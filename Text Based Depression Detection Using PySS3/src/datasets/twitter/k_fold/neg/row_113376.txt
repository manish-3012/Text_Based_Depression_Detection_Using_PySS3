I've had people on here say that they would understand if I killed myself. Things just keep getting worse.Fibromyalgia, IBS, PTSD, daily migraines, no friends, the only family I have is abusive. I literally have nothing in life except for pain and suffering. No one gives a shit about me and I just want to end this pain. I spent last night nursing a second degree burn on my hand. I spent the night before that in the ER for an inflamed gallbladder. Just now I asked my mom to make me something to eat since I literally cannot use my right hand. She screamed at me for acting like a 5 year old and said she is sick of my abuse towards her. This is my life every single day. I don't think anyone is strong enough to survive a situation like this. I've been seeing a therapist for years but it doesn't help because my suicidal thoughts are not some chemical imbalance. It's a result of this horrible situation that I can't fix.
