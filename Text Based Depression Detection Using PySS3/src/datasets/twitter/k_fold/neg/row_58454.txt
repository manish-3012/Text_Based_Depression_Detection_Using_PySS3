.Hey fellow redditors, I donâ€™t know what to call you Iâ€™m very new to this app but I just wanted to rant a little. I just donâ€™t feel like I should be living anymore, I know I sound like a kid but I donâ€™t know, my depression isnâ€™t really as serious as I think as others but I just donâ€™t really feel happy when doing anything anymore. I know I have a couple close friends who may be sad if I really did leave but I donâ€™t really care anymore. The only joy I found in life was hanging out with them but I donâ€™t even feel that sense of happiness anymore. Iâ€™ve searched up many ways on how to cope with depression but it just leads me to become extremely moody and I found that it distanced myself from my family. As a person who was known as loud and I guess you could say funny if you asked my friends, I canâ€™t really show how I feel or theyâ€™ll take it as a joke. I just wanted to know how you guys cope with sadness and yeah thanks for listening.
