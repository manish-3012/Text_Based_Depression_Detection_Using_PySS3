Iâ€™ve been a follower for awhile but canâ€™t help anyone if I canâ€™t help myselfI always want to post positive comments to peopleâ€™s struggles because it makes me feel better sometimes but Iâ€™m too ashamed how do I give out so much advice when Iâ€™m in the worst place Iâ€™ve ever been, 
Iâ€™ve been posting and deleting Iâ€™ve been so manic and depressed about whatâ€™s going on in my life Iâ€™ve finally made the decision to admit myself after this drinking and drug abuse binge 
My mental health has completely diminished. Iâ€™ve slept mere hours in a week now and already suffer from paranoia and am the pint Iâ€™ve been enjoying watching the floors and walls move and taking to myself , all Iâ€™ve been doing is laughing and crying for days  now and honestly nobody knows and the last people who truly cared I abandoned myself and cut off.wish me luck I have a friend taking me tonight when itâ€™s late I donâ€™t want my other roommates and friends to worry or even see me right now. Love you all just a few more hours, itâ€™s been months of stress but itâ€™s finally gonna be ok the people at the hospital make me feel at home I trust them to help me Iâ€™m ready for this!
