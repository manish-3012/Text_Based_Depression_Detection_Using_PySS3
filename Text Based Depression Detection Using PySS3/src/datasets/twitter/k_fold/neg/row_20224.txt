Flat. Empty. Pointless.I'm 29. I've got no education. No job any more. No accomplishments. Nothing. 

I've been "away" from life these last 10 years. It's like I'm not connected to myself any more and I find it very hard to be present. I talk to people and realise it's been months or even a year and to me it's like yesterday, still days are long as hell. I feel mentally behind, like I've turned into one of those that you talk to and everyone is making faces and reacting to their behaviour behind their backs and they have no idea. I can barely remember most of my life. 

I don't want anything. Nothing gives me joy or excitement. I've been offered trips abroad, days out, items. I've lost money, chances and things just because of inaction and I don't even give a shit. Not even the thought of a nice bath or nice meal or things usually mentioned by others give me even a spark. I have zero friends since I can't be present and most of the time I can't handle to interact with people any way. Sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to about just random things or play games with but I tend to drop people because I'm an idiot that can't keep up any more. 

I don't even know how to describe the feeling of being so *flat* 24/7 365. Often my mood dips and I'm closer to killing myself than I have ever been. It's not even when I'm tired or stressed any more, just randomly at any time. I have a strong need for control when it comes to how and where I die, but recently I've thought of just jumping in front of a truck driving past my house or stabbing myself on a whim. It scares me a bit. 

It's like my chest is holding in this insane sadness. The only thing I feel that is not sadness or nothing is a kind of longing for wanting to want something again. I can remember what it felt like. 

Yea so that's it.
