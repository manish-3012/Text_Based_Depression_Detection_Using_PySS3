i feel guilty that i want to dieI tried to kill myself about 2 months ago, went into the hospital, and when i came out my parents thought that i was healed/ better from suicidal ideations and i feel so bad that i still think about killing myself. They say "oh you're doing a lot better!" but honestly i feel almost the same as i did when i tried to take my life but just a little more stable. i feel so bad about what i put them through but i'm honestly just so done with life.
