I am not sure anymoreI have no idea where to start as I've never really posted about stuff like this and I don't think it'll help, and I am not really looking for help either so. I've been just in general sad for the past year and a half, and it's starting to bother me. Back in elementary kids always used to bug me and just be assholes because I am legally blind in my right eye, and it was lazy, but that didn't bother me much. By sixth grade I've heard it all, even just basic comments like "Look at me when you're talking to me" and stuff like that. I got an eye surgery and that was that. My dad would drink often enough where he would make comments about it and stuff and it tore me apart. After the surgery it didn't look lazy anymore but I always check for it whenever I wake up just to see how it is. Then following that we had this big family incident where me, my sister, and my mom, did not speak to my dad for the span of a year. I've never been close to my dad but I just felt alone during this time and I still do. At school I got even more shit for another reason that will take to long to type, but I was lost and alone. I've got friends that I speak to but they all keep saying I should get help, and asking what is wrong with me, even though I don't know and it just makes me feel worse and worse every day. I also can't get into the career I like so I have that going for me. I feel like I would've just been over with it years ago if I didn't promise myself I would be a better dad than my dad is to me one day, but days like this I feel like I am going to break that promise.
