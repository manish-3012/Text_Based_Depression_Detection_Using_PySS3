Idk how much longer I can keep living aloneNothing has changed for me as a result of the quarantine.  I don't have anyone to see or anywhere to go anyway.  I work a part time job I hate and suck at.  was supposed to graduate college, but that's not happening for a while now, and to be honest I don't really care.  Never had a girlfriend, not a real relationship at least.  Still a virgin at 21.  Don't ask girls out much, but I recently started to.  Both were taken, as it seems everyone is. Everyone's got somebody, but not me. The past week I reconnected with an internet friend of mine who I used to be close with.  We've been talking all day and sexting at night.  Out of nowhere she said she wants to stop the sexual stuff because she's afraid she'll become addicted to it and it's unhealthy when it's with someone you'll never meet.  I get it and honestly agree.  She's very serious about relationships and all that.  I'm not upset about that.  Our conversations just don't seem as fun or frequent anymore and that's what's  upsetting me just a day later.  It's like we're forcing the affection to not be there because we know it'll never matter.  It's stupid to get upset over someone I don't even know.  But it's so rare for me to connect with anyone.  She came along and it just feels nice to have someone to talk to.   I'm tired of being lonely every fucking minute of my life.  I haven't felt physical and mutual affection in close to five years now.. unless you count sexting with someone across the damn world.  It hasn't gotten easier and I don't think it ever will.  I had every opportunity to make friends and find a girlfriend in college.  I failed at that.  How am I gonna find anyone when the easiest days are behind me?  The loneliness is fucking tearing me apart.
