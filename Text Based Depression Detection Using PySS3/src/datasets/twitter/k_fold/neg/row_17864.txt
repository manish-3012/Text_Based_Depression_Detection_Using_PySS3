Not sustainableI have to find an escape from this loneliness. I cannot continue to fight for a world that overlooks me like Iâ€™m a ghost they canâ€™t see. Canâ€™t motivate myself to try for anything because nothing feels like it helps or compares to the pains of the traumas I and many others I have cared about have endured. This depression is a black hole, sucking the light from everything, taking away my ability to feel much anything but despair, hopelessness, loneliness, disappointment. My Libra scales are on the table and the ugly of the world weighs so much heavier than the beauty, and what beauty I can acknowledge, I cannot feel it well. My heart and mind is constantly calling my attention to the ugly, the bad, because I know THOSE people need saved, need help, just like me; a reason to continue on. You tell me I should focus on being happy a puppy was born somewhere in the world rather than upset that a 2 year old was stabbed for being chinese American, and yk, Asian=virus? Why? For myself? What about all the people in pain that you step over because youâ€™re too busy focusing in on you and how youâ€™re feeling, yet when youâ€™re the ones knocked to the ground, you hold out your hand asking for help and compassion? Iâ€™m tired of so many people not caring for one another. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m lonely. There are people around me. I am not alone, but Iâ€™ve never been more lonely than when I wake up to this reality.
