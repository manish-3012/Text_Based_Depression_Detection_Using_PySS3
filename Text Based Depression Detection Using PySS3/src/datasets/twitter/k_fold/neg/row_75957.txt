I feel like everything's falling down...My great-aunt got her hip replacement surgery, but it will take at least three weeks for her to walk again (and she will probably need more surgeries to replace her other prosthetic hip and her knees). One of my grandma's varicose veins in her ankle ended up bleeding, and she needs to rest to fix it. Both my grandpa and mom ended up having indigestion... And I know I gotta hold on to support them, though I wish life could be a bit easier on us...

I don't have a job, nor the experience to get one, and I've made them spend tons of money for therapy, and I've barely improved after years of going to psychologists and psychiatrists... 

Also... I still can't accept that I probably have schizotypical traits and schizoaffective depression, on top of paranoid personality disorder. Grades aren't everything, and if I'm still depressed I won't be able to work to provide for my family, since it goes against the ethic code of psychology...

It's like I have to get better yes or yes, otherwise I won't be able to support them as much as I should do... I'm afraid of the future, I'm afraid of what will be of us, I don't know what to do...
