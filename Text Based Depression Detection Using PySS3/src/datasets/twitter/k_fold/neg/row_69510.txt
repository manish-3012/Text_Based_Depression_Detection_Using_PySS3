iâ€™m 20f and im losing all of my hair. i have intense ocd and social anxiety and i feel like thereâ€™s nothing for me in this life anymoreiâ€™m losing all of my hair genetically. I already have body dysmorphic disorder and intense obsessive compulsive disorder which makes it so much worse. my life hasnâ€™t felt like my own for years now. iâ€™m ashamed to leave the house and i donâ€™t have any friends whatsoever, i canâ€™t even carry on a basic conversation most days. i feel like i donâ€™t deserve to be alive due to my obsessions. I think i am a genuinely bad, vain, person and nothing brings me joy anymore, i donâ€™t know why iâ€™ve stuck around so long because i only ever feel like a burden to everyone around me. everyone has a life and hobbies and interests. iâ€™m 20 and iâ€™m balding and i truly have nothing that makes me want to be alive anymore
