Iâ€™m just destined to be a terrible person.Well Reddit, itâ€™s been awhile since Iâ€™ve been suicidal. But here we are... yeah... I remember what this feels like. 

Hereâ€™s the deal. I am a senior in high school and am addicted to cannabis. For the past few months I have been stealing weed from my parents. I am a fucking idiot and obviously they found out, and I denied it. 

My parents started wondering what was going on and blamed my friends. I stayed silent on the issue, yet I kept stealing.

Today my parents sat me down to tell me that my shitty, manipulative, toxic, lie-filled jig is up. They were almost on the verge of tears as I admitted to stealing and lying and being a worthless piece of shit. Seeing my mom cry as she told me she felt like she couldnâ€™t trust me completely tore me apart. 

I have long worried that Iâ€™m a fucking psychopath or narcissist or abuser pretending like I donâ€™t just leech off of others for my benefit. But I do. I cheat and lie and steal and donâ€™t know how to stop. I am part of a select few of people who just donâ€™t deserve to exist because they canâ€™t function properly in normal society without hurting everyone around them. 

I have never wanted to self harm, but I have an urge to cut. I already hit my legs and arms until they bruised. 

I have an almost full prescription of Effexor that I could take. It might stop anyone else from getting hurt.
