Can anyone recommend shows or games to cope?I have had another bad night. I am crying as I am typing this, and I have been in a bad place, but I AM NOT going to kill myself tonight. But it still hurts. I feel like there is a monster made of tar in my chest and if I hurt myself I can get rid of it. I don't want to hurt myself.

Under the resources there is one that suggests watching videos that are relaxing or pleasant.

Can anyone recommend something on Netflix or Youtube or some online games that could be good to distract me from my thoughts? Right now I'm playing [Winterbells](http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm), I discovered it a few years ago and it has been wonderful as a coping mechanism.
