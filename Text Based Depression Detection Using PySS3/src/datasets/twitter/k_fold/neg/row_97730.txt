I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a place for me.I try to help people on here while knowing I also want to die. Iâ€™m helpless in stopping these people and I just want hug all of you and tell you itâ€™s gonna be okay. But for me? No. Iâ€™m socially inept. I canâ€™t get a job because of my anxiety and Iâ€™m bad at what ever I do. I hate my face. But thereâ€™s no way out. I canâ€™t OD on the pills I have and thereâ€™s no where for me to hang myself. I could get carbon monoxide poisoning with my car in my garage. But then that would traumatize my whole family. And destroy my friends. Maybe Iâ€™m just tired. Might delete this in the morning when I unfortunately wake up.
