i want deathi need it actually. iâ€™m just a piece of trash and itâ€™s pretty obvious.

i always manage to hurt my girlfriend who means the most to me. who is someone i want to spend the rest of my life with. someone so amazing, yet i always tend to hurt her. sheâ€™s so patient but i donâ€™t understand why i keep doing it.

i have no real skills and i donâ€™t understand anything that iâ€™m learning to get my degree in, yet iâ€™m a couple semesters always from getting it, and i want to stick with it, but i know for certain there will be no way i can understand the rest of my courses and iâ€™ll just be stuck in a bottomless pit.

i hate my job but the pay is decent enough for me to not want to leave, even though it always get me to a point where either a manager or customer tells me to stop with my attitude.

iâ€™m at the point of life where iâ€™m supposed to be finding myself but i know thereâ€™s nothing to find. i feel like iâ€™m on the last straw with my girlfriend, and if she does break up with me, iâ€™m gonna end my pathetic life.
