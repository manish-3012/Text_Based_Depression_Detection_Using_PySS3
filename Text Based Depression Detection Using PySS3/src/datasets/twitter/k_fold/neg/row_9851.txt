Strung in hell. I will oDFirst of all I'm scared, but only in aan abstract sense. This is because I am choosing to fuck my life up. I don't know why I'm wasting my life, maybe the nonchalance and apathy while walkihg to the slaughterhiuse is my indication of how much I am disconnected from my life.
The means with I am destroying myseld is fenfanyl. A very strong opioid. I am bining on it. I'm not a drug addict, but I am a slave to my pain that I don't even know the source of anymore. I just don't want to feel myself living. I despatately want to numb every last vital cell in my organism.
I am a massively self-indulgent piece of shit. I used to pretend that my parents didn't care but I was just lying fo myself as usual. I devastate my parents because they love me so much. And here I am wasting under their rooftop, breaking my veins in the process.
It's kind of a catch-22: being a fiend makes me a terrible person, which makes me fiend for more and stronger narcotics to forget that I'm a subhuman creature.
I really feel nonchalant about suicide in terms of how badly I want to die, but I look at being dead as a positive good for my family and I. I doubt I have willpower to turn my life around in order to becomd a successful person I can live with being. Also if I am going to remain a pathetic excuse for a human beinh, at least I have the chemical means to go out blissfully.
I made this to guage how much I disgust people.
I am more than a little tempted to hit the reset button on life. With this last binge of debauchery, I have more or less embraced the fact that I failed at the life game, and looking forward to permanently leaving this hell I have made for myself and the few family members I still have contact with.
Also, I'm sorry mods thst I use this place for my self-indulgent shotposts.
