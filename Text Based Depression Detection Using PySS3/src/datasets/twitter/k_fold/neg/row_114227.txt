Iâ€™m just tiredIâ€™m so mentally tired. Iâ€™ve been depressed as long as I can remember. I live with my alcoholic parents who neglected me and fucked me up. Iâ€™m almost 26. Iâ€™m a fucking loser. Iâ€™m a college graduate living in my parentsâ€™ basement. I apply to job after job after job and no one calls. My debt just keeps building. I canâ€™t even begin to fix my mental health while Iâ€™m still living where I was initially broken. Iâ€™m just tired. Iâ€™m tired of venting to my friends, Iâ€™m tired of applying to jobs and going to interviews just to hear nothing back. Iâ€™m on antidepressants but I think they actually make me feel worse. Iâ€™m fat and disgusting and Iâ€™m always broke. Literally not one thing in my life to be happy about besides my friends and my pets and they all deserve better than me. I wish I would just go to sleep and never wake up.
