The Time Has Come To Say Goodbye....Goodbye to the struggle against depression, feelings of inadequacy, the constant uphill battle to be morally just, the relentless pursuit of trying to build a better, more stable and lucrative life. Facts are facts. At this point in my life I will probably never find a wife or have the chance to raise a child, to watch him or her grow up, to pass on the wisdom that comes from living the hard life, all the while providing a better life for them than you ever had. I have been proactively working towards these goals, just trying to get myself to a point that I actually liked who I am, and although almost there, still I can't get a date, much less a girlfriend. I have recently been trying to help a sibling, well 2 of them, but the main one is a junkie and a thief and never ever fails to make me regret ever lifting a finger for him, and he has no idea that I am barely hanging on myself, and honestly, he is so selfish and all about himself and his struggle and what he can get from others that it would be pointless to even explain to him. Well, fucker is gonna truly be on his own here shortly, only wish him the best.
  I have been planning this for years now, I had a loaded gun to my head at 17, actually put the barrel in my mouth at 19, by 25 I was determined to go out like James Dean by living fast and dying young, but somehow made it through.Then I decided to try something different, and actually live the straight and narrow, be the change I wanted to see, and began working towards it vigorously. I have made great strides, but all the while I have always truly felt that it was all futile, and that things would go south. Now with these latest cutbacks at work, this is the second month in a row, that I have been short on rent, and the bills are piling up. Everything I have been working towards, this tightrope I've been walking, is all starting to unravel, from multiple angles. Bills, junkie thieving brother, paycuts, loss of work, not having a girlfriend, or even any close friendships. I thought I was prepared to deal with these things, but all at once? I'm up to my next in quicksand, but ain't got no one to throw me a rope!
   So little by little I've been planning for this time to come about, all the while hoping that it wouldn't, but lo and behold.....it's here!
So next week I'll get on a plane, or just hop on my bike and ride back to where I'm from, and ashes to ashes, from dust I was formed, and to that same dust I shall return, on my own terms. At least I can control that. It'll many months, maybe even a year before I'm missed, that's how alone I am. And let's face it, does the world need another single, middle aged man in his forties? Not around here that's for sure! Not anywhere really. And don't think I haven't been putting up a fight, I have been looking another job for over 2 years now, and nothing. Roadblock after roadblock. That's it! Throwing in the towel! GAME OVER!
