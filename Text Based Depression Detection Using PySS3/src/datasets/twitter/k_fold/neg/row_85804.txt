I just don't know how to feel anymoreI hated my whole life ever since I started becoming conscious. My life has been up and down, parents always arguing, always getting bullied, even now in High-School.. people are using me and then they mock me. My girlfriend and mom are probably the only persons I really care about.. I'm not suicidal but I need help, I literally can't take it anymore, I don't understand why people are like this, I used to be their friend and now they do this to me. I'm their laughing dose of the day, they know that if they mock me I get angry and they just laugh at me like I'm lifeless..
