I hate that feeling when you know everyone is sick of your shit.You need them more than ever to be there and they're rolling your eyes at you, wondering when you'll grow the fuck up.

I already attempted a couple weeks ago, my parents told me they were done with me, sink or swim, they were exhausted. I don't blame them.

I keep trying to think of ways to get people to stop giving a shit about me so I can go in peace.

I love my fiance more than life itself but he deserves so much better than me. I have several chronic illnesses and in a couple decades my organs are going to rot anyhow.

I wish there was a merciful way to leave your loved ones behind, and have them understand that this is a move of pure desperation, not spite.

But I'm also not sure I can forgive them for glazing over the seriousness of this, not because they haven't noticed but because they can't honestly be bothered.

It could be decided in minutes. I just can't stop thinking about it.
