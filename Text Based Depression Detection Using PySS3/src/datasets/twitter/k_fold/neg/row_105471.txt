GoodbyeGoodbye. I have nothing. She doesnâ€™t like, she isnâ€™t even reading my messages. I legitimately have nothing. She meant so much to me. But know she hates me. Goodbye. Fuck this mortal coil. There is nothing. I just wanted her to just... love me. I want her to just fucking respond, she means everything to me. Sheâ€™s perfect in every way, and she hates me. I canâ€™t do this.
