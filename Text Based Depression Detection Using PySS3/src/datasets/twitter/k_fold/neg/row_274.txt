Hope is an illusion for people like meThere's no hope for me. I've never had a real relationship with anyone. I've been scrapping by playing non-stop video games and working whatever dead end job I can find but now I'm 25 broke (soon to be homeless), ugly, alone, and no chance of anything getting better. I've tried anti-depressants and they don't work for me, therapy doesn't work for me, hell going to the gym doesn't work for me.

To anyone out there who actually cares enough about me to understand my chronic misery. Please support assisted suicide because I wish I can die peacefully versus spattering my brains against the walls.
