I really wanted to meet Stan LeeI really wanted to meet Stan Lee.  I've been a fan of him ever since I could read, he's created some of my favourite characters and stories and was honestly one of the only reason I hadn't killed myself by age 13.  It's had forever been on my list to meet Stan.  

I wanted to sit with him for hours at a restaurant and talk about Spiderman.

I wanted to watch movies with him and chat about the premise.

I wanted to read comics with him and laugh together.

I guess that isn't going to happen now. 

I guess I'll probably meet him soon enough if I keep going downhill on this current trend.
