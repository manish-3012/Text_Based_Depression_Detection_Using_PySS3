I had the chance to end it two weeks ago. I didn't. And I regret it.Two weeks ago, I had a chance to end my life. I had a rifle pointed at my skull and had my finger on the trigger. I took one more look at my phone and the barrage of messages and voicemails everyone left trying to find me and stop me. I stopped, drove home, got detained and got put on a 72hr hold. 

The last two weeks have been a complete turn around: I've been getting better physically (both strength and diet), I've been opening up to people more and more about my problems and what I'm feeling in that moment, I've been doing my best to keep moving forward with the wonderful support system I have, as well as starting a new job. 

Tonight is the first time I regret not pulling the trigger. So many people have told me that I'm a good person. I don't feel like one. I don't feel like I've done anything to garner those praises. I don't feel like I've done anything to deserve the things I have in life. 

I don't want to live life without her. She's moving on; the writing is on the wall and she's doing everything that she wants and she's happy. And I'm not. I can't and won't live life without her. I know what I need to do, and I know the steps I need to take in order to better myself mentally so that these thoughts don't come back. But right now, I regret not blowing my brains out in that garage.

I'm sorry for this long winded post; as much as I have done a better job of sharing with my friends and family, I still don't feel comfortable waking them up and bothering them when they have their own shit to do. Right now, I just prefer sharing it with you guys so that I can get it out of me.
