My thinking that keeps leading me here.I am this way and cannot change. Or that change is needed to such a degree that it will take so much time and effort that I am very unlikely to succeed.

Nu not succeeded I end up in this place of not being wanted nor understood.

Everything I seemingly want is out of reach or I am unworthy. (Think women but but includes friends, jobs, etc)

Others people reaction to me over time says something about me and it isn't good.  Both physical looks and personality.

When I see myself in photos I automatically feel I shouldn't exist or don't belong based usual how I feel about my. Appearance. 

Meaning is seemingly more and more, less important where as fakeness, superficial or appearances are all that matter.

There's more but I his is usually more than sufficient enough to reach "emotional death" a few times over.
