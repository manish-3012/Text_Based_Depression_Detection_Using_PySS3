I'm planning on killing myself but I don't know how to say goodbye to my friendI canâ€™t do it without saying goodbye but he knows I have been thinking about it for a while now and made me to promise I would never do it. But I have to because I just can't take it anymore. Is there any way I could say goodbye without him realizing I'm saying goodbye because I know he'll talk me out of it?
