If I get rejected from nursing school Iâ€™m ending itI have a 2.6 GPA and the average GPA that gets accepted at the nursing school is 3.6-3.8. It is my second year at community college and I am supposed to graduate next year. 

I have wasted my time at college. I have put the bare minimum into my classes last semester earning a 1.97 semester GPA and I have made absolutely no friends. If I donâ€™t kill myself Iâ€™ll live to being a virgin at 30 years old, unemployed living with my parents, and completely miserable. Love in this day and age doesnâ€™t exist. Every good looking person can just download a dating app and hook up with whoever they want. Meanwhile, I would be ridiculed and made fun of for having no experience in my 20s. Itâ€™s over before it even began. 

Killing myself is my only long term goal. Other people who are more qualified deserve to be nurses. I deserve nothing but death. I am a useless waste of space and I always will be.
