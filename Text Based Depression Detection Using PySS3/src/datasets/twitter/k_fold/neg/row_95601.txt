The Guilt is too much to handle anymore.Its a long complicated story but My suicidal friend thought i was coming to his house and help him but i lied.  I also said earlier that day "if truly want to kill yourself i wont stop you". 

 he killed himself 7 hours later. 

For almost 6 months, (actually 10 years or so) i have wanted to kill myself.  

I cant get a job (even at mcdonalds).  I am extremely lazy (i dont try my hardest at finding a job but 15 years old fucking get one and they dont even care about it)

I havent even graduated high school (im 23 years old) still living with the parents.   

Im just a burden to everyone.   If i kill myself my mother might hurt herself.  I know ill be dead but i dont want that.    

I basically killed 3 of my best friend through out my life.   I shouldnt be allowed to live past another second.  But maybe living this life is my punishment. 

I dont know what to do.   I know i need to just move or do something but being a lazy, depressed, and inexperienced man-child doesnt help me.    

Death is the only road i see right now.  But im too scared.  I cant swallow pills. I dont have a gun.  I am afraid of heights.     Its like the universe just wants me to stay here and suffer.   

Im sorry for this long post.   Im scared and need advice on how to get my life started or... finished.
