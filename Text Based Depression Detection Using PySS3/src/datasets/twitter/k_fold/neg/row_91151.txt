I want/need to reach out to my boyfriend, but I don't know what to say.I need to tell him how crazy I'm getting. I have never been this close to feeling like I'm actually going to pull the plug and its scaring me. God do I want the constant misery all to end but I don't want to hurt my siblings like that. I've started "getting my house in order". Even have a will already. I am seriously barely making it through everyday. I can't describe this feeling. I want to be dead and I can't stop heading in that direction but I know I need to do something to stop it otherwise I will be gone and that will cause such pain for my siblings.  

The issue is my bf hasn't really ever been there for me emotionally. That is on he and I both. I have CPTSD so it is excruciating for me to bring up my feelings, but when I do I get a shitty response. I've tried to talk to him but he either calls me a punk (in a "cute" way but it feel like he is shutting down the convo) or literally doesn't respond at all. Just sits there silently for a minute until trying to change the topic. I know he doesn't want me to die but beyond that it doesn't feel like he cares much because he doesn't make an effort to listen or see how I'm doing. I'm afraid to reach out and not get taken seriously or he just doesn't even say anything. I know if I get a poor response its going to push me further off the edge. This has happened in the past. I dont have anyone else I can reach out too. Internet strangers are fantastic but I need some tangible help. How can I bring this up to my boyfriend? I don't even know how to start the conversation. I'm lost.
