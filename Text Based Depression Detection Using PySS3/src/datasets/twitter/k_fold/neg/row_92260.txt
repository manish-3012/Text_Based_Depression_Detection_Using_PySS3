3rd time I've been dumped in a row.Hey there,

4 days ago I was dumped for the 3rd time in a row. 2 times their mom has said I'm not the right guy for their daughters. After a relationship of 3 and 2 years... 

I feel really bad hearing this stuff. I feel like a total loser. My studies didn't work out, my relationships don't work out. I have no close friends. 

I went to a doctor because I'm really depressed, he gave me pills, it helped for a day but when I think about all the bad stuff that has been said about me... Fuck man it's hard. 

Sometimes I just want to go drive with my car and crash against a tree... I'm just a failure in life. Thanks for reading. :(
