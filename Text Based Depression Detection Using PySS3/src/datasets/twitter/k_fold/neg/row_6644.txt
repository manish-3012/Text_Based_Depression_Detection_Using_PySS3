Just a cry for help (Update)TL;DR: I couldn't do it, talked with my counselor. Don't know what to do. Also tried to strangle myself (again) so I could pass out yesterday night.


I couldn't do it. I talked about it with my counselor at school (bc I talk with her once a week and she did this "how are you students" chit-chat this week).

I was actually hoping she would talk to me. Kinda pissed but I'm glad I couldn't go through with it. Still have the urge though.

I also forgot my parents are having a party today, so if they found out I would've ruined it for them.

Also I tried to make myself pass out yesterday but it didn't work. Tried to strangle myself enough so I can pass out, but don't die. Ended up with me coughing all over the place at midt night.

I have done this several times before and also failed. Damn it.
