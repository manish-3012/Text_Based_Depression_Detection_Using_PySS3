Update.

Well. I've tried several times and always failed. I can't live in this fucking house any more. Thursday and Friday were actually pretty fucking good, but now I think I was subconsciously trying to have a good last couple days. 

I really want to just sleep forever and never wake up. Being awake sucks, and nightmares suck. Honestly, I'm pretty afraid of that last moment before I pass out and don't wake up again. But I think it'll be better than all this shit. Thanks for reading. Maybe I'll make it to the morning, maybe not.
