If it werenâ€™t for my family, Iâ€™d probably be getting betterI have an abusive sister with an equally awful husband who both make me suicidal. If it werenâ€™t for them in my life, I might actually be able to get better. But every day they find a way to demean, diminish, and hurt me. 

Because of my mental illness, right now Iâ€™m unable to work and have to have a relationship with my sister because she controls an inheritance from my mother and provides for me financially. So Iâ€™m stuck having to be hurt by her all the time.

If she werenâ€™t in my life, Iâ€™d maybe be able to build up my esteem and better myself.
