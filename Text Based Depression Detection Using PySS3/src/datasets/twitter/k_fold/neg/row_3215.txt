I wish I had a gunIf I could just shoot myself I would probably be dead. Quick and I presume painless. But I don't have one, and the other methods scare me. The next fastest thing would be decapitation via train, but then I would be bring another person into this and giving them some horrid memories. Hanging scares me, the last thing I want is to be choked to death. Jumping scares me too, not sure what exactly about it frightens me, but I'm just afraid of heights and I feel like if I don't die on impact it would be an insanely painful death.  Pills don't work, not only do I not have strong/dangerous pills, it's a slow death and leaves a lot of room for me to freak out and call for help. I wish I had a gun.
