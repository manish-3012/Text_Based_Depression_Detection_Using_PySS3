I'm starting to want to do it.I think I have depresion. I've been having this feeling of hollowness since late january. There doesn't seem to be anything that caused it. Everything has gone to shit because of it. Yesterday I had a mental breakdown while telling my parents what was happening. They said that I was just making excuses for my worsening grades, and I had every thing I need in life. Earlier that day I found some razors, and i thought of using them, but i was too much of a coward. Today realizing that what was through my head was fucked up, i decided to set up an apointment with the school phsychologist. If it doesnt go well, i'll have to think about ways of suicide.
