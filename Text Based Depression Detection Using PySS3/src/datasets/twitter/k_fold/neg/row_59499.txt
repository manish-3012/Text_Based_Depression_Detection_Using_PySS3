It would feel so good to die. I look forward to that day. Knowing it will come gives me hopeI canâ€™t wait till the day I die, whether itâ€™s unexpectedly or from suicide. Iâ€™m a defect in this world, nobody needs or wants me. Thatâ€™s okay, as a defect, I donâ€™t expect them too. All I can do is wait for death
