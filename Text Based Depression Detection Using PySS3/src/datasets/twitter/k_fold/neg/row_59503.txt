iâ€™m not sad just want to dieiâ€™ve been depressed in the past and used to be medicated but i think iâ€™ve moved on from that. however, if it werenâ€™t for the thought of making my friends and family sad, i definitely would have killed myself by now. i donâ€™t think my life has any purpose, whatever i do or donâ€™t do doesnâ€™t matter because iâ€™m just going to die anyway. statistically speaking itâ€™s like 1/100,000,000 iâ€™ll make a difference in this world so why even bother with that. i donâ€™t get sad thinking about any of it but sometimes it does make being happy harder. why wait for death when i could induce and control it now? i guess all iâ€™m looking for in this post is maybe finding others who feel the same and how you deal with it? would be great to not want to kill myself haha ðŸ˜™âœŒï¸
