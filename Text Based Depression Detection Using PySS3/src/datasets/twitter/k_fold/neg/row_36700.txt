I hate being hereSince the age of 6 I've been suicidal. 

An abusive and unstable house environment with shitty parents combined with an equally shitty school environment due to bullying, it was at 6 years old I decided "Fuck This"

Jump to now. I'm 21. I've been homeless for 3 years. Recently moved back in with the father as I got nowhere else to go. Majority of my friends are no where to be seen. Mum and Dad are far from supportive like they've always been and I have no job/ no money or savings. My life is non-existent.

The fact that I've tried several times in the past to kill myself and I'm here hurts even more. I can't kill myself. I'm scared of the pain or messing it up. I'm a fucking failure and have the evidence to support that. Doctors so far have been just dismissive or condescending. Nothing helps neither the doctors or the pills.

Everyday is worse than the last. The pain is still there.

I just want to die. Maybe one day I'll get it right.
