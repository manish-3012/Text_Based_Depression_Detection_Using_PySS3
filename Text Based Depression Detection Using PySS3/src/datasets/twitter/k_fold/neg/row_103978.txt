Little sister jokes about suicideSo I have a little sister (lets call her Kayla) and shes 10 years old. Since its sunday we are having her little cousin (lets call her Lisa) come over for kayla's company. So they are playing together in kayla's room and all of a sudden I hear them making jokes about fucked up shit. Like saying you're ugly and I'm ugly, you're stupid and I'm stupid. Even joking about suicide and laughing about it. I was shocked and called Lisa's mother to come pick her up cause i am not ok with her behavior and also to talk to my sister kayla. But for every reason I give kayla that suicide is not ok to joke about, all she says is that its just a joke and says its ok to say it because its a joke.  I don't know what else to tell her to make her understand joking about messed up things like this is bad. I don't know how to make this 10 year old understand. Cause now she thinks im insulting her. Either i let it be and let her grow up and realize things or i dont know. But I am shocked by her mindset right now thats its ok to joke about things like suicide. Shes only 10. I hope this is just a stupid phase and when she grows up she will think better.
