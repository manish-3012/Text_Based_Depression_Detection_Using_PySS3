The only thing stopping me is how others will feelMe entire life is unselfish in a way. What matters most to me is how those I know and love feel. If I killed myself, I would be so happy but they would be devastated. How do I even go on knowing I have no option, either I be miserable or everyone i love be miserable? Life is pain
