I hate myself for why I want to dieI've been depressed for a long time, suicidal at times, but this time is just different. I want to be done so badly but I really hate why. I'm 16 and as of just about 2 months ago I got this girl. And I was convinced this girl was vastly out of my league and I had fallen for her months ago. When I got her I was so excited, because it was the first good thing that's happened to me in a long time. And here's why I hate myself so much right now. I'm 16. And this girl broke up with me after three weeks. She wasn't over her ex boyfriend and wasn't ready for another relationship. But after three weeks I had gotten attached. THREE  WEEKS. AS A 16 YEAR OLD. This is the dumbest reason ever for me to fall in this rut. It's not like this is a really long serious relationship or any of that. But she just I don't know broke me. I am really confused. And this time it's different. This time I can honestly say I understand that my suicide would hurt the people around me and I can honestly say I don't care. I won't have to deal with the guilt of hurting them. I won't have to deal with anything anymore. I honestly have no inhibitions about my suicide right now and I want help 

Edit: You guys have helped a lot and helped me finalize my decision. I just talked to my parents and I'm going to seek professional help. Thanks guys
