OCD is killing meevery single day i wake up I go to the WC i spent like one hour and every time i have to go to the Wc i spent another hour cleaning my hand repetitively until i feel so f-ing exhausted , that I feel like i'm losing my sanity , I've been doing this for like 2 years and i will probably won't be able to stop , now how i'm suppose to live with that ?I feel like suicide is the only relief or solution I have.

Because there is no cure for OCD and yeah I've tried therapy I got OCD when i was 8 now I'm 17 plus I got anxiety disorder and I'm living in one of the worst counties in the world , I'm a dropout cuz I always get late for school cuz of the compulsive behavior so now what ?any one who have dealt with ocd knows a tip or something idk i'm  helpless
