Why does it feel like Iâ€™m not myself anymore when Iâ€™m on antidepressants?Iâ€™m so lost. Itâ€™s like watching a movie about how happy I could be. It doesnâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m there. 

The constant mental and physical pain Iâ€™m being put through is becoming who I am. Itâ€™s my normal. I am the trauma and the trauma is me. 

Iâ€™m not the same slightly sarcastic humorous kid Iâ€™m used to being, I become a different more fake feeling version of myself where itâ€™s taken away the things that make me who I am.

Why canâ€™t I enjoy the sweet feeling of the medication? It was the one hope I had to escape my world of abuse. I canâ€™t last the three more years until I get away from my parents. 

15 may be too young to die but I want to save myself from the future.
