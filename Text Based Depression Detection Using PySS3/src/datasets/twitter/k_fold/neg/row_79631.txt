i donâ€™t have any reason to existhi iâ€™m new to reddit so sorry if i donâ€™t get it right, iâ€™m pretty new to how this all works. 

for the past 3 years i have been falling into these â€œslumpsâ€ that have been so bad that my mom kicked me out and i had to sleep on my brotherâ€™s couch for the rest of freshman year. and now i am living with my other brother and his wife and two kids. 

his wife recently gave birth to a baby and i really feel guilty for taking space in their house. my father also lives with us but often goes on trips with my mom and have rarely seen him for more than 2 weeks at most before heâ€™s off again. 

i had to move to a new school and i still canâ€™t seem to connect with anyone or become involved and overall i feel like a shit part of society. i canâ€™t talk to anyone in my family about how i feel because theyâ€™ll just brush it off and tell me to suck it up.

trying to figure out my future and having to decide where i am going to go or do scares me. i donâ€™t want to end up spending the rest of my life in debt and working a dead end job.

iâ€™m not involved in any type of sport and iâ€™m not very smart, i have nothing going for me. iâ€™m not doing anything for anyone, and i feel like iâ€™m a leech and a waste of space.  i know that i live a pretty privileged life and that my problems are so insignificant compared to other people.i could give my life to someone so they could have a better opportunity i would.


i am a weak person and i acknowledge that.
there is nothing for me to live for, no end goal or future. 

i donâ€™t know what iâ€™m doing with life and tonight i might kill myself, my dadâ€™s gun is loaded in front of me and its all up to me now. 

i kind of went on a tangent but i just wanted to get things out of my head and lay it bare to a bunch of people that i donâ€™t know and it feel very freeing to be honest and if anyone read this post thanks :)
