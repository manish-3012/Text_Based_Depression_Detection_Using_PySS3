I want to die because I don't want to work.Hi guys, 
I never worked in my life (26f), I did internships in college but not all day and I am severe depressed.
My life is without any joy and I don't find anything pleasure or fun, the lack of motivation and resilience is my main problems and I really don't want to keep leeching on my father, I am seriously considering suicide as a option.
