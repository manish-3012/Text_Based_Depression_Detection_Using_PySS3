Deserted by everyone, ready to give up on myself too.I'm 19, going to college right now. In high school, I struggled with depression, trying to keep it to myself. Last summer, I finally asked my friends for help, and they started to ignore me. My best friend of four years even told me he wouldn't care if I killed myself.

Fast forward to this year, I've failed 75% of my classes from last semester. Even the GSA I went to wanted me gone, because they thought my being quiet meant I was an asshole who hated them all.

Only a few of my high school friends still talk to me. Most of the friends I thought I made in college have stopped talking to me. the first guy I asked out led me on for five months, and ditched me when I told him I had struggled with depression. Since then, it's come back with a vengeance.

I honestly feel like I should just end it. It seems like there's nobody left to hurt by ending my life.

I've already written a goodbye letter to my friends. I can't bring myself to write one for my family. I'm going to leave it and my journal on my computer's desktop, for them to read. I have a plan. I have everything I need.
