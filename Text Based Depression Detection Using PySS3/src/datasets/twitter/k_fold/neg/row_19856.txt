I have almost no reasons to live at this point but the ones I still have are the most painful to let go offMy young life was extremely easy, I dont have a sob story, my younger days, aside from the usually bullying was perfect pretty much. I had a family that loved me and supported me, every thing I could want. Its the same to this day yet I know I am a failure. I dont feel like I have a reason to want to end my life yet I still feel that way.

The only reason I am not taking my own life is because I care about my family and have a girlfriend that loves me. I dont want to cause pain to any of them, i know what pain is like and these are wonderful people. I dont want them to feel it.

I am not going to kill myself I just want something to cling onto other than them. Anything.
