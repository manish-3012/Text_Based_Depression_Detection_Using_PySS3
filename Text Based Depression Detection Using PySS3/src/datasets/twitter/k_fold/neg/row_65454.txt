Feeling scared, what do I do?I just started a new antidepressant. I know it has the side effect of possibly making me feel suicidal. Iâ€™ve attempted before and am glad it didnâ€™t work. Logically I want to live and can come up with reasons why, but my brain keeps telling me to kill myself tonight. I know I just need to get over this medication hump (literally only been on it for a week) and Iâ€™ll hopefully be close to the other side, but right now Iâ€™m scared and want these thoughts to go away. 
(I do not have a current plan in place to harm myself or someone else and I would 100% call for help if I did)
