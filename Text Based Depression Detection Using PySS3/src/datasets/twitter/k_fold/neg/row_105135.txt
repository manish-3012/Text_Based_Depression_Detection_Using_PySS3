Tomorrow is not going to be betterFour-five years ago I was this close to jumping off the balcony of my apartment. I didn't know what stopped me. I ended up locking myself in my room for two days and pretty much avoided being close to windows in tall buildings. Sometime later things did get better but just for a short while. At that short moment I'd look back at my past self and silently thank her for staying around.

Since last year though things are spiraling out of control again. Each day I feel like I'm losing myself. The only thing stopping me is the idea that things could be better tomorrow - that one day I'll find happiness again and one day I'll look back at myself now and my future self would thank me for staying. But as each day passes by that probability seems to be getting less and less likely. At this point I'm pretty convinced that tomorrow is not going to be better anyway.

Now I'm terribly in despair that I can't even hide it anymore from people - I've been hiding because I don't want people to see me in this state. One of the few reasons of why I'm staying is because I don't want to see my parents sad, but one day they caught me crying and they basically said that it made them sad to see me sad, and that's when it hit me that I'm probably better off gone. Because even when I'm alive all I can do is make other people sad and disappoint them. If I'm gone they may be sad but at least I know that's the last time I'll ever make them sad.

I... don't know how I'll do it. But I'm writing letters now. I have so many people I care about, but I just can't handle this anymore. I'm thinking about making a web application where people can retrieve my letter if they want to, like if they write their name or something my web app or script would automatically send an e-mail that I've drafted before or something. It's a pretty morbid idea for a side project but it's the least I could do. The letters are not going to be about me but instead it's about what I like about them. They're all great people and I feel like people in general don't talk enough about the good things that we find in each other.

About the when, well, I'm thinking that before I go at least I want to ride the Trans Mongolian train. I love traveling. I used to think traveling can cure depression but no, although I'm always at my happiest when I travel the feelings always come creeping back. But still I really want to ride the Trans Mongolian train, it's a lifelong dream of mine, but I have no expectations that it would cure my depression or change my mind about anything.
