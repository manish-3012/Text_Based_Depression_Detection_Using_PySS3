I donâ€™t know what to doJust like what the title says idk what to do. Im a 21/yo male. have no friends that care Iâ€™m depressed. My mom makes fun of me, my depression and my virginity. I hate my job, I hate where I live,I make little pay, I have no one. Iâ€™m thinking with my next check on buying a gun, so at least I know that if I off myself I have 0 chance of my life getting any worse. I donâ€™t see a future for me. All I see is in my future is my life getting harder and worse as I keep going trying to fix it myself. And itâ€™s getting really tiresome and lonely. Iâ€™m just done Iâ€™m ready to clock out at any moment.
