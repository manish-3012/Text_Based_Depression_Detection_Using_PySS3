Itâ€™s just too hard, I give up. I have no friends where I live, no boyfriend. When I told my dad just then that I want to move to another state next year he said why and I can do what job I want here.He also doesnâ€™t believe mental health issues exist at all. If I cry he gets mad at me, he doesnâ€™t comfort me. My mum died years ago. No one understands me. Iâ€™m sick of being alone constantly. Tonight I got so close to ending my life. I have work tomorrow so I canâ€™t do it now but I have to do it tomorrow because I just canâ€™t take it anymore. Goodbye world
