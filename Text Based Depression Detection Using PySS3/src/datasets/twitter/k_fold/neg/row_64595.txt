weekends are when we feel society's expectations of happiness most | women's bodiesis that why this place gets so busy these nights?

tonight is really bad for me here. 

it's like I'm so much closer to having functionality and happiness in my life than I've ever been and . . . it's like the effort to get to here has overwhelmed me. it's like if you were running a marathon, or even an ultramarathon, and about 500 yards away from the finish line, you die of just exhaustion. 

I know 35 is not too late to find people to love me, but knowing doesn't help. I feel totally unlovable and like I will always be alone, and all my friends are married (because they are) and I am just too much of a wreck to ever get a partner, esp. now that I've stopped dating people who aren't good for my mental health. but if a shitty relationship doesn't kill me, the loneliness will. . . .

on another note: any women out there for whom these feelings manifest as feelings about your body? it's like I felt kinda hot and like my body was starting to look better due to the exercise I've been doing, and then I had a stressful social interaction where I was supposed to be fun and charming. that triggered the suicidality. then I looked in the mirror and I looked horrid and fat and have been replaying the dreadful sight of myself in my head ever since.
