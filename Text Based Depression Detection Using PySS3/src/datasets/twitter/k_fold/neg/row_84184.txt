HelloI am 18 years old and I do not have any friends. I have not had any friends for about five years now, and I just thought I would come here for help. I'm not in desperate need of help, but I just want someone to speak to. With that said, most likely I will kill myself in the next year or so. To continue, I do not have any friends. I don't have any social disorders. I'm a bit shy, but mainly I just have a terrible personality. 
My parents usually give me space, which I am happy for. However I am very isolated. When I say I have not any friends for five years, I truly mean it. Online or real life I have had nobody. The main point I am trying to get at here is that I'm stagnant and alone.
