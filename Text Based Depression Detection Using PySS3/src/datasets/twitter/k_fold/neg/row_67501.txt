Thinking of hanging myself in late September: is it my medication, or my life is just bad/cannot be fixed?Hi i'm on antidepressants, i felt good so i told doctor i want to go from 10 mg to 5 mg to eventually no more meds. After a month on it i became a different person, depression came back. Doctor told me to go back to 10 mg and i did. Its been a month and i feel mostly normal, but recently started feeling suicidal (never happened before). Set a deadline for hanging. Dont know if its my meds or my life is just bad? But im already on 10 mg
