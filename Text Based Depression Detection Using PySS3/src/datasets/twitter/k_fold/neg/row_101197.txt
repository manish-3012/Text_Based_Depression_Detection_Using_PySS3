I want to die, but I'm scared of reincarnationI've been cheated, manipulated, and lied to my entire life. I don't understand how hard it is to just not do this to someone. It really broke me.

I wish I were dead, but if reincarnation is real somehow, then I'm scared of being brought back as a person who makes shitty life choices. I don't want to come back as someone who gets addicted to coke or as that woman who tattooed her eyeballs.

I don't want to come back as someone who will hurt people or whatever.

I just don't want to come back.
