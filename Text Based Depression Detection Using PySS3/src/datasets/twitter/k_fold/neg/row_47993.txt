I cant take this anymoreI just feel like a burden everyday. Even just looking at this subreddit I keep thinking to myself how bad everyone else has it and that im just being dramatic, but I cant do this anymore. The past few days have been complete shit and I can't even pinpoint why, its just all the little things. I asked one of my friends why he left me on open and jokingly said it hurt my feelings, I didnt really care, and his response was because nobody cares about my feelings and I don't matter. This is the only friend I've ever opened up too and it hurt me when he said this with a straight face. I feel like a pussy for even getting upset about it but I cant stop thinking about how true it is. After that the next few days were just full of little things going wrong and they just pissed me off more and more and I don't wanna keep living any longer. If im dead I wont need to worry avout anything and I wont be such a burden to anyone. I've never been in a relationship and I just wanna feel loved. I feel alone, and it fucking hurts me every second of the day. The part that sucks the most to me is that im only 15, so if I try to tell anyone they just assume I want attention and thats not it. All I want is for the fucking pain and loneliness to stop. I can't put up with this shit anymore. I keep promising myself if I don't have anyone that loves me by the time im 18 im going to shoot myself in the fucking brain, but i dont know if I can even make it that long. Im sorry if this whole thing is kind of jumbled right now. I just had a breakdown and I cant think straight, and I know im gonna regret posting this later but I just want someone to listen to me.
