People who used to be suicidal and recovered, how did you do it? How do you stop the thoughts?I want to open by saying that I don't have the consistent, deep, depression that many here are plagued by. However, I occasionally go through periods about 1 to 6 days long, where I fall into a cycle of self loathing, anger, sadness and pity. I get really upset with myself for wasting the opportunities I've had, for not being the man I was supposed to be, and that everyone expected me to be. I get really down on myself for causing the sadness that I have.

I'm not standing on the edge. I'm probably not going to do it, but I would sure love to get rid of the suicidal thoughts. I spend a lot of time daydreaming about it, visualizing the different ways I could end myself, what I would write in the note, how my death would effect different people I've come across, what they would say, etc.

I feel very selfish, and very narcissistic for even having these thoughts. There are so many people who have it worse than I do, and most of my problems and ailments and guilt are directly my fault. I got dealt a decent hand in life, but I can't shake these feelings of inadequacy, and this persistent curiosity and flirtation with suicide. 

I want your help. If anything in what I've written sounds similar to something you've been through, and you've managed to shake it, please. I want to hear from you. I want to banish these thoughts for good, to not go through these terrible episodes I keep putting myself through. 

If you've conquered it and have time, lets talk. There are plenty of other people here who need your help more than I do. If your time is limited, go help someone in a darker place than I am.
