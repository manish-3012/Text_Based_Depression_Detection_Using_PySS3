Getting kicked out in a month.Nearly 30 years old. Have done nothing with my life. I have zero assets and no tangible experience. I deserve my fate. I deserve the situation i am in now. Suicide is the last "easy" way out left to me. I dont know anything else. I have no where to go. Better to end it now before i am on the streets.
