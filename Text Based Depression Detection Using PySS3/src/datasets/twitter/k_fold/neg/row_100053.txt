What is the point of everything changes?Please just hear me out. How can any of us achieve any sort of stability if everything changes? The world around us changes, people change - how am I suppose to keep anyone I love in my life if we all change. I want the friends I had but my mom pointed out that I'm pinning for something that doesn't exist anymore. I had so much fun with them and now all I do is get drunk and do drugs - how can these things be it to feeling some sort of happiness? I'm on antidepressants but it doesn't seem to help. The one friend I still have says that this is just like a tide- it'll go away and I won't feel suicidal or depressed one moment but happy the next but for me it is always there. Happiness for me is the tidal wave, it is fickle and wavering- depression is constant for me. So what is the point if I will lose the precious friends I made? All that matters is the experiences I had with them and clinging to memories is worthless. I just want one thing to stay the same, but it's impossible, people you know will die or change or stop talking to you and even if you view yourself as the sum of all your relations, your relations will dwindle and change constantly. I don't understand what keeps me here. Some say "to feel" but these intense feelings hurt me more than anything. I just want things to be stable for more than a moment in my life
