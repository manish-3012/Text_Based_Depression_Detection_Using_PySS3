i feel sick every day from anxietyiâ€™ve always gotten physically sick when i get too anxious, vomiting or passing out, but having to feel it every day is unbearable.  idk the last time i ate a full meal without getting sick from it. my stomach burns every day and i always have chest pain. i want to rip my stomach out. i want to feel nothing at all. death seems so peaceful. i used to be scared to kill myself, how much it would hurt. i donâ€™t think itâ€™ll be as bad as having to live like this every day. people tell you they understand you or that theyâ€™re there for you but i canâ€™t even be there for me. im going to the doctors today to ask for a therapist for the 10th time in the past two years, they always put me on a waiting list and i never get in. they say they care but if they all know im suicidal wouldnâ€™t they actually do something about it? all everyone does is just cry to me and tell me they donâ€™t want me to hurt myself. i scare myself just as much as i scare them. i cant wait to die it will hurt the ones around me but once they move on they wonâ€™t have to be worried about me anymore, stressing over something nobody can fix.
