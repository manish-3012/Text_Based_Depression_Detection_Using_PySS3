i donâ€™t know what to do with myselfi have posted here before and have been in my exact situation before but something new that ive noticed since experiencing the happiest point in my life before this really low point again is that i acknowledge there are people who love me and care for me but itâ€™s not enough. i love everyone in my life and they love me back and itâ€™s not enough. literally where am i supposed to go from here i have no sense of reality
