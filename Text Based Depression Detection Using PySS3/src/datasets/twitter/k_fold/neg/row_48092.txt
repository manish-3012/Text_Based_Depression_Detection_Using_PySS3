Guy #1038 considering suicideI'll try my best to get these scrambled thoughts of mine into meaningful sentences. Thanks ahead of time for reading all this!


The only thing keeping me from committing suicide is my mom, who I know with her already drastic reactions to both her father and mother's deaths (alcohol and OTC drug abuse) would likely react to my death in an unimaginably damaging way to my family.
I do care deeply about my family and close friends, but every single day my mind seems to get more and more fucked up.


It's hard for me to describe what's happening with me, but for the past 2 years or so i've struggled daily with crippling anxiety, what i think is probably depression, and the worst of it for me is an almost constant inability to translate my thoughts into words. I'll have these things i want to say and the willingness to say them, but I'll start speaking normally and part way through completely draw a blank on the rest of what i wanted to say.


The last thing is the main reason i want to kill myself. I can't see a reason for living if i can't communicate with people on a daily basis. I don't know how relevant this is, but I was diagnosed and treated for Arnold Chiari Type 1 disorder when I was young. I still sometimes get the migraines and balance issues that come with the disorder, but it doesn't seem to effect me daily like the problems in my mind do.


One other thing that significantly affected my life was a surgery I had when I was 14 that was supposed to be a 1 day operation but ended up keeping me in a hospital bed for 3 weeks due to an e-coli infection from the surgery. When I think back, this is the moment that transitioned me from happy normal child to the current state I'm in (now 21).

Well that's all I can think of right now, Thanks again for reading this mess.
