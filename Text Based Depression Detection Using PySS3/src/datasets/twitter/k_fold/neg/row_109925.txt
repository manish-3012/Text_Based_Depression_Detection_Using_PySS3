HospitalI'm thinking about walking into the ER to ask for help. I'm terrified. I don't have a plan or want to be held for 72 hours or any of that. I can't seem to get access to a doctor, so I hope to explain to the ER people that I just need to see a doctor (or NP, whatever) about my depression and hopefully walk away with a prescription for antidepressants. Is this possible or will they lock me up? I need help but I'm afraid
