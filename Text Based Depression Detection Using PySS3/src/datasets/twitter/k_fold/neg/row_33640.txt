I would do absolutely anything for money because the alternative is deathIâ€™m Natasha, 22, I live in the UK. Iâ€™m in a situation where itâ€™s gotten to the point where Iâ€™m actually considering taking my life on a daily basis and itâ€™s really scaring me. Basically what happened is a job screwed me over and owes me a good over Â£1000 of pay. I had to pay for medical treatments with my savings, I have no family to help out (I do but they hate me and they would never help me out), Iâ€™ve always done everything on my own. I have been refused help from the government every time I have asked, because Iâ€™m foreign. Iâ€™m most likely going to get evicted, become homeless and you name it - itâ€™s probably gonna fucking happen or itâ€™s already started. I havenâ€™t had normal food for over a week. I have never been in this bad of a situation before. I canâ€™t survive. Iâ€™ve been trying to get a different job for the past month. Iâ€™ve literally been surviving on nothing for a month and a half. I genuinely want to kill myself. Iâ€™d do anything for money. You name it, Iâ€™ll do it. Anything. I donâ€™t care what it is. Itâ€™s better than me eventually flipping out. I donâ€™t know what else to do. I just want to stop planning my fucking death in my head constantly. Iâ€™m sorry if this is the wrong place.. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m getting very close by the day...
