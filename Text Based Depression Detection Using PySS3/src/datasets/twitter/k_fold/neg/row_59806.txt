Just made my mom cry (I'm an adult btw)I'm 24yo. Was having an anxiety attack this afternoon and called my mom originally to ask
advice about a shitty situation I'm in, but in my panic I just ended up telling 'fuck it' and hanging up. Dad texts me and tells me my mom is crying hysterically. I feel really bad and wish I didn't do that, but at the same time I just keep thinking that I didn't ask to be born and it's her fault for having me and that this is nothing compared to how I feel pretty much all the time and she should fucking suck it up. Still too scared to kill myself unfortunately, so I have to just sit with this all night and then all day at work tomorrow and then all weekend yadayadayada.... fuck this world man.
