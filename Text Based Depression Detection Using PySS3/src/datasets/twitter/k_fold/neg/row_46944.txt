I think Iâ€™ve decided on a methodIs my problem/issue permanent? Yes. Is the pain of living worse than the pain of ending it? Yes. Do I feel absolutely gutted about what this will do to my parents and boyfriend? Yes. But do I want to continue living my life in misery/not reaching my full potential to save them some heartache? No. 
Iâ€™m not posting this to get an influx of â€œDonâ€™t do it!â€ â€œIt gets betterâ€ replies, I just want to speak with people who can relate. Iâ€™ve been suicidal for a couple years since dealing with terrible health issues that have affected my mental health and physical health. Iâ€™ve come to a point in my life where I realize I canâ€™t continue living like this. Iâ€™ve dropped out of school, donâ€™t work, donâ€™t have friends - and there are many reasons why I canâ€™t do/have these things that would be too complicated to explain. 
After stalking this sub for a while, I think Iâ€™ve decided to overdose on Tylenol. Yes...I have read up extensively on it and realize itâ€™s a really fucking terrible way to go. But I donâ€™t really have any other options. I donâ€™t have access to a gun, Iâ€™m too scared to jump off a building or stand in front of a train, and i donâ€™t have access to pills serious enough to be fatal. 
Iâ€™m posting this to ask if anyone who survived Tylenol overdose can share their experience with me. Iâ€™d also like to hear how some of you come to terms with how painful attempting suicide is. Iâ€™m iffy on if I can successfully go through with this and not call 911 before itâ€™s too late.
