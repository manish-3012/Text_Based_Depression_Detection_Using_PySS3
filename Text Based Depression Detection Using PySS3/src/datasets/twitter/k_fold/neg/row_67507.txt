MystoryI am so disguessed from my life .....
 Every day i wake up ... getting ready for the school
 And i know that the same shit will happend.
 Basically i have social anxiety and dippression
 Every day in the night i say to myself: tomorrow
 Will be good.
 And ...... apparently its not gonna get any better.
 Iam in this Situation for almost 1 year
 I just find only one way to end All of this
 But iam too scared to do it
 I just dont know what to do ......
