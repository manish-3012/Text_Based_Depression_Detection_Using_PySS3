I donâ€™t want to die but I just want an escapeIâ€™m 16 and enrolled at my college so when I graduate high school I also have an AA degree so I can get in to a good college. Iâ€™m class president of my class (all the other high school kids doing the same as me) and I have the SATs to worry about, volunteer hours for a scholarship etc. Itâ€™s too much. My chemistry professor doesnâ€™t teach. All her teachings material are YouTube videos from other professors from 4 years ago. I just failed a quiz and have a test next week. I understand the material now but thatâ€™s not the point. This is all pre-req work . When Iâ€™m in higher level courses I wonâ€™t be able to understand the material after I fail, because itâ€™s just too hard. Iâ€™m at the point now where I have to keep going, I might not graduate with a 4.7 GPA but it feels like I will miss out on the right college even though I have no idea what I want to do with my life. I just need an escape, and not drugs or dangerous shit, like playing Xbox with my friends, but right now, I have literally no time for any of that. I like a girl in my class but i donâ€™t have time to be in a relationship and Iâ€™m sure neither does she. All the adults in my life never will say anyone is unlucky. They believe everything that happens in your life you have complete control over. I failed my chemistry quiz because I didnâ€™t reach out to a tutor or professor. I canâ€™t take it and donâ€™t know what to do
