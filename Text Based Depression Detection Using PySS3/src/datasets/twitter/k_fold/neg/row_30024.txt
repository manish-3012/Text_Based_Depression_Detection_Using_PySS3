what is the point of livingi have to deal with this illness. the man i love doesnt even want to talk to me.
. but talks to other woman. somehow i think that breaks my heart more than the fact that i am.sick. i dont really understand why this all happens? why... is there so much hurt and pain... i dont understand why i was even born if all this.. living in this crappy place.. humans are so cruel and disgust me and they just make me sick to the stomach of crap they do. i just get so sad about it all... what did i do to deserve this? what did i do?
