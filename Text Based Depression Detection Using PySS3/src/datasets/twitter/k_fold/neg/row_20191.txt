Not sure what's going to happen...I drank about half a bottle of tequila and downed a whole bottle of NyQuil last night. NOw my whole body is numb and my head feels like it is constantly spinning... I wasn't really thinking of killing myself but I found out what I did could cause liver failure. But it's been so long since I did it, if I was to go to the hospital there would be nothing they could do....
