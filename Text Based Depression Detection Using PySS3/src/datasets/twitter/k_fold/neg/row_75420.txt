Iâ€™ve just started thinking about how everything that makes me stop thinking about killing myself is going to be gone soon and that Iâ€™ll never get the same quality of it if I do it againI used to be miserable and thought about suicide at least 3 times a week. Recently, that got way better and I was actually happy, but now Iâ€™ve realized the things that make me happy are rare and specific. Also that once they are gone, they are gone forever. Itâ€™s difficult to find the same quality of happiness and every time I think about talking to someone about I stop myself because I know theyâ€™ll call the cops or just not care. I donâ€™t have the guts to tell anybody I know in person and I just want to die. 

TL;DR: I need to find a way to add cushion to my everyday life so that when something that really makes me happy goes away, I wonâ€™t be so miserable when I get back to normal.
