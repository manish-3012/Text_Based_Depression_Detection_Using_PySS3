Do you ever feel like you've experienced everything life has to offer, and every subsequent experiences will be lesser versions on the original?Hey SW, 

Firstly, I'm in absolute awe of the work that the members of this community do on a daily basis.  

I guess my point of posting here is to query if life, after you've experiences an extremely privileged range of existence, ever gets better?  It's starting to feel like there's few novel experiences left in life.  

I've experienced professional success (at least compared to the average wage of my country). I've travelled extensively, and spent time living abroad in a few different countries. I've volunteered in humanitarian and wildlife conservation roles.  I've been in love.  I've broken up.  I've supported family members and friends in achieving success.  I've lost family members and friends to terminal illnesses and accidents.

I've experienced therapy, drugs, lifestyle changes, and sabbaticals in monasteries.  While my experiences and thoughts have been somewhat dynamic, a consistent theme has been [Anhedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhedonia).

I guess I'd love to hear from redditors aged 30+ about new experiences, and things that have substantially changed their life, or the enjoyment of it, as they've got older?
