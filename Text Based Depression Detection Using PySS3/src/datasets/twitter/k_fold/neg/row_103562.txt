My mom asked what I wanted for Christmas.I told her I wanted to be a different person entirely. Someone who isn't a total loser and an alien. Someone who deserves to live and isn't an ugly sack of shit.

I don't even know who I am anymore. Its like someone made me and couldn't decide what type of person I should be so they just added in everything bad.

I'm completely alone in this world and nobody understands the way I think our see things. Nobody can understand why I think so little of myself or why I wish to just die. Nobody really gives a shit about me.
