20f i hate myself so much that it makes me sick.For the last two years, my bf has degraded me and belittled me and has made me to feel like I'm not worth happiness and I'm not beautiful. Yesterday, he broke up with me because I was too fat for him, even though Id already lost 30 lbs. I feel defeated. I feel like I cant really go on anymore. Every time I feel my head start to be above water, he pushes me back down. When my grandma died a month ago, who I was extremely close with, he said he would be there for me.  I've been on medication for the past 6 months for bipolar disorder and I stopped taking them the day before he said anything. I have about 10 grams of cocaine that I plan on ODing with. It wont be pleasant towards the end, but I'm prepared for the pain. I hate myself so much for allowing myself to become so vulnerable and Ill do anything to get rid of this pain. I feel so alone and heartbroken and I would appreciate someone to talk to.
