I need help.I just want to be happy but I have no idea how. My depression ruined my marriage and my wife left me. My job made me miserable so I quit. I'm back with my parents and working with my dad. If I don't get up for work I just sleep all day as much as I can because getting out of bed just doesn't feel worth it. Then I feel worse about myself. I'm full of regrets and self loathing and think about suicide every day. I'm taking anti depressants but I don't think they're helping. I know I have to work with them but I don't know how. I don't want to wish I was dead everyday anymore. I just want to be happy. What should I do?
