Left my old because I started a new one, now I'm out of jobI just left my old job because I was hired somewhere else, they told me it was ok to leave my old job and I even worked an entire shift at that new job. I was sure I was there to leave because they told me I was doing great. Now, this morning I get a call and I'm told that they hired someone else because she had more qualification. Now, I'm out of job and if nothing happen, I'll be out of money within the next two weeks. This is a crappy situation and honestly, I'm tired of having to leave through shit like this
