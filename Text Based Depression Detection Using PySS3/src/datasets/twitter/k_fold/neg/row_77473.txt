I can't do this anymoreI hope my nephew grows up and finds happiness somewhere. I hope my sister pays off her debt. I hope my mother finds happiness, she deserves it more than anyone. I'm sure they won't understand, I was never ready for any of this and it's all starting to crash down around me. All I can see is how hollow my life has become. There's no way out of here and I'm starting to drown in my head. Please. For the love of god somebody help me. I can't do this alone anymore. I have no one else to turn to. Please help me.
