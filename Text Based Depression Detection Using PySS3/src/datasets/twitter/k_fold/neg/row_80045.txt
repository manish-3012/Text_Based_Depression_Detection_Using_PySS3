i dont really see a full on point anymore in livingim going through way too much. i dont make enough at my job, i dont have many friends, my soulmate left me because of my mental illnesses, i cant pay car insurance or for a car, my future is going down a different path, etc. 
i had my whole life planned out, and now it isnt even happening anymore because of a bump in the road. 
im not even going to be marrying anybody anymore. i cant put myself through a relationship with anyone else again. 
i learn nothing in school anymore, whatâ€™s the point?
i fear for my future because of our dumb president and dumb republicans. 
i told him i need to talk to him and see him today, he probably doesnâ€™t want to see me, but its my cry for help.
im too p*ssy to even do anything. its just the thoughts. 

whats my point or reason i should be here anyway?
