it doesn't get betteranother 3 weeks has passed. another week has passed by. it doesn't get better.

during Monday i tried to do it but failed. i called the nurses and they sent an ambulance. had to wait in the waiting room for 8 hours then i was allowed to go home because i wanted to.

during this week it's been hard and just painful mentally. during Tuesday i was really not okay because of the day before. 

since Friday ive been having the bridge on my mind again and really, REALLY tried not going there. i tried to fall asleep instead and eventually i did. 

now im just trying to survive to tomorrow. i might call the nurses again because im extremely close to doing it and i cannot handle it anymore. 

everyday im trying and trying and trying. 
tired of feeling this way and tired of these suicidal thoughts i have everyday. they won't go away. 

it really doesn't get better. another half year has gone and im still the same worthless human as before. 

i wish i could be, gone. close my eyes and never open them again.
