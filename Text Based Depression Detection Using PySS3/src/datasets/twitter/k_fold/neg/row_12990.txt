I got dumped and I canâ€™t take it anymoreIt sounds pathetic and dumb, however; she helped with my depression. She made me happy.  I love her so fucking much. I invested so much time into her. Then she ups and leaves for a guy who she knows is gonna use her. When she had a caring and loving guy, who tried to give her everything she ever wanted. 
I just canT take it. Iâ€™ve tried fighting for her back. Iâ€™ve tried. Itâ€™s exhausting. It also doesnâ€™t help things are piling up. I feel so numb and empty. I no longer do good in school. Iâ€™ve been off my meds for a long time. Iâ€™ve been getting more and more frequent panic attacks. Is it even worht it anymore.
