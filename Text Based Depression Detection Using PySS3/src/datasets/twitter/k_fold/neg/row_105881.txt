Everyone always says that people love meAnd i know they do. My family has gone out of their way to express that they'll do anything to help me. But that doesn't help. It doesn't affect me and it doesn't relieve my pain. 
God, I can't take this. It feels like I'm living in an incinerator. I have to kill myself.
