I really need a hug. (Sappy, slim on details. Move along?)That's it

I...it's a VERY long story, and perhaps this isn't the appropriate place to put this* (if it isn't, mods: feel free to delete), but I just broke up with the only person who showed me actual love and affection (it's been almost a week). I'm alone, numb emotionally, hurting physically. I'm trying to make ends meet, out of work and without her or her friends to rely on in any sense of the word. Went to find my username for reddit in my gmail and the only hit that came up was a chat with her, when we were still together.


 *[I really want to die, but between crippling anxiety, awareness of the poor success rates for suicide, prior attempt, and lack of a gun, I understand this isn't a reasonable option, and am thus not suicidal?].
