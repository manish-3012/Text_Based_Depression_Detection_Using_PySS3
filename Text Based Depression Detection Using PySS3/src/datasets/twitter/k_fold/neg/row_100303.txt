completely alone. when will things change?My parents divorced when i was very young, and due to this, my mother became very protective of me.
She sheltered me very much, she didn't allow me to go to school and instead homeschooled me, wouldn't let me out of the house, and etc.
I'm almost now 17 and not quite old enough to make my own decisions, but the loneliness has been ruining me ever since.
I've tried everything to get out of the house and make friends but it seems as if everything just works against me.
I live in a very very small town that is currently the worst job marketing in the U.S, finding a job has been impossible for me. My mom still won't let me into a school. I've tried talking to her... I am just literally out of options...I've never had a friend in my entire life.
I've done nothing but stay in this house. I could die tomorrow and truthfully say that I have done absolutely nothing with my life. What's the point?

I just think about how easy it will be to just end things, and how there is nobody here stopping me.
I feel embarrassed writing this, but I just don't know what to do anymore.
