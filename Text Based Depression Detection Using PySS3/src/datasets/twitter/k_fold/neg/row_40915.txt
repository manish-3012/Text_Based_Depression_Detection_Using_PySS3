Bored reallyHey, so Im not like immenent suicidal or anything, im honestly just tired of my life currently, everythings so bland.

I mean Ive seen alot in 22 years, statisticaly Ive faired pretty good so far, alot of people die before they even make it into their 20s, whether its famine, war illness or just general Darwinism (looking at you anon, you know what you did!) 

Dont get me wrong everything on paper about my life looks good, I look pretty damn handsome, Im currently going to Uni and my parents are paying for it, going to Mexico for a study abroad trip this winter, Im also a cis white male if that matters. I just cant find love or find quality friends, still a virgin so I guess that's one reason to live but even still Im just so bored with life. 

Im not so much suicidal so much that I am incredibly bored, I need something to spice up my life.
