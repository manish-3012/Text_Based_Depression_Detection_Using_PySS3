Wasnâ€™t enough I canâ€™t deal with itSo as Iâ€™m sure many people on here are talking about their breakups. Well this is another one.. Iâ€™ve (21M) been dating (was) dating my ex gf (19F) for over a year almost a year and a half and my life completely changed after meeting her, I found myself, my true self and she has helped me realize so many things and learn. Not to mention sheâ€™s literally the love of my life and weâ€™ve always planned our future.. even up to not long ago. Weâ€™ve had our breaks before but this time is it, this time there isnâ€™t going back I donâ€™t think. I can always see a hint or glimpse of chance but not now.. she tells me she hates me and doesnâ€™t want me to be a part of her life at all. Sheâ€™s completely blocked me off of everything and I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll ever be able to see her again, hear her voice, see her face. And thatâ€™s the scariest thing, knowing sheâ€™s out there somewhere living her life, without me. Might sound selfish but thatâ€™s how much I love this girl.. I canâ€™t cope with knowing i could never see or know anything from her ever again. I canâ€™t imagine having to live my day to day without her by me, and honestly I donâ€™t want to. I canâ€™t deal w imagining her doing anything weâ€™ve ever done together with another man.. all of these thoughts just make me not want to be here. And Iâ€™ve had these thoughts before.. never as serious as this and I just want to be brave enough to end it. But all I could think about is her, what would she go through, what would she think, but then i think of me. How much she hates me now, and wants nothing to do with me ever again. I just want to make her happy, and leaving to not bother her ever at all could be the answer. Iâ€™m never at peace without her, I just want to be at peace if weâ€™re not going to be together.. But I want her to know I love her. More than anything else in this world and ever, what should I do? Or just let her find out? Since she wants nothing to do with me anymore
