I think I've screwed this all up enough and it's time to leave.I quit my job without a plan two weeks ago because it was killing me. 

I've got no money, no real prospects, no training, and no time. 

I just don't want to fail again. 

Nobody calls or texts me anymore, nobody talks to me anymore, I'm gonna be alone on Christmas. Again.

I can't think of a reason not to.
