I don't even know what the point is.I don't even know where to begin here. I can't find a job, because I'm not good at anything useful. I work well with spreadsheets and I type fast, but no one wants people with no experience with those. I worked for a grocery store as a cashier, where my shoulder got messed up, still haven't been to the doctor for it. Next I worked with Sutherland Global Services, and even on antidepressants that were working, ended up wanting to kill myself. The ones I apply for never said anything back. I have to work from home, because a mandatory class for my license where I am is $350, and I can't leave the house with nearly having an attack. If I get separated from my roommate in a store for more than a second, it starts.

I want a relationship, but I'm such a mess that I can't imagine anyone wanting me, and the two of three that did tried to sleep with me and stopped talking to me afterward. The third wouldn't say anything unless he was drunk and ended up being sexist anyway. I get to points where I can't get out of bed, I just don't have the energy. When I contacted the Suicide Hotline, it was so scripted and uncaring. The only reason I won't kill myself is my roommate, my mom, little sister, and my pets. And even then, I've already tried to kill myself, carbon monoxide poisoning. The only reason I didn't is because my roommate started talking to me after, asking if I was okay. I didn't get bad to the point of needing to go to the hospital, all I needed was some fresh air.

I need medication again, and my shoulder needs looked at, but I haven't gotten my insurance card from Medicaid (because my dad lost his job, so no insurance under him anymore). I had moved out, considered going home, but there's a family situation that would definitely make me kill myself. But I just don't see the point of not doing it anyway. The only thing I do is play Pokemon and Guild Wars 2, because I can't get a job. I just don't know what to do.
