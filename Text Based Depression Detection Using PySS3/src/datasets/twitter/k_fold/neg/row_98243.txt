Iâ€™ve been telling myself that I am unable to deal with the behavior of my family, but the truth is my own poor judgement is the problem...... and while I have always considered suicide as the best option for relieving them of me, should I just tell them that I need to go away and start a new life - so they can cling to the illusion that Iâ€™ll be fine? Or should the separation be quick and definitive so they wonâ€™t have the mistaken hope that Iâ€™ll ever return?
