I've got everything planned but I can't bring myself to write a noteI know when I want to do it, sometime next summer so I can save up money for my family.
Good ole fashion hanging or OD on antidepressants (ironic)
I know the time and everything but, I can't bring myself to even start thinking about a note. Am I too afraid to say good bye? Am I embarrassed of how weak I am?
Well, at least I've got time to figure it out...
