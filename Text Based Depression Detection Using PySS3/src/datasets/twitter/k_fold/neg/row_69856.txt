I often think too much about things that I want to do till I have no time left to do it. Why?I want to do many things but even the simplest things i want to do I cant achieve because i spent way to less time with doing it and to much time thinking about it. I feel like i am destroying my life and have many fears that i wont have a enjoyable life.
