It's starting to feel like my life doesn't matterAnd I can hear a train to by. I think about setting my kids near the street and standing on the tracks and waiting for the train to go by. I couldn't leave them anywhere else. No one would find them to help them. No one would be able to identify who I am. Atleast my kids would be safe.
