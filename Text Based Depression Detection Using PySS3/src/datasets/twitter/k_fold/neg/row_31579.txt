Deleted everything. Now I will delete myself.I used to post here on my main account but I deleted it because I didn't want people finding me. Or people being called after I am dead.

People I wanna thank:
1. Parents
2. My sisters
3. My godson
4. My friends Nancy, Shiela, Susan, Irene, Samantha for putting up with my nonsense 
5. My friends Adam, Aaron, Steve, George and Castro for trying to save me so many times
6. Special thanks to Austin for literally saving me once
7. Thanks to my boyfriend Scott for finally pushing me to make this decision. I owe you a lot. Thank you for making me understand that love is fake. And I wasn't enough to fight for.
8. Thanks to my high school teachers Mr Gellert and Mrs Savannah
9. Thank you to my professors Dr Bobby, Dr Simons and Dr Peter Kurtman
10. Thank you to God for these short 20 years


Apart from the thanks, I have something for you all.

You have to fight. I lost. I fought and lost so I know it wasn't possible to live.

Do not trust anyone who tells you they love you. You can give them the whole world but they will take it for granted and not give you anything. Do not trust them at all. Trust yourself.

Have children. If I had children, which was always the biggest dream I had, I would have been living for them. Have children, be wirh them happily. Play with them, teach them. Hold them close to you, they will never stop loving you.

Dear men, find women like me and treat them right.

Dear women, do not trust any man's words so easily and guard your hearts.


To my son who I had dreamed of a lot: I am sorry my love, but we will meet in heaven.


Please say a hail mary with me.

Hail Mary, full of grace, the lord is with thee
Blest are thou amongst women
Blest is the fruit of thy womb jesus
Holy mary, mother of god, pray for us sinners 
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen.


It's my hour now. Goodbye. May your hours come long time later.
