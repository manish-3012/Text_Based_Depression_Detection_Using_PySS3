Switching from Lexapro to Paxil?I have been taking 20mg of Lexapro for just shy as a month now. It has been going okay. My mood has improved and anxiety has decreased, but I have been experiencing some negative side effects. I feel groggy when I get out of bed and it takes me a long time to get going in the morning; even after I wake up, I feel generally low energy throughout the day. I also feel nauseous after taking Lexapro, which I take in the morning because I canâ€™t sleep at night if I take it in the evening, and skip breakfast and lunch because of it, but once the nausea clears up around mid-afternoon, I canâ€™t stop eating. I was think of asking my doctor for Wellbutrin to boost my energy levels and decrease my appetite, but the combination of Paxil and Wellbutrin keeps coming up in my research. A lot of people say that combination Paxil and Wellbutrin did wonders for their depression and anxiety. I am now thinking of asking my doctor to switch me from Lexapro to Paxil and prescribing me Wellbutrin. I was wondering if anyone had experience switching from Lexapro to Paxil? And if anyone had taken Paxil and Wellbutrin? Whatâ€™s it like? Thanks.
