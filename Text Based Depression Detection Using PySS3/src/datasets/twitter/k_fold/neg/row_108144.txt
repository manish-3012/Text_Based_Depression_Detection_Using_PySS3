I never thought I'd end up like this.I would much rather be a female than a male but I know I will never be one because I'm such the epitome of masculine. I have two friends, both of which I'm certain would forget me pretty quickly. They never go out of their way to talk to me, which actually puts me at ease so they wouldn't have to find out that I killed myself.

I hear voices. Voices that don't stop telling me how fucked up and stupid and lame I am. They're always extremely rude and too frequent to ignore. I also hear ringing in my ears. A lot. I have some sort of psychotic episode at least once a day.

I've had vivid visions in my head about hurting and/or killing other people. I want to kill myself to keep from being a danger to anybody else. I hate the way I look and sound. I hate the way I haven't made an impact on anybody. I hate how I always sleep in really late and don't get anything done. I hate the way I talk to people because I'm so awkward that I regret whatever I say. I hate that it's beyond obvious that I'm a disappointment to my parents and they'd only be more disappointed if they knew more about me.

Nobody knows everything about me. If they did, they'd hate me. If anyone decides to respond to this post, you'd probably hate me after knowing me too.

I'm not going to kill myself right now because I want to wait until everyone stops thinking about me entirely. I just want it to be in the dark.
