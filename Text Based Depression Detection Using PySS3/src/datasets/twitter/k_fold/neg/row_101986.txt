I Don't Know What To Title This.I'm in so much pain and I just can't deal with it. I'm a 14-year-old girl and I have chronic period pain, I've been taken to the hospital 3 times with it, once in an ambulance. most times I go to the doctors they don't help. I really can't deal with it anymore. I just don't want to live with this.
