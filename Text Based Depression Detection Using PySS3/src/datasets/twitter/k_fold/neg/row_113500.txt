So tired of it alledit: the two that first commented in this post have helped me greatly. Please don't feel obliged to respond to this post. Thank you. This community is amazing. 

I am a nineteen year old girl starting my junior year of college this coming fall. I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts and depression since I was seven years old. I am struggling to find motivation in my daily life and I despise school. I am so tired of everything. I just want it all to end. I've come to this subreddit so many times. I go to the suicide hotline chatroom and they always tell me to send them an email and then they'll get back to me. It makes me feel even more insignificant. I'm contemplating my life and you want me to send you an email and you'll get back to me later? What the fuck. My life means nothing. I have no friends and I live in my college town to stay away from my family that negatively affects my life. I am miserable. Help.
