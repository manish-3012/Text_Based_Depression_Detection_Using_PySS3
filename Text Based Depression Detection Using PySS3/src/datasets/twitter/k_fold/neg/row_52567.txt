I think I've reached the end of the lineI'm feeling a little helpless and overwhelmed right now. I've been on many psychiatric drugs for 6 years now. The usual story is that they work for a while and then stop.

I was on this med that was a key pin in keeping me together, but I was showing symptoms of tardive dyskinesia (where you can't stop certain motions from happening) on it.

Just started this intense drug, clozapine. I have to get vitals done daily, and weekly blood tests because it runs the risk of depleting your white blood cell count. I feel this med is a complete last resort because of all of the work it takes even to just get started on it, and because of the risks associated with it.

This new drug isn't working right. I'm suicidal. I'm sleeping for 20 hours a day. I'm skipping work. Not showering, eating. I feel there is no where to turn now and that it is my destiny that I kill myself. I've been daydreaming a lot lately about how I wish I killed myself at various points in my life. So I had a thought: I bet in the future I'll wish I killed myself now.

I'm going to wait until after a big family vacation we're taking in Feb. One last time to hang out with my family and say goodbye.
