I'm just so alone.I'm so overwhelmed with life right now. The only person I feel comfortable talking to is my abusive ex and he's just pushing me more and more to want to die. I'm so stressed out between work, my health, and being 2800 miles away from my family. I'm not sure if I'm going to be around much longer.
