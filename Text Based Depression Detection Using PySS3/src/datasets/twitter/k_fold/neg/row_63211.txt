Trying to find ways to not feel so sad. It feels pretty sudden and I don't know why things seem so bad so quick.Just don't understand why I'm feeling this bad so fast, always dealt with everything and took care of everyone. Daily life is getting so, bad and i don't care care much. I feel alone and that is not new, but this bad is different. Tomorrow will be different hopefully. Been a very long time since I felt this bad. edit- I went to the anxiety chat for support due to sleep issuses, and was made fun of. Don't go there unless you want to feel even worse- thanks anxiety people https://app.orangechat.io/r/anxiety.
