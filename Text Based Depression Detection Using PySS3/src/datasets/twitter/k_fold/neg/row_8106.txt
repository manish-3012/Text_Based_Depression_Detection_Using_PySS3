My second post hereBefore you read this, read my previous post: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/4cck3r/left_alone/

So, here I am again. I started to get out of depression of always, but then I got back to it. I bought some clothes, a phone and made a FB account. But nothing changed.

In fact classmates started to ignore me, and my crush doesn't even bother responding. These made me feel so bad, that I started cutting myself. Nothing serious, just some scratch.

Today was one of the worst days of my life, because I was a little bit jealous. Jealousity + depression = suicidal thoughts.
I tried to ignore it, but then I faced another problem: my face.
I just noticed how ugly I am, or at least that's what I think about myself.

I'd appreciate any help.
