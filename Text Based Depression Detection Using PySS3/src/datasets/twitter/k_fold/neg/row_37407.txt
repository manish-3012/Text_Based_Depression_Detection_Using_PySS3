Not Now, but I Canâ€™t Say NeverIâ€™ve been suicidal and had mental health issues since before I was 13. Iâ€™m turning 19 this month. I canâ€™t think of a month when I didnâ€™t think about suicide in those 6+ years. Iâ€™ve always passively planned and thought about what I wanted. Tonight, I wrote out what I need to leave to people and my to-do list beforehand, and I did so calmly. I am not distraught over any of it. I donâ€™t have a date in mind, and I truly not planning on hurting myself anytime soon as of now. But I know that plans can always change. So, I have made sure I am ready. 

I have no idea why I came here to say this. But when I thought of this before, Iâ€™ve always been seriously depressed or upset, but this time, I am calm. I feel as if I might only be planning for something inevitable, something that is certain to happen to me someday. I have lived with this so long I cannot see things changing unless they change in this way I have anticipated. 

If you read this, thank you. I hope you do not worry too much, and that you and your family will be well.
