LostIt's been a year since my mom died. Since then, I haven't had a proper sleep. I get anxious and stressed over the littlest of things. I feel like I am just waiting for something bad to happen or for myself to break.
Way before this happened, I was already having suicidal thoughts/ideations. I was never diagnosed though and I never had the courage to.
My mother, she was special and I never would deserve her. She was the only one who knew, she was the only one I confided in. I guess now, I don't know. 
I don't exactly know how I feel. Sometimes it hits me, fear. But it's myself I fear. I feel like the only thing stopping me is the thought of my grandmother. She might not make it if I finally get the courage to listen to my impulses.
I guess I can fake it well, but sometimes I just wish someone would notice or care. Funny isn't it? How no one really cares, but they pretend they do. I guess I'm sad, and angry, and tired. Because these past few days, I have been feeling it again but this time, it's stronger.
