I'm still here.28th of December I managed to finally pull myself together and get help. Went to my city's emergency center and laid it out: 

I want to die, please help me.

Now living in my best friends old room with his mother at age 23. They didn't want me to be alone and neither did it. Still don't, but it's gotten better. I don't own a single piece of clothing or electronics besides my phone, sold it all. My teeth ache from not having taken care of them in who knows how long, also in alot of debt. 

But I'm alive. Not more than a month ago I was more than convinced I had decided to die. Happy I managed to see beauty through the demon that depression is. 

And if you feel like you're screwed, you're not. Don't give up. Talk to someone, you'll be shocked to see how many cares. 

Ask me whatever.
