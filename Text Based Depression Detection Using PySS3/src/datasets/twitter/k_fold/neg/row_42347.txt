Losing groundI am a disabled veteran with a minor spinal injury (I use a cane), multiple sclerosis, as well as chronic depression &amp; insomnia on top of everything.   Basically I am fucked.

For a few years from 2013-2015 I kept asking myself "Is this enough?" and "Was this a good enough life?".   I stalled until now when we're in the middle of 2020 and I know I am not doing alright.   My daily step count is below 1,500 a day, I spend most of my time trapped in my house, and the medication isn't helping given my problems are real versus just a biochemical imbalance.

As it stands I don't see myself getting better, I've lost the one job I was good at (driving for Uber &amp; Lyft), and I don't think I can make it to 2023 or 2024 when the pandemic will likely taper down.  I don't think I can go to my local VA hospital to be put on a psych hold without risking exposure to corona so I am truly stuck where I am at.

I don't know why I am typing this.  I've already got a plan &amp; means but I keep debating in my mind if it is suicide or euthanasia.   Their just doesn't feel like there will be a light at the end of the tunnel for me, even if the pandemic were to "Just go away" magically tomorrow, I would still be fucked physically and mentally.
