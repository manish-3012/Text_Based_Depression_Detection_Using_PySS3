Mental breakdownI've been suffering with health problems for over 2 years now which have caused me to deteriorate drastically. 

I'm unable to eat without being in discomfort due to dysmotilty in my esophagus. This affects my breathing. The cause of this is undiagnosed and there is no diagnosis in sight.

I've been suicidal about this before, but now I really feel like I'm going to end up killing myself. I don't think I can carry on suffering not being able to live a "normal life". I have regular therapy but I don't think it really helps me. 

I've had a box of drugs on my desk for a week now debating on overdosing. This is as close as I've ever come to suicide - I'm feeling like I'm about to be pushed over the edge. I can not go in living in discomfort for the rest of my life.
