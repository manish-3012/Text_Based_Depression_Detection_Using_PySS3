I am 29 and I think I am going to die soon.Hi everyone
I have been severly depressed for almost 5 months now.I always have suicidal thoughts running through my mind.I have been told countless times that "it shall pass".It never I have been to therapy and also put on Sertraline, it's been 10 days now.None of that stuff is helping.I have no motivation to get out of bed.I have been considering Ketamine Infusion Therapy for a couple of days now,can anyone tell me how the experience is?It is probably my last shot at getting better.
