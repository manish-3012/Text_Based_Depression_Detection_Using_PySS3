this may be a really stupid question.okay, so i live in england, and i need to know, if i go to a doctor and tell them about suicidal thoughts and self harm, will they tell my
parents? i am under 16 and if my parents found out they would make it a hell of a lot worse. so i need to know before i take any chances. thank you!
