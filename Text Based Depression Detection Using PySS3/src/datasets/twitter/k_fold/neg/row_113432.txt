Contemplating suicide
Feel like an asshole. Have others who will be seriously hurt. Recently went through some traumatic and incredibly stressful events. Am on anti depressants, seeing Counsellor and doing the things that have worked for depression before. 

In good socioeconomic standing, enjoy my job and family. Not sure bullshit of life outweighs the pain. 

Have a plan, which is what scares me as I have never had a feasible plan before but have just "fantasized" but current plan is achievable and readily available.
