I'm so ridiculously alone.Hi, i'm 27 year old and have very little willpower, i'm overweight and i'm lazy, i have so little willpower to change my life and i think the reason i'm not dead right now is because i haven't been able to force myself to do it.  I hate my life.  Everytime i stand at the bustop i imagine jumping in front of trucks, I have stood on the rail of my 9th floor window and tried to muster the courage to push the screen off and follow it down.  I don't really know what to say i don't really have anyone to talk too.  I have no friends and my family and i haven't talked to each other in years.  I'm stuck in a dead end job,  I haven't been voluntarly touched by a human being in years.   I don't talk to anyone beside co-workers (most of which i dislike) and my roomate.  I'm not a good person, i'm rude and mean and lazy and fat. I don't want to live but i keep doing it because it requires less effort then not.  This feels so fucking melodramatic and i hate feeling like this so much.  I hate being me so much.  I've pretended to be smarter then other people so long but everyone seems to have figured life out so much better then me.   I don't know where to start and i'm terrified of change.  I've lived the last 8 years pretty much doing the same thing every day and every day hating it but I don't know how to change. that's not true i know how to change but i don't have the will to see it through.   I've been thinking about killing myself for 10 years  ever since the senior year of high school , probably every day, and i plan different ways and some times i buy supplies but I don't go through with it and i'm just so sick and tired of all the shit.  I'm going to stop now because I hate how i sound right now.  Like some whiny piece of shit.  Fuck it i'm going to post it anyways.
