Hello r/suicideWatch! 

How was your day? I hope all of you had a lovely day. I didn't have such a great day myself. I begin school in two weeks, and I'm trying my best to wake up at a reasonable hour, but it's very difficult for me, as I've had a severe sleep disorder since childhood. This has me very stressed. This is truly wearing down on my mental stability. 

I didn't eat much today. I had 2 cups of moringa green tea this afternoon, then ended up going to Texas Roadhouse and having some delicious food, but I felt a tad bit disappointed in myself. I planned not eating today, but my family is rather suspicious of my poor eating habits. I honestly didn't feel like leaving my room today, but my family would get quite upset with me if I didn't. 

Anyway, I'm very tired; I'm going to make a cup of chamomile tea then get some rest. Maybe tomorrow will be a better day.

Sincerely,

Thomas.
