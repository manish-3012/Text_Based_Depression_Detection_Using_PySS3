just done itSwallowed a few too many propranolol.

Life is fucked. I've been getting told 'things get better' for almost half of my life now. They've never got better, just much worse.

Like ive genuinely lived half of my life wishing i wasn't here, how fucking funny is that ahaha

hopefully i had enough propranolol to get the desired effect

cheers to the people on here trying their best
