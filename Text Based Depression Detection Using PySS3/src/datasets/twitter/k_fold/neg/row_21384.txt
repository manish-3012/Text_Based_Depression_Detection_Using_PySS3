I don't know how much longer I want to keep lying to peopleIt's a lie that I'm going to find a job with my degree. I've started applying, sure, but with no experience, COVID, and the way I just don't understand how to do things by myself, all those four years have been are a waste of $30k and a chance to disappoint everyone around me. I'm going to work in this grocery store until I die.

It's a lie that I'm fine. That I'm just tired. I don't want the people around me to worry. It's not appropriate to talk about this during working hours, I don't have the right relationship with my parents to ask them for help, and I never hang out with anyone. So I bottle up my self-hatred, my anxiety, my suicidal ideation until it comes out in posts like this.

It's a lie that I'm so fucking happy all the time. When I'm around my coworkers, I tell jokes. I smile and shit like that. They like me, at least to my face. But the second I'm alone, all I can think about is all the ways I've fucked up, whether or not other people see them as fuck-ups (and suicide, of course). Video games make me feel... hallow, I guess. My projects die off as I become less motivated to do anything.

It's no effort to lie anymore. It just happens; people think I'm happy. I don't want to keep lying though, since I don't know how long posts like this can put off my inevitable first attempt.

I don't want to keep lying. I don't want to keep living with my parents. I don't want to keep working at a grocery store in the middle of nowhere. I don't want be alone. I don't want to keep hating everything I say, am, and do. But the only way out I see is to kill myself.

I'm scared.
