WeakI've done everything I can, I've poured my heart into this relationship and nothing is good enough.  The train yard is just 5 minutes from here, I could just walk out and bam, that's it.  It's not about sending a message, it's not about anything other than ending this pain I feel every day.  I've swallowed so much, allowed her to hurt me so much, to cheat to continue and I've tried to just be good, to do everything I can to just be there and be a good man, and it blows up in my face constantly.  I'm so weak, I've achieved everything I could, tried so hard, but what's the point anymore, nothing I do matters.  If I died tonight she wouldn't care, wouldn't find out until I was scraped off the train tracks and put into a styrofoam box and melted down.
