No One Cares About MeDoes anyone know how to cope when you know for a fact no one cares about you, just what you can do for them? My family doesn't care when I tell them I'm suicidal or know that I've relapsed and cut myself. My friends also ignore me when I open up and tell them I want to die and see no point in living. The most I get is some bullshit "thats sad :(". People always say they like me and that we should hang out but plans ALWAYS get cancelled or we just talk about making them and they never commit in the first place... then I have to sit through them all talking about them hanging out and how much fucking fun they had together. Or I scroll through my social media feed and see pictures of them all hanging out and having a great time while I sit at home alone. I almost broke down crying the other day because two of my friend groups wouldn't shut the fuck up about how they were all having fun together the same night I was crying myself to sleep and hoping I wouldn't wake up. 

I'm always the person trying to be there for everyone, be that reliable person people want as a friend but I think it's gotten to a point where people only want me to use me. Thats how my family treated me and I know in my gut that I'm just going to live a sad lonely life because I was never important enough for people to get close to so I never got to develop social skills. 

Is just one person who cares about me to much to ask? I just need someone who notices when I joke about hurting myself and tries to be there for me because they see me as a human being and not a thing to use. I'm so lonely if I died tomorrow no one would care.
