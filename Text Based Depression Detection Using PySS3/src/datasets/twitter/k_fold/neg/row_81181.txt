Just numb32 and been out of work for a year. Becoming a financial drain on my family. Father committed suicide a month before I was born. Have fantasized about following him into that unknown for most my life. Truly scared of the outcome. I have attempted twice. The first was mostly alcohol fueled rage and a cry for help. The second time I was a bit more committed to the act but still found a way to fuck it up. The only family of mine that wants anything to do with me is an aunt that pays my rent and her son. I don't blame my family. I have pushed them away. I am ashamed of who I am. All I can think about is if I were to go through with it and get it right this time how much easier it would be on my aunt. She won't stop helping me out of my fucked up failures even after the rest of my family has passed me off as just the family fuck up. I don't know anymore. I am lost in this world. I know where the exit is im just not sure how to step through that door.
