Every day feels exactly the same as every other day. And it's not a good day.I finished a post-grad program last summer and moved to a new city for a job. That company had a big round of layoffs in January. I found another job at a start-up agency a few weeks later but after a big project that's set to wrap in a few weeks there's nothing on my schedule and I'm terrified it'll happen all over again. My industry has been wrecked by COVID and it was already sluggish in the city I live in before that. Perpetual WFH is wretched for my mental health (no boundaries, every day feels the same) but I don't know how I'll cope if I lose this job. I feel like such a huge fucking professional failure that will never overcome these scars on my resume and that will never live up to my potential. I grew up comfortably upper middle class, went to a top 5 university, and I'm so unlikable and unlovable that I managed to fuck it all up and be downwardly mobile. 

And it's not like my personal life is going any better. I'm turning 28 in a month and I've never had a real, long-term relationship. The fragile friend circle I was building up in the new city has collapsed under people leaving for new jobs, to stay with friends &amp; family, etc. and I don't even know how to build a new one under these circumstances. I feel guilty telling any of my older friends how fucking miserable I am because they're all dealing with their own shit. I don't even feel like I can talk to my own family. My grandma has cancer and my mom is acting as her caretaker currently. The last time I tried to talk to my mom about all this, she just said that I'm so negative and impossible to get through to. 

Maybe she's right. But I don't know what to be positive about right now. I wake up, turn on my laptop, do work or wait to get work to do, turn off my laptop, and either get stoned enough to watch a TV show and fall asleep, or feel guilty about getting stoned and cry myself to sleep. I hate existing like this. But I don't know when it will end and I don't know if I can hold on until then.
