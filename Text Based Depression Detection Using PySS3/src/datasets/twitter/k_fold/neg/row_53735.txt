I tried to hang myselfI just need somebody to tell. I felt like I was in a dream since Iâ€™d decided to do it. I came so close; I climbed up on a stool, and it was all unstable beneath me. I started pulling the scarf Iâ€™d tied against my neck, though, and something changed; it was like I woke up. I took it off.

In all of the uncomfortableness of my throat feeling crushed, something I canâ€™t even describe, I realized that I donâ€™t want to die. I just want to exist. I can still feel the ghost of it around my neck, hours later. But Iâ€™m going to be okay. I hope I am.
