How do I have faith in myself?How do I have faith in myself? How do I keep living? I typically rely on other people for my own faith, but that always goes down the drain. Currently im just thinking about death and I have no motivation, all I have is a little hope. So please anyone, help me get out of this fucked up mind state and save me. I just wanna have faith in myself and achieve greatness.
