I don't want to be a copycat suicide but i'm just like him.before this kid I went to school with suicided, we didn't get along that well but i thought we were a lot alike. We had similar body types, false bravados, and loner habits. I know because I saw this person around and I even wore similar clothes. It was annoying. When he killed himself, I was shocked. I thought he was the better version of me. He was more popular, and seemed more responsible. But I guess not.
It's taking me everything not to do the same. I don't want to be them. He's dead and forgotten. i want to be better but I'm depressed and don't think much will help. I'm taking meds and seeing a therapist. I exercise everyday and get a proper amount of sleep. I have dropped out of college but I'm applying to jobs every day. The problem then, is that I am at home the majority of the time. My friends are in school but I'm not sure what to do. I've read just about every self-help article I can find and nothing has helped :( I'm 19 years old and would love to start, something, anything ,that would give me hope or meaning. I just don't see that as a possibility rn...i've told my really supportive parents about my thoughts and they nudge me to keep going. But there's no where to go. I've reached a dead-end literally. It's easy to vent harder to prevent. I'm lost, without friends, hobbies, or goals. Depression has robbed me from these things in a way. anyone know where to go for help (online)? any resources would be great, whether another subreddit or maybe another website that has helped you rise above these thoughts.
Thank you- Jeff
