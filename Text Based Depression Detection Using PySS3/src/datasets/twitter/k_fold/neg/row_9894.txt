Don't know what to doI've been feeling pretty terrible the past few years. Usually it's been on and off, but the past few months have been more consistent. Sometimes I have no reason to feel so down and other times it's a dog pile of shitty experiences. I've watched so much of my life pass me by and I want so badly to fix it but I have no energy to. I want to talk to my family about how I feel but I'm afraid they won't quite understand how I'm feeling. They're wonderful people, they just don't know how to respond to these situations. So now I'm here, posting to this website trying to find anyone who can relate and try to find help for myself. I don't know what else to do but to end things for myself. I have no want-to for anything else but that.
