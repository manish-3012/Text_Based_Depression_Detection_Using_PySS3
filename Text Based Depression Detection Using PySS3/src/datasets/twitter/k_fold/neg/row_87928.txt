Suicidal for last 6 months, not sure if I can take it anymoreThis is my first post to this subreddit. I'm currently 18 years old and attending community college. Everything in life feels pointless, we all die some day and forget everything so whats the point of living? I was diagnosed as bipolar 2 a couple days ago and my family has a strong history of mental illness (bipolar, major depression, schizophrenia). I want to live, I want to get better, but I don't know how much longer I can take the suffering. I was on zoloft for a few months and that didn't help anything. I just started lamictal and seroquel and I'm hoping those will help me get better. I'm not sure what else I can do to get better, nothing that I do feels fun anymore and it feels like I'm living in a fog. It would mean so much to me if you guys could possibly relate and give me some hope that I will get better. Thank you
