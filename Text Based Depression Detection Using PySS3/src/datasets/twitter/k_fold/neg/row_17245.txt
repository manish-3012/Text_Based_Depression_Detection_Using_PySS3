My only friend(and former date) in college just dropped out and I now I'm totally aloneThis might be the straw that breaks my back. 

I've lived through too much pain and trauma. Too many nights spent hiding in my room growing avoiding the yelling, avoiding the haze of stress, avoiding the drugs, avoiding my school work, avoiding my gender dysphoria, avoiding the sheer incompetency of my family during those times, avoiding my autism disability. 

I thought college would change all of that. I thought I would be easily able to connect and find other people that would want to hang out with me. I thought starting off presenting full time MtF would solve my social gender dysphoria. I thought I could begin to live my own life separate of my trauma.

But none of that happened. The only groups I stuck with disbanded or don't meet often enough. All my friends but one(girl mentioned in the title) stopped talking to me or inviting me to do anything. I could hide in my hall for days and no one would notice, care, or check up on me. 
And now that my last friend broke and dropped out of college, the trauma of my old high school life is back in full force. I keep having flashbacks and recreations of the horrible nights where I cried myself to sleep. It's breaking my mind and I want to kill myself soon. God help me.
