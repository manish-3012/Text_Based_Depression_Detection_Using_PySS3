iâ€™m on suicide watchi really wasnâ€™t made for life. i could take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep but honestly iâ€™m just too scared. i donâ€™t want to die in pain. i donâ€™t want to make my mother sad. but i canâ€™t keep doing this itâ€™s too much ive been just getting by for almost twenty years and have made no progress and have accomplished nothing whatsoever. itâ€™s too painful. i loathe myself. subjectively it would be better if i was dead. i contribute nothing LITERALLY nothing i we never had a job i canâ€™t drive i have no talents all i do is lay in bed and be sad god i wish i could just fucking end it
