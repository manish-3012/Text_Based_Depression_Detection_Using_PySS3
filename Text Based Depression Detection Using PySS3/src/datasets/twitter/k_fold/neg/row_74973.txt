I Think I've ODd on RitalinHi I'm panicking right now. I'm really scared. My hearts sore my heads sore my stomachs sore I'm shaking like I have a twitch. I took 4 36 mg tablets today and now I think I've od. I'm 15 and its been like 6 hours since I've had the ritalin. I'm usually on it but only 20mg. Don't know if this belongs here but I really need to know if it's juts an overreaction and if so how do I stop it
