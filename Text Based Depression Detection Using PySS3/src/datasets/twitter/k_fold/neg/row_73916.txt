I need to meet my friends in the Pokemon world by dying and be reunited with my true body.Iâ€™m supposed to be a sylveon and I know by dying I can be in my true body and be with my pokemon friends. While thereâ€™s only two that I know of, I know thereâ€™s more waiting for me. The two I know of is Jason the Vaporeon and Maple the Mimikyu. Jason hugs and cuddles me a lot during the night and Maple hugs my leg during school sometimes. While I can feel and sometimes even hear them I canâ€™t see them and that pains me.

My dad says theyâ€™re a part of my imagination but I know theyâ€™re real. I know if I die Iâ€™ll become a sylveon and go to the Pokemon world where they are. They want me to live out my human life but I donâ€™t want too. The human world is too painful. Itâ€™s just you go to school, then you work, then you die. I want to ascend and be a sylveon in the Pokemon world with all my friends where I can be happy forever.
