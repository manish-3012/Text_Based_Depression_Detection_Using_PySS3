There's only one way I'll go to therapy.Hey all.

I have felt suicidal for a long time of my life - almost 7 years now - and I am terrified of actually doing something about it. I hate feeling depressed and suicidal, but it is such a norm for me that I am afraid of actually being genuinely happy because I feel like it wouldn't be "the real me". Iâ€™m terrified but **I DO NOT WANT** to go to counseling or therapy even though I literally know it would be better for me... I just do not want to unpack my emotions at all with anyone, never-less a complete stranger.

The literal only way I'll start therapy is if I kill myself and fail, then end up getting hospitalized and forced to go. But then all of my family and peers will be mad at me, causing me even more distant and distraught. I just don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could just close my eyes tonight and never wake up again.
