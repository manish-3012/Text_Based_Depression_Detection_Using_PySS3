I could use some conversationI still have okay days, like one a month. I'm starting to think my therapist is right and I could have brain damage. I have wanted to kill myself for all of my teenage and adult life, and it feels like it just moves closer to reality every day.  Lately I've just been feeling overwhelmed with negative emotions, like I'm being stabbed in the heart and stomach.

Like I am being abandoned, heartbroken, and punished for being a freak all at once. And there is no reason, it's just that it's happening now, every pain and trauma I've ever felt being replayed at once every single day. And life isn't even that bad right now. It will get worse, and I will check out. I just don't have the ability to handle any more.
