Ex girlfriend has suicide planned out, made me swear not to tell anyoneWe broke up with my girlfriend today. She suffers from depression, and used to be suicidal. She told me on the phone and via text, that she's "giving up". I tried to talk to her, then she went into detail how it's already planned how she'll end it. She then blocked all my numbers / social media. I knew where she would be tonight, so I confronted her at the train station. We hugged, cried, and talked about it.

She told me all about how she already had her suicide planned out since back in March - already had the meds and everything in the summer, but then we met in July, and she gave up on the idea, going as far as throwing away the meds. But now that I'm gone, she has no reason to live for again, and is going to get some meds / poisonous plant, and off herself. She made the decision back then, and now she is just following through with it. 

She says that her entire life was nothing but failures and shitty relationships (used to be in an abusive relationship before we met), she failed at her career, her relationships etc. I tried telling her how important she is to me, her family, her friends, that it's not a solution, to seek help, everything I could think of, but she was having none of it. She told me it's not my fault, she had this planned already, and she loves me and is thankful for me showing her true love. 

I am the only person who knows about it, and she asked me to swear I'd not let anyone else know about it. Problem is, even if I wanted to, I don't have any of her friends' or parents' contacts. She doesn't have a facebook or twitter or instagram so I can't find them there.

I'm really scared for her, and don't know what to do. I tried calling suicide hotlines but most of them weren't picking up at this hour, and the one that did didn't speak english. Only way I could reach her now is if I were to go to her apartment.

Please help.
