22 years of abuse have broken my last little will to live.I'm living with my dad. He's abused me physically since I can remember. Or rather, from what I still remember, because I suffer from amnesia due to the severe trauma.

I've been everywhere, but no one wants to help me get out of here. Everyone has failed, child protection services, the police... It's like everyone just expects me to keep withstanding the abuse. But I can't. I might be able to withstand it physically, but not mentally.

All that abuse has given me a whole slew of unidentified mental issues which will likely prevent me from ever finding employment. I'm barely even able to sustain myself and need to have my food served by relatives because I completely lack any sort of life skills.

I don't have any friends anymore so it's not like anyone will miss me if I decide to leave forever. I mean, no one even wished me a happy birthday, not even my relatives. Heck, they'd probably throw a party if they found out I'm finally gone. Yes, me, that unwanted sorry failure of a family member.

I'm just sitting here, crying endlessly, and... well... it's over. I've given life a reasonable attempt, but I failed...
