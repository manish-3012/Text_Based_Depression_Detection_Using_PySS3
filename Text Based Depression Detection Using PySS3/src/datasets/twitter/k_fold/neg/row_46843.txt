Eaten aliveIt's 5 AM and I feel hopeless. I don't see the purpose in life. I no longer have any motivation that makes me want to keep trying to push forward. I'm wide awake at 5AM because my anxiety keeps eating me alive. There's no one to talk to. I don't even know why I'm typing this. I'll just end this off by saying that my most calming thoughts are thoughts of death, to be dead would mean to no longer be depressed or anxious.
