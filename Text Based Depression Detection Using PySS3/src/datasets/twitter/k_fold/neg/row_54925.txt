I took a bath today and went to school after about a monthI missed school for a month due to my depression. I did nothing this month, clearly nothing. I have wasted a month of my life sleeping or attempting to hang myself. I went to school today and to be honest it was good. Everything seems good when you cut yourself off from toxic people. Thank you, the kind people of this sub for giving me support in a much needed phase. I have learnt an unexplainable lesson.
