I canâ€™t do it anymoreOver the course of the last 4 months I have made so many bad decisions. I donâ€™t know why, but Iâ€™ve lost all impulse control. I just do stupid things and I regret it immediately.

On Monday I made a really dumb decision to lie to someone I considered to be one of my closest friends. I did it to get attention so I made up a crazy story. I guess I wanted someone to feel bad for me. It was dumb. I told her I lied yesterday and I can almost guarantee I will never  hear back from her again. 

I canâ€™t live with myself any more
