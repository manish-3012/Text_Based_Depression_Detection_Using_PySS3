I haven't felt like a failure in quite a while.. I knew I wasn't good enough for anything. (warning, long)I got my first job back in may, nothing fancy, just a cashier at a big chain hardware store, but was a big step for me moving forward with my life and starting to actually be an adult. 
My mother has finally started to treat me like a person, I finally hate myself just a little bit less, I am starting to feel like maybe I deserve to be with the person I'm with (he's a very motivated college student where I was an anxiety ridden unemployed emotional wreck). 
Well, it's been almost 5 months now and things seemed alright. There's still a couple things I haven't quite gotten down yet (because I don't deal with them too often) but it didn't seem like it was having a huge impact on my ability to do my job. 
Well, I noticed on my schedule that my hours are starting to drop. Just a little but that hour makes a difference when you're part time. 
I thought nothing of it, I was already warned that hours drop a bit once the cooler months hit, but I think I'm the only one... 
And it's starting to make me think they want me to quit... 
Because I'm too stupid to keep a goddamn job this simple... 
I am a complete fucking failure and its been a long time since I've felt like killing myself this badly....
