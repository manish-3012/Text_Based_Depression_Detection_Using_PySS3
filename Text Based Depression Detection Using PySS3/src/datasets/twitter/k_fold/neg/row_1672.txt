I tried to kill myself tonight and it wouldnâ€™t work.I wrapped a neck-tie around my neck. I tried to knot it to my clothes rack in my closet but it couldnâ€™t support my weight and broke. I couldnâ€™t find anything else to support me so I just have up. 

Im just going to try to go to sleep and hopefully I donâ€™t wake up and want to try this again later. 

Peace. You donâ€™t have to worry about me
