I'm thinking of ending everything tonight.I'm a 17 year old guy who is fucking miserable and tried of life. 

There's probably about one person who actually gives a shit about me but she has a great support system so she can make it through all of the grief. 

I have never had a job and no one will hire me. I have no applicable skills in the real world and I'm too depressed and anxious to deal with the stress of post secondary schooling. I'm nearly 18 and I'm not anywhere near having a car, job, or even my own place. The only notable thing about my life is the fact that I had straight A's in elementary school. 

My parents think I'm a useless bastard, my siblings hate me, my best friend has abandoned me, and no one around me gives a shit if I live or die. 

I'll never be able to be the man I want to be.
