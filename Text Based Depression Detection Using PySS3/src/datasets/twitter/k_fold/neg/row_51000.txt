I feel... HollowI think the best way to describe what I'm going through right now is the word hollow. I'm not in pain, I'm not sad, I'm mad sometimes but only in short out bursts (mostly at myself). I'm barely excited about anything and the only thing that makes me really happy anymore (writing songs) which is the hardest thing for me too do because it means I need to dig up those emotions and use them.


I'm not really sure why I'm writing this now, I kinda just need to vent after two weeks of shit worthless exams that don't even matter because whatever grade I get it's meaningless if I'll never grow up


I've never being to a therapist so I'm not sure if I'm really depressed or just have the edge teen syndrome, I'm pretty sure I have something wrong with me since about 8 months ago I started having problems breathing and I almost passed out once because I couldn't get enough oxygen into my brain.


I guess I'm just looking for some answers:


What mental illness can cause a person lungs to not work correctly? (I've been to the doctor but he says my oxygen percentage in my blood is 98%, meaning I supposedly have nothing wrong with me)


Am I really just not "special" at all and we all go through this shit? Am I just an edgy teen or do I have something wrong with me and I need to get treatment

If my life goes nowhere and my only passion lies in the music industry which is almost impossible to break into than what's the point in living?


I'm sure this won't get much attention so if you took your time to read my shitty rant and have any answers for my questions than please reply. I've been struggling with those questions for a long time so I don't suppose y'all have the answers for them but it's still worth a try right?
