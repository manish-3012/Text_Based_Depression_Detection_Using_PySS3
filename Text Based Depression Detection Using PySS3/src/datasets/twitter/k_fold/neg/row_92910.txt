The painâ€™s too much, Iâ€™ve come up with a planIâ€™m trying to fight but Iâ€™m finding it hopeless and slowly wanting to give up 

I donâ€™t want to call a help line right now cos I feel so lifeless and numb already I donâ€™t want to talk to anyone

I want to live for my niece but I feel like I canâ€™t cope with pain anymore I donâ€™t know what to do but the thought of going through with my plan makes me nervous but puts me at ease..
