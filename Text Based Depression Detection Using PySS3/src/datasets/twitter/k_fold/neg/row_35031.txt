Suicidal thoughts, partner doesnâ€™t support me or maybe is also suicidalHi,

Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and suicidal thoughts on and off since I was a teenager. The loss of my job, two parents, and being cooped up from being high risk for COVID is not helping. Iâ€™m trying to get help and dealing with insurance issues. I feel like it is taking every bit of energy I have to get help and to fight suicidal thoughts all day with nothing to distract me. 

My husband has also said he wanted to kill himself during our last 2 arguments and I called 911 before but he said he would do it before they came so I told them never mind and talked him down myself. He scares me and makes me feel worse about myself, I almost feel like he takes it personally and if I tell him I feel suicidal he will tell me â€œIâ€™ll just leave forever thenâ€ and walk out the door. 

This makes me feel anxious and then his needs become the priority. If he is actually suicidal then I told him I can listen and he also needs to try to get therapy. Iâ€™m just so exhausted and I need someone to give me a hug or something. Right now he walked out (again) because Iâ€™ve had a tough day and didnâ€™t get off the couch. 

We moved away from all my family and friends 2 years ago to be with his. Iâ€™m just so sad everyday and donâ€™t know how to fix things without thinking about if I killed myself it would be easier. Idk Iâ€™m so sad.
