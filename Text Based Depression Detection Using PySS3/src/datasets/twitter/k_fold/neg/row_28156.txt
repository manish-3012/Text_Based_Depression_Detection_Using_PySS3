I just feel like I'm done.I don't have a job and I live in a house that is owned by my parents. I'm a useless piece of shit that just sleeps until the afternoon when I can get drunk enough to forget about how shitty I feel and eat a ton of horrible food to feel some kind of gluttoneous kind of joy. I mean I'm a 21 year old unemployed drunk with no friends. Who really gives a fuck about me? Things will go on.
