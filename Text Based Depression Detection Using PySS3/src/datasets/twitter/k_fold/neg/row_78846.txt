I feel like I'm drowningI feel horrible. I've got some friends who hear me out when I need to talk about my problems. I've been going to a therapist for the past 5 weeks. I've talked about what's been wrong with my life from my perspective and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I want it all to stop.

I'm not looking for a solution anymore. I don't think there is one. I probably won't kill myself, because I don't want to hurt the people who care about me. I just don't want to live anymore. I really don't.
