Today was a great day.I feel like I've just had 20 different "acts of God" happen to me. Some good, some bad. I'm 16. My life isn't as bad as others. For instance, I've always been loved by my family, except for them being alcoholics. I didn't really feel suicidal until this year. One of my good friends killed himself on May 8th. I was devastated. He told me not to do it. Blake was 18 and he had already tried once, but the gun jammed. He told me he was so happy it did because it was an eye opener. He was doing so well. He would've graduated less than 2 weeks later. It made me realize how real death is. I constantly have existential crises, almost to the point of me killing *myself* to make it stop. I started thinking about how shitty this world is. 

Then, a month later, XXXTENTACION was killed. He was a light in the darkness for me, as he was for a lot of people. Reading people say how it was a good thing he was killed made me sick to my stomach; how could you say that about another *human, especially one who was turning his life around.* My best friend Dylan has constantly been there for me. He was a bigger X fan through me, and had been going through worse things than me.

Now, I have so many close friends it's weird. I used to be a loner, but I'm popular now. Another one of my friends, Cooper, is sad. We got drunk at a friend's and he cheated on his girlfriend. He beats himself up about it, almost to the point where I'm scared for him. He's doing bettet now though. We're so close I almost consider him a brother.

Sorry for rambling, I'll get to the point.

I woke up on time for school, and I live 21 miles from school. I went back to sleep because I didn't want to disturb my brother, who I live with's cat, Pickles. She is normally very independent, but she was laying on my chest. I woke up around 9 (2 hours late) and she was gone. My brother was calling, and not wanting to get reamed, I ignored it and went to school. I now have an hour and a half of detention. This put me in a bad mood, so I went and talked to my mom. Afterwards, I got to thinking, and realised I have multiple reasons to live.

Reason 1: **My mom.** She may be a drunk, but goddammit if she doesn't love me more than life itself. She told me that if I were to go through with it, she'd drink herself to death. I don't want her to hurt herself because of me.

Reason 2:** My friends.** Dylan and Cooper have been so supportive and nice to me I couldn't hurt them like that. I have so many people rooting for me it's almost confusing.

Reason 3: **Pathology.** I'm absolutely fascinated with Biology. Life Science makes my world go round. I realized that even if I hate myself, I might be the person to cure cancer, and stop so many others from hurting from losing loved ones. I just love making other people happy.

This put me into a better mood. Then, to my surprise, I laid down on our couch, and guess who was waiting for me? Yup. Shes laying in my lap purring. I love animals almost more than people. Actually, they're equal. I still kind of hope for a tire to blow while I'm going 80, but it won't be ***me*** who delivers the final blow goddammit. To the people on /r/ SuicideWatch who are thinking of it: please don't. Don't let your mind win. It may sound corny but I love each and every single one of you. There is light in the darkness my friends, and it's you. So please, ***keep on shining.*** Thank you.
