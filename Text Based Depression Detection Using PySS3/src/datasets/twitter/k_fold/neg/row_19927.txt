Tonight one of my friends told me Iâ€™m not trying hard enough.Iâ€™m not trying hard enough at work. Or at school. 
Thatâ€™s my life in general. Work, school. Repeat. 
She was upset. We carpool, so I asked her why she was being so quiet. She explained she was mad because I constantly put myself down for doing my job wrong, even though she thinks Iâ€™m doing it just fine. And because I think Iâ€™m doing my job wrong, I donâ€™t try hard enough to be better at it. She said Iâ€™m not trying hard enough. I asked her if she meant just in work or at school. She said both. We talk about school a lot. Iâ€™ve mostly complained about how I never turn stuff in. I donâ€™t. I didnâ€™t see a reason to. I talked about dropping out. Joking, mostly. But Iâ€™m nearly passing all my classes now , I told her today. I was tired driving with her to work. I was tired going out of work. I just wanted to get food with her and go home. But then she said Iâ€™m not trying hard enough. 
At first I was angry. because she wasnâ€™t concerned with my lack of willingness to do things, she was angry with me for not doing them. Then I was-I AM- sad. Really fucking sad. Because sheâ€™s right. I donâ€™t try. Iâ€™ve never wanted to try. I am a lazy, stupid, unwilling person. Iâ€™ve never tried at school. I never applied to any university or college. I only went to community college to please my parents. Iâ€™ve never had a goal. A dream. An idea of what I wanted to do with my life. Because Iâ€™ve been trying to convince myself for almost 18 fucking years that my life is worth living. 18 years Iâ€™ve been trying. So. Goddamn. Hard. To find a reason to live. I still havenâ€™t found one. Iâ€™m only here because I love my family. One of my siblings died when I was little. It almost killed my parents out of grief. And if I took my own life, Iâ€™m 100% sure they would take their own. So I donâ€™t. Iâ€™m still here. I donâ€™t want to be. Iâ€™m trying. 
But itâ€™s not enough. 
Sorry if this didnâ€™t make any sense. Just rambling.
