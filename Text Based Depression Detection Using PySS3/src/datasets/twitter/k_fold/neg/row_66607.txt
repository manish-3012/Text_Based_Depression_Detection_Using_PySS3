Snapping back and forth from realityI am snapping back and forth from reality. 

It's been six months ever since I got everything I needed to move out, find a job, and study. So far I have managed to achieve none of those things. 

Now I am running out of time. I only have 6 other months left. And it's just....

I spend most of my time doing nothing in my bedroom....I suddenly get a panic attack and realize that I have to do this and that then revert to distract myself with political and historical trivia that is unimportant or video games that I no loanger enjoy 

I am oscillating between being numb and severe anxiety. 

I felt serenity when I went out shopping yesterday. It was lovely but temporary....I need to face my issues if I wanna stay calm

I miss doing things...just hanging out, doing my hobbies, meeting people, feeling alive...now my mind is just filled with noise and I feel like the life has been sucked out of me. 

I eat, sleep, shower and argue with people on the internet. I do it on repeat, and just....why can't I do things normally? Why is everything so cyclical and why am I hiding in my comfort zone?

It's like I am prohibiting myself from living life with all my imagined fears. I have the tools but I keep shaking and wavering. 

But it's so hard. And I have no one....no one in my life to talk to. Just me and the roar of my worn out laptop's fan that has lived far longer than it should have.....just like me
 
Sometimes I wish I was normal and just did what I had to do and had people cheering on me. But I am not normal... and I either live with it or die....maybe most people are not normal....

I just want time to stop. Life is moving too fast. The months are short and the days are long. Please stop. 

Hide me in a dark room.....

God please let me do something tomorrow ðŸ’œ
