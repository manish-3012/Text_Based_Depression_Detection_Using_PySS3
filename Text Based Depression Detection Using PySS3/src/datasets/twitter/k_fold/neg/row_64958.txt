I can't handle this anymore.I'm a NEET married to a retired spouse who's supporting both of us. I don't want to be a burden on them anymore, but I don't know what I want to do. I want to go back to college and get a licensed nurse certificate but I don't think that's possible anymore at age 33. I want to learn a skilled trade and not be a NEET anymore, but I'm afraid they'll laugh me out of the admissions office or not take me seriously. Even worse, what if I somehow manage to get a degree/certificate and I still can't get a job?

Also the political climate of the USA is very distressing. Either way you slice it, we're all screwed. Also if either myself or my spouse catch 'rona, either of us are as good as dead. Is it even possible for me to go back to college during this pandemic? 

It's been on my mind for a while but I can't handle this anxiety anymore. Maybe it's better to just quit and die. maybe in the next life I'll be smarter about my life choices.
