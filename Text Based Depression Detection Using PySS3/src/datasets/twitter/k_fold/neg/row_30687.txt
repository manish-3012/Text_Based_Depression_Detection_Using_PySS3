Are there REASONS people want to keep living or is it just instinctual?I've always thought of it very much as a positive-negative balance and a person wants to live if they're on the positive side of that equation.

But maybe it's not like that.  Maybe there's an irrational desire to live in the same way there's an irrational desire to eat or have sex or whatever.  If that's true, I'm a lot more fucked up than I thought.

  I've been on a couple of antidepressants that haven't done anything for me.  But for people who they HAVE worked for, did it give you back something akin to your appetite or sexual desire or whatever?
