Im ready.I dont wanna die. I have a little but nice house, and an amazing wife and good family.  I've had chronic pain, caused by several medical issues for over a decade. I'm done and ready to go. 

1. Doctors fucking suck, they are smug fucking pieces of human trash that think they know better because just they have an extra piece of paper, and if you present them with hard facts contradicting them, they shut down and refuse to help in any way. 

2. Humanity fucking sucks. Everywhere you go, people are assholes, looking only out for themselves and how they can take advantage of everyone else, or tear you down so they dont have to acknowledge their own insecurities, or what they can get from you.. and only care about acquiring power or wealth. When it boils down to it, we are nothing but mammals and anything we do will never matter in the end, other than humanity will eventually destroy itself and this world. No one cares about anything other than themselves. Yeah there's good people in the world, nothing they do to help change things will ever matter either because there is FAR more bad than good. We all deserve to die and be forgotten.

3. Yeah I've got a great home life but I am in so much physical pain every day. I have been to dozens of doctors, had dozens of major surgeries, with more to come. I have no fight anymore.

4. Bad things always happen to the best people. We've all had good friends die, we all struggle, life is only suffering, what's the fucking point?? Even if you work hard, lose weight, be kind to everyone, and give everything you have to help others, it doesn't matter, you ARE no matter what you do, have needless suffering, pain of all kinds, and you will die and turn to dust. It's pointless.

I'm done with this world. I don't think I have the balls to go thru with it, but checking out is looking better and better every day. When my time comes, I will not be sad.
