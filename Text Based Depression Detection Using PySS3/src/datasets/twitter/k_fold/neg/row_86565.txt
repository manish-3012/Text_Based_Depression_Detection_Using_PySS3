Does anyone else equate success to happiness?My version of sucess is to earn a livable wage working a job I enjoy. 
I had the goal of being successful before  I hit my mid 20s but to be honest I've failed at the basic tasks of being an adult, I'm broke and essentially homeless at this point.  
(Not asking for pity, just explaing my circumstances)


I feel totally and utterly broken and a failure. I try to improve certain aspects of my life but it only gets worse. Why bother continuing and wasting space on this earth?

 I've also had severe depression and anxiety since I was a child,  so even if magically my circumstances improved, I doubt my mental health ever will. 

Does anyone else feel similar?
