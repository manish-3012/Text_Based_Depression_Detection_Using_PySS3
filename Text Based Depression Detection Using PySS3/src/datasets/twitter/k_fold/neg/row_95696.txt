48 hoursI was never meant to get past this point in my life, and now i have the materials to hang myself. Im sure my dead body will hold. Being a single, short man in the city is getting to be too much for me. Especially how much pressure men get for being good with women, if women ever made the decision to talk to me that is. I guess i wasn't supposed to get passed being desperate for a gf or a distraction even.
