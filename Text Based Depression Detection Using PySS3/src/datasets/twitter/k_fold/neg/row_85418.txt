May 5thIâ€™m terrified of that date. Thatâ€™s the day after my sisterâ€™s wedding. After her wedding, Iâ€™ll have truly nothing left to live for. Nothing to focus and hold on to. Iâ€™m not working towards anything. Iâ€™m not â€œbuildingâ€ anything. I fell in love for nothing. Wasted my time. Hell, Iâ€™ve wasted my life. Iâ€™m the child of a closet gay man who has since shut out his children. I feel more like an abomination every day. A lot of people love and care for me, but not in the way I want. Thereâ€™s no point anymore. Iâ€™m just a heartbroken void of a guy who is only living for the immediate with the occasional future events to latch onto like Endgame and my sisterâ€™s wedding since Iâ€™m walking her down the aisle since our dad is out of the picture. Oh well. 

Yours,
