Passively suicidalI'm not actively seeking death, but if a car were to hit me or I died suddenly for whatever reason I wouldn't mind at all and would probably welcome it, so long as the death isn't too painful (not like I could change that if it happened tho.)

I'm content with wasting away in this basement for the rest of my life, and have absolutely no aspirations or desires to have aspirations for anything in life. Psychosis and medications have fucked me over beyond repair, cognitively and emotionally. Idc anymore.

Male virgin at 19 and I never even tried to get a gf or get laid in my life, never cared to, don't care to now. Don't feel attached to anyone in my life either, haven't felt love or loved by anyone since I was 12. I'm literally  dead inside and have been since very early adulthood.
