First New Years alone in a long time, might be the lastItâ€™s been a shit storm with nothing but everyone leaving me and my suicidal thoughts, Iâ€™ve tried so many times to reach out but after a while they just canâ€™t handle me nor my mental illness. At this point Iâ€™m exhausted, like both physically and mentally exhausted. Iâ€™ve mixed up some sleeping pills with other medications I have and I highly doubt itâ€™s gonna kill me but at least itâ€™ll make sleep through the fireworks. Iâ€™m still not recovered from my last suicide attempt but I just might go on with it again once I wake up. Happy New Years guys.
