All because I'm short.I can't take it anymore. All I ever think about is my height. The fact that I'm below-average for an American male and that makes me a "manlet" and a "subhuman" makes me want to kill myself. I've read so much shit online that whatever semblance of self-esteem I used to have has died long ago. I don't even bother trying to flirt with women anymore because I know my 5'7" stature will make me a fucking joke to them. I'm just a goddamn manlet who will make less money than tall men, be less intelligent than tall men, have less romantic prospects than tall men, and be seen as more of a joke than any man. I keep hoping that there's some reason to keep living, but then I remember how abysmally short I am and that is every nail on the coffin I'll ever need to make my life not worth it. I don't even know why I get up in the morning anymore, since my height dooms me to second-rate existence.
