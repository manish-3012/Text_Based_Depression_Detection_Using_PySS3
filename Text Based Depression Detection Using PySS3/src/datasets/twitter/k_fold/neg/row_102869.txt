SleepingI honestly want to take a bunch of sleeping pills and not wake up. Pretty sure I've posted this before, but tonight would honestly be the best night to do it. My partner is drinking loads, and since I'm a lightweight, I think taking just a few more than needed might just make me overdose. Partner has barely checked up on me since I've been hiding in the bedroom all day because of depression. If they come in here drunk asf to sleep, I don't think they'll notice I've taken too much, till of course it's too late. My partner has no idea how bad my depression has gotten, to the point I just wanna die
