angry about everythingI've been so fucking irrationally angry with everything to go minutely wrong. Occasionally I blame it on others, but deep down, I know I'll eventually just absorb the blame and borderline mentally abuse myself for whatever happened or didn't happen. I don't know why I do this. Maybe because I can't stand trying to be mad at somebody else when I know that I am the only one I'll ever hate so much. Maybe because it feels like a well-deserved punishment for a crime I'll never remember. Maybe because I'm trying to allow myself to react like a real person but I can't even do that right. Maybe I'm right to be angry -- with my family for never listening, with my friends for never noticing, but mostly with myself for never saying a goddamn thing and fucking everything up in every single way. 

I don't know. I can't be so agitated anymore but I don't know what it's like not to be, and how to not use everything in the world as ammunition for my own potent self-hatred. I'm sad and stuck and so so close to just trying to kill myself a third time.
