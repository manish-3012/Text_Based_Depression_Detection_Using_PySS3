Iâ€™ve totaled 2 cars in the last 7 days. Family hates me. But I want it to look like an accidentIdk if this is the right subreddit for this, but Iâ€™ve just erased all my savings in the last week, had to borrow my dads car after the first wreck (not my fault, but who cares) and I wrecked his car too (slipped on rainy road)

Iâ€™ve never had many friends, and Iâ€™m probably gonna have to stop eating for a few weeks to get some money back into my pocket

Idk how Iâ€™m gonna get to work tho, itâ€™s not like I can just go and buy a new car.
