looking for some guidance.Hey, I'm a guy from Sweden who is thinking sometimes to suicide. I have not had too bad life, good friends and good family. The thing is that I always fail those who are around me and myself, I failed school overall after several times of promises to my teachers and my family. My mother asks herself how she could have raised me in a different way and crying for my failures. I know it's no big deal when compared to how hard other people have, but I can not see myself in a future where I will not fail with everything I do, even though I want to work hard and succeed in my studies, I will hide away my ambitions and flees to another world. I feel like a little fucking kid who refuses to eat their vegetables and even how much I want to eat the vegetables to reach dessert, I can not do it.

Anyone have a tip or two that can help me?
