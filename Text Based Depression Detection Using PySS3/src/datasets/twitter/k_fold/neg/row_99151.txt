I feel as if my heart got shredded in a blenderGenerally I feel down because I am totally alone. I have also suffered from a major depressive episode from May 2018 to April 2019. 2 weeks ago I was on a wedding where I met this first-cousin-once-removed. Absolutely gorgeous. I know it is family (though distant) but still I felt some spark ignite in me. Today I had another wedding and as the party went on, one of my cousins took her outside and they spent all their time together. I didnt want to know if they did any intimate things as I felt I got a sledgehammer to my face and it would make me nuts.

Without further ado - I felt terrible, like a piece of trash before. Now since a couple of hours after the wedding - like a total disaster without the will to live. I feel I'm losing in the game of life. Please help me, I'm on the edge right now.
