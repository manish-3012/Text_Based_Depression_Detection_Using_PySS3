I don't know why I should care anymore.I give up.  I feel so alone.  College is just a disaster.  I have no idea why I'm even going, it's easy enough to spit out the stuff we're supposed to learn on exams but I don't know why I'm there.  I can honestly say that, since I started, I've only made one friend, and even he hates me now.  I hate my job.  I've worked there for years and nothing has changed.  I'm fucking sick of getting yelled at for things that aren't my fault and my supervisors being morons.  And I hate my boyfriend but I know he's the best I'll ever do so I put up with him.  The worst part is I know I'll never actually be able to do anything.  Even deciding where to eat lunch seems to be too much of a decision for me.  I hate people.  All I do in my spare time is reddit because I have no idea how to actually talk to people.  I just hate everything right now...
