Iâ€™m tired of fighting.Seems like for a lot of people, peace and happiness come so easily. Iâ€™ve been fighting my whole life to feel just a drop of happiness, but they never last. I just donâ€™t want to do it anymore. I thought after my last attempt failed, Iâ€™d never try again because that mustâ€™ve been a sign that things would get better, right? Well, years later, theyâ€™re definitely not better. Iâ€™ve tried picking up old hobbies recently, lots of different ones, but they all feel stale and empty. I feel stale and empty. Iâ€™ve asked for help. Iâ€™ve asked for people to care. They just donâ€™t. And Iâ€™m tired of having to fight for it. If I donâ€™t want to be here anymore, and the people I thought cared about me donâ€™t want me to be here anymore... then what am I but a waste of space and resources better suited for someone else. I know someone I care for deeply is aware of my Reddit account, but Iâ€™m hoping they wonâ€™t stumble across this. But just in case he does, just know this isnâ€™t your fault. Iâ€™m just beyond repair.

I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m going to do it tonight. But I feel it coming. Iâ€™m just so tired. I canâ€™t fight anymore I just donâ€™t have it in me. I feel like a nuisance all the time, especially when I start feeling like this because I have the urge to tell them how Iâ€™m feeling but then I get brushed aside and ignored. When I need them most Iâ€™m put on the back burner. But really, how can I expect them to love me if Iâ€™ve never been able to love myself, right? Isnâ€™t that how that works? Whatever. It wonâ€™t matter in the end anyway. Iâ€™ll solve the problem that is me the only way I know how to.
