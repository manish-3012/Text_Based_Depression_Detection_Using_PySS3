Why am I unlovable?I posted last week about my person not being able to handle me. It turns out he met someone else and was using her to hurt me. Iâ€™m trying so hard not to let a man break me. Iâ€™m a Christian. The Bible tells me to forgive. But how could you see someone at their lowest and just pile on? He deserves happiness. He does. But couldnâ€™t he wait a little while... I feel so fucking unlovable dude. Like my weight is dropping. Iâ€™m always hungry but too nauseous to eat. Iâ€™m so sad it hurts. I cry everyday. All day most days. Iâ€™m on anti depressants. Iâ€™m in therapy. Iâ€™m taking the necessary steps. Iâ€™m just not lovable, and a human without love is a shell and broken mess. IDK man...
