My friend wants to kill herself, how can I help her?A little bit of a backstory, if it helps:

She's adopted, hates her parents. They aren't very supportive. Her birth mom died recently and she doesn't see the rest of her family much. She cuts herself, this is a little over the second year now. She has a forced therapist, but she doesn't talk to her seriouisly about problems. Doesn't really have many friends, trust issues, bipolarish, and is just really depressed in general. She tried once so far (to my knowledge) with a knife, stopped when her brother ran in her room. How can I help her?
