I donâ€™t want to be alive anymore19f depression for years, the world is awful and I canâ€™t imagine myself living a good life.  Both my parents are pretty bad people, my father has never known my birthday and heâ€™s so racist and cruel that can i cant stand to be around him but since the divorce i know heâ€™s been lonely.  Recently he just made the decision to have a child with the woman he cheated on my mother with, this woman hates my brother and I and we were banned from attending their wedding.  I sent him a Happy Thanksgiving texts and I got nothing back.  When my mother heard the news she broke down and i had to babysit her again, both parents are alcoholics but since Iâ€™ve lived with my mother my whole life Ive had to deal with it since middle school.  My stress levels are so bad that my hair is falling out in clumps.  I live at home and attend online community college and i donâ€™t leave my house for weeks at a time.  I just donâ€™t want to keep existing anymore, Iâ€™m sure my friends love me and it â€˜will get betterâ€™ but I canâ€™t wait that long, I donâ€™t want to be here anymore I just cant take it.  I already have a stash of hydrocodone and broken glass that Iâ€™ve used for self harm.  Before this I would just use sex to cheer me up but now Everything in my life is numb and grey or it just hurts, there is nothing to look forward too in my life but pain and i donâ€™t want it anymore
