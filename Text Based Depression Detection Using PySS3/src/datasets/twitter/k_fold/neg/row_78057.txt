WhyWhy do parents invalidate your hurt after they themselves are the ones who caused it? It's like I say sorry (because I do) whenever I fail and hurt them but when they are the one who say hurtful things they don't apologize and just say stop it. I feel like what I'm feeling right now is not valid and that something is wrong with me for even crying and feeling this way...
