I donâ€™t get how Iâ€™m still hereI feel so worn out and I just donâ€™t know what to do at this point. This past year has beat the shit out of me. August-September eased up on me a little bit, but I feel like Iâ€™m spiraling fast again. Iâ€™m not gonna get into some of the worse things that have happened to me in the past year that either made me come close to attempting or made the desire to attempt unbearable, but more recently itâ€™s been my school work thatâ€™s driving me over the edge. I have so much work and I just canâ€™t keep up, I have no motivation but Iâ€™m terrified of failing and I have so much responsibility and so many expectations put on me just cuz Iâ€™m â€œgifted.â€ I feel so stressed from all my work that I feel physically sick and Iâ€™m panicky all the time and itâ€™s getting so hard to handle. Even though school has always stressed me out I never thought that school would be what drives me to kill myself. I really feel like Iâ€™m about to lose it, I canâ€™t take all the pressure anymore. Iâ€™d rather die than fail a class or have to do anymore work.
