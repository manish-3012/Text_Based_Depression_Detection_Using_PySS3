Over thinker....I feel like this might be petty to others I just keep over thinking my life and how it's been as of late ,I had this amazing gf a while back we broke up on mutual terms because she was going through alot but it was  Through text that we broke up we are still friends but it kind of added on to my depression my job well it was fun and then it went to hell , I feel as tho my friends and family are so far from me but there are close when I use 2 hang out with one of my bestfreinds she would tell me don't give that face aggg ....sorry I was just thinking about to much and it shows in my face....what I'm saying it I feel like it would be easier to end it all from day to day but I think of the impact it would do to the ppl around me
