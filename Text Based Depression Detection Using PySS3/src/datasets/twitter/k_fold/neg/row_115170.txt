College Student, Senior year, living alone and thinking about killing myself.I can't rewind the past, living just seems so difficult now. It was just one specific class! I keep telling myself this, but it all seems so far away now that I fucked it all up. I feel ashamed, I got nothing after this if it all goes down the drain, I don't want to go back to living paycheck to paycheck, or being on welfare, and worrying about whether or not I'm going to have a place to rest my head. I can't go back to living with my mother, I'll just become NEET again, a fucking NEET... I did that for 4 fucking years, I don't want to do that again, I can't live my life knowing that I'm a fucking loser. My friends... I guess I don't have friends anymore really, they don't even visit me, or ask how I'm doing. I even had a girlfriend back in September, but I watched her go from being my girlfriend, into a full blown paranoid schizophrenic phase, and it all went down hill from there. No matter how hard I tried to be there for her, it just wasn't enough, I had to leave her and it hurt so much because I watched her just fall apart... 

I just wanna say fuck it all to hell, but I'm here... Typing this.
