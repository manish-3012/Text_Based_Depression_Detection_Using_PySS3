I wish I succeededThough not my first attempt, a few months back I contemplated and attempted suicide once again.

I reader that point where I loved nothing, and nothing loved me. I had burned every bridge I had to everybody I know, and had nothing to look forward to in life. Essentially, I would've died with no unfinished business or regret, so I could die "at peace".

Now things are just as bad, but there are things holding me back. People I love would be greatly impacted, and promises I've made would be unfulfilled. 

I just with I died that night. It would have been perfect. I had said goodbye to everything, wrote suicide notes, had everything planned. Then one things goes wrong and now I'm still here suffering.
