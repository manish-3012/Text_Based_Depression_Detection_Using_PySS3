I tried killing myself a month ago for the wrong reasons in the heat of the moment, today I think was the breaking point.I think I'm going to take my life on my birthday next month, if i do it right no one will find my body so no one will be traumatized, my family and newly ex gf wouldn't know I was gone for atleast one week. They think I'm planning on running away anyways but i think it is time you know?
