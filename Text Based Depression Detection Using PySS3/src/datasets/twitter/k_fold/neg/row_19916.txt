Letter to myselfDear self,

I hate you. I hate you so much I have thought of so many ways that Iâ€™ve wanted to die. Why are you so stupid and do the same things over and over thinking you were actually going to change? Youâ€™re parents think of you as a disappointment and an embarrassment, they have said it so many times before Iâ€™ve practically become numb to those words. So many people have tried to reach out, but you tell them you were fine.

Obviously, you werenâ€™t.

So why didnâ€™t you accept it? Because you didnâ€™t want to burden them? No itâ€™s because you want to have a good image of yourself. You want others to believe that you have everything under control, stupid as that sounds. Why couldnâ€™t you have just done your work and done everything correctly? You shouldâ€™ve just done everything from the start. Look at your brothers, they have everything under control and have a great life ahead of them. You always get compared to them because theyâ€™re far more smarter, better looking, and overall superior than you. You shouldnâ€™t have been born into the family, you were a mistake. The reason why mom and dad fight is always because of you. Do you enjoy messing up peopleâ€™s lives? Why are you still here? Do everyone a favor and leave. I hate you. I hate you so much.

Die.
