Planning to off myself in about a month, AMAA couple of weeks ago, I lost my job, again.  I've never been able to hold onto a job longer than a year or so due to my mental health issues, which I've struggled with my whole life.  This most recent job was the best I'd ever had, and I really thought it was going to be the place I'd work for the rest of my life.  But it didn't work out.

The reason I'm waiting for a month to kill myself is because that's approximately when my money's going to run out.  My former employer is giving me a few weeks' severance, which will get me through the next 30 days or so.  I have no other savings.  At that point, I won't be able to pay my rent or bills, and I'm just not willing to start over from scratch again.  I spent much of 2013 homeless for the same exact reason -- lost my job, couldn't pay my bills, got evicted, slept in my car.  I fought hard to get competent counseling, the right meds, a good job, and finally a nice house just a few months ago.  And now I'm losing everything again.

There's a slim chance I can get another job in my field that will pay enough to keep me on my feet, but I don't have a degree, and my resume is pretty spotty.  I don't have anybody I can use for a positive reference.  And there just aren't that many jobs where I live.  And I absolutely refuse to get a minimum-wage or fast food job again.  I'm just not willing to do it, to move out of my nice house into some cheap one-room shithole somewhere or into another insane roommate situation where I'm terrified to come out of my room.  I likely won't qualify for unemployment because I was fired for cause.  I'm not in touch with any relatives -- I've always been the black sheep of my family and we haven't spoken in over ten years, ever since one of my siblings threw me out on the street for cutting myself.  I'm no longer willing to "do whatever it takes," to fight and struggle to stay alive.  I want out.

I have a really great counselor.  I've told her all of this.  I'm still taking my meds.  But when the day comes that I don't have enough money to to pay the rent, and I'm about to get evicted again, I'm ending it.  I have a plan.

I told my counselor about this sub and I promised her I would post here, much good it's likely to do.  I posted a couple of weeks ago in /r/Assistance with a gofundme, but I knew it was a long shot that anybody would even see it.  So, /r/SuicideWatch, AMA.  Let's spend my last month on Earth together.
