Good thing I donâ€™t have to worry about getting rejected by a girl for prom because Iâ€™ll be gone by then.Iâ€™m spending my last few months writing a detailed journal of everything that led me to this point that Iâ€™m gonna leave with a friend. I can only write bits and pieces at a time, but Iâ€™ll make sure itâ€™s done in time. Hopefully, whoever reads it will understand and forgive me. At least it gives me time to do some things I used to enjoy once more.
