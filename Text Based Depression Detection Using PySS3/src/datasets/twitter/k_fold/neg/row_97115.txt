I NEED TO BE FREEThis is my first reddit post, I have writing in a text document for a couple of weeks and will be posting it very soon. I can't take it everything is terrible the condition I live in fits with the definition of hell, I have no hope, I can't call anyone and can't go anywhere, I am physically unable too and so I am locked in a house, please is there anyone there out for me, looking for me. What have I done TO BE PUNISHED. Please someone answer me I can't take it anymore I want to be FREE! 

I hope someone replies if you see this, please let me know someone is there. If not it seems death is my last resort, I would take that than live another minute in here, secluded from the world, and treated like joke.  If anyone else has a similar situation I hope you can get out of it, I was born into this and manipulated into staying here, and now I am trapped.  The best summary I can think of is that every thing is so precisely complex that not even the authorties would believe me, but I can't call them, bit because I don't have access to a phone, but because e things would be so much worse. My whole family is completely fucked up too so they are no help ( sorry for swearing ). 

I don't have much else time to type so I will thanks anyone in advance for reading this I hope it want too long, and for also possibly replying to me.
