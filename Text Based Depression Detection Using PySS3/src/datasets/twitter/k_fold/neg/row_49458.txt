just cant movei feel like im under a heavy rock today, i have zero motivation, its almost like its emotionally painful to move, every character i type exhausts me, i just dont want to go on anymore, i wrote a suicide note earlier just in case. i get so irrational when im like this, ive been trying to get the motivation to write this all day, i skipped class, i just need to stop. i dont even think my phobia could get me off my ass right now, im so done. they say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem and what sucks today may be better tomorrow or a year from now. its been about seven damned years. it wont get better. it cant get better. i hate everything
