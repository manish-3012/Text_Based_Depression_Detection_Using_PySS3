the act of living is exhaustingtoday has been an off day. i've just felt weird all day, probably because it's christmas eve and im alone. im completely alone. everyone just tolerates me. i am too much for everyone. my own family doesn't even like me and they make that so obvious every single day. i am terrible and awful in their eyes and most importantly, an annoyance. my friends don't even talk to me anymore because they're tired of hearing about my depression and trauma, and honestly they all have their own lives now. i don't even have a significant other to help. i am so fucking alone and sad every day.
