I canâ€™t take the hits.The hits, one after another, week after week, over, over, over and over again. I canâ€™t take the hits. I canâ€™t close my eyes. My eyes canâ€™t stay closed. I donâ€™t like what I see when I close my eyes. I canâ€™t sleep. I wonâ€™t say what I see, but I canâ€™t close my eyes anymore. I have no choice but to keep taking the hits. Itâ€™s my only way to survive. My brain rattles. I have to keep taking the hits.  Itâ€™s my only trade. I donâ€™t have an option.
