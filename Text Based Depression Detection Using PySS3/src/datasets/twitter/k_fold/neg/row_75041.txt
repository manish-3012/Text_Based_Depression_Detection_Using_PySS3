I made a mistake...Over a year ago, I made a promise to help a girl find comfort and a reliable friend. We were great friends, and were in an "okay" level relationship, it was stressful sometimes, but we made a great team and some great memories. It wasn't easy, she wasn't very popular and I got picked on a lot, even my "friends" pitched in on the bullying. But I made it through, everyday waking up saying "This will pass, I have to do this for her". But then I messed up, I had a really stressful day, we had another argument in a string of arguments (we were both going through a lot), and she left. In an instant, all my mistakes and bad decisions fell in on me, and I lost everything I stood up for. I lost the thing that kept me going. Trying to fix it only made it worse. And it's all my fault. I've had constant thoughts of suicide and self demoralizing phrases. I'm afraid that if I do follow through with suicide, it will just make things worse, even if I'm gone. I don't know what to do anymore.
