Sorry please ignoreWhy is there never a good time to die? 
I should have taking that opportunity when I had the chance. Iâ€™m soo stupid. Iâ€™m such an idiot. Iâ€™m too weak to live and to much of a chicken to end it. Every day is just a million more horrible mistakes. Iâ€™m just slowly becoming worse and worse until the selfishness consumes me and I end up like my father. I just want to die. I just wish I was never born so no one would miss me. If itâ€™s even possible to miss such a horrible and annoying person. I beet no one would miss me when I die. I beet every secretly hopes I do it already. Iâ€™m a horrible person. Iâ€™m a horrible daughter. Iâ€™m a horrible sister. Iâ€™m a horrible friend. Iâ€™m so sorry. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m so sorry.
