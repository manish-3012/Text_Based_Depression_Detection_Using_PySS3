I want to die to end my relationship, I'm so sick of this.I'm so tired of living, I'm tired of being stuck in this and I can't end it and I'm so paranoid they can hear my thoughts and see what I post everywhere, we're in a long distance relationship and I feel like the only way to end this is to end my life, the only way to get out of this emotionally abusive, manipulative relationship is to kill myself, my OCD and paranoia and psychosis has gotten worse because they made me feel like I don't need medication, something I'd been on for a long time, I only eat because I'm afraid if I don't they'll know and call me selfish even though they make fun of my body. I can't do this anymore and I don't know how to get out of this without killing myself.

Edit: I'm at the stage where I've accepted death, I was smiling and joking when I talked to them a few minutes ago because I know if I want it to be over, I can end it with me.
