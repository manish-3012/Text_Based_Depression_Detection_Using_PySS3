Iâ€™m already dead, alive in name onlyIâ€™m not sure when it was, but my spirit was crippled and I accepted death in every meaning of the word. 

Death became me, consumed me, and I belong to it. An irreversible threshold was crossed. I no longer find any meaning or joy in the act of living or being alive, I feel like a soulless machine. 

The human mind has a breaking point, you kick a dog long enough it becomes a very different animal from the puppy you once knew. It would maul and kill you without hesitation or remorse. 

Nothing else matters, even if I became a billionaire overnight the grip of the giant cannot be broken.
