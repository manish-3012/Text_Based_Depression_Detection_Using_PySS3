When will then be now? Soon....Putting some bows on my notes. Itâ€™s not going to be tomorrow or this week, but I feel itâ€™s coming soon. The anxiety is wreaking havoc with my body. Losing weight without trying. The depression grabs at my feet and holds me underwater. Breathing life is more difficult each day. I have hollow ups occasionally but itâ€™s just more to put on my face to show the world and keep them off my back.  My plan goes back and forth between a couple of different options but theyâ€™re all easily attainable and not violent.  In life and death my ocd prevents me from making a mess.  Iâ€™ve made it through all the familyâ€™s birthdays and thanksgiving.  That was my goal so not one person has a tainted date.  Just got to put more days between so as to lessen the hurt.
