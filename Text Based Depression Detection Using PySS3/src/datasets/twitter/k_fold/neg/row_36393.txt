Tinnitus is testing meHonestly...fuck this. I'm a 21 year old tortured male with several severe mental and physical health conditions that make my life a waking nightmare. I will decline to elaborate here on my conditions and broken life because it's too much personal information. It will suffice to say it's more than bad: others would have killed themselves in my place years ago. I've suffered enough to the point where acquiring tinnitus is pushing me over the edge. I don't have the means to end it anymore but I wish I had a way out. I don't want to suffer anymore. I aborted a suicide attempt a few months ago and I'm already regretting being condemned to an existence where I no longer enjoy life or have the opportunity to create a decent one. Tinnitus took my silence, pieces of my sanity, and my last shreds of a will to live. I just want it to stop. ðŸ˜­
