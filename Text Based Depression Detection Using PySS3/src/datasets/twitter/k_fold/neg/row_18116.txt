My school is putting on an awareness gallery for orientation this year and this amazed me.I'm part of the group that is putting on orientation for new students at my school. And every year we make an awareness gallery that focuses on a lot of different transition elements of coming to college. One of the sections focuses on mental health, and we have a strip of paper where new students can put a sticker on it to show how much they have been affected by having a mental health issue personally or by knowing someone that has an issue. 

After a group went through the gallery they sat outside and talked for a very long time and they came back and asked if they could add some of their own words to our gallery. We said sure that's fine and let them back in. When I walked in and saw what they had added I broke down crying. The gallery has been up the last couple of days, and I go in every day to see how the interactive parts are going, and every time I see this wall I get emotional. 

I know this isn't a post asking for help, but I just wanted to share something uplifting. 

Here is a picture of what the students added to our gallery.
