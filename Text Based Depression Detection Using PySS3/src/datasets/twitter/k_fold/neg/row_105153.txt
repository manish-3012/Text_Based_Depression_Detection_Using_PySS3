I just want some opinions.Well, I don't know where to start. 

I'm studying a career with little to no futures because I'm not good at anything else (I'm mediocre at best in this one, though) and can't find any joy in anything.

I have a nice family, never had a problem with them, I've been at the psychiatrist with a really long and kinda fruitless treatment of atypical depression and paranoid personality.

I have no friends and don't know how to make them, I'm really reserved so it's hard to keep a conversation with a stranger or even a classmate if the topic isn't studying

I have a girflriend of one and a half years, we're gonna be celebrating 19 months tomorrow. Both of us were/are suicidal, she has cut her arm a lot but says she can't get enough 'strength' to kill herself, she has a kinda broken family. We have supported eachother all along but I'm getting tired of this relationship.

That's all my life. No hobbies that I'm good at or reaaally interested. No pets. No friends. No nothing. Nothing to live.

Years ago I've promised myself to kill mysealf, I just don't know when, the rest is sealed, I'm gonna kill myself.

What can you tell me? No matter what, I just want to speak to someone.
