Not sure how much I have left in meIt's 5.54am at time of writing. Suicidal ideation is at an all time high, therapy was helping for a while but it's been 3 weeks since my last meeting due to corona virus.

I've been dealing with this shit since I was 8. 21 now. I've wandered on this subreddit for consolation and to see how others deal but I don't know if I can anymore.

My partner was the o my thing keeping me here, but I feel like I just disappoint her daily. I had good news recently that I was coming into money for a mental health claim I've waited 8 months on. Feeling helpless and unwanted by your own country for 8 months was hard....

But originally I had these plans to use the money to better me and my partners lives. Now I think the best thing would be to transfer it to her and finish it once and for all. Just as a thank you for dealing with me and a sorry I wasted her time...

I'm just really not sure I can go much longer. I've never felt more useless in my whole life. And the only thing that scares me anymore is the fact that the thoughts come so freely and are so welcomed by my subconscious. I used to fight them now I think them through...it seems only a matter of time at this stage.

I'm sorry for the rant and if you spent the time reading this but at the same time thank you for doing so.
