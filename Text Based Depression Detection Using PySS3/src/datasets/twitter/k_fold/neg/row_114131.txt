I think I'm going to go out and buy a rope.So it brings me great comfort in knowing that I can buy a rope in case I want to end things at any time.  There are plenty of great trees around here in order for me to perform some type of hanging of myself thank goodness if I ever have to commit suicide soon.

I am a very pro-human euthansia myself, so I believe that when a person wants to end their life at any time, they should be able to. And that is the same standard I generously give myself. I'm very kind to myself in that regard. And I'm proud of myself as a person for believing in such a kind philosophy dealing with such a belief. 

But merely having a rope on hand at any given moment puts me at ease. It makes me feel better in case things get worse and I will have the ability to take my own life at any time. It just makes me feel better and gives me comfort. I'm very proud of myself and thankful for that.
