Thereâ€™s no point in life, and you canâ€™t convince me otherwise.(This isnâ€™t a suicide note, just things Iâ€™m thinking about). 
Tell me this. Whatâ€™s the point in living a life when eventually everyone will die and nobody will remember any of it? I honestly donâ€™t understand how people can care so much about life. Many people with depression say how they are worried about exams and they want to study but they canâ€™t... but Iâ€™m the opposite. I donâ€™t care enough about my life to want to do well in it. I have big exams in 2021 and my mum keeps telling me to revise, but when I try to revise I just lose focus so easily because I know it doesnâ€™t mean anything.

Iâ€™m such a damn nihilist and I wish everyone was - we could have a worldwide genocide and put everyone out of this misery.

People fail to see the big picture.
