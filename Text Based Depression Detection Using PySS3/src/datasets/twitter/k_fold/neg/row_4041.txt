I just wanted to know what is right to do only for onceThereâ€™s been sometime since nothing I do seems to make sense at all. I feel like everyday I do wrong stuff, that what I do is not right, it feels like Iâ€™m on peopleâ€™s way and because of me they canâ€™t do what they want. Iâ€™m talking majority about my family, who affords a $4.000,00 college of medicine for me (I live in Brazil). They quit a lot of the stuff theyâ€™d wish to do so they can pay for my education. Besides, I broke yesterday with my gf, all my fault, today is my birthday, and I feel like I canâ€™t be anymore on so much peopleâ€™s way, stopping them from doing what they wish, as they wish, when they wish to do. I just wanted someone came to me and tell me what is the right thing to do, what can I do to be a better person. And the worst part is that even though I want to kill myself, Iâ€™m a coward, Iâ€™m so weak I donâ€™t have enough strenght to do it. I wish I could end it all... everyday that passes it just gets harder for me. I really want to stop suffering... I just wanted to please the people around me, knowing what I have to do, what is right, but it looks unrecheable, and I think Iâ€™m each day closer to ending my life...
