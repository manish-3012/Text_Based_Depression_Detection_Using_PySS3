Iâ€™m scared of my future.I hate it here. Itâ€™s almost time for me to start grade 11 and I have no clue what Iâ€™m doing as a career. Iâ€™ve been applying to jobs since last year to no avail. My grades are at that point where theyâ€™re not good for uni competition but good enough for everyone at school to talk about how good my grades are and how I shouldnâ€™t worry. Itâ€™s an endless cycle of demotivation and now school is starting. I feel like Iâ€™m a burden around my friends, like they just feel obligated to bring me when they go somewhere. My family keeps favouring my older sister, who always has things going for her; she got a job thatâ€™s close by and pays well before she turned 16, she knew what she wanted to do since she was in grade 11, and she got into uni easily. She has so many friends and goes to so many parties, and still gets good grades. While I sit here praying to God asking him why he even put me here. It sucks, I feel like I donâ€™t suffer as much as anyone else here and I canâ€™t complain, yet I keep praying for God to just take me away and end it all.
