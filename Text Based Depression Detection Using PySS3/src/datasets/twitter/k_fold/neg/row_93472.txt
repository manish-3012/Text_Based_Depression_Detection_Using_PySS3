I was too caught up in my own problems again.A week ago I woke up to a phone call from my mom, she never calls. My gramma who was in her early 60s still had horses, loved working and traveling was murdered. She was beaten to death by her own son and no one found her for 3 weeks. Her son is know as my biological father who I've had nothing to do with my entire life.

So I went home to take it in, no one else was sad but my mom. We didn't talk about it though, instead I got to break up drunken fights between her and her boyfriend for 2 nights. My gramma was the warmest, kindest person I have ever met, and she always worked so hard.

But I was to busy to call or text her, I used to visit her twice a week if she wasn't busy. The last time I had seen her was September 2019. When she brought me a mini fridge as a graduation present, because she remembered me talking about how someone had won one last year.

I've already been dealing with depression for years, I tried to kill myself not even 2 months ago. Effort is wasted on me. I wish I could give my years of life to other people who want to live, who have to fight to live.

The world is such a cruel place, why was I given all of these good things that other people would appreciate so much more.
