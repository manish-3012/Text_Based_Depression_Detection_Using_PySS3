The intrusive thoughts of suicide and ...They keep coming like usual, covering my mind with the common urge: "Now!" and a bunch of other comments. The plans and schedules are foggy but I have no hope for them to be clear. 

For now, I ignore them to stop my logic from the likely corruption. I don't know how long I can stay.

They obstruct my other thoughts, preventing me to reason myself out, to feel or to ask for help. Typing these was hard as I keep pressing Backspace/Delete and pausing to look for suitable words and expressions. English is not my first language and this is my first time on Reddit.

Everyday is a battle. Everyday, since the last year. Everyday, to be placed on the verge, alone.

"Sound as fake as you are looking for attention." - for example.

"You did this multiple times on many different websites. No one can understand these lines." - another example.

"Stop typing something in the quote format and call it an example."

"Meta?"

"No, procrastination. Get back to work."

"Press Post now. We cannot keep typing like this forever."
