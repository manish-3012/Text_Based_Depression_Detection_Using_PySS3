My life will end in suicide.I feel like it's an inevitability. My life so far has been a steady stream of getting rejected, failing to make friends or really accomplish anything, and my family not even caring how I feel. I'm completely alone and nothing in this life makes me want to stay, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. So there's really no reason for me to keep living. It's just a matter of when I finally snap.
