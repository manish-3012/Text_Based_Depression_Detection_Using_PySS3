Here's my story.Hi,

I thought it would be a good idea to share my story with you guys on here.
When I was little, my parents didn't much care about my feelings or my interests. I was different than them, being a lot more passionate and explorative. My faher acred the least and my mother was just scared about me getting hurt. I am a hemophiliac since birth, which means, that I have to take medication to make my blood clott the way it should. Hemophiliacs usually tend to have more serious injuries as children, so my mother made sure I missed out on a lot of fun. In some serious cases I can recall very well, she kept me from doing things with friends, like ice-skating or taking the public bus on a stormy, snowy night, that eventually led me to thinking that I should never ever be happy and feelings are bad. There were different factors to this. Another big issue was, thatby the age of six my first rolemodel whom I truly loved died. Everyone in my family was happy about it finally happening and I wasn't allowed to be on the funeral for it being "too sad". So I "learned" that not was it only wrong to be happy, it was also bad to mourn and noone told me how to work with negative emotions. I stuck to books. My parents having received only basic education couldn't keep up with me. Then some other people in my family died from various illnesses, and two other rolemodels I had, one in a very tragic accident. All in all, I visited 9 funerals. What actually bummed me out the most, was that I hadn't been able to sleep with as much women. My relationships were longtime, starting when I was 16, 2-3 years at least, with a few months between them. But with each I had more and more problems to open up, to let her help, talk about my worries and so on. I was told that it's all a matter of perspective and the good things in life will always prevail. So I did go outisde, met new people, tried out different sports, hobbies, you name it. Every single one of these activities left a sour taste and got boring after a while. I found out that I am really good in seeking the negative aaspects of something and using them to destroy the good image I had before, so I can throw it away. (this stems from my happy childhood). Well, what was left was to obey, learn and follow the rules. Life is so much easier with rules! I ended up as a student, I'm going to be 27 next month with 8 months to graduation left. I'm an A Student, but I don't care at all. Everytime I aqcuire a new qualification or knowledge, it becomes stupid, easy, I dislike it and hate myself for not being much better at it than everyone else.

So...My last girlfriend just broke up with me because she found out that she doesn't quite like me as much as she thought she would. At this point, she gave me a reason to live, honestly. We had the year planned out: friends, festivals, vacation...everything. Now I'm again at a point where nothing makes sense. I am going to finish my studies, because that's just what you do, it's the right thing. As much as I want to build myself a cabin somewhere and live there all by myself or go exploring the world, I am not going to follow any of these impulses, because I hate myself so much for having them. I'd rather die. I have been on different vacations, in different countries but afterwards it never left me with the thought of having learned or achieved something. We are all going to die, the universe will collapse - all the happy days you had do not. make. sense! That's what I think when I remember something happy. And I can't stop myself from doing so. It feels so natural and right to think this way, that I do not want to change it. I think that emotions are a sign of weakness and that there would be no way ever to lower myself so much, as to the point where I could love myself and life self aware about my body, my needs, my everything. Avoiding any contact and effort that leads to this is kind of my ultimate goal. But yeah, it makes me quite depressed, which is something I came to accept.

I have told this to various people in my life and also did two therapies, but my life didn't get better in any way. I just know all of the above now and the connections, therapy couldn't help me get rid of my negative thinking. You see, it is just not an option for me to give in to my needs. There just isn't. The only two ways out I see now is to find a drug strong enouh that will completely destroy my ability to feel anything at all or to kill myself, which I rather wouldn't do, because that's just not a thing you do.

Any advice?
