It's time for me to goAll you amazing people who comment on other's posts to try and help them or encourage them to get better even though you're all going through your own stuff, you're amazing. I hope they keep this sub around for a long time.

I wish I could have stuck around longer to comment more on people's posts, or to at least lend an ear. I mean I guess I have a few hours so if anyone wants to tell me their tale of woes I can listen.

Otherwise, peace out
