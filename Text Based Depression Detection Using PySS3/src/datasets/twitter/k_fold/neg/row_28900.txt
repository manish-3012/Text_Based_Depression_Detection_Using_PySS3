I can't do this anymore and I don't know if can move on from this painI'm currently in third year of med school and miserable because I don't enjoy my clinical years. Everything is too much; it's like I have to do part time job and drown myself in books within a short frame of time (im a slow learner) or risk failure. I enjoy studying with my books, jotting down notes, answering paper exam and involving myself in interesting research. I did well for the first 2 years but I never thought that 3rd year would would be so different from what I've expected, it's hell and I freaking hate it. I don't enjoy patient interaction and figuring out how to diagnose and also how to manage them. I don't have the passion anymore. I want to quit and if I have to repeat a year because I failed a paper, I think I rather die than doing it all over again. I just want it to stop, like I need to take a break from all of this madness and go away somewhere peacefully where I don't have to study medicine anymore.
