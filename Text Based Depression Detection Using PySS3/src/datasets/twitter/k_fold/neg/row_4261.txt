Would you rather know, or be surprised?I'm planning on ending my life sometime this week and I'm not sure what to do about people who know me.

In high school, I faked everything so a lot of people in my local community know of me and think I'm set. I know my family will be crushed and the few close friends I have will hurt too. My question is: do I tell them it's happening? Would you guys rather know what happened to someone by letter, note, or video, or instead would you rather just hear about it through the grapevine? 

I have a lot of mental health issues and a history of depression but I'm curious as to what you guys think would leave the better impression. Thanks for the help in advance.
