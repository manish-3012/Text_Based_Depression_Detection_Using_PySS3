I tried overdosing on some old pain pills, but nothing happenedI found an old bottle of pills. Not sure if they were aspirin or ibuprofen, but the bottle was mostly full. All that happened was that I got dizzy and had to lay down. I also got a few hives (at least I think they're hives, they're itchy bumps) on my neck and arms. Right now I think I'm coming out of it, but I'm still a bit lightheaded. This is what I was afraid of. Making an attempt and failing. I'm just going to take it easy for the rest of the day.
