My husband posted something about me and I wanted to follow up with something I learned that might help someone.I went to the funeral of an awesome, courageous, unique, caring, and all-around remarkable human being. He was a mentor to many kids, and an inspiration to his colleagues. He unfortunately took his own life. I sat in the funeral home and watched people break down into uncontrollable sobs. I saw people leaning on each other for support. I listened as they told story after story about this absolute treasure of a man. So many people were there, and I thought to myself, â€œAny one of these people would have gone to him if he was in need. If only he had reached out, he would have found so many people reaching back to help him.â€

I have been suicidal for a while. I made my husband [posted]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1726ge/my_wife_is_suicidal_yesterday_was_her_second/) something he said while I was in the middle of a breakdown that really resounded with me. Now itâ€™s my turn to share something.

Itâ€™s easy to forget the ones we love when we are in crisis. Itâ€™s easy to say things like, â€œTheyâ€™ll get over it,â€ and â€œNobody would even show up to my funeral.â€ Our friends and family (you have them even if you think you donâ€™t) would be devastated if we took our own lives. But, more than that, we would be inflicting a grievous injury on them that would never heal. They would think, â€œIf only I hadâ€¦â€ done any number of things. Picked up on signs, just stopped by that day, called, etc. For the rest of their lives they would carry around the guilt of having not done something. Now, some people may find that thought appealing. They would like to punish the people that have ignored, not cared, or otherwise wronged them. If you really want to punish them, walk up to them and say, â€œI donâ€™t think that you love me, and some of your actions have made me want to kill myself.â€ Donâ€™t do it in a mean way. Be honest and tell them how you feel and how they have made you feel. Iâ€™m willing to bet they will change the way they act towards you and maybe even other people. 

I used to think that people would be sad for a little while, but then they would get over it. But itâ€™s not true. Some of those people will never get over it. Theyâ€™ll never stop being hurt by what he did, and what I wanted to do. And if you want to use suicide as a means of getting even with someone, there are far worse things you can do that wonâ€™t end up with you dead or in jail (for the love of all thatâ€™s good in this world, just donâ€™t kill anyone, especially yourself.)

I have â€œtaken suicide off the table.â€ The grief and anguish that those people expressed, the way they talked about how he lived his life and how much they admired and loved him, their pain and their words brought me out of myself, and I saw exactly how wasteful and tragic suicide is. The world was a better place with him in it. The world is a better place with me in it. The world is a better place with you in it.

Think of the people that you love, then imagine how you would feel if they committed suicide. 

**Edit** For those who have no family or friends: The very fact that you are here tells me that you have looks at sidebar at least 53 other people you can reach out to. There are suicide hotlines, and all sorts of other places you can turn to for help. You also have yourself. Step out of yourself and recognize the value of you. Love yourself (fuck, that is the corniest thing I have ever typed, but it's true) and you will have a friend for life.

**Edit #2** I am not "guilt shaming" I am sharing my real experience from last night and the last few weeks in the hopes that it can help someone. I'm getting some serious negativity, and I see myself in those peoples' words. You are so angry, the world fucking hates you, you are in constant pain, and you have every right to take steps to end that pain, and anything, or anyone that tells you otherwise is a worthless (fill in with many very nasty expletives). I've been where you are, and I might be there again someday. The utter darkness that swallows your mind, the hatred for yourself and the world around you. "Why does it keep hurting me? Why does the pain never stop? Why does every fucking thing that can possibly go wrong, go wrong? God fucking hates me. The universe hates me. I'm being punished. I'm being hurt. This is so unfair, what did I do to deserve this?"
  
  
I know where you are. I know that place very well. I wish I could take you out of it right now. I wish I could fly so I could swoop down and carry you to safety. Maybe I can't do it, but you can. This is what works for me. This is what I say to myself:  
   
*Don't let the pain swallow you. Fight that Goddamn son-of-a-bitch with all your might. Grab on to something, anything, and don't let go. And remember, this is your life, YOU are the boss of your own life, not the pain, not the darkness, YOU. YOU are the boss. Don't like where you live? Move. Friends pissing you off? Tell them to fuck off. Get fired? Fuck em', they were a bunch of damn hell ass idiots anyway. Someone break up with you? To hell with them, find someone else. Love someone that doesn't love you back? Try and stop thinking about them, and embrace the pain of it and ride it out to wherever it takes you. Someone you love die? Talk to them anyway. Carry them around in your heart and mind and let them live on through your thoughts and actions. Did all of this shit happen to you at once? Get out of bed every morning. Brush your teeth. Brush your hair. Wash your face.*  
  
I take one gut-wrenching step after another and wait for time to pass. And it will pass, agonizingly slowly, but it will pass. It will pass faster, then faster still. Brushing my teeth in the morning is getting easier, and everything is following. Today wasn't that bad. Tomorrow might be horrible. But things are going to get better. There will be setbacks, but I believe I will wake up in the light and leave the darkness behind me.  
  
I just wanted to share that. Iâ€™m sorry if it doesnâ€™t help you. Iâ€™m just sharing.
