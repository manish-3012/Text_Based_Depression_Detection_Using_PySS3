Ethics of Suicide?Letâ€™s discuss it. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s anyoneâ€™s right to say you canâ€™t. Itâ€™s quite possibly the most basic human right. Maybe if we accept the fact the suicide is a valid reaction, people will stop using it as an act of revenge. Nor would you have to resort to firearms, overdoses, or fucking razors. Itâ€™s just an option, that you can safely and calmly take. You donâ€™t like it here? Thatâ€™s okay man, itâ€™s not for everyone. Boom, assisted suicide then you are done. Then you wouldnâ€™t have to do mental gymnastics to justify something that is an absolute basic human right.
