I don't see the point anymoreEverything's fucked, i'm going nowhere. I'm 18 and i've done absolutely nothing in my life, i have no future because i fucked up my exams (currently  on my third attempt) and i'm miserable at college even though i'm doing something i enjoy, i can't enjoy anything anymore, i think my relationship is coming to an end, i thought feeling like this was over, i just want this to end, i don't know what to do anymore. 
I think the only reason i haven't done anything is because i'm too scared, i can't bring myself to do it.
