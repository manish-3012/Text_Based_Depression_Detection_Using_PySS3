It's getting worseNow let me get this out of the way first, I am a teenager and this is somewhat common,  but I have been diagnosed with depression, as well as what can only be described as crippling social anxiety. Regardless I still find the urge to commit suicide. Even though there are people around to help, and god bless them they have tried, even through effort of my own, I still feel like its the Better option, I don't feel safe anywhere I go, even though I live in a great home environment,  and can't seem to find a small bit of happiness even if just for a split second. Im tired of trying and I've about convinced myself of how little self worth I have. This isn't necessarily a cry for help, but some would be appreciated, and I'm just not sure what to do now
