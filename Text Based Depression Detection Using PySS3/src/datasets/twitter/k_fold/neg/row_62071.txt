I really need a hugI'm an FtM trans guy. I've known this since I was 14 and have accepted it for a long ass time. I'm not on hormones but I'm doing what I can with what I've got. I'm in a relationship with another guy \(he's cis\) and he's known this fact since before we started dating. I made it very clear to him before that I had plans on medically transitioning before we got together. He was okay and super affectionate with me still. He says he's bi, he leans more towards girls, but he likes dudes too.

And then I cut my hair again. This was less than a week ago. Since then, I can barely get him to touch me. He's been distant. I'm so paranoid he's cheating. He's done nothing to try and address his behavior even though I've sat down with him multiple times about it. I'm at the end of my rope. My dysphoria is sky high, I'm scared to proceed further with my transition because of this. If I go through, sure I might be happier with who I am but how's it going to press on my relationship? Am I just gonna have a fucking housemate I share a bed with? Someone I say I love you to and he just regurgitates it out of instinct? I don't want that. I don't want any of this. I've been depressed for 6 fucking years and it's been nothing short of shit. I wish my fucking sister hadn't found me when she did when I almost had a successful suicide attempt. I could've been dead 3 years ago. 3 years of not putting up with this shit. I don't like this body. I don't like this life. I don't like who I am. I don't like who I'm around. I don't like anything. No amount of running will let me escape. I just want a hug and a gun in the mouth. Someone please give me a hug, I'm at the end of my rope
