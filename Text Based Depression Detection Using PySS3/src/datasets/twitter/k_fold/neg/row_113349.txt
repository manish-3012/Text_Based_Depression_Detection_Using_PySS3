Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria is killing me and I'd rather die than live with it.I have rather severe ADHD, which comes with a heaping dose of [RSD](https://www.additudemag.com/rejection-sensitive-dysphoria-how-to-treat-it-alongside-adhd/). It is defined as **"an extreme emotional sensitivity and emotional pain triggered by the perception â€“ not necessarily the reality â€“ that a person has been rejected, teased, or criticized by important people in their life."** I take everything personally. I hate seeing other people happy. I constantly worry about things I have no control over. **"Itâ€™s not that people with ADHD are wimps, or weak; itâ€™s that the emotional response hurts them much more than it does people without the condition."**

It's so hard to tell people about this because I'm constantly fighting through misconceptions about ADHD. Yeah, sure, it's hard for me to focus and I always sway back and forth like I have to pee. But it's impossible for me to function as a human being emotionally too. But I always get either I'm "making it up" or "we all have a little ADHD". I'm just so fucking tired of it.

**"When this emotional response is internalized, it can imitate full, major depression complete with suicidal ideation... RSD can make people with ADHD anticipate rejection â€” even when it anything but certain. This can make them vigilant about avoiding it, which can be misdiagnosed as social phobia. Social phobia is an intense anticipatory fear that you will embarrass or humiliate yourself in public, or that you will be scrutinized harshly by the outside world."**

When my meds are working, I don't have to worry anymore. I can talk to people. I focus on the things I can control. I can see a light at the end of the tunnel. But it never lasts. Adderall gave me mood swings. I developed a tolerance for Ritalin. Concerta requires 3 hours of exercise for it to activate. And I was making do with that for the time being, even if it doesn't leave me a lot of time to do homework. But now, even with the exercise, it's not working anymore. I'm already at the max 72mg for Concerta. I don't really see any other options. **"Rejection sensitivity is hard to tease apart. Often, people canâ€™t find the words to describe its pain. They say itâ€™s intense, awful, terrible, overwhelming."** And I'd rather kill myself than live with it. Hopefully, this time, I don't fuck up.
