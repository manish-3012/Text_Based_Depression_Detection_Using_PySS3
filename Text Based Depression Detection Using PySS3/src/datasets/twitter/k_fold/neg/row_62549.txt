X-post Everyone hates me at work and they're forcing me to work more so they can goof offI used do a certain amount of work. Let's say 100%. It was fine if a little stressful at times. I worked 8 hours a day.

We hired another guy and now I do 55% of the work.

For the last year, this guy has been lazy, slow, and the quality of his work shit.

Yet, everyone loves him. When the director told me there had been complaints from clients I honestly reported that "Arthur" usually is on his cellphone, smoking outside, chatting with people, etc. Nothing was done and my supervisor never forgave me. She ranted at me in private about it. She chats with Arthur maybe a total of an hour a day. She's married but acts like she has a crush of Arthur.

Even though Arthur has been fine with the work for a year, recently he's been staying two - three hours overtime on a regular basis.

Either he's gaming the system, working slow to gain overtime pay or he's grossly incompetent and getting worse.

Now the director and my supervisor are pushing me to take 77% of the work. Even through it wasn't decided yet, today the front desk sent one of his clients to me. During the meeting, I could hear Arthur laughing and chatting with another employee. This is my future. Me working so he doesn't have too.

Nothing talks to me unless it's strictly about work. No one seems to notice this guy is a clown. Everyone loves him and fuck me.

I don't want to work to create a paradise for this guy. I have no friends. I was raped when I was 8. I've been bullied and abused my whole life. I don't know why people hate me. I don't know how to fix myself. I might as well kill myself instead. I don't see anyway out.
