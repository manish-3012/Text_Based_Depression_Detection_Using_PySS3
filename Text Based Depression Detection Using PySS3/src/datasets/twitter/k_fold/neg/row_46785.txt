I know my situation could be a lot worse, but I just donâ€™t see how Iâ€™m going to climb out of this hole. I graduated college two years ago, Iâ€™ve had two jobs since, both on my â€œgoalâ€ career path, but after a year at it I quit the first one, and now a year in  Iâ€™ve taken a week of work to try and decide if Iâ€™m going to quit the second one. I donâ€™t know what it is at both of these jobs my anxiety and depression spike to an all time high. I get violent at home and I hurt myself, Iâ€™ve been in therapy, and Iâ€™ve been on different medication, none of it seemed to help. 

Iâ€™m now searching for a job again, and Iâ€™m not having luck. It wasnâ€™t this hard the last two times, Iâ€™ve done this twice and along the way Iâ€™ve burned so many bridges because of the monster i become when Iâ€™m anxious, constantly physically sick, constantly on edge and angry. I have a month left and then I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself. I have set a deadline and attempted it before. I didnâ€™t have everything set up to go right. I will this time. 

I just donâ€™t see another option, whatâ€™s the point of pushing yourself through failure after failure. Whatâ€™s the point in doing that to the few people who do care about me still. Theyâ€™re angels for not running away when they see me explode, or for not ignoring me once they noticed what I had been doing to myself. 

I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™ve been in this rut, and the only way out I can think of is to take myself off the game board.
