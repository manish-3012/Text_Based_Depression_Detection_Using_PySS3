After all this time of telling myself I'm over it, I'm not. I really am not.I'm tired of complaining to friends, of therapy, of everything I've tried.  

I'm tired of having all these thoughts invade my mind, these feelings of remorse. 
I hate that I messed up my relationship, and there's nothing I can do to fix it.  My ex has moved on and is happy now.  There's absolutely nothing I can do, but move on, but I can't, I can't... I can't.

Knowing he's happy with someone else is driving me crazy to no end.  The person I love is loving someone else and not me.

I'm not going to overdose myself with pills again, because that doesn't work.

I need to find a tall building.  I live in NYC, you'd think that's easy, but it's not.  I don't know anyone who lives on a high enough floor, and hotels usually block their windows, I'm guessing for this reason?

I feel emotionally stuck, I feel stuck in every way.  Every time I try, I just fall harder.
