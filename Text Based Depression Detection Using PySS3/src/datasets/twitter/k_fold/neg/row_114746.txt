Lonely and abandonedI feel like hell. I am so alone. I just realized my family says things to placate me but never mean what they say   I tell them I feel abandoned and they say they will try to visit but get so busy and forget. Ha bullshit. Dad you are a horrible liar. I see you sitting around the house every Friday since you retired doing jack shit. Some days I wonder would he even give two shits if I was gone. I seriously doubt it. He might be sad and confused for a few days but the back to business as usual. No one really cares about me. No one gives a fuck I am on the fucking precipice of killing my self just days before xmas. I'm tired of his bullshit and he thinks it's okay to bully your adopted son every now and again just because he was a lawyer. Fuck you I hate you
