I need help I need it fast im losing my mind. Im doing everything to beat depression im taking cold showers and im eating healthy im working out and getting vitamins from the sun but i still and I feel like im going to lose it and fly off the handle any second now

I used to be a nice guy to be around and everyone liked my presence but recently when hanging out everyone is uncomfortable around me, and the laughter seems forced and Im about to give up trying. My social anxiety is coming back harder than ever and i really need help please

I wash my face a lot and my skin is fantastic and surprisingly enough the "sunked in" tired black eye rings look has disappeared. I look fantastic, but feel like shit.

2 weeks ago and thats when it all started declining for tge worst I was at a coffee shop and I just couldn't do it anymore my blood was boiling and my anxiety made me lose my mind, i stormed out and i threw my cup on the ground outside and I went home panicking, im serious im so sad and i need help NOW I NEED HELP NOW and the other night at around 4 am was my worst one I was walking down near the bus exchange and I cant even remember what song I was listening to but I looked like shit my hair was flying off my head and my eyes were blurry I went to a train track and started pissing on the ground and someone was behind me on a skateboard watching and I started laughing really loudly and he thought i was crazy and went away and went away but now im stuck and i went home and started holding my head and bashing it into the pillow and crying.

I don't know I cant feel anything but sadness and anger and I was talking to the cashier at a gas station yelling at him about the lottery and I now he thinks im crazy but I dont exist.
