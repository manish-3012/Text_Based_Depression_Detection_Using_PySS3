I don't think there's a solution to long term depression.I first started self harming at 12. Now, 20yrs later at 32, I'm still no closer to overcoming depression.
I've tried therapy, medications, sheer willpower, meditation, diet and exercise. All resulting in a big fat zero in terms of progress.
I've never experienced some major trauma, or any trauma at all really. It seems I was genetically predetermined to be this way.


Now I'm facing another upheaval in life, I've got to find another job. Which wouldn't be a life ending problem for anyone else in my position. I've got savings that will last a while and know I could easily get a new job. 


I'm just wondering why I'm bothering. Putting myself through the stress of applying, interviews, meeting new coworkers..... all for what? A substandard, low quality life that simply fluctuates between periods of boredom, low motivation and low mood - to extreme stress, major depressive episodes and suicidal thoughts.


Perhaps now is a good time to bow out. I've given it a good shot but I've got no motivation to continue.
