People are hypocritical and suckyou got parents claiming to treat all their children equally and have no favorites, saying suicide is selfish when it is also selfish to make someone continue suffering, rich people posting on social media about how much they care for that poor starving kid far away, good looking people talking about how looks don't matter.
Sucks to see I'm a human as well. Most don't even realise they're doing this unconsciously.
