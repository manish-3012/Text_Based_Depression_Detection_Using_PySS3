I've lost the ability to be delusional about death, and now I want to dieLike most people until now I've been able to suppress recognition of the fact that I'll die someday. Everyone of course "knows" they'll die and that it could happen any time, but nobody really accepts it. Everyone thinks they're special somehow.

My mom will be dead of cancer soon. On top of dreading that loss, I now am facing my own mortality. Whenever I read about this online people try to frame it positively. "Once you accept death you can live every day like it's your last!" That's not how it works for me. Now that I'm facing the truth, everything seems pointless. I have no interest in doing anything, because I know it's just a distraction, an attempt to not think about dying.

Decided it's time. I can't control anything in life except this. Ending it on my terms, when I want. Fuck waiting to get cancer, or die in a car crash, or some other shit. Time to go.
