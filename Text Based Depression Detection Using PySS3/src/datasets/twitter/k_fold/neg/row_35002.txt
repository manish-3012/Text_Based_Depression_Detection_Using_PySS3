I shared something like this on an ocd website except sharing the unhealthy sexually experimentation I did as a teen as a trauma-influenced piece of shit (I only hurt myself psychologically in the end) and the moderator just got angry with me for being too â€œvulgarâ€ and I get it...but other people on the website have posted about the same type of things and have gotten support, so why am I different? Hearing that Iâ€™m â€œvulgarâ€ or â€œinappropriateâ€ makes me realize that everyone would judge me and Iâ€™m too mentally ill and traumatized to live a normal life and like myself and heal. I want to die. I donâ€™t see another way. I have it planned. Iâ€™m done and sad and feel like garbage. Iâ€™m so stupid. No one cares anymore.
