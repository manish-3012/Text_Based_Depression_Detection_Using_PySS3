Iâ€™m giving myself until the end of the year to turn things around, otherwise Iâ€™m buying a gun and offing myselfIâ€™m happiest when Iâ€™m asleep, I fail or am mediocre at everything I do, I ruin every relationship Iâ€™ve ever had, I attract toxic people into my life who take advantage of my willingness to make people happy. I drink alcohol every night until Iâ€™m too drunk to have coherent thoughts, I sit and look at my ceiling every night that Iâ€™m not drunk and think and wonder if my shitty life is a product of me being a shitty person just getting what I deserve. I donâ€™t have any real friends anymore, my boyfriend is using me as a get a jail free card for his finances since Iâ€™m in med school and had planned to be a doctor... the only thing I look forward to during the day are the little moments that last a few seconds to minutes when I forget about how I fucked up everything in my life. I see a therapist but am too much of a coward to admit how fucked up my thoughts are and how pathetic my life is. I wish I could trade places with every terminal patient I read about because they deserve to live more than I do.
