What's the f!cking pointWhy do I even bother existing if all I am is a f!cking nuisance?! All I ever do is piss people off so why do I even fucking bother being around?? I'm better off dead at least I won't get on everybody's nerves all the fucking time. I see how point in even taking care of my damn mental health, let it deteriorate until I lose my damn mind and jump in front of a train. I'll never get better when all people want is for me to be in the f!cking ground. Sorry I existed, sorry someone birthed me, believe me I wish I was never born either. I should just f!cking drop dead, or die in my damn sleep. No one would mourn me, no one would care, maybe they would and be sad for a bit, but in the end they'll be happy they don't have to deal with an annoying, cringe worthy, stupid, fugly, fatass, idiotic, depressing person like me anymore. Done with everything, gonna stop antidepressants, get the painful brain zaps but idc, stop therapy, stop everything and just wait to f!cking die
