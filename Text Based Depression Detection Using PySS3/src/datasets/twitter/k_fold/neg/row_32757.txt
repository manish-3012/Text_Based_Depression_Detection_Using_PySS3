I was already a disappointment and once again, I'll live up to that expectationIt's been a while since I had thoughts so nasty that I made me want to talk to someone. 

I just took 2 ( English &amp; Math ) out of 4 ( English, Math , MT &amp; Science ) examinations before my final major exam before I leave Primary School. 

While I still have the urge to cut myself with a knife, I try to refrain cutting so that I would remain unnoticeable in school. Before I took the Math Paper, while we had our usual class, when I responded to a question, my form teacher gasped in surprise. 

She said that "It's the first time I hear you talk for a long time," 

Even though she had been my teacher for 2 years, it actually made me wonder how quiet I am ? 

While I still pretended to joke around with classmates and talked nonsense with them, I don't really talk other than that. Only when I am asked questions do I reply. A lot of teachers have said that about me. 

Well, I am worried. Since the major exam is about 1 month away, I can't help but worry. Everytime I think about my grades, I always imagined...

Will I die then ? Will I die after taking the exak ? Will I kill myself when I get my results ? 

Weirdly, I would smile or shed tears unconsciously when I thought about it. 

Well, since I imagined it so much...

Maybe I really might die before I turn 13....
