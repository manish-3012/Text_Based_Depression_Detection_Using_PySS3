All life has to offer to me are distractions from itI just don't see the appeal of life. If I had to come up with the perfect situation in which I could say I was truly happy, nothing would come to my mind. 10 Years ago when I was 15 I wanted to kill myself, but I promised to give it another try. Would I have died back then, I would have missed out on nothing of value. It is unlikely, that the next 10 years offer much moreor at least the probability isn't worth the pain, that is actually guaranteed.

I tried alot, enough that I can say with certainty, that live isn't for me. Now I just wait for that last spark of motivation and considering the last weeks it shouldn't take that much longer.
