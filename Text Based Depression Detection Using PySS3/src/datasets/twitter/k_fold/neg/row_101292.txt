Iâ€™m fucking trapped. Into living.I wish euthanasia was legal. I donâ€™t care that it doesnâ€™t make sense for that to be the case, since even if it were I wouldnâ€™t benefit from it since it would only be for those with certain medical conditions, etc.

But when it comes to suicide. Canâ€™t just go to Walmart and buy cyanide. To try it via alcohol, it would take like 20-30 shots, which I would for sure throw up. I guess I could find a rope and a tree? But where could I get the privacy for that? Guess I could get my hands on a gun? Seems like a pain in the ass, not to mention that, as I know from experience, this is a *fucking hard way to do it*. And I even considered getting some kind of a camping stove and letting the CO get me. But Iâ€™m afraid to go through the effort for that, just for it to make me a little sick or something.

Like, now that Iâ€™m actually seriously thinking about it, Iâ€™m starting to realize that thereâ€™s no easy way to do it, anyway. Fuck, I just needed to vent. Will probably delete this post.
