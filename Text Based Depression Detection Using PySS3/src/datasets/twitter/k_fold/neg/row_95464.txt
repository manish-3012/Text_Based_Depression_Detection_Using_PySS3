Figured out what would make me happier.Stopped drinking for a week. Turns out I just really hate life. Started drinking again and just slept all day. Unfortunately my family loves me and hates that I drink. Back on the sobriety track, but fuck if this is anything I actually want. My own psychiatrist does not even call me back. I am hoping this city is shitty enough where I can get shot in the near future. I don't want my family to know I committed suicide. I would rather them think it was an accident.
