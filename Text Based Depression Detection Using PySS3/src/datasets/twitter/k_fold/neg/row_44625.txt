I feel like my suicide would be natural selectionI am not yet an adult. However, I am getting close to becoming one. I feel like when I commit suicide, itâ€™ll be a matter of natural selection. I am too stupid, weak, and just generally unequipped to become an adult and the weak, inept ones like me die out because they arenâ€™t fit to live life. I know thereâ€™s a shit load of adults who call themselves â€œpretend-adultsâ€ or refer to them as â€œadultingâ€ but Iâ€™m not even competent enough for that. I am not fit to succeed in life therefore natural  selection will just weed out the useless ones such as myself.
