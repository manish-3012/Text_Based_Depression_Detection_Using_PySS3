Life is turning into #%^* again.. Canâ€™t take it anymore..Well, Iâ€™ve been thinking things have been going better and trying to help others here but situations have gotten worse again...

Even with medication my depression is getting stronger and stronger. I thought it was helping but now I feel like Iâ€™m trapped inside a cave with no escape. I canâ€™t take this pressure anymore and just want to end it..

I know Iâ€™ve said to others about fail rates being bad for suicide but at this point I donâ€™t really care.... I just want to end it, people canâ€™t understand the pressure of the â€œfakenessâ€ of the happiness that you present to others... OMG just blah, ugh, and crud! The pressure is soo much Iâ€™m trembling on the inside... 

I need serious help, I think.. I just donâ€™t know... Iâ€™ve tried writing in my journal, tried taking my medicine today but itâ€™s NOT helping...
