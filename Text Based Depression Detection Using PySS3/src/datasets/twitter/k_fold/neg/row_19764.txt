iâ€™m everyoneâ€™s therapistliterally nobody cares what i have to say. since i can remember as far back as grade school i would let everyone vent to me, over and over and over. i never chime in with my own problems because i donâ€™t want them to feel how i feel; constantly being the one complained to. because nobody knows me nobody cares about me. nobody wants to listen to me. i have all these people to take care of and listen to but nobody to do the same to me. itâ€™s lonely in the worst way- surrounded by people but still alone. i havent been excited for anything in life. everythingâ€™s a chore. i donâ€™t look forward to the future. i just dread it knowing what i want wont happen- a good career (i donâ€™t think iâ€™ll be able to finish schooling). iâ€™m just so tired and i need a break but cant take one due to schooling. life seems so pointless if iâ€™ll be miserable the majority of my life. i just want out or a break-which i canâ€™t have- which leaves my only option as suicide. iâ€™m obsessed with killing myself by driving my car into a tree or rock. i donâ€™t know why. i just want out and thatâ€™s the only break i can get.
