I think i'm reaching the endTo be honest, what I'm about to write I've never told a soul, wasn't really sure how... I'm not sure about much longer I can go on.

I've always struggled, never really had friends, social interactions confuse me (I never know what to say, often never find the words) i starve myself every day because food terrifies me... Every relationship I've been in ended with me being cheated on, I'm always in overdraft, my family doesn't want to see me, my friends want me around less and less...

I feel trapped in my own head, it's getting harder and harder to get up each day. I'm a failure, im still haunted by every past mistake I've made big or small. I just want to make everyone happy and I can't even do that.

At first the suicidal thoughts used to scare me, now they are starting to feel like the only way out, the snag? I deserve to suffer, I don't think I should be aloud a way out. I don't deserve to be happy, maybe I am better off dead.

Sorry for inconveniencing anyone with this... I'm not even sure this helps but I don't know what to do anymore. Thanks if you have read this, this isn't the full story but 24 years of shit would take far too long to write.

Sorry
