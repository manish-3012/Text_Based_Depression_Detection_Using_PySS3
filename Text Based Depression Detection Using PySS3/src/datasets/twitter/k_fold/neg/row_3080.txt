Life wasnâ€™t made for meI have been to so many programs for suicidal people depressed anxious I have done so much to help me I have really worked for it and wanted 

I am so obsessed with my ex from years ago she has been with so many other people and I will not check anything online and then I will and Iâ€™ll see her whole life with skmekme else its always a new guy 

I loved her so much we broke up because I lied to her I am 21 in a month and I canâ€™t wIt so j can drink k so ducking much but honestly I wish that j could drink and IMO off a bmdjnf or right now in front
A train but Iâ€™m too guilty for how I will ruin my familyâ€™s life and future 

I prayed I went to church I have a job I try so much in and do good in just to distract me and give me hope I go to therapy php every day 

Everyday my mind is fighting thoughts of my ex and the thought to not check her social media. I will not check for weeks for months and then I will 

Iâ€™ll think Iâ€™m better then a strong urge comes 
Even when I feel horny something I canâ€™t control I get so mad and scared because just that reminds me of her 

Everything does 
Some days I forget how she looks and what we ever talked about and yet these feelings come 
This isnâ€™t just one emotional night this is every fuckkng day 
I tried everything 
How did she ducking move on and never think about me how did she date someone new afte me break up with them and go to another do the same and ANOTHER how is she better and not thinking of me EVER  people have told me she doesnâ€™t 
I wanna get shot on the fucking head so itâ€™s not my fajlt for ruining my familyâ€™s life itâ€™s someone else 

Iâ€™m alone and hopeless this will never ducking end 

I wish someone would just realize how much pain this is too much to handle  and just tell me step by step guide me to kill my self why does god not make a maricle why M I on this disgusting earth 
People move on why canâ€™t I why doesnâ€™t god give me
Mercy and take these thoughts if he cares so much Iâ€™m sick of having hope from god and in a second itâ€™s gone because nothing good comes when I try so much 
I have learned the guitar in my time of pain and tang wonâ€™t help maybe Iâ€™m lonely and need a friend so I donâ€™t have tjeee thoughts but I have done so much to make friends it never happens never
