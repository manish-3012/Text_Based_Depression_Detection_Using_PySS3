what's the point?I miss school constantly, sometimes I cry all night, I wake up feeling empty, I have no motivation for anything, my mother hates me for it despite the fact my school knows and is understanding of my absences, she's just screamed at me about how I'm not depressed because I don't show any signs when I'm off school or when I'm around my boyfriend which isn't true I just hide it from her, and my boyfriend has seen me crying or panicking numerous times he's been here. She calls me lazy and pathetic and I believe her. What's even the point in existing anymore, nothing makes me happy. i ruin whatever does, my own mother can't stand me anymore and I can't get more help without her ranting about how there's nothing wrong with me and I'm just shy and anxious. I tried to kill myself two weeks ago for the first time in ages and I'm being told I'm not depressed. Just what's the point?
