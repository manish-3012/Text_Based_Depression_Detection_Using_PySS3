I think i might do it in 6 daysYeah i think this is it for me. I've just totally lost all reasons to keep going and nobody's gonna miss me.   I've spent the last week deciding and planning how to do it (i wont say here so i don't violate the subreddit's rules), and yesterday i decided to kill myself in a week's time. I deserve it anyway and i hope its painful so i get what i deserve. I don't even know why i'm posting this tbh.
