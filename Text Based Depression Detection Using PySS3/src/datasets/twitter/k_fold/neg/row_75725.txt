Something is seriously wrong with meI really dont have a real reason to kill myself, my family is doing ok financialy, they love me, I love them, im doing good in college have a dog that i adore but with all that i still have suicidal thoughts on a daily basis, the most minute shit happens and they pop up in my head, i have extreme fear of faliure and just think that id be better of dead. Ive been depressed the last 3 or 4 years but in the last year its gotten really bad. Anxiety rules my life on a daily basis. A lot of people here have it way worse than me but I still regularly consider suicide.. Im really fucked up mentally...
