What would happen to my dog? M/22What would happen to my dog if I killed myself? I live by myself with him, so I'm really all he has. He's met my parents and loves them. If I killed myself, he'd live with them for sure. But would he be okay? Can a dog just forget about their previous owner and live a happy life? He's not even 2 years old yet so he has a lot of life left in him.

This is one of my fears of suicide. I'm convinced that my parents, sister, and friends would all move on. But would my dog be okay? He's really the only one I'm not convinced wouldn't be scarred for life. Everyone else would be fine in time.

Sorry if this is a stupid question.

Edit: I wouldn't do it in a way where my dog could find my dead body or smell that I was dead. I've also had him for about 4 months.
