I don't know anymoreMan, I am just really miserable now, I supposed to go and get helo tomorrow I have an appointment with my psychologists and psychiatrists but my dumbass keep reading about people's opinion about depression and antidepressants and man I am getting discourage to get help, I've been to 2 psychiatrists prior this and I had a bad experience especially the 2nd one. And now I know my doctor is gonna be good but antidepressants and depression and anxiety disorders got a bad rep and many people say that "antidepressants side effects outweighs the pros" or that depression is just something that's in someone's head and that antidepressants will gonna make you dependant, loss your libido, and I seen worse claims than that. I really don't know who to believe or not or what to do really.
