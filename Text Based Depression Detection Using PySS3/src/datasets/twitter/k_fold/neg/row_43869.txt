I want to die so badlyMy biological parents were incredibly abusive and my in laws (who I was staying with) basically just told me that Iâ€™m not worth their time and that I take advantage of them. Iâ€™ve done everything I can to help and be grateful and stay out of their way but itâ€™s not enough.

Iâ€™m so scared Iâ€™m going to lose my fiancÃ© and heâ€™s the only family I have. I canâ€™t do any of this without him. I have a full bottle of seroquel and Iâ€™ve attempted before and it didnâ€™t work. I just want this to end and finally not be so sad and just be numb.
