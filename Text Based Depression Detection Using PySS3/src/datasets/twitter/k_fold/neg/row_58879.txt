This time it'll workMy first suicide attempt was 12 years ago. My third was two years ago. I should be used to things not going my way. So, today, I finally bought a gun. Usually I abhor guns and people who use them, but they're good for one thing, that's for sure. I thought it would be difficult or expensive. I drove to a neighboring state, and, a few hours and a few hundred dollars later, it was mine. I've learned a lot in 12 years, mostly what I did wrong. I can't fail this time.  I won't go through another holiday season, another month, another year, this way. I deserve more. Honestly, I don't know why I put off using a firearm before.

I'm making all the final arrangements, closing accounts, etc, this week. I need to do this right this time.   
When I was a kid or even a 20-something, I never would've dreamt that my life would end this way. But so it goes...
