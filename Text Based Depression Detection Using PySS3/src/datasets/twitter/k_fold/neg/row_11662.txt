I donâ€™t knowIâ€™m 17 possibly even trans and I just donâ€™t know where to start. Even if I had someone who loved me or even liked me or if I had all the money in the world I just donâ€™t see the appeal of living. I just donâ€™t feel anything anymore no desire to be happy anymore. I donâ€™t feel any desire to be loved anymore. When I used to reach deep down to know what I want to do with my life and what I wanted from a relationship it was clear what I thought could make me happy, but now when I reach deep down for what I truly want itâ€™s just a deep desire to stop existing and just disappear. I almost fantasize about doing it, like it would be the best outcome for me, like it was a mistake for me to exist in the first place. I get a sick feeling every time I look in the mirror. I doubt itâ€™s possible for anyone to truly like me anyway. I have unrealistic expectations of life and relationships anyway. Iâ€™ll die before I truly find someone I can be happy with. I canâ€™t exactly expect someone to like how I look when I clearly donâ€™t take care of myself. I donâ€™t even truly have the motivation to even kill myself with conventional methods maybe if I lived alone I could starve myself to death or something like that but I donâ€™t know anymore. Since I never made that many connections to people there arenâ€™t many that would be that sad for too long. The only reasons or pretty much just excuses at this point to live I have are meaningless things that only just keep my mind occupied for a time. People tell me that Iâ€™ll find someone or something but that person doesnâ€™t exist. Iâ€™ll just keep waiting and getting by until either I end it or I just die alone anyway. Itâ€™ll be just right when it happens, like a dream, like all is right.
