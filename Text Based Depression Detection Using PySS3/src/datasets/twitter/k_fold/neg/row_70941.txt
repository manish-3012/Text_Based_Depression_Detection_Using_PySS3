What do you think happens when we die?I hope this is an appropriate subreddit for this post, I'll happily take it down if it's not. I've just been wanting to die ever since primary school and, funnily enough, also have been scared of death, mainly due to my religious upbringing.

At this point though, I don't even know whether I'm scared of it anymore. Some people with near-death experiences have said it's like being snuggled in a large, warm blanket and they've never been more at peace.
