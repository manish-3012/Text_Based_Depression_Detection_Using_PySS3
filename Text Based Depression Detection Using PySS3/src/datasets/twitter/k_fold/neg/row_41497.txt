My Therapist Did Not Tell Me to Kill MyselfI finally a therapist for the first time after months of being desperately suicidal. She did not tell me to kill myself. This was my biggest fear. 

However, I could definitely tell that while I was explaining how bad my life is and why I suck so hard as a person, she was silently chuckling and thinking "wow this guy really is completely hopeless". 

I don't feel any better and I'm still planning to commit suicide as soon as I can. I'm hopeful I can do this tonight or tomorrow. No point waiting. 

Now back off to crying myself to sleep over what a worthless loser I am. Sorry for wasting your time.
