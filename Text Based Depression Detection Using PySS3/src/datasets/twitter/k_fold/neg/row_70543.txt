I CheatedHe was so loving and caring and selfless. I felt trapped and every time I tried to break up with him because I didn't love him the way he loved me, I couldn't. I'm such a fucking selfish coward I went behind his back and cheated. Wtf is wrong with me. I never thought i could betray someone in this way. I don't think there's anyway I could forgive myself
