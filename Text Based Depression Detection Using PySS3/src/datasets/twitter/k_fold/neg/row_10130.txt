I donâ€™t belong here..Iâ€™ve felt this way most of my life. I feel like o donâ€™t belong anywhere. Of course there are people who love me and I love them and I have two kids that need me even though I feel like they donâ€™t sometimes. I just wish I didnâ€™t exist anymore. Iâ€™ve written letters to those I love but I have not made plans. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™ve spoke to a therapist and while it does help me to vent about stress I still feel this feeling like I have no home anywhere on this Earth, I donâ€™t fit in anywhere and Iâ€™m just done. There isnâ€™t any amount of help or anything anyone can say to change this feeling. I just donâ€™t want to be alive anymore.
