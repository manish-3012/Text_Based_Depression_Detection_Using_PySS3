I'm here for youWe all are here for one reason or the other. Some people to say goodbye, other people to reach out and find someone with common ground to connect with. I don't have all the answers, idk who does. I just want to say that I'm here for you. I'll be your friend, I'll be your hero I'll be your shoulder to lean on.

   We struggle day in and day out with depression and anxiety. It's absolutely crippling. We can get a little bit relief in our current mental state by just having someone to talk to and by feeling loved for once, even by a total stranger on the internet. If you need someone in your life to talk to, please reach out to me. We're in this together and you and I can help each other get out of this hole we've dug.
