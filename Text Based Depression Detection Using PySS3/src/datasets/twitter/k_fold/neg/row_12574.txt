I have no motivation to live anymoreI have has depression since I was 12, and taken medication for it since I was 15(currently 21). Generally I've been okay since then, but on occasion I have had relapses. However, I have had a major relapse that started back in January and has shown little signs of improvements. For months I have been depressed with no motivation to get out of bed or go outside, and I have stopped enjoying this I use to find fun, and all of my goals for the future seem pointless. I am starting to see a Psychiatrist and a Therapist now and there have been adjustments to my medications since January but I have seen no improvements in my symptoms.

I realized now that I am 21 I can finally buy a gun, which not having access to one is really the only thing that stopped me sometimes in the past from killing myself. There is a gun store down the street from where I live and have been considering to go there and get one and kill myself for awhile, and might go tomorrow morning. And while I have no motivation to live, there is a part of me that doesn't want to die and wants help.
