I knew I wouldnâ€™t really do it. I just wanted to know what it might feel like.I know I canâ€™t kill myself, I canâ€™t do that to my parents. Iâ€™m just waiting for them to die so they dont get hurt. I just wanna know how it might feel. 

I jam a belt into the doorframe and fasten it around my neck, not tight, just enough to sort of feel the pressure. As I went to tighten it further, the thought flashed through my mind that I could die alone in this cupboard and no one would find me for weeks. 

just as I was about to tighten it right to my throat, I get a text message from my friend saying goodnight. I usually do not hear from this person. I love this person intensely. But not enough to really wanna stick around. The only people I owe my life to are my parents.

Iâ€™m still in the cupboard, crying in a pile of laundry. 

fuck 

someone save us. wtf am i talking about. no one can save me
