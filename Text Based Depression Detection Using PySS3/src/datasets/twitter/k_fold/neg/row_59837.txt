I cut myself tonightVery unhappy, and it is mostly my fault. I have been looking into other ways to harm myself but this was the most I had the confidence to do. There is no light at the end of the tunnel, and honestly it felt liberating. It was only a small knick, but I can see why this helps. I always hear cut down on your arm, not horizontally. I don't want to do that yet.
