LumpsSo I found some lumps, I don't know what they are and initially I panicked but now I am thinking that they could be the answer I have been looking for. If they are cancer lumps maybe it will be serious enough that I don't actually need to kill myself and that will be better for my kids. However,  I think that I should go to a doctor to see because atm I can't afford to be truly sick as i am still on my timeline. But also there is no point pinning my hopes on something that might turn out to be an infection or something.  My worry is this, if I see a doctor and it is cancer, they can't force treatment on me can they?
