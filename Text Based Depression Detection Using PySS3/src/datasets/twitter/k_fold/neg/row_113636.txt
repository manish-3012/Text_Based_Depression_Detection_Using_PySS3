Feeling lonely and a little panickyI just received some info that I don't know how to feel about, and I feel really lonely because I don't know who to talk to about it. Should I message my friends? I don't want to be a burden by complaining about my problems again, I've probably annoyed them enough by now.

I wish I had a best friend. Well, I do, but we haven't really talked and I don't know if I can talk to him about my problems out of the blue. Online friends and he's been busy lately.

Edit; messaged a good friend I promised I won't bother with my problems anymore, but she says she'll support me no matter wha so i guess im good. been a while since i cried haha
