Should I just do itThis plastic world is garbage. No one cares until your dead. Right now no one cares abt me. I could be on fire and they would ignore me still. But the moment I jump of that building or tie that rope or load that gun everyone â€œwants to be thereâ€. But they donâ€™t care. People only care abt you for a short while. If I were to die they would remember me for a couple months. But give it a year and Iâ€™m forgotten about. Besides I donâ€™t contribute anything to this world. One less person isnâ€™t that important
