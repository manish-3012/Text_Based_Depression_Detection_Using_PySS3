Fuck grade 10I have had a VERY SHITTY day. First theres a guy in my science class who was talking shit to me calling me a fag/quear i called him a druggy (im not totally against drugs as i smoke weed but he does hard shit) he got out of his seat and wanted to hit me but teacher caught him. So i laughed it off. I went to gym class and me and my Bestfriend started playing around poking each other in the ribs laughing he went all bipolar (he's not actually bipolar) and slammed me into the wall i was like ''dude chill i thought we are playing around'' i went to drawkick the soccer ball and guess who gets hit "him" he punched me in ny face now my lip is puffy sliced and bleeding. I then smoked him in the face 2 or 3 times and kicked him in the nuts he then layed off, i was told to go to the office i was so furious i punched a locker . We talk to the principal neither are in trouble. I went home so angry. i put 14 holes in my walls, smashed my dresser, took a knife stabbed my walls dresser chair everything screaming (keep in mind i NEVER get mad im a chill loveable guy) till my knife broke. I went full crazy slicing my arms. Im so mad 3 hours later im still angry and smashing stuff. I m depressed, he gave me a bloody lip and all i did was hit him, i always thought i could fight, all i hear is, looser im my head. i feel like the cash me outside chick. Im worried about tomorrow will everyone be nice to me, does the girl i love think im a looser, i dread tomorrow. Im most likely gonna fight the guy in my science class tomorrow. God i hope people will help me
