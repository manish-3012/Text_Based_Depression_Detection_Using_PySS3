I feel pointless and want to end myself but don't know how to handle talking about it with my wife.There's not really a lot to say I suppose. I've been out of work for a long time, I can't find anything, I feel like a worthless human being, I feel like I have no value to anyone. I feel like I'm just a burden to my family and friends. I feel like I have no future whatsoever.
I just can't fathom a logical reason to continue to live. It's not necessarily that I'm depressed, in fact, I feel entirely rational about it. I have no use or value so the best thing to do is just end my existence.

I want to talk to my wife about it but she has enough to deal with and I don't want to make it worse. If I was a single person I would have killed myself long ago. The only think keeping me from doing it is that I know it would destroy her if I did. I just don't want her to suffer, so I'm suffering so she doesn't have to.

What can I do? I don't have the answers. Please help me.
