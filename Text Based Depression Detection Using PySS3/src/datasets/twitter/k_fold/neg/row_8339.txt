I survived and I've realized my mistake.On February 9th at around 10 AM I took around 105 10mg tablets of adderall mixed with 8 cups of coffee. I have a heart condition that causes an extra electrical pathway to fire when my heart is under stress, which drastically increases the heart rate for short periods of time. I was hoping that this combination of factors would eventually trigger a heart attack. I was transferred to the hospital in an ambulance and after 52 hours of insomnia due to the stimulant, it was finally balanced in my system and I was medically cleared in the hospital. The Monday after I was transferred to a behavioral hospital in which honestly, I had some of  the worst and most bizarre experiences I've ever witnessed or been a part of. I realized that out of all my peers, I was the one who was able to handle my emotions without outwardly broadcasting them. I met people that were so fucked mentally I questioned if I belonged there. And after 8 days and 9 nights of captivity, they finally released me. I think after seeing how life could be so much shittier and with no possible way to end it, not even suicide, I learned how to endure the mundanity of everyday life and the longing for someone to share my feelings with in confidence until I finally find an opening and some control in the flow of my life.
