what they canâ€™t seethey donâ€™t know Iâ€™m ready to die.
they donâ€™t see the pain Iâ€™ve gone through.
they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m hurt.
they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m backed against a wall.
they donâ€™t know their words are lies.
they donâ€™t know me.
they donâ€™t know what they did.
they donâ€™t know my family.
they donâ€™t know what Iâ€™ve lost.
they donâ€™t know they keep hitting me.

they say they donâ€™t want my kind.
they say Iâ€™m dumb.
they say I have no business there.
they joke when they see me.
they donâ€™t know my capabilities.
they think I am unaware.

they donâ€™t know Iâ€™ve invented something.
they donâ€™t know my family will get the money.
they donâ€™t know the patent pending.
they do see my talents.

they ridicule me.
they blackmail me.
theyâ€™ve touched me when I didnâ€™t want it.
they steal from me.
they they blacklist me.
they hate me.

they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m ready to die.

they donâ€™t know when itâ€™s over they wonâ€™t have to hear from me ever again.

they donâ€™t know they will never know me.

they donâ€™t know Iâ€™m holding on for just one thing... my family &amp; what they may benefit from this small victory.

After that ... Iâ€™m dead.

see, this was always the plan ... 
to simply give and disappear.

Then they will all be happy,
know nothing,
and have something to laugh about.

because deep down inside I laugh
as I slowly fade away and I block them out
...
because Iâ€™m already dead.
