Second AttemptI never feel like I fit in anywhere, I never feel like I have friends. I think Iâ€™ve pushed my boyfriend over the edge with my mental illness and he has stopped loving me. Iâ€™m seeing a therapist, Iâ€™m on medication, nothing works. I think Iâ€™m doomed to be this way and I really think Iâ€™ll do it soon.
