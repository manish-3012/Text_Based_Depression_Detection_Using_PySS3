Some one please talk to meMy life isn't turning out to be what I wanted it to be. I moved twice to run away from my problems, and they are still hanging over my head. I can kill myself anytime. I'm sick of waking up every day to a bland life. I have no friends. No men approach me. I just got my certification in the field I want to work in, and I couldn't care less.
If I could have one thing back it would be my first love. I lived when I was with him. And he's been out of my life for almost 2 years..

I hate this. I'm miserable almost all the time. I can't keep on waking up every morning and going to a shit job with a shit life. I don't know what to do, please some one talk with me.
