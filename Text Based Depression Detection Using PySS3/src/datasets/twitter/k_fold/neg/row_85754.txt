Old poem i wrote.. How could you..How could you not see it?
It's 3 am and I'm sitting alone in the kitchen floor, no food around and yet a poorly hidden knife at my side and a cat that won't leave me be...
It's 1am and I'm in a bath full of water. No soap or cream but a razor blade on the ledge just out of reach...
It's noon were sitting in bed and I'm playing with a knife to see how sharp it is, I say I want to see if it can cut my hair and glide it across my skin. But you weren't looking. I don't have any hair on the inside of my wrist...
How could you not hear it coming...
On the kitchen floor, did you not hear the sniffles and whimpers..
In the tub, when you asked me if I was alright, did you not hear my mind screaming no as my voice trembled saying I'm okay...
In the bed, did you not hear when I quietly whined to myself because I pressed the knife down and it was to dull to peirce skin... 
How could you not notice?
How could you not notice the stains of tears all across my face..
How could you not notice the layers of clothes hiding scars, mental and physical...
How could you not notice, I was reaching out, I wanted to be saved..

How could you not know...
