The 29th4 years ago on the 29th I asked you to be with me. 2 years ago on the 29th I told my dad I was dropping out of college. This year, itâ€™ll be my last day. I think.... I donâ€™t know, I donâ€™t know anything anymore. I donâ€™t know how to live, how to talk, carry myself, just be myself. If I canâ€™t be myself then whatâ€™s the point of being.
