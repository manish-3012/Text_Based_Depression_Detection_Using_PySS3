Itâ€™s not getting betterSix months ago I made an anonymous post on another site saying how the answer I want to give to that age old question of â€˜where do you see yourself in five yearsâ€™ is dead. It was a throw away account and I thought Iâ€™d never use it again. 

But today, I used it again. 

I truly thought I was doing better and I thought I was doing okay. Until today at work I really thought about the last few weeks. Every single day Iâ€™ve thought of suicide and how I donâ€™t want to be here anymore. 

I want to talk to someone... I want someone to know Iâ€™m having these thoughts (not that theyâ€™re new... I tried to hang myself when I was in the 4th grade)... but Iâ€™m too terrified to ask for help.. Iâ€™m scared of what repercussions it will have in my life. 

Last Thursday I came home from work looked at my backpack and packed it. I left without a purpose or a destination... I didnâ€™t tell anyone where I was going. I didnâ€™t even know if Iâ€™d be back. Maybe that was my cry for help... just to see if anyone noticed I was gone. One person called me and talked to me while I was still driving unsure of where I was going. He listened while I cried he asked me to not do anything stupid not to do anything unsafe... and because of him.. I didnâ€™t. And he checked on me the next day. Thank you, Cameron. In that moment I think you truly saved my life. I woke up the next day and explored a national park.lt was beautiful.. but no one else noticed I was just gone (which is VERY unlike me). But I felt better and came back home. This lasted two days. 

Every single day Iâ€™ve thought of killing myself. Iâ€™ve had pills stashed away for two years because I know the day is coming. Sunday I got up off the couch and walked to go take them.. a text from a friend arrived just then and I stopped. Thanks John... you saved my life. This was a day I thought about having myself committed... but if I got committed would I get fired from my job? Probably. Will they put me on medication? Probably. Will I still be the â€˜funny, happy, carefreeâ€™ shell that everyone knows? Probably not. Iâ€™ve become so accustomed to wearing this mask that when it cracks people donâ€™t know who I am... and people donâ€™t want to be around that. 

When Iâ€™d have thoughts of killing myself when I was younger it was because I was sad or hurt and was tired of feeling that way. Now... I just feel blank. I feel heartbroken... but Iâ€™m not heartbroken... I feel sad... but Iâ€™m not sad. ... I feel angry.... but Iâ€™m not angry. I feel like Iâ€™m under water all the time.. and like someone is crushing my chest. I can literally feel my mind breaking and slipping... I literally feel this... I didnâ€™t know you could feel when that was happening... but I do. 

I know itâ€™s going to happen soon... and Iâ€™m oddly at peace with it. The only unease I feel is what this will do to my grandmother... sheâ€™s already lost a daughter and it almost killed her... she raised me... Iâ€™m her daughter... thatâ€™s the one bit of sadness I feel.
