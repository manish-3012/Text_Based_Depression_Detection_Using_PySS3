Fuck the Founding FathersI am a bipolar depressed, unemployed, uninsured, college graduate with 70k in debt. I can't hold down a job due to my mental state. I need help. But I do not have a right to help. I am also suffering from severe tooth decay do to not caring about myself for years. I need a dentist. But I do not have a right to a dentist. I do however have the right to buy a gun unrestricted and kill myself to solve all of my problems. Thanks Founding Fathers!
