My friend just told me her plans to kill herself. What do I do?She said she plans to overdose on her dadâ€™s prescription stuff Monday night. I didnâ€™t know what to say, so I just talked to her for like five hours last night. About pretty much everything. Just her life, about her. We were friends but not super close, yknow. So I tried to get to know her.


What do I say? She made me promise not to tell anyone/do anything. Obviously I canâ€™t just sit here and I donâ€™t want this to happen. Help. Please.

(Other pertinent info: she is probably anorexic. She doesnâ€™t eat ever. She also has very high social anxiety. Her dad is abusive but she doesnâ€™t resent him. Her younger brother is the only contact I have in her house besides her.)
