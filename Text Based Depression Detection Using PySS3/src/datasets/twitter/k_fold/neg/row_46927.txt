Iâ€™m too hopeless to live...Before I vent my ass off, I legitimately canâ€™t wait for this year to be over. 6 more days! I know itâ€™s nothing special because the switch to January 1 from December 31 is nothing more but a day change. Seriously though, it gives me an opportunity to make a new year better than what happened this year.

This year was by far my worst year. My senior year of high school ended abruptly so I had this super long break. Then later in august I started university which I wish I didnâ€™t. I did absolutely horrible as Iâ€™m currently enduring Christmas break. It took me a long time to get used to things and exams were quite confusing.

Anyways, Iâ€™ve decided to drop out of university completely. Iâ€™ve already paid this first semester so I donâ€™t plan on doing so for the next. Now I have absolutely no idea on what I wanted to do. I wish I learned earlier that I could go to community college instead or at least join the workforce. I feel like college isnâ€™t something until the frontal cortex is fully developed. Or when we can make good decisions.

I donâ€™t know what career would fit me. Iâ€™ve never had a job before. But I do enjoy reading, writing, and learning about healthcare and related sciences. Iâ€™m not a fan of math but itâ€™s mainly because I have a hard time understanding it. Weird thing is that I used to enjoy reading and problem solving a lot but I feel like Iâ€™ve gotten lazier. Like I get distracted too easily. I have to have something to play with in my hands in order to do something or else Iâ€™ll get fidgety.

I think the big problem with me is Iâ€™m afraid of being touched. I donâ€™t like anyone touching me anywhere, not even a simple high five or a handshake. Which this would be a problem in future job seeking. Iâ€™m not sure if itâ€™s from some past trauma but I donâ€™t like the feeling of another personâ€™s skin on me. I donâ€™t like people looking at me which I think theyâ€™re perverts if they do. This also makes me quite shy. Except when Iâ€™m online in an anonymous forum like this place. I sometimes get jealous or envious of others, and also defensive.

Iâ€™m hopeless arenâ€™t I?
