Mum just threatened me with not seeing my baby sister.So, my mum used something of mine without asking and broke it. I got a bit pissed off with her but she was completely dissmissive of how i was feeling. That pissed me off even more and i was so angry. She then threatened me with her not letting see my baby sister anymore, i then told her fine if thats how she wants it to be ( which was the hardest thing ive ever said in my life to my mum because my baby sister is my world, my light and my rock) and my mum then told me to stop being stupid. Im feeling really low now from the whole thig as i had already had a stressful day... im not really sure what to do at the moment... im just feeling really low and suicidal now.
