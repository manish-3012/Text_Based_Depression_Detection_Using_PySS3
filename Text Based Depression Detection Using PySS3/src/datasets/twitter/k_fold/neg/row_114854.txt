I don't knowI don't know why I feel so much worse today than any other day. I don't know why I am so mentally worn out that I feel physically ill. And I don't know why I can't sleep, even though I haven't had more than 20 minutes of light sleep at a time 4 or 5 times in the past 3 days.

But what I do know, is that I want to die. I'd rather not live this boring, uncomfortable life anymore.

I don't even know why I bother posting this. Not like any of you can help, when even doctors and meds have been failing me for years. I don't want to hear the "it gets better", "you will find purpose eventually", or especially the "I/other people love you" bullshit. You don't know me, even I don't know me. This is just kind of venting... a shout into the void.
