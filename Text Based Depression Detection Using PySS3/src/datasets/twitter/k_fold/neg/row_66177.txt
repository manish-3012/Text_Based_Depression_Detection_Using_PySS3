I feel emptyLong story short, there's a girl I love. We were together for almost a year before circumstances drove us apart. This was the best time of my life without comparison. We had no real issues, just bad luck. When it was over I was crushed. I put on 15 kilos, lacked motivation and hated myself. I saw her again today... She's seeing someone else. I've been borderline suicidal my whole life, constant bullying throughout school, and the death of my father, which I witnessed, being major contributors, but I've never felt like I've been stripped of a portion of myself. Now I don't even have anyone to give me a hug, and the Bolte bridge is looking real friendly. I'm scared of myself, and I'm scared of my world. I'm scared of this empty feeling in my chest that stops me breathing properly. I hate my throat that makes me feel like I'm choking on tears every day. I'm sick of not being able to be happy. If I don't feel better again by the end of the week, I don't think I'll be going any further.
