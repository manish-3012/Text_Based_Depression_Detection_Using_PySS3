How do you conquer feeling alone?My boyfriend of a 3-4 year on again, off again, relationship just broke up with me. He's usually the only person I turn to and spill my guts on about my depression. He was really the only person I even really spoke with and spent my days with. Now that he's gone and I really don't have anyone talk to, I just feel alone all the time. I haven't eaten all day, I just feel miserable. Sometimes I have a little glimmer of hope, but that quickly disappears. I don't know what to do. All I feel is sadness and I just want it to end.
