I canâ€™t do anything rightIâ€™ve always had issues going out in public but itâ€™s gotten worse i start having trouble breathing i feel nauseous i canâ€™t go out without a hood and at home all i do is stay up late crying or cutting the feeling off me to i feel like iâ€™m somewhat alive and have a migraine 24/7 my parents just think iâ€™m a burden i was in a group chat with some people i thought were my friends but they told me to kms and that i fuck up every thing bc i wasnâ€™t responding but theyâ€™re right i fuck up everything even the other day i tried to od and here am i even fucked up that all i did was vomit for a couple hours iâ€™m so pathetic iâ€™m so done with being alone iâ€™m so done with being unwanted but iâ€™m mainly mad at myself for being so weak of a person everyday is a struggle just get out of bed iâ€™m just so tired i want it to stop why wonâ€™t it just stop.
