Hitting rock bottom tonight. Single, lonely, unemployed. Going to drink a glass of vodka and swallow a pack of sleeping pills.This is so pathetic. It's the day before Thanksgiving and I'm alone. Single, unemployed. No girlfriend, no career. I'm going to swallow this bag of sleeping pills and vodka.
