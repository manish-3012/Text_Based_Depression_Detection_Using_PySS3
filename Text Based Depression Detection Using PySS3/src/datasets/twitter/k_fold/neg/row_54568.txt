I am not afraid of deathI am not afraid of death.
I am not afraid of the consequences of killing myself.
I am not afraid to die.
I am not afraid of how my family, my friends, my coworkers, will react.
I am not afraid of the pain. 
I am not afraid to kill myself.
I am afraid of the what ifs.
I am afraid that if I give up now, I'll miss out on my dreams
My whole life I've wanted kids, a family.
I've wanted fame, fortune.
I've wanted a house with a pool. 
A career I love.
I'm young, 18, all of those things are ahead of me.
That's was keeps me here, but if anything were to happen that would lead me to believe that I will not achieve my dream, no matter how hard I try, I will kill myself. 
For so long, I thought I was a coward. I thought I was a poser. I though I wasn't suicidal, I just thought about suicide a lot. Every second of everyday suicide is in my mind. It's a way out. I just can't choose it knowing that one day, I could be happy. That one day all of this pain, this darkness could be gone. That feeling you get right in between your ribs of just emptiness. Of just dark, hollow, despondency. I'm not happy. I'm not anything anymore. If I just let go now, I could be free. But the what ifs always get me. If I kill myself now, I'll never see my children, never swim in my pool, never have a job I'm excited to go to. That's all I want. But if I stick it out, and I never have kids, a family, then why? Why stay and suffer? I guess that's how it is though. You can't leave without giving something up. Am I naive for even thinking I could get everything I've wanted? Am I stupid for thinking one day this could go away? That one day I won't have suicide in my mind, I wont know how I would do it. What my note would say. Who I would give my stuff to. Am I naive for thinking this all could be over someday?
