Only path I see is deathIt's so hard to sit with someone and watch them live their lives happily.

It's not fair that I've gone through so much.

I wish I could get treatment but I don't have any power or money to make that happen.

It hurts to breath and I wish it would suffocate and kill me and I hate going to bed like this and waking up like this.
