Donâ€™t want to be here anymoreI feel like I am nothing but a disappointment and a failure to myself and my family. No matter what I do I feel like everyone gets mad at me. My wife, my mother, my sister...just everyone. I go through the motions everyday and just pray to be taken from all of this. The only thing keeping me here is the fact that my wife and I are expecting a baby girl in March. But even that is starting to give away to the temptation of just ending it all. Iâ€™m tired of being anxious every day, and tired of being always sad. Tried therapy twice but it just doesnâ€™t stick.  I wish I could just be happy but itâ€™s like every time a little piece of me becomes happy there is this little voice in my head reminding me of why I shouldnâ€™t be. I donâ€™t know if I can keep doing this anymore.
