Broke downI broke down in front of my boss today. Went back to talk to him because we are close and he knows about my struggles. I couldn't hold it in. Everything that had built up inside of me just came out. Tears and muttering. I'm embarrassed. Luckily he is very understanding. But I still feel like shit. Why the fuck do I have to be this way? Why am I cursed with these types of emotions and sensitivities? Not only that, but I had a fight with a coworker. It's all fine now and we both walked away with no hard feelings. I didn't even necessarily do anything wrong and yet I still feel like shit and can't get it out of my head. I can't relax. Every minute more and more wait is added to me just weighing me down. I can't breathe or think without a feeling of sadness and despair over me. Each moment is just me wishing that I could just turn my life off. Like a lightbulb, just flip a switch and it's out. I just want it to be over. I hate myself and how I'm wired. How I look. Just how I am.
