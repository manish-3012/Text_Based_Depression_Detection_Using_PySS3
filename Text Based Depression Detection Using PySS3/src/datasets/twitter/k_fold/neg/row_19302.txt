I have no reason to get up besides going to work.I've been struggling with depression since fall of last year. For awhile it was ok and i felt like i was going to get over it and go back to my happy care free self, but sometime in early June i contracted herpes both genital and oral which gave me an overwhelming sense of hopelessness. Along with this i feel no need to try for any romantic relationships anymore because i don't want to have to tell anyone i have herpes. I slept for 18 hours today because i had to reason to wake up. I do this everyday i don't have work. The only thing that keeps me from killing myself if how badly i think it would affect my mom and sister. So any words of encouragement would be very much appreciated.
