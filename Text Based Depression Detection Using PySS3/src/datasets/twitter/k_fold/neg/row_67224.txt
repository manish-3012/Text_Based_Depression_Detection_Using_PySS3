I dont know what to die anymoreGuys I don't know where else to turn or what to do anymore.ni thought I was getting better, I thought I was happier but this last two weeks I've been spiralling so hard, I've started cutting after 12yearsnof not, I always made a promise to myself I would never commit suicide, but I want to so badly. I'm so tired. I'm so tired of pretending everything's okay when it's not. I'm so ready to just give up. I don't know what to do. My heart aches for peace. Sorry for the rant I just don't know where else to turn.
