nah like life aint even goodfor real tho   


the chances of being born with a bad life statistically are higher than being born with a good life... having a good life with good cards is such a rarity... 

and even if u were born with a good deck of cards, into a good non abusive family, not in a starving third world country, and not with bad genetics... you gotta work so hard at some shit job just to even put food on the table.. 

and its like not even that fun after all that work... theres nothing to do except fake normie shit with fake friends and fake lives and fake happyness...

and its all vapid and meaningless

in the end, life aint even that good. Even if I wasn't depressed, I still wouldn't wanna be alive. Why am I forced to play part in this game? Shouldn't I have the right to "Quit" if I wanted to?
