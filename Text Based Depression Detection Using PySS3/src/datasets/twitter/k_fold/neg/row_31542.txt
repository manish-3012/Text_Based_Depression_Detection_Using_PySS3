I wish I could either enjoy this life or hate it enough to end itI wish I could just enjoy this life. I don't hate it enough to want to end it.  
There's so many things I like and I wish I could enjoy.

But my head is fucked. I suffer from a severe case of OCD, and I know I will never get rid of it. Meds barely help, and when they do, they numb my mind so I can hardly pay attention anymore. It doesn't help that I've also been in an abusive relationship that completely shattered my self-esteem and to this date, fuels my OCD. I hate going to therapists. I never feel understood and can hardly open up to them.  


I was in a long-distance relationship with another girl who suffered through similar struggle. I felt truly understood and immediately got too clingy for my own good. But she was emotionally unstable and highly suicidal herself. One day, she disappeared and never came back. I can only assume that she ended her own life, and I can't really get over it. I don't think I'd ever be able to meet someone like her again.  


I honestly hate this state. I can neither enjoy life nor am I at a point yet where I truly want to end it permanently.  
I'm not suicidal, but I definitely can't rule out I will never be there. I have severe disorders, engage in self-harming behaviors and seek comfort in suicidal thoughts.
