Itâ€™s better to be goneIâ€™ve had countless of suicide thoughts over the years but I never went along with them. The problem has always been within my family, and when I try to address this problem with them, they call me ungrateful or laugh. I ran away from home once and my parents didnâ€™t bother finding me, only calling me saying they donâ€™t like what Iâ€™m doing. They sent my brother to get me and he only laughed and took pictures. Iâ€™ve had countless dreams where I keep running away from home, running away from my family. I even had two dreams where I slit my throat in front of them and died. I tried telling my dad once about my sexuality and cried in front of him for the first time, he only gave me a bible and told me to quit basketball so I wouldnâ€™t be a lesbian anymore. My mom says things out of anger and I honestly canâ€™t live with it, especially at those time when Iâ€™m supposed to stay home. They call me the rude child, have the highest expectations for me, and think that anxiety and mental illnesses arenâ€™t real. Isnâ€™t it better to end all the suffering? It must be...
