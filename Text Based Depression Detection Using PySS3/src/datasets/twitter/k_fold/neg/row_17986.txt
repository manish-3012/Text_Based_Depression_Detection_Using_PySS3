Still hanging on by a thread, wishing I could just let goThe depression just keeps getting worse.  Itâ€™s so deep and so painful.  Nothing is helping.  My meds arenâ€™t helping, the therapy isnâ€™t helping, I donâ€™t know what else to do.  I canâ€™t stand feeling like this.  I can barely function this way.  It just feels hopeless.
