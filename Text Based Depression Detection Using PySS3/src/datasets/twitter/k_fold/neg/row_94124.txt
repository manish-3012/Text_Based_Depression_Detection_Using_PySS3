Parents had me for purely selfish reasons. Human beings are a disease. It's no wonder that life is suffering because they are the ones that want more things and more kids when less is more. Man or women, both reproduced out of selfish reasons and never thought of what long term impact this might have and it's no wonder why war keeps breaking out. It's because we realize that our own purpose was the result from our parent's bad choices. Fuck having kids. It does the planet and this universe and everyone around us a dis-service.

I rather die than carry forward my legacy forward(whatever this means) to the next generation.

I have had no fun in my life and ALWAYS DID SHIT THEY WANTED ME TO DO...I FUCKING HATE BEING A SLAVE TO MY PARENTS AND I RATHER HAVE FREEDOM THAN SECURITY.
