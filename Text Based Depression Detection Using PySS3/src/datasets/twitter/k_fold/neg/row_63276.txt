Nobody online or IRL fucking listens to what you're sayingThey think they've fucking listened but they havent- they've read a couple words and then twisted it to suit themselves so they can call you a fucking idiot and stroke their own egos

I'm done with reddit, I am done with the people I know and I am fucking done with life. I hate everyone and everything, people just don't fucking read properly or listen they only take in what THEY WANT TO FUCLING HEAR
