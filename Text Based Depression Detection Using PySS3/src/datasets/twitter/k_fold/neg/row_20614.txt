I feel so lostIâ€™ve never been on Reddit before just I really just need to talk to someone. Iâ€™ve called several hotline/crisis centers and they all just tell me the same thing like donâ€™t think about it, focus on your school work, when I just want affirmation/someone to listen, not give advice. If anyone is willing to listen I really need a friend right now.
