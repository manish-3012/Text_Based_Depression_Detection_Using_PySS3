My Girlfriend cheated on meMultiple times. The same ex she swore she doesnt even think about. I seen her call history. She told me she's been texting her from an app to hide it from me. She's even picked her up a few times. Then come home to me. She even swore to God she was telling the truth so I asked the ex personally. This isn't the reason why I want to end it but its pushed me to this point. That was 2 hours ago. I'm still alive because I cant think of a quick way to do it. I dont want a positive response or you'll be okay/ it'll get better. I just want someone to know. I'm scared. To be honest. But I was never meant to be here.
