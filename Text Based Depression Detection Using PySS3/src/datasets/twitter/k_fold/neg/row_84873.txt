20 and ready to give upI've dealt with severe depression and anxiety for several years now. I've seen doctors, been on medication, and gone to therapy but nothing seems to help anymore. I've lost most of my friends and my boyfriend, and most of them won't talk to me or have blocked me. My parents are unsupportive and always tell me how miserable I make them and that they want to cut me off. I feel completely alone. When I try to talk about how I feel or how I'm struggling people tell me that I'm manipulative and selfish which makes me want to end my life even more. 
I've tried killing myself before and have almost succeeded, and I'm ready to try again. The only reason I haven't attempted suicide in the past year is because I'm scared of surviving. I used to have a little bit of hope that would prevent me from harming myself as well but it's gone now. I don't know what to do anymore. I plan on ending my life when I go back to college and am in my one bedroom apartment again because I know that no one will be there to stop me or know what's happening. I just can't keep going. People tell me they're exhausted by me but I'm exhausted from trying to keep living.
