"It gets better" MY ASS, I gave myself 2 years and things only got worse. I'm planning to do it I've set a date. I'm done with this.Seeking professional help made me more suicidal. Why haven't I killed myself yet? The reason is funny: I don't have the tools to do it. I've done a lot of research on suicide methods. Getting hit by a truck or a train, not possible. At least not during the lockdown. I can't find a rope anywhere in the house. I tried doing it with wire but it didn't work. Maybe I should've tied it differently or maybe it needs to be thinner I know cutting wrists or slitting throat doesn't really have a high chance of death. Taking pills/ overdosing doesn't sound very promising either. I know a lot of people tried it and ended up damaging their organs instead of dying. The only option that I have is jumping off of one the tall buildings in the city. There are two tall buildings in the city that I can think of. They both are under construction. Which means I don't need a key to get on top. If one of the constructors or the guards there tried to stop me, I'll just run as fast as I can. I know they might try to grab me, but it's worth a try.
