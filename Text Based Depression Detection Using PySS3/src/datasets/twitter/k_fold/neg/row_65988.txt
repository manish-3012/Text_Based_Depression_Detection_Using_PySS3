I donâ€™t have the capacity for real life anymoreI deleted my twitter because it was too attached to my real life. I only use fan accounts now. I donâ€™t ever want to talk to my friends, it just reminds me that I like someone whoâ€™s one day not gonna text me back because theyâ€™re too busy with their s/o or are out on a date (which is fine because itâ€™s their life and they should be able to do what they want with it and love who they want, but it just hurts to see and i feel so selfish for that.) Real life is so hurtful and painful I wish i could abandon everything that reminded me of it.
