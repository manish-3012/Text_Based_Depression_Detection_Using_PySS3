My life is a torture triangle.**Backstory:**

Hi, I'm 15, and I hate my life right now. Some people might think that my reasons are unimportant or that there are worse things that can happen to you in life, but I just want to get it out there. From the start, I was born in Ukraine and lived there for about 4 years, we then moved to Belgium because my dad could make more money there. By the way, my parents had a shitty life in Ukraine (this is important for later). Honestly moving there wasn't so bad, in fact it was the best thing that happened to me. I learned to speak Dutch, made allot of friends, we spent *allot* of time together, life  was great. Things started when I entered middle school, my big friend group fell apart, and my best friend went to a different school, so I was feeling depressed for a little while. We still talked to each other on Discord and things were, *okay.* School hit me like a train, I had to make friends all over again, which was hard to do since people in my class were assholes, also I started failing school, I mean I was an overachiever my whole life and yet here I was with shitty grades, disappointing my parents. The sad part is that all of this happened during Christmas, this was the moment when I started to hate Christmas, not only did I not receive any presents, (I'm not even talking about my birthday), but I got into big fight between me and my parents. It was a really annoying year. Second year felt like it didn't even exist because pretty much nothing happened and I just didn't care, the only thing that I remember is the big Christmas fight that was even worse than last years. Now when third year started (third year = freshman year in Belgium), I thought this was going to be the best year ever, I had great classmates and even some older friends were in my class, things were going great, until they weren't. Introducing...   


**The torture triangle**:  


I make my parents depressed because I have bad grades and because of me being depressed, my dad starts getting stressed which leads to medical problems and that makes my mom depressed, fun fact about my mom: When I was 6, I was sick, ALL OF THE TIME, so that made her paranoid for me becoming sick which turned her into a cleaning torture machine, sometimes I feel like she doesn't even care for me and who I am, my interests, school, all she cares about is if I'm alive and well and that's literally it. Also she doesn't even have a job because she was too lazy and scared to learn Dutch for 10 years, which made my dad so mad that he wanted divorce. She puts hygiene above literally everything and does unnecessary actions which make everything she does 100 times harder or longer than they should be. Also every trip to anywhere goes to shit because we are always late because of her, there wasn't a single time when we had a trip without yelling or anger and us being right on time. Every day there is a fight about the dumbest of things, which makes me depressed and not want to be a part of this family anymore, so I just run of to my room and sit on my computer all day long with my friends, usually, because now I can't anymore thanks to my dad.

Because of my bad grades my dad claims that me being on my computer all day is the source of my bad grades and he's right, but It's also my only source of happiness. So he allows me to spend about 1 hour a day (including my phone) which is just a bombshell for me, I can't make videos anymore, I can't laugh anymore, I can't spend time with my friends anymore,I can't play anymore, I feel lonely. And instead, I have to read 3 books which consist of 500 pages each, IN Ukrainian (a language in which I never read) which is 1500 pages, great. When I read, all I can think about is: my friends are enjoying life together without me and they don't have to worry about the shit that I worry about. Why do I think so much about my friends? I have no siblings, there is nobody I can share my feelings with, because my parents don't care about my feelings, all they want is for me to do work. My friends are the only people in life who I can speak with freely. Not having siblings means I have no motivation for school, because I wouldn't have rivalry to motivate me to be better than them, meaning that all my parents have is me and I'm their only chance, which is a huge burden for me. 

I can't be myself because I have to fulfill my parents' wishes, also I have to listen to how awful their life was back in the day, which makes my problems seem meaningless, which makes me guilty for existing and thinking my problems are problems. The thing is, I can't possibly know how my parents' life was because I could never possibly experience what they have experienced. I have my own problems and my own scale, my parents couldn't possibly understand the things that I'm dealing with. Over time I also realized that I'm more poor than other kids, so I feel very separated from them. Also over the last couple of weeks my friends have been avoiding me at school because I can't socialize online anymore, and it just makes me feel empty and even more lonely. My only motivation in life right now is my friends cheering me up and me spending time on my computer/phone. Please end me..  


TLDR; My depression and my bad grades torture my parents, which makes them fight to the brink of divorce, my mom tortures us with her hygiene, my dad tortures me by making me do everything I don't want to do and take away all happiness that I have. Fuck my life.
