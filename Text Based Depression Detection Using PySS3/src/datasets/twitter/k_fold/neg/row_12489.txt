Life is living the same thing. Over and over again until you grow tired of it and decide you want to die.Today, my father tried to strangle me. If he tried to strangle me, it must be something horrible i did! Yes, indeed quite horrible. I sat on my chair for online classes so long that it began to stink. But instead of doing something any responsivle adult would do, instead my father reacts by first yelling at me, then when I try to explain, he tries to strangle me. If you've seen my previous posts, you know this is nothing new. Ive never put value onto my name. Only the things I own. So when i die, people will find them and make whatever money they can off of it. Im seriously beginning to consider changing my due date. Maybe then it'll decrease the pain I bear when I die.
