Not sure what im doing. Everyone i love has left me.I posted here a few days ago on a different account about taking a box of benadryl. In the end i only took about a third of the box. Another friend that I love (like a sister) just told me she didn't want to be my friend anymore either today and she blocked me on social media. while i was sad and crying i ended up dming the person i love about why everyone is leaving me. i shouldn't have done that and he ended up blocking me. then i went on skype and i acidentally sent an invite (I was planning on doing that months from now, not today). Now i feel like everyone i love is gone, as my other best friend is also gone aside from the one i loved as a sister. and my romantic love is gone and i feel like a stalker. all ive been doing for thge past few hours is checking what medications i have here would kill me painlessly but the ones that would kill me will just make me die painfully. I'm not sure what to do
