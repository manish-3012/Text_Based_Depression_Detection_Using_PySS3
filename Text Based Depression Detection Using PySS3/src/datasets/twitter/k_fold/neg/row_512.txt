Iâ€™m So Tired Of TryingIâ€™m 39 F. All my life Iâ€™ve been different and unattractive. Growing up I was told that eventually Iâ€™ll be normal and then people wonâ€™t pick on me as much about my looks, but that hasnâ€™t been the case. I refuse to leave my house because Iâ€™m tired of people staring at me or making ugly faces when I try to smile at them. I feel like Iâ€™m just bothering everyone. By now, unless I miraculously come across a lot of money, my looks arenâ€™t going to change and unfortunately will probably get worse now that Iâ€™m aging. It makes me feel like Iâ€™d rather be dead then endure another 40 years of misery. I donâ€™t have the courage to hurt myself, but I wish all of the time that Iâ€™d not wake up in the morning.
