:(I've always wanted to kill myself.  But for a long time, I've been able to tell myself, maybe it'll get better tomorrow.  But it hasn't, not really.  Its a little bit better, but it isn't good enough.  No one knows, and it would shock every person I interact with in the real world.  But today is the first time in a long time that I feel the urge strongly.  Today I snapped at one of my only friends for making the mistake... of talking to me :(  My girlfriend isn't very attractive and last night she got upset that I laughed at something she said in a joking tone.  I can't do this much longer.  I feel complicated.  I simultaneously want to like people, but hate how they interact, they are confusing. I want a simple happy life and I'm never going to get it
