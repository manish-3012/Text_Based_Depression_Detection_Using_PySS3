Why can't my mom accept I want to kill myself?She has a son that has done much better. Went to college at the right age. Graduated at the right age. Got the traditional college experience. I flunked kindergarten. Graduated high school at 19. Will graduate college at 25 and still live with my parents. I transferred to USC to get the college experience but I am a dumbass for overlooking the money. Plus I am 22. No longer 18. And 3 years at USC isn't 4. I commute an hour and 30 now from school thanks to my stupidity.Having the college experience I desire is only now such a distant dream and impossible at this point no matter what I do. It's so weird that I am my mom's favorite. She has the perfect son. Yet she's so blind. Me dying won't be such a bad thing. She's going to have a son that is much more responsible (especially financially), competent, and intelligent. He's going to Switzerland for his job! Most of all, he's confident enough that he will get married and give her grandchildren! I told her the other day that I have been having suicidal thoughts and she cried. I was confused. It's obvious to me who really should be the favorite. When I die, I hope she will discover she's much better off.
