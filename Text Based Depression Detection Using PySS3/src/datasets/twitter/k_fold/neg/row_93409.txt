I'm trapped...Each day, I'm having a hard time justifying my own existence, why I should even bother rolling out of bed in the morning.

Collectively, in my household, we have way too many bills piling up and nowhere near enough money. We barely have 2 pennies to rub together, it seems. I do have a job, but it's like a hair above minimum wage and soul-crushing as all hell. My free time is basically spent helping another family member pursue a dream, a dream that I'm less &amp; less convinced will actually come true. I feel like I'm trapped and have nowhere to run or go to. I feel so fucking alone, like I'm suffocating. 

I don't know what else to do except end it. I feel like there's no real way out.
