Thinking about it constantlyHave been slowly killing my liver by drinking extreme amounts; my life has been getting worse. I think a lot about getting it over with and I have a bunch of pills. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of nights recently drunk and holding all the pills in my fist thinking about it. At least killing myself is my choice.
