I HATE my lifeI DONT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON. I do not understand people when they speak to me. I dont understand reading or what people say when they talk. I cant answer questions irl bc i dont have enough time to understand and process the question. I dont understand anything happening around me or how to process things. Alls I do to get through life is smile often, do my best to mimic other people to fit in, and eventually fucking kill myself bc I am unable to do basic tasks to provide for myself. My options are A. be abused by people that share their resources B. KILL MYSELF C. Be fucking homeless or a fucking sex slave since I CANT FUCKING DO ANYTHING and NO ONE IRL FUCKING GETS THIS. I have been set up for failure. I have been set up to fucking kill myself. people are like "oh youre smart" "oh youre just a perfectionist" WTF I  DONT UNDERTSTAND ANYTHING. I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO READ. I HAVE NEVER READ A BOOK IN MY LIFE. I DONT KNOW HOW TO DO BASIC MATH. I DONT KNOW HOW TO TELL TIME UNLESS IT IS A DIGITAL CLOCK. I DONT FUCKING KNOW WHAT PEOPLE SAY WHEN THEY ARE SPEAKING IT FEELS LIKE I HAD A TIME LEAP AND AM NOW PROCESSING TWO WORDS. IDK WHT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING. MY FAMILY IS ABUSIVE AND THEY DONT FUCKING CARE EITHER. SOCIETY DOESNT GIVE A FUUUUUUCK ABOUT ME. I TRY TO GET HELP. I HAVE GONE TO THE FUCKING DOCTORS I HAVE TRIEN TO GO TO CLINCIS I HAVE TRIED TO GO TO ALL SORTS OF PLACES THE COPBS BLAAAHHHH BLAHHHH BLAHHHH. EVERYONE IRLLL DISMISSES ME .....
