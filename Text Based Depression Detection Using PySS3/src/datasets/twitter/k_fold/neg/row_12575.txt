My existence is hopefully coming to an end. Maybe. Idk.My mind, it always races, races to just find the most sickly and most foul way to commit suicide, and at the same time, it tries to distance myself from my family and friends so I don't have to give them trauma. 

My mind races in public, online, when I'm alone. I find out how people act, and all the ways I can appease them and try to get on their good side to feel like I'm needed, I'm naturally kind to others. But at the same time, I'm always on my toes. Constantly guarding myself against others just incase if I were to say, be mugged, kidnapped, attacked, etc. I don't trust anyone. I'm always thinking about how I'm wrong compared to other's opinions, such as politically, morally, etc. Its so difficult to think anymore. How im self conscious about my stomach, the way I walk, how close I am to others in order to not draw attention or worry, not seeing or hearing well, forgetting a shit ton of things.

I can barely think.

And not only that, but this fucking burden of a blackened hole in my heart and my mind doesn't make it better. I want to never hurt anyone, I want to be alone forever. I'm not worthy of relationships. I shouldn't be allowed to live, I should never have existed. I fucking hate this depressive asshat of a mind, but at the same time I find comfort in it. Knowing the pain will go away.

I don't know when or how, maybe a few years, once I move out. Maybe after this pandemic. Maybe by bleeding out in an alleyway alone, maybe a quick death by gun shot, I don't know.

But I'm hoping it will happen.

Just. I hope when I'm cut off and away from everyone I've ever known.

Never to be seen again.

Fuck this existence

Fuck humanity

Fuck being self conscious

Fuck this world

And most of all, fuck my existence.
