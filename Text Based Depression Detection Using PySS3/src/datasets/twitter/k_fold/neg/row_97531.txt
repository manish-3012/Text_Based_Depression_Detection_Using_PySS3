why i want to kill myselfi have no money and no power. all the abuse i got, i feel everyday like im nothing and that everyone else is above me. judging me, mocking me, looking down on me. but i hate everyone too, i hate working for others and making them rich and getting paid crap. i hate how disgusting rich people act like they have the model of the universe figured out. yet they are built on taking advantage of people. every area in this society is a scam to take advantage of you...not just financially but emotionally. we are all slaves in chains but dont even realize it. getting taken advantage of in every way we can think. so i went into my own business, i was good for a few years but I got an injury that put me out of business. im not pulling my fair share in my relationship anymore. all the things new i thought would bring me success have been failures. the debt companies are constantly lying, charging me late fees and over-charging me. they put me on a payment plan and then just decided to abandon it last month and wanted $1000 from me. they charge me late fees ever month even though i have it on automatic deduction. my dad emails me all the time telling me how angry and disappointed he is in me. my mom insults me constantly calling me fat and ugly and a failure. i have also developed health problems because the only escape i have are drugs. im gonna kill myself. i really will. i believe in god and i think he is an evil sadist self righteously disguised as a teacher. when i die i hope i go straight to hell with no stops. the people i see there will all be my friends
