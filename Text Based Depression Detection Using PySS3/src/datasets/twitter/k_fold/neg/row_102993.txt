Why bother?Truly, I don't see a reason to continue living. I hate this. I hate myself. Whats the point in trying if you tick every box for 'Failure'?  If you KNOW that you'll never really be happy.
I'm still young, I dont want to waste years of my life hoping to one day be happy because I doubt that day will come. I'm tired. I'm drained. I'm hurting. I'm weighing my options as to wether I'd rather die once or live everyday. I'm still not sure.
I would much prefer to live. But at what point are you at such a negative, at such a disadvantage, that it just doesnt feel worth it to try. I know that the world is absolutely beautiful, but only to those who it favors. I love life but hate living if that makes sense. Maybe I'm just dramatic.
