I am freaking outI don't know what has gotten into me but I am undergoing some sort of mental breakdown in which I feel completely and utterly unstable. My emotions are killing me though I paradoxically feel apathetic. I cannot pay attention to my school work though I need to. I cannot read. I cannot do anything. I feel completely lost. I cannot direct my attention to anything. I am such garbage. I fucking hate existence right now. I can barely even find the incentive to write this. For what? You know. I can philosophize. I can find meaning in the arbitrary. I can give valid, actual advice containing substance. I can help myself. But right now I feel as if I am completely wrecked. 

I think it may be because I have been taking ADHD medicine for a week. And these past two days I have not. I have slept for a total of like 30 hours these past two days. I clearly have ADD. But I am unmedicated. I guess I forgot what it is like to be the 'actual' me. I am so fucked.
