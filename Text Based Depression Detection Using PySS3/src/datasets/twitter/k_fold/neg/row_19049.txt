Last post with a gun in my handI just can't anymore. I believe nothing will ever change. This shit is like cancer, once it gets a hold of you, you done. I'll admit it's my fault it's all like this so I'm not not gonna point fingers at someone else. I decided I was gonna end my life on December 31 because I love Christmas time but god damn it I just can't wait anymore. I'm just drinking what I got left, smoking what I got left, listening to whatever I had liked and its check out time. I seriously wish everyone luck in this god awful torment you face everyday, I couldn't do it but maybe something will change for you. Life for the both of us yeah? Goodbye everyone.
