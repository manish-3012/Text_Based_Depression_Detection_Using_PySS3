I want people to hate me.It's strange but has become clear to me. I'm not quite sure why; maybe it's because I want my miserable life to be justified, or perhaps I'm just that starved for attention that I don't mind being despised. 

I think it may be the latter as I am unable to establish worthwhile relations built on compassion and friendship, I've been alone for the past 5 years without anyone to talk to. No one acknowledges my existence, but by having people hate me and say hurtful things towards me I feel really good; because I'm finally being recognized.

I achieve a strange sense of joy and happiness when being actively detested. I've wallowed in despair for over a decade, I'm used to feeling like shit. So when people other than myself hate me, I feel fulfilled and validated, it's a sublime feeling. 

But life still lacks reason, and I don't think I want to live anymore. I will hang myself.
