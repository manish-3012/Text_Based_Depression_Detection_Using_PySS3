I have an appointment with my clinical psychiatrist tomorrow.As the title says, I have an appointment with my clinical psychiatrist tomorrow finally!! after a wait of three months!! 

I was wondering, what do people say in these sessions?? Can I tell them that I'm feeling suicidal for the past months? Can I tell them that I have attempted suicide multiple times this year? If I told them that, what will they do? Are my parents going to be informed? Are the police going to be involved too??

I'm scared and stressed about this appointment. Please help :)
