Does Life Ever Get Better or Just Die NowI feel like every time I have a small reprieve from intense suicidal thoughts I always regress back within a short period of time. It's almost as if I'm merely bridging the gap between periods of despondency. Does life ever improve for a significant period of time or am I stuck in this endless cycle? If so, I really have no reason to live (though I probably should kill myself ASAP regardless of the answer.)
