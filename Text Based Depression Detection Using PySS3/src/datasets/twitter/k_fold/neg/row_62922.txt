it's been too overwhelmingevery day i wake up and am reminded how much of a failure i am. i am nothing but a waste of oxygen. my family thinks nothing of me, and would do nothing for me. they are neurotic, abusive, and controlling. and yet here i am still at home. studying at a university that i hate more than life itself, studying something that sparks no real passion in me, hoping every day that i might just drop dead. i hate my family, i hate myself for being so negative and bringing down the few people that graciously spend their time to talk to me, i hate that i let myself go on with this facade that i have anything of value to offer the world, and i hate that i didn't take the opportunity to leave home the moment i graduated. i graduated a scholar who overcame adversity and life-threatening illness and here i am a well below average university student struggling to pass first year courses. i wish i could just drop dead. i just want to die. i've dug myself too deeply into this hole. there is no way out anymore. i just need to do everyone a favour and fade.
