Realizing how im such a retard at 26Last year god my drivers liscese and a month later my parents borrowed grand dads car well theirs in the shop

I use it to go get mcdonalds and my mom tells me when I get back "I don't think  grandpa wants you using the car ,something about insurance  reasons or something"

Obviously I think my mom is just dumb since it clearly wouldn't matter but they were just afraid to tell me he didnt want me using the car because I was inexperienced 


So couple days later I take car to grandparents and when they find out I'm still driving it  my grandpa says they planned on taking the car back that night so why don't they just take me home .

I realize now they just didn't want mt driving it and made up the shit about wanting it back that night .

God i feel like such a retard for not noticing that shit till now. Same with my mom saying the car didn't need a emissions sticker ,i knew it needed one and thought she was just dumb but I know realize she was trying to trick me  and wasn't actually dumb

My brain hurts from realizing this ,like actually hurts and i just want to die  and killmyself
