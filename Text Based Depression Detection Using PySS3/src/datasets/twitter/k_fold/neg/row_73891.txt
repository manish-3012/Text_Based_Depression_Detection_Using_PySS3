I keep thinking about suicideIâ€™m a 25 y.o. male.

I have attempted suicide as a teenager several times. I realized that failing to commit suicide is problematic because of the health risks if you survive. I wouldnâ€™t want to commit suicide in any way that would leave my body in some kind of condition that would traumatize whoever finds me. I donâ€™t want to commit suicide via anything that takes too long or is particularly painful. 

This has basically kept me from committing suicide whenever I have felt like maybe I ought to. 

Iâ€™m also worried about my siblings. 2 of 3 have attempted suicide, one several times. His best friend overdosed recently as well. I think my death would be the tipping for him. 

For all those reasons I wonâ€™t commit suicide, I donâ€™t think.

But I am frustrated. I feel overwhelmed, I feel despondent. I feel so much regret, sorrow and pain from what has happened to me. 

Iâ€™m exhausted. Sometimes when Iâ€™m not working and I finished errands/chores Iâ€™ll sit on my couch with my cats. Iâ€™ll think about the child abuse I experienced, the relationship violence I experienced, the stressful educational experience I had, or the stressful professional conditions I face. I think about all the things Iâ€™ve done that I wish I hadnâ€™t, the loved ones I no longer have. I feel alone, worthless, pathetic. 

In those moments I entertain suicide. I imagine how I could do it in a way that minimizes the collateral damage, with 100% lethality and as little pain as possible.
