No PointIâ€™ve made 2 emergency moves this month. Once out of an abusive parentâ€™s house, and once out of a toxic renting from a family situation. I finally moved to a place where I finally felt welcomed and accepted; a friendâ€™s house. They have a dog, 2 cats, and an abundance of stuff to do to keep me distracted from the depression. Today one of my roommates got a job offer. The job is across the country and I donâ€™t have the means to go with them. I have nowhere else to go. I donâ€™t have other friends or family members to move in with. I hate my job, I hate myself, and I hate the pain that so many â€œloved onesâ€ have caused me. The only therapist Iâ€™ve gone to was an abuse apologist. The crisis text line and the suicide hotline donâ€™t do shit. I see no other way out. Iâ€™ve already came up with a plan if they accept the offer. I donâ€™t want to tell anyone because I know Iâ€™ll get institutionalized. I canâ€™t do it anymore.
