Why does it get harder when I decide I want to get help?I don't really know what I want to say. I just want to say that I'm tired. I'm so very tired. I'm tired all the time. I want to get this right, and I want to get help, but the moment I decide to do it, everything gets ten times worse to block my way.

I'm tired. I'm really, really tired.
