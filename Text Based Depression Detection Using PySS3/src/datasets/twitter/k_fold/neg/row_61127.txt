I just want a girl to cuddle with meIâ€™m 22 and have been off and on dealing with mental health issues since I failed my first semester of college right after high school.  I donâ€™t know what the hell Iâ€™m doing with my life at this point.  Right now Iâ€™m at welding school, but Iâ€™m not doing so great in my first semester here either.  Iâ€™m also enlisted in the Army National Guard and going to BCT(Basic Combat Training) in February.

Iâ€™ve only had one girlfriend and it was in high school.  The most Iâ€™ve gotten from girls was a few cuddles and my first kiss(my only girlfriend).  Iâ€™m still a virgin but honestly at this point I just want to cuddle with a female again.  Iâ€™d like to lose my virginity, but Iâ€™d rather just be loved and appreciated by someone.

The reason why Iâ€™m posting on here is because Iâ€™ve been contemplating suicide a lot.  I feel like Iâ€™m taking the wrong paths in life and itâ€™s leading me deeper into the tunnel.

I think thereâ€™s still hope for me in terms of living a good life, but weâ€™ll see.
