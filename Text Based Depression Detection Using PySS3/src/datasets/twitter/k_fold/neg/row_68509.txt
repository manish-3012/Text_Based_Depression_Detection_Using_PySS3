A chat friend for the nightHi guys. Probably not the place to ask but I was wondering if anyone here wouldn't mind chatting with me during the night? I'm in the UK and I want to watch AEW Dark and NWA Power but they're not on until late here.

Thing is, I came out of the hospital earlier after trying to throw myself from a bridge and I'm still a bit low and somewhat suicidal from it all. I know if I'm alone I'll want to try something. I don't want to be alone tonight.
