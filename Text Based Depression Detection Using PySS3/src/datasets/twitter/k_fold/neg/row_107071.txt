"I know you dont have the guts to do it,you don't wanna die,so I don't really worry about it,you just wanted to be treated the way you wanted to but haven't found it yet,so you basically just like a kid throwing a tantrum"Yeah,and hearing that actually makes me even worst,i know im too much of a pussy to do it,but now i even have more urge to actually prove how much i wanna die

It's so humiliating n im already felt guilty enough to be even alive,I'm 22,still can't accomplish anything or do anything right,still live with my parents,they already have to pay a lot of bills,now they have to pay for my college tuition,i still have a little sister studying elementary school which they have to pay too,im basically just a burden,can't really see what's the point of living if i can't contribute to anything except being a leech
