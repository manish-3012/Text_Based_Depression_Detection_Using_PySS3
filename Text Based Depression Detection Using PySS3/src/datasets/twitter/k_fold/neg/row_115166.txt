Hard NightI am having a really hard time recently. I feel like a failure, I can't get anything done properly. I've been in college for four years and yet am still a year away from my AA. I am running in circles, not going any where, just making a deeper and deeper track that's trapping me. I almost did it last night. I was right there, ready to end it all when I thought of who would find me and how that would change their life forever. I just don't know what to do.
