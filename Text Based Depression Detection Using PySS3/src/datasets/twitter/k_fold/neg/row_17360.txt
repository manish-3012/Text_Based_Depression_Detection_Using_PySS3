Everything is good but I'm not sureHi, so I live in the upper-middle-class, I'm really good at school, I have lots of friends, but every day I have suicidal thoughts like "what if I just jumped into the traffic" or "what if I swallow this'.  I'm quite confused as to whether or not I should talk to someone about this because I don't ever do anything to harm myself or want to and I don't have any other mental problems or trauma that I'm aware of.
