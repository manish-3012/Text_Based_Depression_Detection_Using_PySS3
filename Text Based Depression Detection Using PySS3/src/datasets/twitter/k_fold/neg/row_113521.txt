No hope, but don't want to hurt my familyMy desire to die is, to me, pretty rational. I have nothing to contribute to the world don't anticipate being able to enjoy life for myself at any time in the future. There are only 4 people in the world who would be noticeably saddened at my passing, and I'm certain 3 of them would be tangibly better off without me, but they all want me to stick around.

When I say I'm not worth the space I take up, it's not a passing moment of angst. I have no particular practical skills, and zero social skills. I can hold down a "warm body" job, but don't have any abilities or passions that would translate into a job that paid enough that I'd be financially stable. I already have a [worthless, liberal arts] Bachelor's, so going back to school to re-train means racking up serious debt, as there's little to no aid for students who already have a B.A. I'm pushing 30 and still live with my parents, on the premise that I'll go back to school for a high-need job once I have a little money saved. Spoiler alert: I couldn't even finish the broad-base engineering physics series at the local community college, I can't code elementary-school-level Java even when I have explicit instructions,  and even if I suddenly got hit with the social-skills stick over-night (I'm reasonably sure I have Asperger's), I just failed my state Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) exam. A.K.A., I'm too incompetent to get licensed to change adult diapers. I did well in and comparatively enjoyed biology classes at school, so I thought maybe I could translate that to working in an operating room, where I could be useful to the world and make a decent wage even though I have inadequate social skills. However, if I can't get my CNA, I can't go to nursing school, which seemed by far the best route in terms of being a program I could get into, afford, and be able to get a job from. (It seems like a lot of these healthcare specialties get listed as high-need jobs even though there's not very many openings, so it comes down again to networking, which both I and the four people who are close to me suck at.) The same difficulty/cost problems apply to veterinary school, plus difficulty getting a job. I've looked into those government-repayment programs for vets who work in rural areas, but it seems even the people who initially take advantage of them leave, because there's not enough customers who are able to pay -- that's why they were under-served in the first place. My mental processing and physical moments appear slower than average, too, so I'm not even very good at menial work. At my current job, I'll clock out at the expected time, but stay up to 2 hours late because that's just how long it takes me to do all the normal work tasks. I know this is illegal and most of the time I don't care, because I just want to do a half-way decent job and not get fired for being "lazy." (I'm aware this technically puts the company at risk, but since I'm the only one there during those hours, there's no cameras to prove anything, and I have no intention of outting myself, I don't think the broken law would amount to anything serious against the company.)

"Gee," you say, "it sounds like you're putting an awful lot of stock in a job. There's more to life than that!" Sure, I say, so long as you have the social skills to connect with people. The four people who would be affected for more than a hot minute at my passing are my parents, my brother, and the friend I've had since I was 5. I have not managed to make any lasting, meaningful connections during the 23 years since then; and I've never had anything that could in the vaguest sense be considered a romantic relationship. The closest I've come to approximating social connections is people who share an interest or hobby, but those connections either are (a) through the internet, or (b) in classes or at events that require money. So, if I want to try to connect face-to-face, I'm back to the money part from the previous paragraph.

I know I've been really privileged in a lot of life circumstances, and I'm incredibly lucky to have those four people. I try to contribute what I can through doing volunteer work, random acts of kindness, and occasional monetary donations (after all, at least I have a safe, dry place to sleep at night, which is more than some people). But my conclusion is that existence isn't really worth it for me; I don't enjoy it and I can't see how I can "make things better." The idea of planning out an effective suicide, then spending the rest of my pathetic savings on a weekend of fun before I tap out is really, really appealing. My family's managed to make me understand, though, that even though I think I'm a waste of resources and life is not something I feel is worth continuing, they are desperate for me to stick around, and much as I suck, it'd be worse for them if I committed suicide. I'm a little frustrated with them, a lot frustrated with and hating myself, and just want to lose consciousness and not regain it.
