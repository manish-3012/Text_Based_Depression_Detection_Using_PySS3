I don't want to kill myself, but I realise on a factual level that this is probably end of the line for me.I've been in poverty my entire adult life. I have severe developmental disabilities that have only been compounded by trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma after trauma.

Where I'm at now is just trying to take inventory of all my remaining options and stare at them until one of them looks more appealing than just up and dying but it's not really working. I have no family, about $500 in my bank account. The only way I ever make any more money is through e-begging and I just don't have it in me to do that anymore. I can't beg for my life while being accused of being a scammer and being stalked and having rumours spread about me and whatever else and then people get upset at me for not wanting to be super friendly and cheerful with everyone. 

All I want is a place to say I live, but I don't have one. I don't live anywhere. All I want is some sense of permanence in life. I have no income no home no family and I live in a hostel. My visa in this country runs out in less than a week and I don't know where I'm going. 

I don't know. Maybe I do want to kill myself after all. I've just been keeping myself drunk for days and days because this is just too much for me to handle emotionally. I don't even drink but the more killing myself starts to look like a genuinely viable option on the table...

I just don't know. I'd rather die than put up with any one of these problems anymore.
