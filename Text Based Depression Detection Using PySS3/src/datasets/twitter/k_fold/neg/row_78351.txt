The first and the last timeI've never written anything on reddit or anywhere on the internet before, I'm the defenition of social anxiety, so this will be the first and last time. 

I got everything set up and prepared to kill myself, written notes to specific people, letting out thoughts and feelings I've never shared before.

I have worries and doubts about this but I have to do it. 

Now I just have to muster up the courage to do it.

I don't know if I'll succeed, if anyone reads it, I'll let u know if I wake up. 

Bye
