I'm getting evicted again and I think I'm going to kill myself before I'm forced to leaveI've been extremely depressed for the last four months. My partners left me and I spend too much time alone stewing in dark thoughts. I've let my life just fall apart because I don't have the energy to make it any better. I failed to pay my rent and now I'm being evicted. I can't do this. I can't deal with constantly struggling to do the bare minimum requirements of being a functional human being 

I'm in constant emotional agony and I can't imagine the next day. It's just darkness all the time. A doctor gave me too many antidepressants and I am torn between just swallowing a fistfull of them or tying a rope around my neck. I want to die. I don't want to exist anymore. If I could just stop being then there is no more pain no more suffering. I can't see a reason to continue breathing when every day is just another day of empty darkness
