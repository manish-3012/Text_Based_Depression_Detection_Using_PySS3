Iâ€™m going to fail in lifeIâ€™m 16 I should be going into 11th grade. Last year before 10th I had a suicide attempt. Then I moved from ohio to Tennessee to help my sick grandma until my grandpa could get here. I tried the local high school for two days but anxiety and my grandma being sick add that to the night before I started a student killed himself. It was really triggering. 
I ended up doing an online program, but I didnâ€™t really do it because Iâ€™m a stupid lazy person. 

Flash forward to now I went to register at the school and they pretty much told me thereâ€™s a good chance they wonâ€™t accept me because I wonâ€™t have enough credits at the end of senior year. Iâ€™ve got to have 28 credits and the grading scale here is different to what i was used to my entire life. I currently have 10.5 credits. I should have 14. 

93-100 A
84-92 B
75-83 C
70-74 D
00-69 F

I feel so stupid. My entire life my identity has been being smart, being above average being in advance classes, Learning stuff years early, Having a high lexile, getting straight Aâ€™s. But here, at this school Iâ€™m just average. Actually Iâ€™m below average because I donâ€™t have all my credits. I donâ€™t know how to cope with my entire identity being taken from me. I just want to not exist anymore. I donâ€™t want to try because I donâ€™t want to fail.  I donâ€™t want to be like my parentsâ€” one dead and the other still addicted to drugs without a home or anything other then my brother and me to show for her life. 

I have to succeed. I have to be successful.
