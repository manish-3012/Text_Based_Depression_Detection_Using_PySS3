I just want them back.. I can't take it.Tomorrow it will have been 10 years since my mom took her own life and honestly the only thing keeping me from doing it is that I dont want to do that to my sister.. I dont want to put her through that pain again.. but I'm so overwhelmingly depressed. I've lost both parents, my grandparents, and six friends.. I just can't do it anymore its too much for me too take..
