I just don't see the point in continuingMy parents prioritize my siblings over me and act like me and my opinions, thoughts are worthless. They know I'm suicidal and basically make fun of me when I mention I'm thinking about it. I have so many medical issues that I can't even go to school or get a job so I'm trapped at home with them. I have no future. There's really no reason for me to go on. I've been thinking about it for a long time but now I feel like I might end up doing it for real
