Came reddit looking for relationship help. Ended up here instead.Basically what the title said. This isn't about me and I don't want everyone to think that I'm here to flood the subreddit. I legitimately think my problem belongs here. 

About a year ago I caught my girlfriend cheating and I tried to call it quits. I walked in on her in my room near the point of death. Hanging on my ceiling. 


2 months later I try again this time just emotional distress on my part. And she tries running her car into something while me in it. 

4 months later or so I try again because she turned most of my friends against me and made me seem like I'm a scumbag. She tries to off herself with some pills. Luckily I stopped her in time. 

Recently I try again and she slices her wrists. 

I don't know what to do and where to turn. It's affecting me in many ways and I need desperate help. I came to reddit trying to fix my relationship. But it turns out I'm just trying for no reason. 

Any resources or ideas are welcome. 

Please hear me out.
