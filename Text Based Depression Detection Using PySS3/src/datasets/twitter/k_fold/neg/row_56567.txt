Please just talk to meI tried to go out with my friends and now Iâ€™m alone by my own choice thinking about how much I want to end it all, I feel ashamed ever talking about it openly with anyone I care about and I donâ€™t know what to do, I canâ€™t stop thinking about how much I want to cut my own throat, Iâ€™ve never felt like this before And I donâ€™t know how to stop. I canâ€™t think of anything else
