24 years old wish I had a gun to out to my head....had a friend  &amp; he helped me a lot with my suicidal thoughts  , when that went away every day I just put it in the back of my mind that I need to do this I need to kill myself , bc I feel like I have know one now! Nobody to catch me when I fall I feel like when he left he said ok you donâ€™t matter Iâ€™m tired of that feeling canâ€™t seem to surpass it in my mind ! I donâ€™t know what to do , I think being here on this earth is more pain sometimes then not being here! What do you do when u loose people u care about when everyone leaves and u feel like you have nothing left!
