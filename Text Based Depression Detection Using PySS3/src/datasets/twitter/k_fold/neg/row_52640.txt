Thank God for DrugsNow that I think about it, I probably don't have to worry about making plans for suicide .. considering how drugs may very well be the end of me, especially Alcohol.

I love alcohol too damn much. I make my own too, and I drink every night. I actually credit Alcohol for 'stopping me from self-harming' .. lol
