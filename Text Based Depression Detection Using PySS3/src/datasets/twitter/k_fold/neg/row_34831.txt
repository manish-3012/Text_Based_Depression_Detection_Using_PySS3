Life is worth LosingI am diagnosed with GAD, social anxiety disorder, major depression and mood disorder and I am an asexual currently on the end of my ropes. 

I have no feasible options available to me financial, educational, therapytical support opportunities no friends for about 12 years and I have been a recluse for the last 2 years leaving my home only when it is an absolute necessity.

My only valid reason for not being here is Family, it would absolutely destroy my mother and for that reason I have postponed my fate, the problem with the whole situation is if I explain how close I am in leaving my family would be forced to act that would cost them financialy and cause strain on my siblings as well. I would honestly like to be instituinalised as that is the most logical next step to save my soul but as all things are it is not free, you will only be taken into the public institution after a failed suicide attempt. I have never attempted it before I will only be able to follow through, as I believe a cry for help is false, you either are committed in doing what you want or not at all.

I hardly express an emotion anymore, even facial expression has become non existent, apathy is my natural tendency these days. I have felt dead inside for years now. When my family speaks with me I listen however there is a wall so to speak were I just respond in the blandest of manner. I am always in my own head all the time while interacting with others. 

I am realising now that the time to take action has arrived, it might not be today, tomorrow or next week but I know that soon I am going kill myself.

Sorry for the morbid post I just had to get it off my chest as each passing moment I am a step further in ending it all.
