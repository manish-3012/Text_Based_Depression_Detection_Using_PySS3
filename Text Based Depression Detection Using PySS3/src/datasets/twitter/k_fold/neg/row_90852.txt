I keep returning to the option of ending it.  I'm tired and I really don't feel much of anything anymore.So, I'm married with two kids.  My marriage was a mistake, I should have left when I had the chance.  I did it because I basically thought that it was what we were supposed to do when we grew up.  While I love my children, I cannot stand my wife.  Ya, I know I should get on with it and leave and make myself happy.  However, I am flat broke and have no where to go.  We all know that as a man, I am going to be fiscally responsible for my family (wife works part time).  I would not have a pot to piss in.  Life insurance would take care of my kids I hope._x000D_

I hate myself for so many different reasons, too many to list here.  Sufice it to say I am a bad person.  No, I have not killed anyone, but I have done some real dispicable shit.  A few years ago, I had a scrape with the law and it really took the rug out from under me financially.  I will never recover the lost time or money now.  It is too late._x000D_

I would love to just be able to go to sleep and not have to wake up and face another day of my soul sucking job and harpy of a wife. _x000D_

I love my kids and I think that they would be better off with someone who at least was happy around them.  I find I yell at them for stupid shit, I feel like shit for doing it but it still happens.  Like I said, I am a bad person._x000D_

After the job loss, I really spiraled down into depression with suicidal thoughts.  This time, it is not the same.  I don't have thoughts or a plan, I just don't see an alternative.  If I got hit by a bus, the driver would be doing me a big favour._x000D_

I'm not expecting any help or sympathy from anyone here.  I just needed to get it off my chest.  The other day my wife told me once again that I should quit smoking and eating like shit.  I think that it is my passive agressive side coming out and I am finding that I am hoping that I have a heart attack or stroke. _x000D_

While my wife may feel we have a normal marriage, I don't think it is.  There is little to no sex.  What little there is is contrived and a result of me asking/begging for it.  The rejection has had a real impact on how I view myself._x000D_

if I could crawl into bed and just sleep forever, I'd be happy.
