Suicides been on my mindMy life has no purpose anymore. Iâ€™m tired of feeling this way every minute of every day. Iâ€™ve been dealing with depression and these thoughts for 3 years now. It started when I got discharged from the Marines due to an injury. Then shortly after getting home, my girlfriend of 3 years left me. Been down hill from there. I have 1 close friend but he lies to me so much and makes up every excuse possible to not hang out with me that I wouldnâ€™t even consider him a friend anymore. I havenâ€™t been on a date or been with a girl in 2 years. Stuff I use to love and enjoy doing doesnâ€™t even excite me anymore. My life is miserable. Iâ€™m currently in the Army now which just sucks the life out of me even more. I just donâ€™t want to be here anymore. Iâ€™m just going to become another statistic.
