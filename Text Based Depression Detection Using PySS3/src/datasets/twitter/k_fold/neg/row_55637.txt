I feel like my family would be better off without meI couldn't give up on my kids. Having said that, my wife and I are divorcing after 15 years.  My wife has been convincing my kids that I have been abusive for years. She found a  new bf. My kids are confused. I feel like if I wasn't around she would stop telling them that I emotionally and mentally abused them.  They aren't understanding why she is saying this.  I know, but I don't want to ruin their relationship with her, my kids are all under 12.  I can't stop her from saying whatever she wants to the kids. So I don't know how to make this better for them but to end myself, it seems like I have no other way to stop their hurt. I know they would hurt because I am gone. Just because I know the answer isn't to kill myself, however I can't stop the thought from popping up in my mind. I'm scared because I am so depressed right now. The last time I took an antidepressant was when I started to think about suicide and had a really bad reaction that sent me into the hospital for 72 hours. So I really don't want to take anything because I am under WAY more stress now than I was then.
