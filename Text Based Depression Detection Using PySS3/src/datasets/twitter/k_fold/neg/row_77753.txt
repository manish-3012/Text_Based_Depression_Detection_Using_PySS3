If it weren't for them..Lately I've been feeling drawn to pull the plug, more than I have ever felt it. I spend a lot of time thinking about it. It's not the first thing on my mind in the morning, its when Im sitting at my computer desk working, or when I'm making my lunch, or when I'm sitting on my sofa alone wondering why no one calls, or cares. No one cares; but they do. I have 2 dogs that I know need me, and it's scaring me how much the thought of them needing me is the only reason that I can think of to not go through with it. I know it might sound strange to some people but right now this is my truth. I never thought life could be this agonizing.
