I feel like everyone elseâ€™s emotional crutch and I just donâ€™t want to be anymoreEvery few weeks I end up in this place mentally. I really really thought I was getting better. Thereâ€™s no one in my life I can talk to without ringing everyoneâ€™s alarms bells. The one friend I had who I could, wonâ€™t even keep up a text message conversation with me for more than 1-2 replies. My father died several years ago and I live with my mother who frankly couldnâ€™t do it emotionally alone. But fuck, man, I feel like every time Iâ€™ve tried to make things easier/better for us, it hasnâ€™t made one bit of difference. My siblings are useless. What few friends I have who will actually talk to me, theyâ€™d just panic if I told them Iâ€™m having these thoughts more and more frequently. But man, I just want to die. I donâ€™t care where I end up. At this point, anything would be better than feeling like someone elseâ€™s emotional crutch and getting absolutely nowhere. Everything makes me anxious and every time I feel like I fix something, my mind finds something else to worry about. Iâ€™m just so fucking over it right now.
