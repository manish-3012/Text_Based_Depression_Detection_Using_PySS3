Posted the past two days. Been too weak to do it.I might try harder to get through this if I knew anyone cared enough to help. The people around me know. They donâ€™t care enough to help. No one can help me, I suppose. Iâ€™m screaming in a room full of people and I just canâ€™t feel anything at all anymore. Feeling alone is worse than just feeling suicidal, or depressed, or angry. Now Iâ€™m numb.

I need to quit crying on the internet to strangers and just fucking do it already. 

What am I waiting for?
