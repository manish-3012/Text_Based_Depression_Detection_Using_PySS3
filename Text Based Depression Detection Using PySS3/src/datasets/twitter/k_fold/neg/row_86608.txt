Life or deathThis has become a life or death situation. I actually cannot express into words how awful this feels. This tension, this horrendous tension in my chest has been here a week straight and it's only getting worse. I keep watching people leave one by one and it's going to sting like a bitch when everyone is gone. I'm so scared of myself. I can't get these things out of my head anymore I'm going to die if I stay here any longer.
