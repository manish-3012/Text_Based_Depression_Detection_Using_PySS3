Iâ€™m thinking about attempting suicide again soonI canâ€™t live with this pain anymore. I just want it to end. If I had access to a firearm Iâ€™d end it all in a heartbeat. Iâ€™m too weak to use a knife or other sharp object and I donâ€™t think I can OD on anything currently. Iâ€™m afraid of heights so Iâ€™d never jump. Iâ€™m trying to cope and be better but Iâ€™m only getting worse. I wish I could just be euthanized.
