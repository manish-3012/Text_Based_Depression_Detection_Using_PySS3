Help with how to proceedI have had suicidal thoughts for several years now, as far as I know it runs in my family (my father committed suicide almost a decade ago). I have made the terrible choice of keeping everything to myself until now, but starting a new semester of school has pushed me closer to the edge than I have ever felt. I am afraid that I will lose control and commit suicide at some point, and I realize that I had to get help. I do not feel comfortable going to any family or friends right now, I couldn't tell you why even if I wanted to. I just want to know if there is any way that I can begin the process of getting help, and a diagnosis, as a college student without involving those around me?

Sorry if all of this is completely unintelligible, I just felt like I finally had to write this before I stopped myself
