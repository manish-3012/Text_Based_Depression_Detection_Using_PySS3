If not tonight, then when?I've been down a loooong road with depression and anxiety throughout my life. Growing up gay didn't help at all. But I feel as if I've reached my rock bottom. I lost my job in May, I've been hopelessly single for 7 years, had to move back in with my parents which is currently hell. Not even sure what the point of writing this is, and in all honesty will probably delete tomorrow if I'm still here. I just wanted a written record that I'm fucking tried. And I lost. Mom, Dad, if youre reading this, im sorry. Good luck to all of you. I'm sure some/most of you can make it to the other side.
