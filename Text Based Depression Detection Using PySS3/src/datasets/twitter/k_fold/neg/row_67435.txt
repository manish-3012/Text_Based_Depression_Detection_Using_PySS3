Just writing some of my thoughts outIâ€™m still suicidal but kinda on the fence if I can actually build up the courage to do it. I want this pain to end but Iâ€™m afraid to do it myself. I know A part of me wants to live but the other part wonders if itâ€™s worth it. Iâ€™ve been sick to my stomach lately and not sure if itâ€™s the depression or anxiety or both. My chest always feels faint and I have no energy. Early this morning I went to the ER to get staples put in for more self harm. I was sent home after the staples were put in. Iâ€™m starting to wonder if Iâ€™m safe to be on my own right now or do I need to be in hospital. I havenâ€™t been admitted on a psych unit in about a year. I feel like Iâ€™m at the end of my being and nothing is left of the person I was. I see my family doctor tomorrow and hopefully get a medical not to quit my job (a lot of people donâ€™t agree that I should do that but I just canâ€™t do it). I want to get better and I donâ€™t think I can adjust my meds anymore I basically just have to wait whatever this is out. What is one supposed to do when they have come to nothing left inside and have a death wish. My self harm is â€œnon suicidalâ€ but is problematic enough that it could â€œaccidentallyâ€ lead to death and I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d care if it did. I just know Iâ€™m in a living hell and donâ€™t know what to do with myself anymore.
