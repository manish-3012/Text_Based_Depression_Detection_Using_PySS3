I tried to kill myself by asphyxiation, but I must have unconsciously (?) Ripped the bag open, or I just don't remember. I passed out after for 2 hours or so, and my chest, and throat hurts. What should I do?I used a bag and tied it around my neck really tight, I think it must have been around 2 minutes maybe before I stopped remembering anything? I set a timer that went off every minute so I could count down until my death. My chest hurts, my head hurts, and breathing feels weird. What should I do?
