You've heard this story beforeMy story doesn't differ much from your generic 'im going to commit suicide' story. I made some mistakes and I don't see any other way out. I love my little siblings so so so much. I hope they understand one day. I hope it motivates them. If I weren't on the other side of the country I would kiss them one last time. Mom I'm sorry. I had plenty of chances to finish grad school and focus on helping you guys. But I didn't. I chased being a big movie star instead. You were always a great mom. One I did not deserve
