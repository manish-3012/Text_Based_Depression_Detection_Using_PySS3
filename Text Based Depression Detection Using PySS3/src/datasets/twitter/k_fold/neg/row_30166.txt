I want to die.I'm 22, currently not employed or in school because of my extremely severe anxiety, I cant even hang out with friends or even do daily things like shower or do dishes without feeling like I'm going to die. My FiancÃ©e works herself to the bone and I cant even help anymore, which just makes me feel even worse. I can't keep this up and every day I'm feeling more and more lost. I feel normal only when I take Xanax or Klonopin but those are short lived solutions that end up with me feeling even worse by the end of it. I feel like a drug addict, and It almost feels like nothing's real, I dont know, just needed to say something somewhere to someone.
