My wife is probably going to leave me because she can't deal with that.  (fallout from a porn/sex addiction hasn't helped much either)  I'm in a boring dead-end job, which pays well and has put me geographically somewhere I've wanted to be for years - but now I live an ocean away from all my close friends and I'm still nowhere with my musical dreams - and beginning to think I never will be because I keep screwing everything up._x000D_

I've been on medication and in therapy, but i keep falling apart - keep losing my cool and putting my marraige in the gutter.   _x000D_

This all leads to a feeling that it's hopeless. I know I have family that cares, but I'm tired of calling them and just having them worry - there's nothing they can do.  And thinking of what it would do to them is losing its effectiveness of stopping me from committing suicide. _x000D_

I'm not sure what to do anymore.  I know there's a future for me, but I'm having trouble feeling it - and beginning to think more and more its just going to be filled with me disappointing myself because I'm broken._x000D_

Any advice?
