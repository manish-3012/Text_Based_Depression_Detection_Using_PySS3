I don't know why I am postingI have been planning/attempting over the past ten years and am at the age I decided I want to die. There is no moving forward, medications are not helping, the hospital is a joke(handcuffs, blood test, pee in a cup, strip to a robe and sit in a hallway for 4-5hrs.) and intensive outpatient is ignorant of my problems, I have to educate them. I wish they offered euthanization. Insurance doesn't cover my meds (hundreds), testing (thousands) or surgeries.
 If I earn more money I will have money taken from my pay for new insurance that will also not cover my meds surgeries or my 2 doctors. If I am not dead by the end of the year it would due to cowardice not lack of thought.

I don't why i am typing because all i get are chanlers. I don't expect anyone to help, I will most likely get flack.
