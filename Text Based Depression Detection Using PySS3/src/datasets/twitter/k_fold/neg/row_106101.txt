What's the point?Hey guys, this is my first time ever posting in this sub never knew it existed before today, and was just wandering what's  the point?  To give you some context, I'm  just some random 23 year old kid with what a I consider to be a crippling debt. I took it to avoid inflighting in my house since my father wanted me and my older brother to study abroad, like a fucking idiot I decide that my parents can do no wrong and since I've always been the good child that everything's gonna work out. The money runs out midway and my parenta haven't assist me with a single payment, my brother who came with me fled to a monastery to avoid his problems and then ran back home after regretting his monastic life. Anyway I have to go back home and get a job the very next day, since payment was due. Since I have to leave in a hurry I did not validated my grades at uni and they won't be accepted here, wasted 2.5 years of my life on that, I decided to do night uni while doing a 10 hour shift in a call center earning 2 dollars an hour, to pay a monthly  bill of 500$, my salary is of 625$ and and I pay around 30$ in gas. To add insult to injury, my borther who also took the loan is terri le with money and I've been helping him and the family here  and there, making ends meet, this all changed when 3 weeks ago after my birthday, he recieved a lawsuit from the bank, he hadn't pay them in a year and he earns more money than I do, and his cuota  is of 400 to the bank. The fucker was lying to me, making me carry extra responsibilities and shit while he wasn't doing shit. My parents owe me money that  i had saved up for a year and haven't paid me back, I've been promoted twice at work but the tunnel keeps getting narrower and narrower, I'm at my wits end, laying in a dark empty living room, so why not?
