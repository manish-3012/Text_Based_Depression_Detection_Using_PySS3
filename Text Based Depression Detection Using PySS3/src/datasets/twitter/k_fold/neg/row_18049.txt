irrational suicide thoughtsI lost a total of fifty dollars in the past week in poker, partially damaged my MacBook, and broke my shaver. All in one week. I'm very worried about how much I spend always and never like to waste money, spend too much, and try to be as frugal as reasonably possible with my food choices. I'm in college. This is all despite my family being well off and I don't really need to be worried about this, so its irrational. I keep trying to tell myself that its no big deal that my parents aren't hurt by this at all, and that it doesn't matter, but its not working. For some reason I just care so much about how much I spend and all this loss in one week is making me very depressed. I feel ashamed and worthless that my parents can make and accumulate all this money and yet I haven't really been able to make shit yet and I'm blowing through a bunch of money. I feel like a disgrace and not even worth being alive, that I do not deserve to be in the position I'm in. My parents wouldn't feel this way and probably wouldn't care that much but I can't let it go and its eating me from the inside.
