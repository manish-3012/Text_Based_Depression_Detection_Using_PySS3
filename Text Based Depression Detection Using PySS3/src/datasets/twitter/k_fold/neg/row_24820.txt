Being stuck is the worst feeling in the worldI want to be anywhere else but here right now. But i have no car and no money. I want to move to a deserted island where I can just take a break for a few months. Im so SICK of being at my parentsâ€™ place and not being able to move out on my own. LET ME LEAVE. Let me win the lotto so i can get out of here please. Iâ€™m about to walk out the door and just walk to a new town. The anxiety of staying here is crushing my soul.
