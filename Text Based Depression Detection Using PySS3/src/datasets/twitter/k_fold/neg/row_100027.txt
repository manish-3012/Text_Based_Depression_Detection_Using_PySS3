I feel like I'm close to the breaking pointBeen stuck at the same part time job from the age of 14, its been 6 flipping years. I'm the only other person working there, so I'm doing the work of 2-3 people. I'm sick of dealing with stupid customers l, and I'm sick of my boss having a go at me when I'm trying to do fifty things at once. God forbid I take a moment to check what needs to be done "what are you standing around for?" it drives me nuts and makes me feel like I'm a useless person. If he makes a mistake while cooking an order, it's my fault for not telling him. I'm sick of it. 
But I can't quit my because I need the money, and any other job I can get to is basically the exact same as what I'm doing now.
I don't feel alive anymore, and haven't for a long time. I'm wasting my life. I'm a huge disappointment. I don't have any dreams or ambitions for the future because I don't see myself living long enough anyway. My friends have everything planned out, my siblings know what they want to do. But I just don't see the point. Everyone else is so far ahead that I'll never catch up, so i might as well clock out early, right?
I just want to stop, and one of these days it's gonna happen.
Sorry for the long rant, I just needed to release these thoughts somewhere...
