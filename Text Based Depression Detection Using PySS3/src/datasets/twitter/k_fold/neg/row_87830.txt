Can I die from a blood clot? Is it painful?I started having sharp pains in my back and difficulty breathing about two hours ago. I've had terrible circulation most of my life and just started birth control, so it seems like it's a blood clot. I called my school's medical center and they told me to go to urgent care.  
I've been suicidal my whole life, so I was wondering if this is a good opportunity to die? Would a blood clot do that? Has anyone had a similar experience before?
