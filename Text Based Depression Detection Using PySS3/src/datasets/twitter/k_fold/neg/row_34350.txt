I don't know what to doI want to die, cease to exist or whatever. Not actively suicidal I suppose but I'm tired of living. It's been this way for many many years now. Have tried therapy, medications with no success. My life is absolutely fucked and I don't have the slightest clue really how to begin to really work on it.

Some days are better than others, I can at least get out of bed and do a little something. Other times I can't be arsed to get up and brush my teeth let alone anything else. I've been trying to work on my house so I can get to a point of selling it but motivation is failing.

No job, terrified of going back to work due to past experiences. It's part of the reason I'm in this mess. Very stressful/unhealthy job and environment, and apparently I suck ass at setting boundaries and completely burnt out. During that time also didn't keep up with my house well and it's fucked. I drank alcohol to cope, which obviously also severely detrimental.

I have no friends to speak of, am home alone 99% of the time. Family is and mostly always has been strained, they are not very supportive or communicative. I'm single and always have been, hitting my late 30s tomorrow and I'm so lonely. Crying as I type this, I'm so pathetic.

Nothing really interests me any more. I used to enjoy games or watching various movies/TV. I feel empty, hollow... the walking dead.

Why can't I just go to sleep and never wake up or poof out of existence? My very core/being has been hurting for so long and I'm tired of suffering. I'm worthless, quite literally shouldn't have been born. My father obviously didn't give a shit, I guess I shouldn't be surprised that practically no one else does either.

Surprised I've lived this long to be honest. Have told myself for a long time that once my mother passes away I'm going to end it. She's really the only reason I haven't yet.
