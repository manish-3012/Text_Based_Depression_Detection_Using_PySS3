Why is everything always my fault and should I be alive?before i even get into why id like to kill myself, let me just say that im writing this post after being yelled at by my dad for being a nuisance and for being mentally ill. keep in mind that before the fight i was talking to him about how much bpd (borderline personality disorder) makes me struggle and then he just went ahead and told me that i deserve to be treated badly because im ill. it really hurt. 

i honestly dont know why im here anymore? im "mentally ill", everyone hates me or dislikes my presence and im 100% sure that no one gives a fuck about me, i wake up every morning dreading going to college (i hate what im studying), im so ugly that it physically hurts to look in the mirror, my body looks terrible even though im still 18, i can never do what i want because im an arab girl  (i cant study abroad or live alone to distance myself) and i just dont feel free. everytime i think about my future plans i want to die because it all seems so useless and pathetic. 

i really want to kill myself and the only thing keeping me is that ive been through fucking hell and im just so drained.

and before anyone says that im 18 and i can do whatever i want, i just want to remind you that im an arab GIRL and i live in a third world country. i cant legally do anything without a mans permission (dad or husband in the future since marriage is the closest ill get to freedom)
