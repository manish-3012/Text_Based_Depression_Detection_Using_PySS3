Being alive is hellBut dying... I feel like I will be copping out without trying to figure out all the life shit first.

I'm in an abusive not-marraige, I can't tell anyone what's happening to me or they'd try to help and make it worse. 

My kids have to deal with me being absent mentally and barely functional because of whats happening... And a long history of C-PTSD and depression on my end.

I love my children so much. I hide all this from them, they are too little and it would damage them immensely to know what was really happening.

I didn't want kids, not when I had them. I knew it was too soon...

But I didn't have the courage to abort. (Hyper religious upbringing). Not til way later, twice, after any inkling of religion was pounded out of me.

You can only deal with what I have for so long before God either becomes an enemy, or a sad fairy tale told to the foolish and naive.

And I would think that it was temporary... Except this has gone on in some form my entire life. It's unspeakable. I will never, never get justice for what has been done... I can barely speak about it in even the most general terms.

In addition to that, I am now being evaluated for an uncommon and highly stigmatized disorder.

I just want to have a normal life.

Just be able to do normal things. Get out of bed to a house that's not a pig sty, mostly thanks to chronic illness and my incredibly useless excuse for a "partner" who barely works rn and gets paid to stay home... but still makes no progress on the mess and won't communicate about it without becoming abusive and effectively traumatizing me into a meltdown and shutdown. 

I have no one.

I am an orphan, there is nowhere to run. I have tried.

The shelters are worse than home.
The few "friends" who offered me and the children shelter, expected me to be healthy (despite me being very open about my health issues and mental health severity) and then tried to exploit me as bad or worse than he does.

Just... What is the point?
