In hospital and things arenâ€™t greatI have just been admitted to accidents and emergencies waiting on a psych doctor to admit me and Iâ€™m feeling a little off. The girl in the cubicle next to me sounds so sick and she is gasping for air and dry heaving when Iâ€™m just here sobbing because I want to die. I feel like I donâ€™t belong here and Iâ€™m just wasting a bed. I suppose what I donâ€™t get is why theyâ€™re even bothering with me. My problems arenâ€™t like hers mine are in my head. Iâ€™m trying to make the effort to want to live but what I donâ€™t get is why they even try on me. When Iâ€™m discharged from here I will still be borderline and life will still be hell. Iâ€™m just taking up a bed from someone they could actually be helping. I mean Iâ€™m not at risk of suicide right now because Iâ€™m under observation but Iâ€™m battling with why they actually try and help people like me instead of just let me kill myself. I mean I think you are all great people too for helping people who are suicidal but wouldnâ€™t it be a peace to just let us go? I donâ€™t know. My love to everyone else struggling tonight.
