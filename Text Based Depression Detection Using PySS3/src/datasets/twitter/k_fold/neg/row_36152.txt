Strong thoughts of suicide..So i normally dont do this kind of thing, and generally i just kinda keep things to myself. I feel like i am at a breaking point in my life finally where i cant stop thinking that enough is enough and i am so ready for everything to be over with..  i dont have friends, i cant speak to my mother, or my father (2 other long side stories) about my issues and i find myself wanting to go through with it more and more every day... ive read so many articles about why not to kill myself and yet, here i am, wanting to die more than ever... my wife left me, she took my kid, i am homeless now, i have no money, i have nothing anymore. All i keep doing is pushing people away, and i cant stop no matter how hard i try.. im not playing a pissing match with anyone, but i have had a pretty hard go at life so far starting when i was 12, wont go that far back with the story.. my job moved all of us cross country then laid me off, soon after my wife left me and she is living with her mother now back cross country demanding a divorce. All i have is a gun, bullets, this phone, and a few other odds and ends.. i am running out of reasons not to pull the trigger honestly.. maybe someone here can tell me something i dont know? Convince me that its all worth it? When all i can think in the back of my head it really isnt? maybe this is my cry for help? Last ditch attempt before i just say screw it? Idk.. i was baker acted about 6 or 7 months ago for attempted suicide, but i talked myself out of it that time as i felt like i still had stuff to live for and it was just a hard time... i just dont know what to tell myself anymore at this point.. it all seems helpless.. i screw up anything good that DOES happen in my life (as few and far between that is) and i dont feel like i have a reason to keep goin forward anymore in this horrible joke everyone calls life..
