Death and dyingSo my mom died last year in April. Sheâ€™d been fighting cancer for a short time. So it wasnâ€™t a complete surprise when she passed but nothing could have prepared me for how I would feel afterwards. And even to this day, almost a year and a half later, I still miss her so much. I want to see her so bad. Talk to her. Hug her. I often think about dying in hopes I may be with her or see her again. The thought of that is abysmal. I donâ€™t think it really works that way honestly. I donâ€™t think we die and are just automatically reunited with our loved ones. I donâ€™t know what happens when we die but I have a hard time really believing thatâ€™s how it works. My heart aches so bad. I think about dying so often that itâ€™s an everyday occurrence. I feel lost and abandoned. I have very few people left in my life and it seems the rest of my life just isnâ€™t worth living.
