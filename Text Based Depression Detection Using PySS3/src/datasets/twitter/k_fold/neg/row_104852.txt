Not certain where to post this. Thoughts for survivors of suicide victims. WARNING: CONTROVERSIALI have noticed a lot of documentaries and news articles from survivors of someone who committed suicide. They never seem 'guilty' and rather seem to make it about themselves, and not the victim. It makes me wonder if this is a reason why someone may feel suicidal or alone.  That because they are so self-involved they are incapable of seeing someone else is in pain.
