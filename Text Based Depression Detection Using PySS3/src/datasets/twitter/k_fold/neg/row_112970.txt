my friends want to die tooI've made two friends recently irl, theyre both suicidal too

One has scars and the other has brought a knife to his throat multiple times

I revealed to them that I feel the same but i felt like such a faker, because ive never attempted to hurt myself yet or anything and i feel really terrible about it

them talking about their experiences made me feel like i should die to prove im really suicidal which is dumb

So ive come to a conclusion.,,,,, i will never talk abo it my feelings again becos if i do it maybe makes them feel more suicidal like it did for me

so maybe me holding it in will decrease their chances pf thinkig about it by just a little
