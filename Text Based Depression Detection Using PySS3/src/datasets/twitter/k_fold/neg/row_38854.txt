Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonight.my parents are going to cut off all my contact with my friends and the outside world because i drunk alcohol in response to my issues. they said theyâ€™re never going to let me out of my sight but i swear iâ€™m going to fucking kill myself whether they fucking like it or not. they will like it, they donâ€™t care about me. iâ€™m not letting them make me suffer any longer. they said theyâ€™re going to know every part of my personal life and i canâ€™t let that happen. they drove me over the fucking edge. this is it. this is the end. iâ€™m not going on any longer like this.

i want them to know i fucking hate them now. and i love all my friends and i will miss them so much. i didnâ€™t want it to come to this point, i was trying to improve myself but now theyâ€™re just preventing me from doing that. constant surveillance would be the worst torture of my life. i refuse to go through it.

iâ€™ll kill myself because thatâ€™s obviously what they want. they donâ€™t care about the fact that they know constant surveillance makes me want to kill myself, theyâ€™ll do it anyway. i have no choice.

thereâ€™s nothing that can be done to talk me out of this. i have to go now.

goodbye. iâ€™m sorry.
