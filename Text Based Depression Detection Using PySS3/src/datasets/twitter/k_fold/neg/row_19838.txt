[vent] soon, maybeso the plan/thought process was that i would do it a bit after my brotherâ€™s birthday, and that is now only a few days away. i wanted to share one last good day with him and do whatever activities are planned for that day with him, before he goes back to school and we inevitably never spend another birthday together. 

i worry though. i havenâ€™t been able to do much as of late. i am scared that i will be too depressed to have a good time with him on his special day, and that thatâ€™s impression that i will be leaving him with. not as a brother who loves him and wants to be happy and spend time with him. but as an asshole, who canâ€™t drag his depressed junkie ass off his floor for a few hours to celebrate his little brotherâ€™s birthday, and then kills himself because boohoo. 

thereâ€™s been a lot of deaths in the family this last month or two and we have someone else very close who is on their way out, and iâ€™d hate to add to it. but i am, and have been for years, nothing more than a ticking time bomb. 

hopefully iâ€™ll get my shit together, make sure my brother has a good birthday.
