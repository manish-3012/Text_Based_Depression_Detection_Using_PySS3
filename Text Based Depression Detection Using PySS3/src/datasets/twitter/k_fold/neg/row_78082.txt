Whatâ€™s the point?Privacy is eroding and I hate it, mass surveillance everywhere. Itâ€™s so shitty, you canâ€™t do anything or say anything without somebody else knowing. Even worse is when you read the comment on this video [https://youtube.com/watch?v=VFns39RXPrU](https://youtube.com/watch?v=VFns39RXPrU) and see some more truths about life. The government are evil, thereâ€™s no escaping anything no matter what you do, Iâ€™m just an unimportant, slave to the system whoâ€™ll amount to nothing. I hate this, I feel so worthless and powerless while governments and corporations rule over the planet. Nothing even fucking matters. Even to make this account I had to complete a captcha, so now google know who this is, not to mention all the possible hardware back doors. Whatâ€™s the point of living in a world like this? Itâ€™s a damn dystopia!
