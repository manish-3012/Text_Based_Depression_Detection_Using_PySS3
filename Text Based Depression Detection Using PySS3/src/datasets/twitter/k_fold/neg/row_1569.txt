I'm addicted to child porn.Ever since age 15 (20s now) I have been watching child porn. I wish I did not do this to myself, but I did, and I can't find a way out. I still cannot break the habit no matter how hard I try. No matter what meditation or other mental exercise I do, it's a compulsion I cannot help.

I've dug and dug and still not found. So I pray. I need a miracle. I have to break free. I never want to hurt a child and I'm not even attracted to children (and don't even think about them except for trying to figure out how to break my addiction), but the videos are unbelievably addictive. I can't even imagine anything else having this level of hold over me. My problem is terrible compared to even the worst cases on /r/NoFap because I need to do it daily and it's children. *Children*. I can't believe it. I can't believe this is real.

Even if I break this finally... what do I do then? I have that in my past. How can I ever live with myself fully?

I can't seem to do anything about it but cry and hate myself, no matter how hard I try. But I don't want to be at risk of hurting a child. I need a miracle.

If anybody has the ability to give me advice in any way, please do so. I will use it to improve myself and grow in love. That's all I want.
