I'm feeling useless and I don't know what to do.My mom is criticize me because I don't do anything all the day. I'm feeling so different from other people. I don't want to do anything in my life, this world is so disgusting and ugly and I'm in a really bad situation for 1 year long already. I'm not going to school, I don't have friends, everyone is mad at me because I'm waisting my future, I have obesity and vitamin shortage. Life isn't made for me. I'm trying so hard but I never succeed. People is shit. We ruined the planet.
