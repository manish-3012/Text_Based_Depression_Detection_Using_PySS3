Itâ€™ll get better eventually is a lieIâ€™m done. All my life Iâ€™ve been dealt an unfair hand. It doesnâ€™t get fucking better. Not tomorrow, not in a year, not ever. I held out hope and improved myself for 6 months. I started feeling a bit better and optimistic but reality just dragged me all the way back to the bottom. Today is my friends birthday. He killed himself a week ago. My life just feels so numb without him . One of my actual true friends and I didnâ€™t even see it. I feel so guilty for not being able to prevent it. I always relied on him and never asked how he was doing. I couldâ€™ve prevented his death, he was actually loved by many, he was a good person among trash. Hahahaha this is just a bad fucking joke. Life doesnâ€™t feel real anymore. As soon as things start getting a bit better Iâ€™m reminded that I canâ€™t be allowed to be happy. - Iâ€™m cursed. If I kill myself Iâ€™ll probably wonâ€™t even actually die. I must be in a simulation. This canâ€™t be real. Itâ€™s all fake.
