I did it boi's! Finally!So today after 9 long months of feeling like a shit. I finally got a job. It sucks compared to my last one. I didn't think this was possible. Money is money right now. I was gonna blow my brains out tomorrow but maybe not yet. I'm genuinely happy for once. This feels like a small "pursuit of happiness". I wish I could cry but I can't. I still got ways to go boi's. I wanted to share it here; I don't really have anybody to share it with besides my brother.
