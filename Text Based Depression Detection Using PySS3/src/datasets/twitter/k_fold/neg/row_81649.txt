Some musingsI donâ€™t know what the breakout of this sub is, whether a itâ€™s mostly folks wanting to end the suffering or folks trying to stop those who want to stop it, but has anyone else ever felt like their existence was meant for suicide?


Deep, dark moments where you think: Iâ€™m destined to do this? Iâ€™m not sure I ever could. About ten years about in my early teens I held my mother in my arms as she died. Iâ€™d never do that to my family again. But it still nags at me every day: I was born to kill myself. Itâ€™s going to happen. 

I donâ€™t know if this is what this sub is for, or if other people even think this way, Iâ€™d just like to not feel alone if thereâ€™s a chance of it.
