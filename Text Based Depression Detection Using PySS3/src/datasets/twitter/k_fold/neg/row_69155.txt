Useless PersonI'm useless. I can't get a job in my field and I can't get a relationship. I'm tired of my life. One of my friends on Facebook posted a status saying RIP to two of his friends who died in a river. I don't know what happened for them to be in that horrible situation, but why did they have to go and I have to stay? I bet they were good members of society who had things going for them, and then there's me who has to be here. I hate living on Earth. I hate living.
