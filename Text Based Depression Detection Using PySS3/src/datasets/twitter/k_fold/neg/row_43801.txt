Just not seeing the point of it allI wake up in the morning, spend all day at my job which I hate, get home in the evening too exhausted to do anything other than browse reddit, then go to bed. Lather, rinse, repeat.

I graduated university a few months ago, and I can't say I've been at all happy since then. I have no friends in this new town, and no time or energy to go out and meet people. I can't see why people bother with this whole adulthood thing.

I feel so much better when I'm asleep than when I'm awake. Why can't I just stay asleep?
