I've failed everything in my life and I'm afraid he's going to realize he has no future with me.I'm afraid when he realizes it, he's going to kill himself. He's depressed too. If he leaves me at least he has a chance to be happy again with someone else. But I'm scared of that too. 


No matter how he leaves my life I can't live without him. I know I'll kill myself. I know I'm selfish.


I've known this was my last chance for a while. I've been miserable since I was a little kid, and I was so close to ending it when we met. He saved me. He's the only thing keeping me here now.


I wish with all my heart that he is happy. I don't know if that will ever be with me, but I hope so much that it is. If he can't be with me, I dream of being his guardian angel. Just like he was for me in life, I dream of a place where I can watch out for him forever.

I know I have no life without him. He is my life. If he leaves this world, I only hope I find out soon so I can follow him. Maybe we'll be together in some afterlife.

If he stays I hope we have a beautiful life together. But I don't think he will.
