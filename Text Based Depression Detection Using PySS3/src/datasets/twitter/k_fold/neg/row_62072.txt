I'm trying to find a reason to live. It's been so hard lately.You know that feeling you have when you just cannot get out of bed. Well that's how I feel most days. I have no idea what to do with my life. And considering how young I am, this sounds sort of ridiculous. Everyday I feel like a blob just sitting there. I would love to go out and socialize but my social anxiety stops me from doing everything I want to do. Whenever I talk my voice sounds weird, it's like I'm struggling with going from high tones to low tones. And I have no idea what to say to people. Also the fact that I'm ugly stops me from going to see people. Don't say that I'm not ugly, because the longer I stare at my face in the mirror, the more it becomes like a freak. This stupid oval resting "bitch"-face I have can't be fixed no matter what. I don't have the energy, not mental energy to do anything. Not even the things I used to love doing. I'm not thinking very straight nowadays, it's like my brain is static. If this is what my life will be then I really see no reason to keep on living life as a blob. 

Also the dream I had this morning confirmed my fears. Teachers, classmates, everyone in my life was telling me how fucking stupid I was and how weird I am. I don't know why but I heard this line in my dream/nightmare.

"I've had ---- ever since 1st grade and ----- still doesn't know how the fuck to follow instructions."

I woke up with tears all over
