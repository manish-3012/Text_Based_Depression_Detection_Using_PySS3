Borderline Personality &amp; SuicideI have a personality disorder with a 10% suicide rate. Thatâ€™s 50 times the suicide rate in the general population.

Speaking only for myself, the constant feelings of isolation and abandonment are often unbearable. 

My first thought in the morning - and my last in the evening - are all about dying. For me, this has lead to parasuicidal episodes of increasing severity.

Iâ€™m missing a lot of work lately, which has heightened my stress and deepened my depression.

Anyone else suffering in this way?
