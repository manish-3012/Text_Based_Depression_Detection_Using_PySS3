I don't wanna be here anymoreYesterday my life took a bad turn, my so was supposed to move in 2 weeks ago and now I'm alone he doesn't talk he has issues he's not telling me about I'm crying all day skipping class because I can't get out of bed the dark thoughts creep in and out of mind. I don't know what I can do. I feel scared because I don't wanna feel hurt like this but he needs support too, but I don't think he understands that not seeing him is going to make this worse on both of us, I don't wanna lose him but I feel alone now I only moved out because he was gonna move in with me and now I don't when he will be here and I don't know how to do anything while I am like this. I don't wanna be here I don't wanna feel like this anymore I just want everything to end. I need support and I don't know where else to turn to or who else to turn to.
