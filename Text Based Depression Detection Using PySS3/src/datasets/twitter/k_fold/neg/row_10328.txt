I've been depressed, stressed, and feeling loneliness for way too long. Finally ready to give up.I've been in a rut...for about 16 years. Fought it every way I could think. Been in therapy for years. Tried to make small changes, big changes, and everything in between. At some point though, after facing failure again and again, you just don't want to fight anymore. On paper, my life looks good - job, house, and most people see me as calm and friendly. Inside though, I've been living in my own personal hell. I could go on and on, but there's not much point now. If you've read this far, thank you so much for listening to my last rant, it means a lot to me.
