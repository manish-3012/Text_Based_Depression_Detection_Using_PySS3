Is it my faultI try to always tell myself to take responsibility, that im in control of my actions, and when I act out or do something ridiculous that I need to learn from it, but alot of times things set me off really bad, things I didnt even do but happened because of other people. Im in a bad headspace most of the time because of life/things that have happened to me, and I hate where im currently at. But its not enough, when im struggling to be "normal" my family goes and fucks everything up. Was coming off 3 or so suicide attempts and finally got a job with the help of my friend, then my family losers our fucking cat who seemingly comes back with flees (while letting stray cats in the house), or fucking ruins my chances of going to college, or throws a tantrum and breaks things in the house screaming how they fucking hate everyone, or just generally constantly drinks/smokes in the house. And when these things happen I just lose my shit. And I blame them for most of my problems. But i cant blame them for how I reacted, but it just hits me so hard, so much dumb shit. People I told I despise who have deeply hurt me and I never want to see again and they're allowed back in the house. People who live in the same house as me and cant even say happy birthday and I feel so alone and crushed already on my birthday
