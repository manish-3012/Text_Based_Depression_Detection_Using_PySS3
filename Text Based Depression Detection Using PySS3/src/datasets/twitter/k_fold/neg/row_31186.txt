I don't know where else to go but just i need to just get this out thereI really don't know what to do anymore, I was able to save up so much to help my mom buy a house and I decided to put it into the stock market. I have traded before but lost all of it because of stupid mistakes but this time I was supposed to play it safe since it was money I didn't want to loose. My goal with to make small trades and make back what I had originally lost and just stop after that. But the market tanked because of the virus and i lost 75% because I was using margins. I fucking lost 15k! And now I don't know what to do. I've been laying in bed for a couple of hours and music isn't helping. The only thing on my mind is how fucking stupid I am and just different ways to end it all. Last time I was this low I had gotten to putting a knife to my throat and just crying but I don't even know anymore. I don't know how else I can deal with this. Ik that it's just money but it's not the losing it part that's messing me up, it's the fact my family will find out. I don't think i can handle their response if they find out. So before that I think i might just go through with it.
