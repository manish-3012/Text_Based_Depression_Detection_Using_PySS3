I tried all I could. Am sorry I didn't mean to disappoint .Am 22 , alone and that's how I want it to be . I try prevent any relationship with any girl that finds interest in me.Why? Because I think they deserve someone better than I am. They disserve someone with a more better and clear future and more realistic goals in. 
My Parents have invested so much in my education and I really appreciate that, I can't disappoint them (especially my dad). Honestly I have to admit it that I already lost my passion in school. Am at University studying Telecom Engineering. I worked my ass off to get here and am    glad that am here. But I didn't do it for me I didn't it for my parents. 3 years back, I decided to follow my dreams as I continue school. Everything was going well until.. The Fuck am I saying??? Am just a stupid fucked guy who fucked up my life . Shitty goals, a disappointment an a failure to my family and I don't deserve to be here . I find peace in just thinking about suicide. Now am alone in my room , my roommate is not around. I should wrap the bedsheet around my neck and just sleep my life away. FUCK FUCK FUCK
