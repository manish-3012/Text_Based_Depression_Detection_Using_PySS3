I wrote a song based on emotions that Iâ€™ve had.I talk to the voices, even in my sleep
I still feel it empty inside me
Forgive me, my weakness, but I donâ€™t know why
Like this itâ€™s just hard to survive 

cause every time I think, my brain takes damage
And every thought I have, makes me wanna die
Gears in my head start to turn, My stomach will churn
Headâ€™s empty behind these eyes
Whenever I attempt a thoughtful process
My head begins to ache and I start to cry
Canâ€™t you hear my skull echo? Itâ€™s empty you know!
I want this out of my life

My head is a trap and my heart is in pain
Iâ€™m afraid of showing it all again
The good and the bad times, Iâ€™ve been through it all, but now they all make me fall

cause every time I think, my brain takes damage
And every thought I have, makes me wanna die
Gears in my head start to turn, My stomach will churn
Headâ€™s empty behind these eyes
Whenever I attempt a thoughtful process
My head begins to ache and I start to cry
Canâ€™t you hear my skull echo? Itâ€™s empty you know!
I want this out of my life

cause every time I think, my brain takes damage
And even taking meds, itâ€™s just not alright
Why do I keep all this in, itâ€™s just more sufferinâ€™ 
I need to get this outside



Even while Iâ€™m getting help, these feelings of depression and anxiety donâ€™t go away, and I donâ€™t think they will. I fucking hate it. Iâ€™m just doing the same thing Iâ€™ve always done. Instead of solving the fucking problem, itâ€™s just repressed. I donâ€™t think thereâ€™s actually a solution to it. I hate it so much
