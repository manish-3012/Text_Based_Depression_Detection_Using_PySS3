I just existWell, I think that I just fucked up my life. Spent full year doing almost nothing. Iâ€™m in a huge debts in my uni, still canâ€™t get up from a bed and go there to start fixing my problems. Canâ€™t do actually anything at all. 

One day switches another, nothing happens, I donâ€™t even feel interested in doing something, I can wake up and lay in a bed for a full day. Iâ€™m a fucking burden to my family, even my sister tells me, that Iâ€™m a complete disgrace and have achieved nothing in my 22 years, I agree. 

It feels like Iâ€™m just not created for this life, itâ€™s too hard for me to live this given life. And if suicide is for weak and cowards only, then yes, I am that coward.
