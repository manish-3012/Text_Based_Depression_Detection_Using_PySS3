I don't want to do this anymoreSo tired of every fucking thing. Drinking myself into a stupor and spouting off bitter rants...to myself. Being passed over by people who are fucking annoying to me but everyone else loves them because they're bubbly or whatever and therefore apparently kick ass. Constantly being filled with shame over not putting more time into schoolwork, and even more shame because I let it make me feel that way. Defining myself according to everyone else's expectations, and being malformed into a pushover throughout my upbringing and still being one today. Realizing that no one will love me that way because of the way my skin is (how many "cute girls" do we know who have to blot the oil off their fucking faces every few hours? What did I do to deserve that?) I'm so bitter and so tired and something is so off about me that even if it has its own merits sometimes, it'll always be such a struggle to assimilate with the world. I just wish I could go to sleep and it would be like I never existed in the first place. Things weren't supposed to be like this and I can't do it anymore.
