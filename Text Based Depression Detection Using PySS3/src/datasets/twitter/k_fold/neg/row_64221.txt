Blowing away in the windIve spent nearly 17 years wandering aimlessly. Highschool has sucked the soul out of me and I doubt that college will be any better. I don't have many friends although im a fairly likeable person. Today I had this realization walking home from my bus stop in the rain that life is awful and that it never really gets better. I could die at any minute and none of this matters. Why should I keep trying if nobody really cares?

Despite the image of normality that I try to convey, im a really broken person inside having spent a childhood of abuse, anxiety and family illness. I've had really strong reoccurring dreams lately and feel like I'm just falling apart all together. Im sick and tired of suffering. Im planning to drink myself to death this weekend. Im in the process of tying up some loose ends and coming to peace with all of this.
