My memories and thoughts make me want to kill myselfA lot of awful and embarrassing memories just keep coming back to me. I feel so much shame. I also have a lot of unpleasant thoughts that aren't memories. No matter what I do the thoughts and memories come back to me. It has gotten so bad I want to kill myself to escape it. I wish I could actually stab my brain.
