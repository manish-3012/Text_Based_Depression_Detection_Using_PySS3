Had enoughI just had a panic attack ...i dont know what im going to do right now.
Im 22 and i live alone , i literally had the worst year of my entire life .And now i was expecting to get some money today from the government , like an aid because i have an ilness and that money never came.Im already poor and i had so many struggles but now after paying for medicine im left with literally nothing .I get paid in 3 weeks and i dont know how i can survive that long .No money , no food left , im sick and completely alone.
I feel like i want to die im so stressed and i cant even think straight.
Im sorry i just feel so tired.Im done.
