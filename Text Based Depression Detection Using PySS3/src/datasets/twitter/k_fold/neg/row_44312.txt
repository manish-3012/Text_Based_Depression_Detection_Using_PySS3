Not sure how long I can hang on...I haven't really posted here before and don't like being vocal about my issues online.

I'm currently stuck in a really mind-numbing job that is draining enjoyment from my life. It's gotten to the point where I'm considering ending it because I feel trapped and can't face another day doing said job, and it's quite difficult to look elswhere with everything closed.

I'm about to start a shift and I'm having suicidal thoughts already. I keep reminding myself of what my therapist said but I'm struggling to see any positives now.

I know how this comes across and I am lucky to have a job with everything that is happening...but I can't continue like this.
