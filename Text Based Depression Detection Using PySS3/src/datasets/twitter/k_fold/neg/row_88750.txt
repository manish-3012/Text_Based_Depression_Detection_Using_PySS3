Are there people that truly enjoy life?Iâ€™m starting to question if happiness is truly real or if itâ€™s a facade people put on.

Is there anyone on here that can confidently say at one point they enjoyed life or were happy? 

Iâ€™ve been a wreck from a very very young age. Like I developed an anxiety disorder at about 6 and started developing depression at 9. NINE. What the fuck. 

Iâ€™m going to be 24 next month and thereâ€™s no sign of it letting up. Iâ€™ve been on meds, therapy, eaten healthy, exercised, stayed hydrated, meditated, did yoga, smoked pot, alcohol, sobriety, I have hobbies, I go to school. 

It. Doesnâ€™t. Work. *Nothing* works, and Iâ€™m seriously starting to question if happiness is something you can truly achieve. 

The closest I came to achieving happiness was alcohol. Iâ€™ve only been â€œhappyâ€ when I was drunk. Eventually it stopped working and I realized I ruined my life and got sober. I was told sobriety will help. It didnâ€™t. 

I donâ€™t want to do this for another 60 years.
