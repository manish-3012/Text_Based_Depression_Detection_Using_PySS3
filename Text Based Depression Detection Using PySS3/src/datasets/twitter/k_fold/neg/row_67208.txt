I get suicidal thoughts around 3 or 4 times a week, but I never have the stuff to lull myself withLike right now I just want to be done with everything. But I have no method of doing it right now. Iâ€™ll probably feel better tomorrow so I wonâ€™t go and get the equipment to do it (pills, rope etc.) 

How do I get around this loop?
