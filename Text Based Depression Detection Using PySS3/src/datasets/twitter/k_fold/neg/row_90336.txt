At my worstI've struggled with suicidal ideation since I was 10 years old. I don't even go to anyone about the daily thoughts anymore. I finally sought help and got medicated, but honestly now on my 2nd medication and still think about it daily and the side effects are almost unbearable. It's one extreme or the other when I open up to people. Hearing I'm selfish is one of the most hurtful things I could ever hear. I feel like I have more love to give than most, but no one lets me in. I've always been the weird person, the one that says things in conversations that causes silence, or gets talked over, or straight up ignored. Even professors ignore my discussion posts and e-mails. I have people read them and they say it's not the way I'm wording it, so it's like there's some barrier in the universe against me. All "advice" is the same old extremes like "but you have so much to live for!" or "well if you're going to talk about it then just do it already!". I get angry with myself often for not having the guts to follow through. I feel weak, alone, and afraid. I'm honestly have this fear that I'll be that one person that survives and will be stuck living in even more pain than I already do. I don't have many friends, and the ones I do have either turn out to be horrible people or I manage to mess it up somehow. I have a career and I'm in grad school, so despite my societal appearance I'm falling apart inside. I'm so tired of feeling this way, but I don't feel like there's any hope for me. The thoughts never go away. I always feel alone, unloved, and unwanted no matter what is going on. I had a really rough relationship with my parents growing up. We got along slightly better as I got older, but there was a lot of resentment between us. My dad and I had finally started to get along when he bled to death after a hospital fall two years ago. My mom has Bipolar II (I have been evaluated for that, and thankfully don't have it) and is medicated but it doesn't stop all the symptoms. She is my best friend one week and my worst nightmare the next. I never know when I can depend on her. My boyfriend is wonderful and does a lot for me, but he has severe ADHD which he has only recently become medicated for and we have been through a lot of ups and downs together, including my family despising him because of his lack of a career and poor upbringing (judgmental much). Most of my "best friends" are non-existent now. Grad school is a joke. I just can't seem to find the silver lining. I am so tired of feeling like this. I just want to go to sleep and not wake up. I'm not okay and I'm not sure I'll ever be. I can't talk about this stuff with anyone else because it sounds like a bunch of "pity me" and "woe is me". I know that I am pathetic, but at least it feels good to be able to get my thoughts out there.
