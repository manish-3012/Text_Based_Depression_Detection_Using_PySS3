Looking forward to friday, march 20th 2020Hello folks,
I hope you're having a great day so far, because I surely do not. But that's okay ladies and gentlemen, because march 20th 2020 is just a few days away! You know I like fridays, they always make me wanna chug some booze and lay down on a bench while it's -3Â°C outside in the middle of the night, you know? You see that bench on my profile picture? It's located around a mile away from my village, so it's the perfect spot to take a look in the sky, while chugging a bottle of vodka. Laying down on the bench, staring at the stars while slowly passing out/falling asleep while the body goes numb. Next thing you probably puke ya liver out but I will try to hold it in as long as possible guys, wish me luck. While being unconscious and dreaming about magic, mystical things, that I never experienced in my life such as LOVE, AFFECTION, GOOD &amp; DEEP FRIENDSHIP or simply a stable job. Well I think I have learnt my lesson in life, and don't worry guys! Some people, who don't really care about me, tried to talk me out of it, but that's so okay! Can't wait for the DMT being released from my body while my soul is quitting my body to find a joyful, bright place, where it is going to be hugged and kissed by positive energy for all eternity. I'm on my way. Soon I will be there. Soon.
