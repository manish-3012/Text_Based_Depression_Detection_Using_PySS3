Thought long a hard on killing myself today. Instead I decided to write a book.Iâ€™ve been so tired recently, no amount of sleep has helped. Iâ€™ve been trying to keep up with my college classes but I failed one of my test yesterday. Iâ€™m disappointed in myself and stressed out. After weeks of depression and no longer being able to afford my counselor, I thought long and hard about killing myself. Iâ€™ve thought of killing myself last year but back then I was so afraid of dying I couldnâ€™t do it. Now Iâ€™m no longer afraid, Iâ€™ve come to terms with my mortality and Iâ€™m not as afraid of dying as I used to be.

Well tonight when I thought about how to kill myself, I decided to instead talk to my mother. We had a long conversation over what I want to do with my life. She gave me advice on what she thought I should do to motivate myself and I decided to follow through with it. Itâ€™s always been my dream to write a book so today I took my first steps.

I wonâ€™t kill myself until this book is finished and who knows? Maybe Iâ€™ll be better by then.

Wish me luck, Reddit. Iâ€™m going to need it.
