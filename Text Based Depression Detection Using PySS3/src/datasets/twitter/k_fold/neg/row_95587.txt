Rock and a hard place.NSFL photos have shaken some of the suicidality out of me. My parents don't deserve to live with nightmares with the rest of their life, seeing my brains splattered all over the road, or the wall, or find my decomposing corpse wherever else.

I won't hurt myself. And it's making me want to die even more.

I'm stuck with all the thoughts that make me want to die, but I won't take the one certain route out. I'm fucking screaming inside.
