I have conteplated every day for as far back as I can remember.I dont have the motivation to make a very long post. Im just tired. I just want it to stop. Ive seen my only glimmer of hope in my entire life and the thought of losing it is driving me mad. I just keep lying to my psychiatrist and counselor. I cant help it. Medication hasnt helped. Everything just keeps getting worse.
