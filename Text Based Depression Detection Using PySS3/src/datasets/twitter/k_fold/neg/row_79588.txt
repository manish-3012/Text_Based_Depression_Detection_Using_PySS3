I feel like I canâ€™t do itMy life is a repetition of every day with different things happening only in school, my life is meaningless and I havenâ€™t felt a true genuine love from someone in a long time 

I feel like if i told someone of what I want to do, I would be placed in a mental ward but thatâ€™s never gonna happen

I hate myself and others there are people who chant â€œGay is not okay!â€ Or â€œTrans should be banned!â€ And itâ€™s hard to put up with this every day and I feel like I need to end it.

All I hope is that my death can serve as a lesson to our school on what they turn a blind eye to every day

Goodbye, for now or forever
