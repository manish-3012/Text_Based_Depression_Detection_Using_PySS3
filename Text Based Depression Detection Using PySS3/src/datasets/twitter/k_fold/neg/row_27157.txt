I feel like giving upMy name is Lane (M/23) I donâ€™t know if that really matters but thought Iâ€™d include it. One of my friends died a few weeks ago and that led another friend of mine into a deep depression that ultimately took his life as well. I was grieving all of this and at the same time dealing with relationship problems with my boyfriend (who lives next door to me). After about a week, I drove about two hours to go to the latter friendâ€™s funeral and had an extremely hard time coming to terms with everything all day when during the service my boyfriend texted me to break up. I did everything I could to separate the two things in the moment but the second the service ended I broke down in my car and sobbed. Iâ€™ve since come back home and had to deal with seeing random cars in his driveway at all times of the night (which is not something that ever happened while we were together). And I just canâ€™t deal with everything I have a lot of stress from not feeling good enough for what Iâ€™m in school for as well and classes start next week so Iâ€™m stressing that on top of everything else thatâ€™s going on in my head. Thereâ€™s more to everything but I feel like thatâ€™s the main gist of whatâ€™s currently happening. I feel like Iâ€™m drowning and canâ€™t reach the surface. Iâ€™ve been seriously contemplating suicide for about two weeks now, Iâ€™m just so over feeling so miserable and itâ€™s not just been like this since everything started. Iâ€™ve been depressed for as long as I can remember and have never truly felt happy with who I am. I take antidepressants that donâ€™t do anything and I literally just feel worthless all the time and this is the icing on the cake. I literally just want to give up and stop hurting. Everything is too much and Iâ€™m sick of fighting it all.
