My sister in lawHey all, we will call her Jane. I love her as if she was my own sister and Iâ€™m deeply concerned. I am well versed on what not to say when talking about suicide because I myself have had some issues in the past. My issues are one of the reasons Iâ€™m so concerned for Jane. She has recently attempted suicide and I believe she is in a mentally abusive relationship with a man that I truly liked a lot until I learned of how he treats her. They both have drinking problems and when they drink thatâ€™s when the abuse starts. Iâ€™ve only witnessed snippets of this type of abuse, the name calling, the belittling tone.... according to my other sister in law this guy also has used her suicide attempts against her in arguments.

I get the best thing to do would be to get her away from him. But she lives 10 hours from immediate family and has no job due to COVID. Another problem being, I donâ€™t think she will accept help. She is the eldest of the 3 sisters and wouldnâ€™t want to reveal these things, as it would make her feel vulnerable. I just have no idea what to do and I want to stop her from doing anything.

Iâ€™ve been there... once you attempt suicide, in my mind, itâ€™s not a matter of if, itâ€™s a a matter of when. Time is running out and I am just worried. I donâ€™t want to say something and cause more harm. All the internet resources out there tell you to get help from all these different suicide prevention places but what if the person doesnâ€™t want help.

I know I had to want help before accepting help, but Iâ€™m afraid that we canâ€™t wait for her to want help.

Please help me and more importantly help Jane.
