I Can't Do InpatientI am seeing a therapist for an eating disorder, and today she told me that it was my last session and that she recommends I go to an inpatient care unit. She's the only person in my region who treats eating disorders. I've had terrible experiences with inpatient before and would rather kill myself before going back to one.
