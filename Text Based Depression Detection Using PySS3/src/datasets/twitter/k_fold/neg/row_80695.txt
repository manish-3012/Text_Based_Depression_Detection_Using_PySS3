I get what I deserveI just hate myself. I'm a horrible person. I've ruined most of the friendships I had. I've had ghosted 3 friends (through the course of my highschool to college) over petty reasons. I think I even ruined their highschool/college life for them. I wish I could take it all back. I hope things are better for them now. 

Now I'm suffering because karma is a bitch and this is what I deserve. I don't enjoy anything anymore. I have no real goal in my life. I'm angry all the time even to my parents. My mind is all over the place. All the wrong things I've said and done before is eating me up, I think i'm going crazy. The voices in my head never stop. Everytime the memories come back, my mind tries to justify the things I've done, but I KNOW I'm a shitty person. I don't deserve to live. I can't wait to finally have the courage to end my life once and for all.
