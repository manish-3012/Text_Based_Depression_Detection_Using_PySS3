Things went downhill fast, having trouble coping right this momentI moved in with this girl, and for a few days things were great, then she got distant over a few weeks and eventually we decided to take a break, after a while it seemed like that wasn't enough so we broke it off completely, now she doesn't even want me here anymore, and I'll be moving back home, we've been friends for seven years, and with eachother a few times before online, but this is our first time actually meeting, and I can't blame her, sometimes things just don't work out, but we just had a huge argument and she doesn't even want me here anymore.

I know this is kind of stupid and I shouldn't be this effected, but it was my first time moving out of home and my first time actually being with someone I loved, and tonight she brought a few of her friends over, one who she was heavily flirting with and I lost my temper and said something then asked if we could talk outside, she then started telling me how I haven't contributed a thing (She's right, I've tried to do a bit of housework since I can't find a job because I don't have any experience or my GED even) I've been stuck up in the room to much, she doesn't get enough time alone to herself, and how I wasn't ready for anything like this, and maybe she's right, she probably is, but, I don't know, I feel like I've failed completely, I don't want to be away from her, she's my best friend, and even if she doesn't feel the same I still love her, I just don't know what to do with myself, I've never felt this far off the edge, I've been sitting here shaking and confused as to what I'll do now, I just don't know how to handle myself right now, I just want it to be gone, all of it, I don't want to remember the past few weeks, or anything that's happened, I don't want to move on, I just want it to stop now, and idk, I don't want to die, I don't, but I don't know how to handle this, I feel so fucking mixed up right now

If it helps at all, I'm 19, and moved from MI to CO to be here, first time leaving state on my own, I know it's pathetic that this hit me this hard but I'm really having trouble figuring out what to do, I still can't stop shaking, I've been shaking for hours
