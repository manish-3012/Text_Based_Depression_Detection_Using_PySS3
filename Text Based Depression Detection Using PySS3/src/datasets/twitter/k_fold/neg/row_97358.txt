Cut throatRecently, for the past couple of years I have found myself in positions where I would sit in my room for hours alone either holding a gun to my head with one in the chamber trying to build up the courage to pull the trigger but I never could. 

I have been trying to do the same but with a knife to my throat instead, yet I can't do it because I can't find a good place to go through with killing myself; purely because I don't want anyone to find me when I do it.
