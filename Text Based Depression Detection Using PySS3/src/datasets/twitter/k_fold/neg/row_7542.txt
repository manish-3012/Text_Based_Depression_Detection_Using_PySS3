I give up...I'm done..might as well end it..I just donâ€™t feel like living anymore. Iâ€™m tired of fighting it. Tired of being so damned tired no matter what I do. Iâ€™m just ready to give up. Hereâ€™s a few reasons why.

In no particular order:

*I was born dead, aka a blue baby. Depending on who you ask (different family members will give you a different number), my heart stopped 2-5 more times over the next couple days.

*I was sexually abused by my step-father for a few years. Then 3 years after he stopped, my step-brother started the same thing.

*My ex-gf cheated on me. A lot. Over 25 guys.

*My best friend died because of me. (pro-wrestling training incident)

*My aunt passed away 2 months later from a drug overdose.

*My first child, my daughter, passed away and my ex-fiancee left me.

*My current Ex-gf will not let me see my son, now going on 2 years since Iâ€™ve last seen him. Courts will not do anything. (she doesnâ€™t know about any of this or my depression)


Yeah, and Iâ€™ve made four previous attempts to take my life, so far none successful (obviously). At this point, I just feel done. My job is shit, doesnâ€™t pay well or even get my pay correct. I have no friends to really hang out with anymore. Nothing really interests me anymore. My family barely even says anything to me, usually only bothering to come talk to me if they need something. Really, Iâ€™m a burden to everyone I know.

Whatâ€™s the point of continuing on? Nobody needs me. Nobody cares. Nobody wants me. The world is better off without me. Iâ€™ve nothing to show for my life. I am useless and a waste of space and everyone's time.
