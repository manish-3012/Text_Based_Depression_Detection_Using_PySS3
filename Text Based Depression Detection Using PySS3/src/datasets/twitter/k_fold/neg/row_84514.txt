Vent..?Iâ€™m honestly done, I donâ€™t give a damn anymore. Itâ€™s the same every year, I hate birthdays so much. I try my best to give stuff to others and overall just make them happy, why wonâ€™t anyone do it to me? Why do I get loneliness instead??? Why do I have to get yelled at and just have to deal with toxic parents. What even makes a birthday special, nothing. I always thought as a kid that they were great, BUT ITS ALL SOME STUPID LIE. Worst thing is, they forgot about my birthday. Sometimes I really do feel like Iâ€™m no one. Iâ€™m just someone who has tried to be there for others.  I wanted to eat with my family, but I ended up being alone. I wish I were something special or amazing.. but Iâ€™m not... Iâ€™m nothing. Iâ€™m just some stupid punching bag. Whenever Iâ€™m sad, nobody helps me out, I usually have to put a mask on and say that Iâ€™m fine or else I get yelled at. Iâ€™m not allowed to be myself.  Iâ€™m only 15, Iâ€™ve dealt with stuff. Iâ€™m not allowed to go to therapy, but I really canâ€™t stop thinking about hurting myself along with suicide. People keep telling me that itâ€™ll get better, but each year it gets worse. Iâ€™ve had some good days, but those days were due to my sibling (my parents like her a lot). Nobody wants to hang out with me. I try to be with them, but they just donâ€™t seem to like me. I honestly donâ€™t think anyone has liked me as a kid. 

I verily even know what affection is. I have to fake it sometimes or else Iâ€™ll end up sounding really ungrateful and just dead serious. Iâ€™m aware that this is more of a vent, but I really donâ€™t have somewhere to go and just talking it out with one person alone makes me uncomfortable.
