i donâ€™t want to die, i just want to stop livingiâ€™ve tried to kill myself before but i got so scared at the last second and instead of waiting for the pills to do their work, i went to my mum as soon as my body started reacting to them. why was i scared? iâ€™ve realised that itâ€™s because i donâ€™t want to die. i really donâ€™t. i just hate life and i donâ€™t want to live it. nothing is enjoyable. thereâ€™s so much pressure. so much stress. so many changes. i hate it. i want time to stop. iâ€™ve started hating the people around me, why is that? i have no dreams for the future. i have no career i want to pursue. i would like to live young forever. that would be nice, to be a child forever. easily forgiven, donâ€™t need to work, dont need to pay to live under a roof. thereâ€™s only one thing i would like to do before i die, and thatâ€™s visit japan. but i donâ€™t want to live to be an adult. i donâ€™t have long left until i have to be independent so i doubt iâ€™ll ever get to visit it. iâ€™ve been really alone this year. i have no friends close by, and none i feel like i can talk to. iâ€™m feeling lonely. i donâ€™t want to die, but i donâ€™t want to live anymore. someone kill me.
