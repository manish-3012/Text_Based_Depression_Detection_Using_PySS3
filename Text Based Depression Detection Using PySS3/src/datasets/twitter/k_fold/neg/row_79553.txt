Literally no pointHave a cat

Am 23, male

Collect money from the government and I don't deserve any of it because I don't do anything anyway 

Live with family still and never planned to get a job or be anything of use to this steamy pile of shit called life

Can't stand the stupidity of humans

Can't stand myself and these thoughts

Can't stand pain and hopelessness

Can't stand anything 

Hopefully I can do it correctly and be gone.
