I finally told my mom.Iâ€™m 17 and Iâ€™ve been struggling with depression for several years. It was diagnosed when I was quite a bit younger, alongside anxiety. My mom never let me take medication and we were struggling financially with my (at the time jailed) fatherâ€™s debt sO therapy was out of the question as well. I donâ€™t really know why Iâ€™m telling you all this, I guess just to vent. Because I know Iâ€™ll get some response that at least extends past a shallow counselor telling me how I feel and that â€œitâ€™ll get better one day.â€

Ugh, Iâ€™m rambling..sorry. Anyway, I finally told my mother today. I told her how hard it is for me to get out of bed and the lack of ambition I have. I told her a lot of things that I never thought I would have. And she ignored me. She told me that I shouldnâ€™t say things like that because itâ€™s insensitive to others. She told me that her struggles trump my ownâ€”and you know, maybe that is true. But Iâ€™ve always offered her my sympathies or had patience with her and attempted to alleviate how she felt. I thought maybe if I told her I was struggling she could help me, Iâ€™ve always felt this way but recently itâ€™s gotten so bad that I needed that. 

So I told her, and she didnâ€™t even acknowledge it beyond heightening her own complaints. She blamed it on the fact that I donâ€™t go outside often and told me that I am going to be an adult soon so I need to just suck it up. And, again, maybe sheâ€™s right. But I already struggle financially to pay bills and afford my car. I canâ€™t go to college on top of this or be expected to afford a home. Itâ€™s just not realistic. But I canâ€™t put myself through the monotony of the job that I have. If I canâ€™t pursue the future I want, then why even bother? I donâ€™t even feel the same passion for the career I want anymore. Iâ€™m just existing. The only things I feel are anger and grief and exhaustion and itâ€™s such a miserable experience. 

I donâ€™t want to live anymore. I attempted suicide in middle school after an incident, but it didnâ€™t go as planned. I didnâ€™t really make another attempt because I thought i was being irrational and that things would get better. I graduate next year and I feel so lied to because all of the people that told me this were so wrong. I hate myself, I hate the situation Iâ€™m in. I feel like thatâ€™s the only thing I CAN feel anymore. Hate and exhaustion. 

And now I donâ€™t even have a future that I want to look forward to. I donâ€™t even know what the point is anymore. Iâ€™m so sick of being told how I should feel and that itâ€™ll get better if Iâ€™m just patient, itâ€™s the only reassurance that I get and it only fuels the fire. I canâ€™t wait, the world wonâ€™t let me. And Iâ€™m so tired that I donâ€™t think I can even keep up with it anymore. I donâ€™t know what to do with myself. I finally confessed to a person that I care about how I feel and I was rejected and it hurts so much worse than I ever thought it would. 

I feel so lost and unloved and i donâ€™t even have the luxury of â€œmaybe being wrongâ€ anymore. Iâ€™m so tired and I just want it all to stop. I donâ€™t know what to do.
