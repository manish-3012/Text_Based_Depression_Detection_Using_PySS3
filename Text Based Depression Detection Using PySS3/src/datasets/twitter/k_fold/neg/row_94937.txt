Honestly I donâ€™t know what to doI feel like my future will be going into addiction of alcohol and drugs because Iâ€™m already drinking and itâ€™s the only thing that takes my mind of my current and eternal struggling mind which feel shattered in either sadism or the need to end it all and I donâ€™t know what I should do or what I can do and I have gotten so much help over 5+ years so and I feel that there is only so much â€œlegalâ€ help,

And I donâ€™t want to disappoint my mom even do I have no feelings for people but she shouldnâ€™t have to know her son killed him self but at the point where I feel like I just should end it but then my problems disappear but there only grow  bigger but I loving family is again only so much that it isnâ€™t a permanent solution
