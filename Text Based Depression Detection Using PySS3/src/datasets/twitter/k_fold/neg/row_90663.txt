What's something that made you cry that helped you realize you're kind of patheticI've been a pussy and a crybaby most of my life but I think I realized that I was pretty much worthless in all regards when I cried from doing piss poor in a video game  


the mindset is definitely something like "Wow you can't even win a dumb game? you're even more incompetent than you thought" but after the first time I actually dropped a tear over this I realized it was pretty much all over for me lmao  


what about you?
