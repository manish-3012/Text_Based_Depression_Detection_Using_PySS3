I'm achieving professionally but collapsing internally and keep obsessing over killing myself and othersI'm objectively successful and well known in my field, but I've never wanted everything to end more.

I'm socially popular and reasonably attractive but anytime a human gets close to me on a personal level I shake them away. I have this sick superiority complex, I'm convinced no one is as critically and conscious as I am, that they don't deserve my time and focus. 

I spend hours planning how to make a final act. Either I'll drink and drown myself in the sea. But I keep obsessing on killing people before I go. I have people in mind and how I'll do it. I have so many plans and it scares me because if I start then there's no going back. 

I have achieved everything I wish to and I just want to go before I hurt people. 

I can't go to a counsellor, I'm stupidly sure that they will have no insight into my thoughts greater than I do.
