Should I die a hero in my kids eyes or live as a disappointment? Explained this timeSo yesterday I asked should I die a hero in my kids eyes or live as a disappointment? I didn't really go into details cause I only had 5 minutes before work. Today I'll explain. My only reason for life is my children. Their 6 and 4 years old and adore their father. Everything I do is for them. Rewind the clock back a year ago and I can say I was proud of how I raised my children. I had my own place so they could be with me every week. I made enough money to support us and spend time with them. I'm also in the military so my kids would be proud of the career path I chose for securing their future. The only problem was I have depression. It's really bad. There was nothing really wrong with my life but I felt hopeless. I bought a gun just in case life got the best of me. I didn't get a chance to use it tho. One day while going to work I was having a I want to die moment. I don't remember the drive to work just the police pulling me over pointing weapons at me. Long story short a driver said I pointed the weapon at him. That was in April of last year. Because I'm facing a felony charge I lost my job and place to stay. My daughter and her mother are homeless and my son is having behaviour trouble to the point he been hospitalized for it. I've tried so hard to be the dad my kids looked up to but I'm not sure if I can take this anymore. I've tried to get help but the meds and medical care made things worse so I stopped. Everyday I wonder should I die now and have my kids remember me as a proud dad and soldier who would do anything for them or live on and be seen as a low life loser who can't do anything for them cause he might be a felon
