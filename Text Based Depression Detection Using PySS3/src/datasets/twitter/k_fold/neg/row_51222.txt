I tried todayI tried to kill myself today. I made a couple mistakes though. I let myself get to nervous thinking I would get caught. My hands were shaking and I cut the non-dominant arm first leaving to cut my more dominant hand with even shakier hands. That didn't turn out too well. I had a little over an hour and a half to two hours to get it over with. I didn't cut deep enough though. I don't know why. I usually have no problem with that. I just couldn't cut deeper than I had. I didn't bleed enough by the time I had to get out of the shower. I bleed a **LOT** though. I hurt. It hurts so bad. Trying again will be a bit easier next time though. Just another failure to put under the belt. This one was just weird how I got so nervous. I have never been so nervous during an attempt before. Weird.
