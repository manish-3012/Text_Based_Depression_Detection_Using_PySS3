I dream of deathI have constant fantasies about ending my life. I've never been with a woman in any way. I have been rejected by women. They cannot all be wrong therefore there must be something wrong with me. Maybe I'm too ugly, maybe I have a horrid personality, maybe I'm just plain unlikable, but if I can never get love, what is the point? If I can never fall in love with somebody else so strongly that it hurts and know they love me back, what is the point? If I can never have a child, if I can never know what it is like to hold something in your arms and adore it so much that I know I would gladly give my life for it, what is the point? If I can never look back with my partner of many years on our journey and our children and grandchildren, what is the point? What is the point in shambling day from day with no real purpose like a zombie? Why shouldn't I end it? I have such vivid fantasies about it. There is no point to my existence, and if there is no point to it, why should I keep on living and wasting oxygen when there are others who could use it better? Sometimes I believe the only reason I'm not dead is because I'm too much of a coward to do it.
