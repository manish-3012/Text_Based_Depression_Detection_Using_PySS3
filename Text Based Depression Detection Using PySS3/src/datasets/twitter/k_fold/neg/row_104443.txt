its toughEverything feels so.... weird right now. I don't feel like I belong in my home, my parents and siblings are either neglecting or bullying me. From my own family I am getting insults that are in no way "for jokes". 

I can't sleep most nights, I wake up tired and go to school, its the same cycle. All my friends have disappeared and Im left alone. 

I'm not considering anything but everything feels negative. 

Is this a call for help or am I just.... idk
