My friend in a different part of the world than the USA can't access the hotline, as they don't have a phone.As said in the title, someone I know is going through extreme abuse and emotional torment and they can't get out, as they're underage. They've wanted to commit countless times, and I don't know how much longer our promise can hold up. Their phone is broken, so they can't call anyone, and because it's not in the Usa and I don't know exactly where they live they can't use the chat with their laptop. They're currently having a breakdown as I type this and I don't know what to do and am panicking. I apologize if this was vague, or not correct for this area as I don't normally use Reddit, but akjk ndnfen er im about to freak out but i have to stay calm for them--  


what do i do im so scared what do i do--
