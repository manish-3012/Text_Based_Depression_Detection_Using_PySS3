I'm trying so hard and I just want this to endIt's so hard to deal with. Yesterday would've been our aniversy. She left me 8 months ago but I'm still not over her. Not even a little bit, I'm still as bad as I was on day one. I know I need to move on but I just can't. I hate my life and I always feel so sad and alone. She was the only person who actually cared about me. I have no one aside from my best friend who's basically my brother but he doesn't help at all. I know she'll never come back and that I need to move on but if I move on then all that does is put the fact that we're over in stone. I hate this feeling. I just want to die, I have nothing to live for. I don't have anyone now. I need her. I have no purpose. I always try so hard and get nothing. I deserve to be happy but I'm not. All my life I've had to deal with people leaving me. My mother was abusive to me and abandoned me when I was 13. That's probably where my abandonment issues come from, I always feel so lonely even when I know I'm not. I'm just so exhausted I just want to lay down and die. I'm never happy. I'm only sad and anxious, and that's when I feel anything at all. I want life to reset. I just want it to, I hate this so much! WHY AREN'T I HAPPY? I WANT TO BE! I DESERVE TO BE! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH ME??
