I donâ€™t want to die but sometimes be alive is too much.Iâ€™m 15 years old. My dadâ€™s side abused me and brainwashed me. They made me blame my mom for the divorce and the rift between my â€˜familyâ€™. This happened when I was eight. My granny (on my dadâ€™s side) threatened to kill me last year and screamed that I betrayed her. My dad didnâ€™t believe me, he blamed me and told me to apologise. I couldnâ€™t because I donâ€™t want to have a relationship with her anymore. She hates me because Iâ€™m my momâ€™s daughter and thatâ€™s something I canâ€™t change. I blame myself for everything. My dad recently asked me to talk to her and he couldnâ€™t understand when I told him that I didnâ€™t want to have any contact with her. It stresses me out, all the things theyâ€™ve said. It hurts my head and Iâ€™ve been having a lot of mental breakdowns recently. I hate myself. I live with my mom but our relationship is a bit awkward but Iâ€™m working on it. I have this sinking feeling in my chest that crawls up my spine behind my throat.
