Hear Me Out...Big Chungus.

It hurts. But you have to say f it and move forward. Donâ€™t stand in the fire. Try not to be afraid. Iâ€™m terrified. Iâ€™m on fire right now. Here are my thoughts. 

We were given a life. Itâ€™s hard sometimes. We gotta ask for help and hope for the best. Nothing is perfect. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s worth it. Itâ€™s honest. 

Not too in depth, but feel free to add to that.

I love ya. We are in this crap together.
