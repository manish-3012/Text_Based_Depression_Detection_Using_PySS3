Looks like it's nearly time to check out, and I finally feel at peace with it.We've been together two years, and I (27f) destroyed it and destroyed her trust and self worth in the process. I'm almost certain she's working up the courage to leave me and I'm glad. She didn't deserve it, at all. I'm think I'm just a bad person. If she doesn't leave, I should, she needs to move on.

Once she's left, so has my last reason to keep going. Her and my dad were the only reason I've not taken matters into my own hands the past few years, and he died in March. Cancer. He was fine at Christmas. That disease fucking sucks.

I finally feel okay with everything. I deserve to be punished for what I did to her - I don't know if she'll ever recover properly. Nothing will be stopping me soon other than my own cowardice.

We'll see how easily that is overcome, won't we.
