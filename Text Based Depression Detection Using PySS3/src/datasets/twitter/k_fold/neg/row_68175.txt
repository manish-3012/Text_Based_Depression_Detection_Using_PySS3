I don't know if I can make it through the weekend.Everything has been piling up for a while. Every time it looks like things are getting better something falls through and I end up right back here. It's worse having to watch hope get crushed over and over than if I never had it at all. I'm a freshly minted grad student and I'm not doing well. I'm working a decent, dead end job and get rejection after rejection from jobs in my own field. My husband and family all seem so baffled and don't seem to understand that I'm just not as smart or capable as they think I am.

Anyway, when th the three day weekend I think I'm just going to have too much time to think. I feel like I'm drowning in every failure I've experienced over the last three years. I love my husband and my family, but I want to give them the opportunity to not have to watch me fail anymore.
