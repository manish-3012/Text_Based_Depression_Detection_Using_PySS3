i need your advice...not gonna write a wall of text about my story now, i might do it later though.
just to make this as short as possible, i want to be able to talk with my friends about my depression, that im having suicidal thoughts right now and have been close to killing myself before, but i fear they will tell and my parents will try to give me professional help and send me to a shrink and whatnot. That is the last thing i want...
Holding this for myself is really getting to me, and i dont know how much longer i can take it. i want to "risk" talking about it, but if they were to tell someone else i'm afraid it will get worse and i would end up actually going through with suicide.
help me reddit i dont know what to do...
