Tiptoeing around the edgeLet's just get this out of the way: I've wanted to kill myself for five years. I was abused as a kid in all three ways, and that combined with a traumatic period of bullying and my dad being incarcerated left me with crippling anxiety, and a depression that was only mild before as severe as severe can be. (I scored the highest possible score on the diagnosis test - how the fuck am I still alive?)

It's never gotten any better: my councillor is useless (and I'm too anxious to ask for a new one - the ultimate irony), my mum makes it worse somehow, and I have no friends in real life. Just people that let me sit with them. I'm fucking miserable, and I'm this close to just calling it a day and ending it. My relationship with food exactly mirrors that of a person with substance abuse issues - and yet nobody takes it seriously because I'm overeating. I was a skinny kid with huge self esteem issues, and now I'm 22 stone. Fucking kill me. The only things that keep me going are my one online friend Emily (who I'll eventually end up scaring away like I do everyone else), and whatever short term thing I've come up with to keep functioning. I don't know what else there is to live for. I'm an emotional black hole with no relief, the only community on reddit that gave me any solace got banned (SanctionedSuicide). The other day I smashed open the pill cabinet and nearly took everything that was inside, but I cut my foot on the metal which distracted me enough to revert back to my usual vegetable state. I'm failing at college, I'm barely going in and I say it's because of anxiety (because at least people understand that) but it's actually because of the fucking crushing depression I feel every single moment of my life. I've been told time and time again it gets better. Well, it isn't. So maybe I should just call it here.
