I am having suicidal thoughts, don't know if I should tell fiancee since its a really stressful time for her and I don't want to burden her.Hey, I'm having suicidal thoughts, and am in need of support. I want to talk to my fiancee but its an extremely difficult time and shes already stressed out enough as it is with exams and working. Should I talk to her -or- should I wait until a less stressful time -or- should I not bring it up at all and just talk to a therapist or something.
Thanks

I tried to post this to relationship advice at first but it didnt let me
