When every day becomes a a nasty battle with depression, is it worth living anymore?I keep posting on this sub, hoping that by externalizing what I feel will somehow make it easier, I will feel less insane..

But every day it's getting harder and harder, and suicide keeps looking like good, safe option to check out, be free from all the pain.

I go to school, I have a good enough job, amazing parents, some friends.. my life doesn't really suck, it doesn't, but my brain is killing me. I keep thinking of the day my parents will die one day, and the pain of that reality makes me want to die instantly, and I can't help but think about it. 

The psychiatrist I went to put me on some meds, and told me to give it at least 2 weeks in order to tell if they're helping me or not, it's been a week, I wannna wait one more, and then fuck it, at least I'll have a good enough reason - medication didn't work, it's hopeless.

Fuck
