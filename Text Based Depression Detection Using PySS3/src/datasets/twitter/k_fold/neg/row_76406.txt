Feel like I've wasted my lifeBefore you ask, I'm 33. I'm morbidly obese, female, pretty shitty job, no friends, haven't been in a relationship in 10 years. Have bad social anxiety and depression, I'm so quiet I feel like I have no personality or anything to talk about with anyone. No hobbies and I struggle to find interest in anything aside from sleeping. I feel like I've royally fucked up my life and even if I lose all the weight I need to my body will be messed up forever and no guy will want to be with me. I'll probably never have kids (maybe for the best?). My 28 year old sister is perfect and is getting married this summer- I know my parents favor her and I can't blame them. It doesn't seem like it's worth living anymore, I wake up every day feeling like shit about myself and for wasting my life.
