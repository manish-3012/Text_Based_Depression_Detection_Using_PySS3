How do I not leave my son with a life of trauma brain?The only thing keeping me right here is the fact that my son will end up knowing that his mother killed herself. 

I work in healthcare, so I know of lots of people who have had traumatic upbringings and have ended up with awful lives.

How can I guarantee my son doesnâ€™t end up with an awful life knowing that his mum killed herself?
