Not sure I even have the energy to type thisBut here goes. I tried to kill myself last Saturday night. I took 15 pills of codeine and valium with whiskey but evidently it wasn't enough. My girlfriend broke up with me and I thought it was over for good but she came back and talked me through it. It wasn't just the perceived end of the relationship that I attempted suicide over though, that was just the last straw. I've had derealisation-depersonalisation disorder from smoking weed for 14 years and severe OCD for 13. The former manifests as agoraphobia and I have been stuck in a rural shithole trying to get help for it all from a local health trust in special measures for almost as long. Everyone I ever love leaves me. I seem to always piss my girlfriend off just by being myself. She is the only good thing in my life but we can't have a normal fight, it always has to end with a potential breakup and tonight she seemingly doesn't want anything to do with me again. It's my fault but I just don't know how to fix it. All this ha sort of compounded to the point where I just don't want to be me anymore, even if I'm nothing. I'm not good enough for my girlfriend, I am too mentally ill to contribute meaningfully to society and I fucked my one chance at a good deeth last weekend by taking too many but also not enough pills so now I'm just slamming my head against shit and jamming knives that aren't sharp enough into my arm. I don't even know why I'm typing this.
