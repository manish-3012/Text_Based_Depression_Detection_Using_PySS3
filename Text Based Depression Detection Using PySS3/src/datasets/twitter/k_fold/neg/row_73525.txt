Why do I have to continue to exist.My first post here. I'm sure I'll fuck it up. It's kind of how I roll.

Just shy of 5 years ago I tried to kill myself but backed out at the last minute. Checked myself into rehab, on the Chicago north shore.

Typed out other shit but deleted it. Suffice to say beautiful rich women I was in with were fawned over and flourished. I just wish I were dead. I hate myself for not pushing through with the suicide. My marriage ended, my daughter hates me, and my one relationship after has been a shit show.

I guess I look good "for my age" whatever that means. I'm still alone except kitten, half drunk, listening to creepy pasta stories on YouTube and posting here.

I hope next time I push through. 30 seconds of strength and this post wouldn't exist.
