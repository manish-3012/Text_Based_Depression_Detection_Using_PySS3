How do I go?How am I going to go? Rent a hotel overlooking the beach? Overdose? Jump off that balcony? Itâ€™s been long overdue. Really has been. Iâ€™m tired of lying awake for hours thinking of everything thatâ€™s happened in my life thatâ€™s unable to be changed and fixed. Iâ€™ve reached 20 years old and Iâ€™d love to think of that as an accomplishment but rather, I think of it as eight years of helplessness. Suicidal for all of those years. Nothing has changed when it shouldâ€™ve. I canâ€™t deal anything anymore, no strength and no will to at least try life.
