I donâ€™t want to die, but Iâ€™m not so sure anymoreI used to be a happy person, but Iâ€™ve been dealing with a lot in the past five years. Like many people, Iâ€™m sure, Iâ€™ve thought about suicide: sometimes abstractly and sometimes not so abstractly. Iâ€™ve always known in the back of my mind that I wouldnâ€™t go through with it, because things can always change; things can always get better. And there are people who need me and depend on me. Today, I wrote a suicide note, and Iâ€™m beginning to get scared by how comforting the thought of ending it all now seems.
