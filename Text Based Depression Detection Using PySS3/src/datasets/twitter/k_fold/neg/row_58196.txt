Trigger warning: my mam wants to commit because of me and my brothersI was talking with my mom earlier about the state of the house, she said we never show her respect (sheâ€™s never in the house and I always do the best I can) and she says the way my brothers treats makes her suicidal, she burst out crying saying we donâ€™t respect her and Iâ€™m trying my best but she just focuses on my brothers (as usual) and I donâ€™t know what to do lm so scared and I blame myself, what do I do
