Out of options.I won't even use a throwaway for this..
I've been here before. Around the time of my first attempt at my life. I've run out of options again, and I'm close to just ending it. I've had no real friendships throughout my life. My parents constantly ignore and undermine me. Self-harm doesn't calm me down anymore. I just don't know what to do.

EDIT: Sorry guys, I fell asleep. And I'm okay now, thank you all very much for listening and for the kind words.
