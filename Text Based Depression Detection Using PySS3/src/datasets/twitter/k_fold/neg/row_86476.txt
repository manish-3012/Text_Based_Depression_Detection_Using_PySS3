Just a shell...I feel empty. I've struggled with suicidal depression for 12 years,sometimes its easier to get through but im sinking really deep this time and its scary. I want to throw myself in front of every car I see, launch myself off my apartment balcony head first onto the concrete. And I feel so guilty it makes it worse,because I have the most beautiful son in the world. I try to tell my husband about it but itll be a topic of conversation for 5 minutes before he moves on and talks about something like its really not as bad as im making it to be. I feel like there's just this hole in my chest,and the more it caves in the emptier I am. I don't have the money to try and get help, and im just sinking. Its hard to breathe.
