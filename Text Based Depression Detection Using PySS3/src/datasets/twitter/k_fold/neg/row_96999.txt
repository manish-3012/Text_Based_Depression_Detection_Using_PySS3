Hospitalized and lied5 days ago I tried to kill myself. I tried to OD on my medication however two days later I woke up in hospital. A psychiatrist talked to me on my last day to see if I should be further kept, however I lied. I lied saying it was a mistake and that I didnâ€™t attempt to kill myself. Itâ€™s all LIES. I did try and took the rest of my medication I had for the month. I was crying in downtown taking the pills and for some reason decided to go to hospital. That was a mistake. I should have went home and passed out. Iâ€™m so disappointed with myself as I came so close to dying. My regular psychiatrist thinks Iâ€™m ok...because I lied about it. Nobody know that I cut myself...again because of lies. I canâ€™t tell the truth to people because of judgement. I wish I was dead already. I feel so lonely and have a terrible feeling of being in my body. I just want an out. One future plan of mine is going to a shooting range and ending there. I donâ€™t know how to feel normal. Iâ€™m always on the verge of crying. I lie to people close to me that Iâ€™m ok. Because I know theyâ€™ll ask whatâ€™s wrong, but honestly I canâ€™t put it into words.
