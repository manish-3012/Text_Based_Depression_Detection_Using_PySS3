Writing because Iâ€™m worried for a friendIn our six years of friendship, he goes through seasonal affective disorder like clockwork, but the last two years have created stress and unfathomable trauma.

Iâ€™m trying to be a supportive person, but heâ€™s super withdrawn right now. Iâ€™m respecting his boundaries in attempts to get him to stop isolating himself (heâ€™s not physically alone in his house), but damn. I miss my buddy and I donâ€™t want to miss him forever.

If youâ€™re dealing with any ideation or intent and need an ear, Iâ€™d like to do *something* for someone who needs it.
