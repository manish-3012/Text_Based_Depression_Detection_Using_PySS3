Can'tFor a couple of years I've been contemplating suicide. My father doesn't really pay attention about my mental health, rather my grades in school. My mother is always working and has no time for me. My brother is annoying and doesn't give me any privacy. He barges in my room and I never have any time for myself, just right now he broke the doorknob to my door and punched me hard in my stomach. He is always rude and hurtful to me, and my grandma does nothing to stop it. I'm always the one bullied in my family, the odd one out at school. I have so much anxiety it's not even funny. I'm too scared to kill my self, but I really just want to die already. What do I do?
