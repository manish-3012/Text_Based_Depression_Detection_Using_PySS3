Numb, not sadBeen having on and off suicidal thoughts since around December. These have gradually become more serious to the point where I have started planning and testing my plans. This mess begun when I started hearing voices, one in particular has even encouraged me to jump over high balconies and in front of an approaching train, 4 separate incidents to date. I'm still here but I feel like I shouldn't be. I have until September to magically fix my brain and go to college or something else my mum's gonna kick me out. She can't support me and I can't do it on my own. Maybe my only escape is death. Why can't I just be healthy and happy???
