I'm a really sick person.All I want to do is die. I honestly wish I could get my hands on a gun to blow my brains out. I've tried OD-ing before but alas that did not work. 
I have a sick fantasy about my eating disorder getting so bad that I'm basically a skeleton and end up in hospital. 
Do I want attention? Sure. But I don't know how to get attention in a positive way, especially since I've been majorly depressed for years. 
I just don't know the real me from the depressed, sick me anymore.
