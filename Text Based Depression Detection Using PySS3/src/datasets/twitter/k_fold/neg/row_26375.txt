Why do people lie and say they care when they donâ€™t?Iâ€™ve become such a horrible and bitter person. I know this. I know it must be hard to care for me, (I have BPD, Iâ€™m at least self-aware enough to know that I can be the problem) and I do my best to manage symptoms, but fuck. Iâ€™m constantly torn between people are just trying to protect themselves, just like we all do, and expecting that people should care about me. But I also realize I can be toxic with negativity. Iâ€™m trying though, Iâ€™m trying so fucking hard and itâ€™s never good enough!!!
Iâ€™ve been depressed since I was 13, been on so many different fucking medications, been in and out of the hospital for suicide attempts 3 times, no wonder Iâ€™m depressed!! No wonder I can be a negative person!! I have no friends anymore, Iâ€™ve dropped out of college twice and lost all of my academic scholarships, Iâ€™ve lost my job, Iâ€™ve gained 50 pounds, I have self-harm scars and stretch marks all over my body (Iâ€™m 21 and it looks like Iâ€™ve been pregnant), and above all, music was my saving grace and I canâ€™t even muster the energy to do that anymore. And then after all of that, I had to be assaulted in a room full of people, with someone who I thought was a friend since I was 12. A â€œfriendâ€ who sat by and did nothing. And when we ran into each other recently, she noted that Iâ€™ve disappeared off all social media and promised to reach out. That was months ago. No follow up at all. Not even a hint of apology for the friend that she watched strip me naked and abuse in front of her. Iâ€™ve cut, burned, and starved my body before, but at least it was mine to abuse. At least it belonged to me. Now I donâ€™t even own my own body. Itâ€™s a fucking prison, and I want out.


How long do I have to fight this???? Why do I have to fight this for the rest of my life???? Itâ€™s like every time I take a step forward, I take 3 steps back. My dad offed himself when I was 14, so whoâ€™s to say that I wonâ€™t do the same thing decades from now? Why canâ€™t I just cut out decades of suffering? This sounds horrible, because Id never wish this on anyone, but I wish heâ€™d done it decades earlier so I wouldnâ€™t have even been born. If I werenâ€™t so scared of failing and being hospitalized again, and then having to pay money I donâ€™t have for the â€œprivilegeâ€ of being kept alive against my will but most likely disfigured, I wouldâ€™ve shot myself. Or driven into a tree. 

No one cares about me. No one cares about any of us here. No one cares until youâ€™re dead. I wish I had the strength to just fucking end it already.
