I'm not used to these suicidal feelingsHi all,

Until recently, I was super happy and optimistic about the world and humanity in general. In retrospect, with regards to the way I'm feeling, that optimism now appears to have been foolhardy ignorance and naivety. I don't know what happened but a few months back it felt like a fog was lifted and I really saw the world. Stupid me was ambling around in a happy hippie fog not seeing the true destruction that we cause to nature and each other. With this fog lifting, I can honestly say I've never felt such misery. If not misery in one moment, then I feel total apathy. I want to die, just so I don't have to watch us humans pillage the Earth and exploit each other. I've come to realise the small amount I can do will change nothing. My deeds only pale in comparison to the evil and disunity there is in the world. 

I feel resolute in my decision that I will end my life. Having control over that one thing gives me strength to postpone it for now. The only thing I am struggling with is the emotional devastation that I will leave my family with. We are very close and they have already had to deal with a familial suicide. I don't think I can put my parents through dealing with my death but equally I feel so trapped in this life. I can't wait wait another 30 years for them to die before I kill myself. This is distressing me. I could feign a natural death or an accident somehow but the thought of my parents grief after I'm gone stops me from following through. 

I don't know if I'm asking any questions within this text to you all or what exactly I want to hear back. I just needed to talk to some one and get these thoughts out of my head. Thanks for reading.
