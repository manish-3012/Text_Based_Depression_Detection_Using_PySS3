Things to remember before goingWith each day that goes by, I feel ever slightly less afraid of dying and leaving what's here in this life behind. With each passing sunrise comes another day that I'm emboldened by the idea of leaving this pain behind and embracing the dark and cold.

But before that can happen there's many important things to wrap up and conclude. I need some advice on what these things should include. Obviously some high priority ones include things like:

Notarising a will to pass along monetary and physical property that was yours. 

Closing bank accounts. 

Quitting your job. 

Disposing or selling of unwanted goods.

Terminating all online accounts and emails. 

Etc. 

Any other suggestions to fill in the empty spaces of what a person leaves behind after passing would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.
