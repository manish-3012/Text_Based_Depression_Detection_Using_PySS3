Not going into 2016So its been a hard year for me, not going into too much detail but i've tried killing myself several times and each time i was saved before i was done and had to deal with police/ambulance showing up at my house and taking me to the Mental health ward at the local hospital followed by me spitting bullshit about how i wont do it again to leave.

I come from an Italian family and I'm 21. They still are very protective which limits my happiness in life. For the past year I have smoked weed everyday to "try" to forget all the bad, but the weed always runs out and when it does, nothing makes me happy.

I had the world in 2013. At the end of high school i weighed 135kg, got down to 75kg in 3 months (no joke) was on a local news show in Australia. I felt like i was finally in tune with the rest of the world, going out making friends getting girls. I started training hard at gym and wound up 95kg (did one cycle of steroids) at 10-12% body fat. So any gym junkies would know that i would have had an amazing physique - thus 2013 was the best year of my life, i was happy. 2014/2015 were hard, i crashed my car leaving me with no car and insurance money. Started gambling and smoking weed, stopped going gym, leaving me at 90kg with atleast 20% body fat and a body that im ashamed of. Now its almost 2016, i have no friends, no one who loves me and there hasnt been a day i havent had to face endless screaming and being put down by my family this year and its taking its toll on me. I just want to be safe in the sky.


TLDR;

-Not happy
-Nothing making me happy
-Will be better if im in heaven
-Failed attempts 4 times this year
