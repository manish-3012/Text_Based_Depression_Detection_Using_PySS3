Whatâ€™s the point of living when the world is fucked and you canâ€™t do anything about it?Iâ€™m so empty. Iâ€™m in my first year of college, and I seriously donâ€™t see a point in going to school for four years to get a job when the chances of the world even being around in the next ten years are slim. 

Iâ€™m an empath, and itâ€™s so hard. I watched the videos of innocent civilians being brutally beaten in the subways of Hong Kong, and people taking selfies with those getting arrested. I see things like that, and Iâ€™m so powerless because thereâ€™s really nothing I can do. Or anyone can do. It just seems like a massive world war is going to happen soon. 

Thereâ€™s the threat of global warming, and economic crisis, and a million other things that will literally destroy any chance of me being able to live a life. Hell, even now, I canâ€™t allow myself to feel happy when so many other people are suffering. Itâ€™s selfish. I canâ€™t think of a single way I can possibly be happy or content knowing how terrible everything is and how much worse it could get soon.

Iâ€™m so scared of dying but Iâ€™m so scared of being alive. I just want to be able to fall asleep, and live in a dream forever. When Iâ€™m dreaming, everything is exciting and fun, and anything bad can be changed. If virtual reality becomes a thing we can live in someday, I donâ€™t care if itâ€™s artificial and fake. Iâ€™ll gladly trade living in a world where people are so horrible to each other for living in a completely fake and made up world where everything is fine.
