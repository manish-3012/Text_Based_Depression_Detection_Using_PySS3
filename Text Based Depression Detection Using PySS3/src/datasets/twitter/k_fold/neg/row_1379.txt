I don't wanna Live and Its becoming a issueSo, My life has really gone to shit,
All my childhood memories are of Sobbing while listening to my parents fighting with loud bangs.
 when I was Nine and sexually assaulted by a family member (that's the first time I've actually ever confessed that but it doesnt phase me anymore) 
And Then around age Eleven my Dad started drugs when his brother died (my mom had been on drugs since before I was born)
And Started to ignore me and Steal things from me and siblings to sell for cash and I developed depression.
And then I became homeless three years later, And still had untreated Depression after begging Multiple family members to try to help me get into therapy.
And then I had to leave behind all my friends and move to a new state and start again without help.

And then I stopped caring, Its almost as if I lost the ability to feel and I want to Try to end it all to see if I can feel anything at all. 
And as you'll probably assume Its really been getting in the way of classes (another truth I've lied about being older on this site so people dont treat me like I'm actually my age 15) and I honestly dont think that I'm going to get better.
So... what do I do?
