The thoughts are backSo after maybe 6 months of suicidal thought freedom, I'm having passive thoughts again that I'm afraid will turn active. I mean I'm already envisioning myself jumping from a bridge every time I see one or shooting myself even though I don't even know where to begin to find a gun. I mean, what am I supposed to do when I'm like this and I have no one to talk to. No friends, no supportive family, and no doctor until a month from now. All I have is maybe some internet strangers. I want to overdose but I have nothing harmful in my house. I want to just leave and run but my parents have alarms on the doors. Im trapped in my own skin and I feel like I'm running on borrowed time, like I was supposed to be dead ages ago. I'm so tired.
