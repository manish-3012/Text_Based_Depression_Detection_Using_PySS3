I do not regret attempting suicideI have tried to commit suicide multiple times via trying to hang myself or suffocate myself.
I do not regret this, I hate western society and feel there is no point in participating in the corruption of capitalism.
I love my friends and music.
my family was abusive and I do not associate with them, and it makes me feel so lonely.
I feel like no one has the time or energy to help me survive.
I have no job, no place to live and I don't know if I can survive another winter.
I'm addicted to alcohol, weed and cocaine and I am so tired of living.
I believe pharmaceutical companies are essentially capitalist propaganda designed to pacify descent and assimilate anyone who becomes aware of the immoral nature of capitalism and ''democrasy'.
in my mind the only escape is death. 
society has become a filtration system that weeds out anyone who is emotionally aware enough of the pain capitalism causes.
we are told not to change our society but instead our minds and I believe this is a contradiction. 
my personal experiences have been a series of trauma and I feel unsafe to express the reality of my experience.
I feel that my experience has inherently forced me into isolation. 
so when people tell me there is so much to live for it feels fake because I am not permitted to feel or enjoy anything.
I have no idea why anyone would want to live and I don't think there is any hope of reform in my perceptions of reality
society makes me sick and I just want to die 
it feels like torture knowing people want me to live.
I have so much suffering and I can't function in this world.
