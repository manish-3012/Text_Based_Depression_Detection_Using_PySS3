idkAfter reading a few posts on this subreddit, I feel like I shouldnt have a reason to be suicidal. Compared to other people I have a very good life, but I just want to die. I feel like suicide is my destiny. 
I know I wont let myself change because its how I survived so far but its the reason why im sad all the fucking time. All I can say is gg, could have been better but i think its time.
