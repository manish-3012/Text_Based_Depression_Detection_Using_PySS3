I don't think counseling is working, but what else can I do?I've had PTSD symptoms for years now, but only been diagnosed recently. That was helpful, as was much of the initial work. But everything has been stymied for months, and I don't know what to do. I'm using my university's free counseling, if I paid for this I would've stopped a while ago. It's so dispiriting to keep going and making no real progress.

I just have have these massive issues with touch that I don't think talking about can help. I was molested, and the parts of my body that she touched fill me with shame. I can't look at myself sometimes without feeling vulnerable. This is perhaps TMI, but I can't even touch my penis without intensely feeling that I'm being molested again. I literally have never touched it for longer than one second in my entire life, because the abuse began when I was really young. I never had a chance to be normal. 

So I live out this weird, maladjusted double life of deep and twisted dysfunction. I seem pretty normal to most people. I've cried to a couple friends about getting molested, and mentioned "I don't like being touched" or "I often feel unsafe" but how can you talk about the deeper, weirder shit that it does to you? My thought process is just altered in so many bizarre ways. I'm not a complete human being. 

I have trouble telling my counselor this because I feel so... stilted when I'm there. Everything is second guessed and I have trouble recalling the depths of my darker thoughts. When I'm with other people everything is extinguished and it's like I'm a different person. At night, alone, a blanket of sadness descends on me and only then can I catalog all the ways that I'm broken.

I don't get anything out of still going, but it seems rude to just stop. And that seems so final. What else could follow ceasing therapy in defeat but suicide? To surrender now would be my Waterloo, but to keep fighting is exhausting. I don't know what to do. I wish I knew what to do. 

I don't even wish to be normal. I'm more realistic than that. I wish I had a patch of my life where I might've had a chance. I was first molested at 4 years old. It's my first memory, but that wasn't the first time it happened. In the misty far reaches of my memory, the abuse is already ongoing. I wish I had an unclouded stretch of time before it happened I could recall. Some beautiful sun kissed memory of safety and comfort and joy that hasn't yet been corrupted. I'd trade decades of my future life for that. I'd die tomorrow if I could spend today recalling a time I wasn't crippled by abuse.

Why do people do this? How can someone hurt a kid like this? She was in charge of me. She told me not to trust strangers, because they might hurt me. Did she know what she was doing? Does she have any idea that almost two decades later her victim is crying late at night because he doesn't want to bother anyone and because he doesn't want to be alive anymore? I always wonder if her other victims are like me. How many of them are dead, how many of them wish they were. 

Please I really want someone to talk to. I can't talk to my friends in real life about this anymore. I feel guilty, I can't control myself and just keep crying.
