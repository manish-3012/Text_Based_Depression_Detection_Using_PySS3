Just lost the sparkI'm 17 and I'm in my last year of high school, for month's I felt that didn't care no more  about any thing, each passing day I wish for death to come and take me. I even though about suicide, I joke around with my friends about suicide and hope for someone to notice and ask, last year I joined two sports wrestling it's because I want to be an MMA fighter and track so I could be mentally though and be athletic, today in wrestling practice I felt like i didn't want to do this and just drop out of school and work at my nearest 711. I just don't care I lost it and I'm not interested in relationship like any other teenage boys, I don't know what I'm going to do and I'm probably just gonna end it on Friday but I don't want to ruin my little sisters birthday. Do I care? I care right? Or should I ended it  probably on Oct 17 is this normal? I don't feel any thing just nothing like my emotions are trapped I want to ask my parents about this but they well just throw it under the rug just like my sister. She attended suicide and failed "my mid sister not the little one", when she tried that I didn't actually care and thought to myself "lucky", I don't know what to do any tips?
