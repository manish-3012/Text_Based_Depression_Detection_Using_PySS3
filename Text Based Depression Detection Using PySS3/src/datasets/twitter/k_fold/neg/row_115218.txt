Dear darknessHey, it's me miah. We meet again! You've grown since last I saw you. I see you've made some friends..You and I haven't spoken since I was 6, no 8, no 12, no 13? 15? 16? 17? 18? 19? 20?

 Hmm? You mean you've stayed by my side all this time? Oh that's right! You were there! Always there! 

There when "Blade" met the dermis of this sentient being (me). Blade had kissed the dermis 164 times. His kisses stung at first, but I got used to it.

Remember those white oblong "vegetables"? They entered through my kisses and slid down the voice of reason. They entered all at once, 36 times if I can last remember.

My tummy aches darkness. My arms, they tremble. I tire the day and what is in store for me. 

I guess you were right all along. You are the one for me. I remember the words you told me: "You're beautiful". You always knew how to treat me. Not once did you ignore me. It was always I who had ignored you. 

Well, darkness my old friend, I welcome you back into my life. Just promise me. Promise me that this time you'll turn off the gravity so that I may finally be free?

Love, miah
