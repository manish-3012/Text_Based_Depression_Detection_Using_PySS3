Friend starts college at dream school in Fall, has attempted, in abusive household. Advice on what I can do?I have a friend who has attempted suicide and who suffers from depression and has grown up in an abusive household so much so that their parents aren't even allowing them to set foot outside their house under current global conditions.

This person's parents also constantly go on hour long tangents about their animus towards the romantic partner of my friend, with no substance behind their animus whatsoever, and it is quite clear that in the midst of their living situation and mental health situation, my friend's partner is seen as a sort of sanctuary from all that my friend is dealing with.

My friend starts college at their dream school in the Fall (whether that'll be in person or virtually we are yet to see).

I tell my friend that I support them emotionally, but do you have any advice for how I can virtually console them such that they can at least make it to September, if not farther?
