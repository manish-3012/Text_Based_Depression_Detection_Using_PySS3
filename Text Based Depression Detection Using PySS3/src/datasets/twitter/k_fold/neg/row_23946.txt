i want to fade awayi'll never be happy. i've tried and tried to find my way out of the darkness but nothing works anymore. i'm lacking in every aspect. i'm so far behind my peers. i want to leave this planet. life isn't worth it anymore. it'll be so much better if i never knew i failed at existence. i'm not afraid anymore. i just want to go.
