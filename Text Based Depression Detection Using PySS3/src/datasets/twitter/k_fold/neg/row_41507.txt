Need advice for friend that I'm worried aboutOk, I've got a friend, who's trusted me enough to confess that they have been depressed for a long time and that they started thinking about suicide and I'm  worried because they told me last night that they are leaving a letter behind for something really valuable for them to a different friend in case something happens. This sounds like a huge red flag but i don't know what to do. Should i tell someone about this? I feel like it might betray their trust and make things worse.

We are in our 20's in case that is needed for context
