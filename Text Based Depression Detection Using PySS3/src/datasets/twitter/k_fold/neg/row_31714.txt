Why can't I these thoughts out of my head?Half of me knows I want to be strong for the people around me, for not giving up after it all. The other half just wants it to end. 

I can't get it out of my mind, even when   I'm "happy". People say it gets better, but I doubt it. I just want these thoughts of suicide to go away, but it's starting to seem as if there is only one way.
