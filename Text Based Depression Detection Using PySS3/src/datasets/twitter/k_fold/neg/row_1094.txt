Should I kill myself?He tells me I'm absolutely worthless. That nothing good will happen to me, that I should just kill myself now. 

Should I?

I'm fairly destructive to society and I don't really think I'll ever get out of my bad family situation.

I think I should go.

EDIT: judging by the upvotes and no comments, I should?
