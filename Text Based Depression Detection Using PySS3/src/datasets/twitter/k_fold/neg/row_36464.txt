I am on the edgefor the first time in a long time I am back to this cliff. I am looking out trying to grasp on to as many happy things, and positive things that I can...but nothing is out there anymore. 
I am tired of being here. I am tired of this bullshit. 

i know where to find herion. I know how much I will need to OD on it. And I know that it is a relatively painless way to go. if I do it this way, my family can still get the life insurance. They desperately need that. God damn, I don't know how I got here. I just want to feel like i'm doing good for my family---but I feel like I just continuously bring them down. 

I want to give them something, and the best thing I can give them is ending it so I can give them financial relief.
