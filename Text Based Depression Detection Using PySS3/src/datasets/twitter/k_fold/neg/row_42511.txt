I have that purpose, but I still want to die.This is the probably the 4th or 5th time I've attempted to commit suicide, but allow me to give some backstory...  I am a 25 year old white male living in Tennessee.  I am close to graduating with an education in Advanced Emergency Medicine as an AEMT.  I love what I do and helping people, but I've been suicidal since approximately the age of 16 and I've tried many times to kill myself.  I love life, and every up and down motion is has provided me.  I come from a loving family of two grandparents and a loving brother who love me dearly.  My problem is my outlook on how I feel, I was doing well for a while and trying to figure out who I was as a person, but I am what I believe is a high functioning alcoholic.  I've struggled with alcoholism since I was 17 years old and its plagued my existence as of late.  I've always had thoughts of suicide and trying to kill myself in unconventional ways.  I simply don't care where I am headed even if I graduate to help people, I am so sick of this cyclical sorrow and it is so hard for me to talk people out of suicide and maintain a professional composure talking to suicidal patients because I feel their pain and don't want to say anything irrevocably foolish and no, I am not comfortable sharing where exactly I live for the lonely soul who reads this post, thank you.

TLDR:  I'm a 25 year old AEMT in Tennessee who is trying to help people not die and wanting to die himself and has been trying to die since the age of 20 or so and struggling with alcoholism.
