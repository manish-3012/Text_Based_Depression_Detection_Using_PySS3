Parallel thoughtsI have so much love for so many things, maybe thatâ€™s one of the reasons I hurt so much, because in truth I know that this reality Iâ€™m living is a mere illusion. This constructed fabrication of a world pains me almost constantly, and I can see through the facade of it all. Many days I feel full of sheer happiness, I am working towards an end goal in my biggest passion in life (MMA.) But I fear of failure, not afraid myself but for those I love and do not want to let down. I feel that Iâ€™m a true kind-hearted person, pretty intelligent and eloquent, but I am plagued by this mist of unclarity. I am being pulled apart by the polar opposites - sheer passion to follow my dreams whilst being sucked into a void of depression by a society and social structure that doesnâ€™t  want me to excel in this life, but just to live in mundane shitness..
