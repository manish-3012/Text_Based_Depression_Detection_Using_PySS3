I'm so loved but I still want to die.I don't know what I'm supposed to do.. suffer? I have an incredibly loving and supportive boyfriend. And a family that at least tries to understand. Yet I still am constantly overcome with suicidal thoughts. Everyday I want to jump out the window, crash my car, and other more graphic things I don't want to trigger anyone :/ It's come to the point were it's borderline obsessive. Googling possible outcomes, reading survivors stories, watching videos, I can't stop. I have such an urge to just end it even though I know it won't always suck this much.. I am stuck between rationally knowing I will without a doubt regret it, but still wanting it anyway. I can die feeling guilty and regretful it'll be the last thing I feel and I'd be okay with that.. I think. I just feel like I'm debating my head and once it comes to its final decision  I'll be out of time. I'm just so sad and tired all the time, I'm being tortured 24/7 by my own head. My brain is trying to kill me. I don't know what to do. I'm trying to do coping skills, I'm doing what I can but it's not enough.. I know they want me to fight, but I'm so tired.
