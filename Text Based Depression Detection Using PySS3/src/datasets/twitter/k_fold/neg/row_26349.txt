I've finally hit my breaking pointI struggle with math so much. Everyone keeps making fun of me for doing bad in Finite Math. I can't retain any of the information from any of the homework and just flunked a quiz because I had a panic attack. I feel so hopeless. I beg for help, but no one wants to help me. I don't want to take this class again and waste my time and money.

I feel like I don't deserve friends. All I do is ruin relationships. I feel so sick and upset I don't know what to do.

I give up. I've wasted money, I've ruined friendships, I've ruined other peoples lives. I can't do it anymore. I plan on taking all my pills and washing them down with whiskey. It seems to be my only option right now.
