Falling back to the darkness from years agoFew days ago my girlfriend of 7 years admitted of cheating me with her boss. I cut her out immediately and blocked her everywhere possible. Just out of my life, out of my mind. Ofcourse tonight I ended up answering to her SMS for whatever reason. I probably shouldn't have. I didn't want to talk to her again. I don't want to talk to her again. But these past days I have just been thinking about how I lost the solid ground I had built myself since my last time in dark. How everything was going great. How can this one thing just ruin that? I'm a mental wreck. I have been here before, I have been completely shit, but I never cared back then. For once I let myself care and now it feels million times worse. And I just think about walking into the night, to never return. Again and again. I've been so close before. I've sat in the car driving on the highway steering towards forest. Somehow stopped that. But now I'm not sure. I have no one to stop me anymore. I had, this girl. She saved me. She's no longer there to save. No one really is there to save me from myself.

I'm sorry about rambling. I don't know the point of it. I just don't have anyone to share. I don't know if it helps to write it out. Maybe.
