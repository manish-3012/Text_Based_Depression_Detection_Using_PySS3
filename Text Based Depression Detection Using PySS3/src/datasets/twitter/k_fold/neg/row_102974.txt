Sick and tired of feeling badI cannot remember the last time I had a second without anxiety and depression affecting my life to the point where I want to kill my self. The feeling of constantly being less worth and so irrelevant. Surrounded by people that absolutely disgust me. I swear to god I feel like hitting them every time I see them. 

The people who were supposed to raise me, left me alone to develop a row of mental disorders that might just be enough for me to end myself. The worst part is that they deny it. How fucking sad of a person can you become? Abused for their own good and now that I'm growing up they are afraid of looking me in the eyes.

Bullied by my own friends and abused for 6 years until I stopped seeing them. Took my dignity, money and ripped my personality to pieces. Made me develop a severe personality disorder. When trying to get my money back, they wouldn't even respond to me. So ashamed of themselves that they can't set things straight.

But I'm the one that will suffer for the rest of my life.
