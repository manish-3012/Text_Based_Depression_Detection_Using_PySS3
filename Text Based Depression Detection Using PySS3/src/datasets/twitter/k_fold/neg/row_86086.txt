GrowingMy suicidal ideation is only growing. I am fucking trying to stay on. People will see me look down and have all these thoughts. They donâ€™t realize itâ€™s taking my all not to hang myself. I just want to disappear. I am so much emotional pain. I try to do whats right but whatâ€™s the point? If Iâ€™m truly going to Hell, what is the point of all of this? I am just so angry and this life only brings me sorrow. I know this just another post from me and at this point itâ€™s tiresome. But, imagine living every fucking day with these thoughts. I genuinely hate myself and constantly say out loud how I donâ€™t matter/how bad I want to end it all.
