I want to die but I don't know howI don't know what wrong with me but I'm really tired of being here. I kinda attempted to end everything today but I grew too afraid that it didn't even seem like an attempt. Honestly, I have no excuses in wanting to die, I am just a person with a very weak mentality and I think my family is getting sick of it too. My sister, who is the closest person to me, is getting tired of me telling her my thoughts every single day and acting the way I am (which I can understand because if I was her I would've gotten tired of me a long time ago). My mom and dad, who gave a lot to me, are getting incredibly stressed by me and my attitude. I really just don't see the point of me being here. I'm16 right now and I just don't see a future for myself. I don't why I'm trying so hard in class. I don't know why I am alive. I sometimes wish that I just died before I even had a conscious. I wish that my life could've been given to a person that wants to live. I wish I am not a selfish human being that I am. 

I'm just tired of being here and being a nuisance to everyone else.  I don't want to be me anymore.
