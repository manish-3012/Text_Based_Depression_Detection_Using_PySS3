The penny has finally droppedI've broken up with my gf about a month ago and I have been trying my best to move on but I've realise I can't. Add that with friends who don't like texting me then I have no one to talk with or be with.  There is no point being here anymore as I have realised nobody likes me anymore and I'm now alone and always will be.
