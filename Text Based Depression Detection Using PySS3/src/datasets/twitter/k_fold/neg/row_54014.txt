Iâ€™d like to take the easy way out but others are in the way.Iâ€™m just totally fed with what my life has come to. I feel like such a loser, still living my parents at 23 and unemployed. 

Iâ€™m stuck in a place with little to no opportunity (Spain) and if I do find a job itâ€™s temporary and a bad pay rate which demotivates even more, besides I am already in a burnt out stage. As the days go on my mental health deteriorates more and more. 

I feel trapped and alone. I do know people around me but I donâ€™t want to bother them with my issues which results in isolation. Iâ€™m in the gym for an hour a day just to stay in shape and then I spend the remaining in my room, alone with my thoughts. I contemplated suicide, however I do not want to put my parents through such an ordeal. 

I need help. I need someone to talk to. I donâ€™t know how to get either. Please help. This is the tip of an iceberg.
