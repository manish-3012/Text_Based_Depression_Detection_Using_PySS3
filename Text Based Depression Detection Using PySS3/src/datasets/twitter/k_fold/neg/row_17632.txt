Questions for those who know someone close to them that committed suicide.I am making final preparations for my demise and I find myself wondering what I can do to make this a little easier on those around me once I'm gone. Sure it seems fickle but if I could cause a few people a little less pain I'm sure they would appreciate it.

Any legal advice for last will and testament, ways to remove any and all online personas and was to dispose of my earthly possessions without burden to loved ones would all be helpful.

Maybe its something that I haven't even thought of. In short what are some things that you wish someone you lost to suicide had done before they left.

Cost is a major issue for me and trusting people with the knowledge of my plans can be trouble too. So things I can prepare by myself and no cost would be ideal. 
    I thank you for your time wasted reading this post. please make replies promptly because (as in everything) time is an issue.
