Not sure if I'm scared or if I anticipate the day when all the commitment and guilt disappears and I can just go away peacefully.Reading suicide stories from grieving families is what keeps me going mostly. I can't stop imagining the face of each and every one of my family members and close friends. It makes me angry too because why should I be the only one who has to suffer alone for people who aren't even around me 99% of the time?
