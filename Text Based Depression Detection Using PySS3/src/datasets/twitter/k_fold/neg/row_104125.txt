Why am I the only one that can see how hopeless and pointless my life is?No one cares, my only friends just bully and abuse me. I can't get a girlfriend because I'm ugly as sin and have no people skills. I hate my major in school so I'll probably hate my job but I can't change it. My parents just tell me I'm feeling sorry for myself and stop being such a lazy piece of shit. The only thing that brings me the slightest bit of joy are my games but despite how much time I spend on then I still suck. I can't do anything right, the world would probably be a better place without me even if it's just to save oxygen. But the worst thing is I'm too much of a coward to even kill myself, so I can't even do that right. Why do I even bother?
