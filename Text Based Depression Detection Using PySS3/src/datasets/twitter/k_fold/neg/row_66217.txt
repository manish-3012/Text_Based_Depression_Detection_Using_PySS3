SuicideIâ€™m a 21 yr old male currently attending a 4 year college to earn my Theology degree. Iâ€™m a freshman and Iâ€™m supposed to start the spring semester in the middle of January. I used to be a welder and took home over $1000 a week, now Iâ€™m lucky to take home $300. I have a $1600 school bill due registration and I only have maybe $400. I feel trapped and just want to be done with everything. I believe in God and believe this is where He wants me but I canâ€™t even afford food or gas. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. I just want to be done.
