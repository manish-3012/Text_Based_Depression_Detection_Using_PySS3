This is bon voyage.I've read a lot of these post in SW. There's a generic pattern to the responses that don't add up. It makes more sense for me to just kill myself instead of carry on. 

I won't waste your time. I'm just going to leave this up on the screen for the people here to find after I'm gone. 

I did because I don't belong here. This place isn't for me. There was nothing you could do. Goodbye.
