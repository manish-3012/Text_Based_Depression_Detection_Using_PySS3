I keep ruining things and can't figure out how to fix them..don't get me wrong; I LOVE life; even while writing this. why? because I LOVE writing and I love talking, expressing myself, making people laugh.. there is lots of thing I would like to do. infact sometimes I drown in lots of projects. being productive is the thing makes me feel the best. not only that; I love landscapes, ligthhouses, trees.. I just could spend countless hours while looking at them and I would never ever think about suicide..  it's not that I feel useless or I don't have a purpose.. I have lots of reason to live and feel excited in the mornings. but I can't keep my peace of mind anymore because I keep ruining things over and over again. I'm 19 so I don't have a job nor a diploma. I can't take care of myself, I don't/can't make money. I can't afford a place, food or pay the bills. when it comes to my parents; things falling apart way too fast. I haven't spoke with my dad for months even though we're living in the same house. I should be going university but it's 1.5 hour away, I just couldn't put up with the road everyday and stop going. believe me; it's not because I'm lazy. I tried to go there first 3 months and those were the worst. that made my parents turn againts me. soon they will take everything from me and it's so embarracing to say that but even though I'm 19, I'm subjected to violence by them.  as I say I cant run away from this. there is nowhere to go. even though I vent somewhere else I cant take or myself. no matter how I love being alive at the moment, I know I just won't be able to bear anymore. I can't put up with violence again, I can't put up with spending my life in humiliation. is there a way to me out of these mess? because I cant see any..
