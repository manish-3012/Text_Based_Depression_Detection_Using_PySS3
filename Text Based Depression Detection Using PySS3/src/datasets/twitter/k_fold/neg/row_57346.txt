If something doesn't change im gonna do it.I'm a piece of shit in a dead-end job thats fucking destroying my body. I've done shitty things, im not a good person. I fantasize about doing it. The only thing thats been stopping me is my dog not knowing why I'm gone and I'm scared of the split second pain before its over.
