Suicide over the AbsurdHey,
I'm not exactly sure how to format this post as there is a lot to cover. For starters I suffer from anxiety and depression which has lead to suicidal thoughts. I am a nihilist (one that believes nothing has meaning), and it is depressing living while no meaning exists. As Albert Einstein writes, "The man who regards his own life and that of his fellow creatures as meaningless is not merely unhappy but hardly fit for life". I also am completely against society as a whole (I live in the US). This causes me to become suicidal because I do not want to live in a world that I do not agree with, and a world that is void of meaning. I believe creating meaning for yourself is a waste of time because the universe will never say anything in response (there is no universal meaning so I shouldn't have one) This has made me lose my drive to do anything. I lack the drive to be successful. I used to be a straight A student with a 4.3 GPA, but now I am struggling and getting triggered trying to do any school work. I do not know where to turn as every option just makes me more and more depressed. Sorry for the long post, let me know if you can help or have any questions. Thanks Guys.
