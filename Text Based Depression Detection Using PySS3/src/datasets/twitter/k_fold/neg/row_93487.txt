Iâ€™m not sure what to do anymoreIâ€™m pretty sure I fucked up again. Actually, I know I did. I got two friends back and I tucked it up again. I was closer with one than the other. I could tell her so many things and she got it. She knew what it was like but then I was stupid and people found out things and then they all came together and Iâ€™m pushed out again and I shouldnâ€™t be hurt by it because it already happened but itâ€™s happening again and Iâ€™m so lost and I donâ€™t know how to stop. I didnâ€™t mean to tell anyone. I mean I did but they all live in different states. I thought I put it in a different chat that she wasnâ€™t in but she was fucking there and I hate myself for it. Iâ€™m ruining people. I ruin people and friendships. I donâ€™t know how I have any friends. Iâ€™m awful. If someone tells me something Iâ€™m usually good at not telling people but I couldnâ€™t not tell someone. I didnâ€™t know what to do and I messed up so bad and I tried to say sorry and I did and she still left. Iâ€™m scared and I donâ€™t know what to do.
