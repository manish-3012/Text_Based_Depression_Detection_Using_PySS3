I thought I was past this.I'm 19. I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts since I was 14, but for the past year and a half, things had been a lot better. I thought I was past all of it because I finally felt happy and comfortable with myself. But these past few weeks, I've been in a low place and I feel so weak for it. I'm in a long-distance relationship and I keep having thoughts about breaking up with my boyfriend. Nothing is wrong, but I just keep thinking about killing myself and I know it would hurt him worse because I haven't been talking to him about how I feel. I have friends at my university, but my anxiety has been awful so I always opt out of going to do things with them. I feel like they don't like me and like they think I'm annoying and bitchy. I got drunk last night and a bunch of my friends from my dorm building were in my room but when they left I relapsed and hurt myself, which I hadn't done in two years. I hate myself. I feel so worthless. My friends went out tonight to celebrate a birthday and I flaked last minute because I had a really bad mood swing, but I blamed it on homework. I feel like shit for it. I feel like I'm being so selfish and hard to be friends with. They keep inviting me to hang out with them, but it makes me feel worse because I feel like no one could enjoy being around me when I'm like this. I just want it all to be over. I live by myself so I keep thinking about how I could just kill myself and it could be days before anyone noticed I was missing.
