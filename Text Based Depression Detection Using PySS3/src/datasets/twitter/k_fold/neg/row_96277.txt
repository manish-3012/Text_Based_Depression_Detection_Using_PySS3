i have less than 24 hourslast human thing i did was file taxes months ago

then, lost everyone

coped with a bottle a day

lost everything

missed a court date violating probation, lost the job, the apartment, and was too degenerate to apply for insurance

now sitting 2 minutes away from an ER in case. hands shaking nonstop and just feeling the day 2 seizure/stroke threats coming (last two withdrawals were bad and each gets worse)

if/when i walk into the ER with no health insurance, crippling costs

debt and detention, or death

really considering not walking through those doors and taking a bridge

not to belittle anyone else, but i wish i had some of the problems here that are just a single breakup

i hope you all have a fantastic life. goodbye
