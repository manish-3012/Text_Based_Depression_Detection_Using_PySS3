Only thing that keeps me from killing myself is I suck at commimentForgive the drunken banter.

25 year old loser. No 'real' friends, no that anyone could be with me anyway. Never been on a date, not for a lack of trying, just i....can't get close to people. I mean I am not good looking, but I just got 85 lbs, thinking it might help or something, but now I am just ugly, not fat an ugly. I work in IT and don't care. I try to force myself to learn more by buying books or courses but Ijust put them off. I am in debt and live at home, looser x 100 there. I even dress better adn take good care of myself. Clean, neat, well kempt. but I hate myself even more. 

I don't even know why I bother. Typing thing, not stepping off infront of the next train. I have no joy. I go the gym and work out and come back home, run errands, clean, whatever. It doesn't make a fucking difference. I try and it makes no change. 

I guess this is my every now adn then rant. Everyone I used t do this to grew out of giving a fuck. TI doesn;t even matter what you say becuase what difference will it make? 

YOu know, you look at facebook pictures of people that haven't unfriended you yet. People living theri lives, having fun, doing stuff. And you just feel so hollow, and you realize that you have nothing to add to anyhong else's life. You aren;t in anyones pictures becuase you would add nothing.

Ramble rambel. THiking about killing yourself is hard. Not becuase it is mind you, but the train thing...that would piss to many people off, real dick move. Heights? Maybe, but you gogtta get there and too much though.I just don't think at the end of the day I could walk off a brige, too weak for that.
