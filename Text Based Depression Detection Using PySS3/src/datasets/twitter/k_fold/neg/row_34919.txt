I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrongI donâ€™t know why my mind just canâ€™t comprehend something good happening to me, itâ€™s literally like my mind isnâ€™t used to this so instead it fucks me over. Iâ€™m in a good relationship with someone I really love, yet my mind things of the worst outcomes that may not even happen, Iâ€™m sick of it. Even thinking thereâ€™s the slightest possibility they might cheat on me for someone else or get the urge just hurts me and I donâ€™t know why, Iâ€™m probably becoming too much anyways, too much of a burden having to deal with all of my problems on a daily basis, wouldnâ€™t their world be nice without me, maybe Iâ€™m not their soulmate, maybe they donâ€™t really need me, maybe Iâ€™m not really needed in this world, Iâ€™m thinking about looking for drugs to overdose on, if that fails Iâ€™ll start setting up a suicide date for my birthday
