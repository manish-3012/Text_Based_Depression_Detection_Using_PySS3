Do you ever have good dreams?I often have good dreams of things I want or aspire to have and they're always perfect. The perfect fish tank, the perfect house, the perfect food. Then I wake up....to this, the constant desire to cry and sleep knowing I can't ever achieve anywhere close to this perfect dream. I wish I could just sleep forever, maybe then I'd be happy.
