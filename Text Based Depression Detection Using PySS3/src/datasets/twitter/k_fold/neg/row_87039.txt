I dont deserve to feel this wayMy parents tell me I have no reason to be suicidal and they're right. I have a roof over my head, enough food to eat, a computer, tv, a bed to sleep in, etc. There are people in this world who would kill to have the things I have. There are people who have suffered so much and are justified to feel suicidal, but what reason do I have? I dont know why I feel this way. I dont know why I want to  cease to exist. I guess I just see no point in existing. What difference do I really make? If every living being disappeared in this universe, nothing would change. At least, I dont think it will. So why do we continue living and for what purpose? What's the point of going through suffering for a purpose that doesn't exist?
