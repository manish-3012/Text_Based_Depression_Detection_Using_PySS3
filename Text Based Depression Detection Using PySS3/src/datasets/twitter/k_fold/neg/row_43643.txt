can't keep it upi posted here about two months back and didn't get very many replies and i'm too tired to say all the same things again. it feels like things aren't changing. i feel stuck. i feel like i'll never be good enough. i feel like i'm going to keep getting stepped on and pushed around and discarded forever. i feel like i will never be happy, and every single day i'm just trying to push a deadline back. i don't actually want to kill myself--i want to be happy. but being happy seems so impossible. everything hurts me so much, and i'm on so many medications and even though they help they can't fix the things that are fundamentally wrong with me.

i just want to die, and i know i have the means to do it and i'm alone for a week, so nobody could interfere. i'm scared i'll do something. i truly don't know what else to do.

i'm not sure how relevant it is, but my original post is here: https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/5n3sb8/think_it_might_be_time/
