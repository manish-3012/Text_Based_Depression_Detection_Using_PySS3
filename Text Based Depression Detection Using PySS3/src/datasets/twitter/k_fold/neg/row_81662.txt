Why is suicide a bad thing anyways?You know, I really don't understand why it's such a problem, if after a long period of struggle and sadness, I decide I'd rather not be alive. I get why it's a problem if I decide I'd rather my neighbor not be alive, since that's harming someone else, but why shouldn't society just let me have my end in peace?

I can't keep doing this. I'm sad all the time. I feel worthless all the time. I keep hoping that I'll have some fortunate accident, but I keep having more evenings alone, more time without anyone to talk to, and more time to be sad. 

I hope nobody else has to go through this level of sadness and depression. It's hell.
