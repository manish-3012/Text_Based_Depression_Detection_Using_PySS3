Am I About to Repeat My Past?So back when I was a Junior in high school I started to lose interest in everything I liked, never wanted to be around anyone, had no motivation for anything whatsoever. After a while, I started having dreams of myself committing suicide and the best way to do so.

I attempted suicide 3 times (obviously failing every time). After a while I just decided that if I saw a way out where I didnâ€™t have to pull the trigger or tie the noose myself, Iâ€™d take it.

I dealt with those suicidal thoughts for about 3-4 years. I finally told my parents about it when I was a Sophomore in college, and they were very supportive. Eventually I pulled myself out of it, and I have been fine since. Well, till recently.

Iâ€™m starting to notice the same things happening to me that happened when I first started developing depression back in high school. Iâ€™ve talked to my parents and multiple psychologists, but nothing seems to be helping. If anything, it just keeps getting worse.

Honestly, Iâ€™m terrified that I could be going down that road of suicide attempts again, but it feels like no matter what I do that I wonâ€™t be able to prevent it.

I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m hoping to get out of posting this, but maybe posting here could help me. Who knows? Im just completely out of ideas.
