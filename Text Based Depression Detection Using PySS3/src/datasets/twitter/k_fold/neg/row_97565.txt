What happens when you go to a hospital?Throwaway account for obvious reasons.

Recently I started being open about this kind of stuff. The doctor told me that if I got in a bad spot and couldn't get out, I should head to a hospital and they'll help me out.

What exactly does that entail? What sort of things do they do? I've had quite a few bad times but I've never really thought of going there.

Edit: I'm in Canada.
