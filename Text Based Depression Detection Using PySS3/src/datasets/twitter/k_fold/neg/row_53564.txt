Having suicidal thoughts againThey went away for about a week and a half and now I just want to die again

I got a new supply of pills today so now I have more than enough to do it

Itâ€™s only a matter of when

I have one friend who talks to me sometimes and my other friend just makes me feel like shit all the time but I have nobody else

I wish I had a few more friends who cared and didnâ€™t scare me
