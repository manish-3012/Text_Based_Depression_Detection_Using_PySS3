There seems to be less and less to be happy about every time you turn around. The world is falling apart and I'm going nowhere in life.Pick your poison:  

1) Global warming destroying the world  
2) Automation destroying the economy  
3) Being outpriced of college and essentially being a prisoner to my local area  
4) My myriad personal and family issues, including having absolutely no friends and living in a strict household in the middle of nowhere
Everyone says to look at the positives but they just seem to slip away, or they aren't there in the first place.  What is there to look forward to?  What is there to live for?
