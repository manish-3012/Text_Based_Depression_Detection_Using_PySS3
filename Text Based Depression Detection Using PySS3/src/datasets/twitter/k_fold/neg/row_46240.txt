I need help for a friend who is talking about committing suicide.My friend and housemate has been talking about killing himself for sometime now and I am worried.  Essentially, he told me about 3 months ago that he used to take prescribed anti-depressants for suicidal thoughts but stopped taking them sometime ago.  He told me in the same convo that he had in fact thought about suicide several times.  Jump to 2 weeks ago, he gets a call informing him his close relative had passed away.  That night I coaxed a blade out of his hand after he told me he wanted to die but was not able to stop him from destroying several things in the backyard. Today the guy punched a window and broke several bottles in our yard and I am extremely worried he may try something.  He also said a few comments implying he not be around for much longer.  A few friends and I are contemplating doing an intervention for him tomorrow.  Is this a good idea?  Who should come to this intervention, a few people or a lot?  How do we convince him to get the help he needs?  Our university's health care (at least the ER) is a joke, where else can we go?  What long term things can we do to prevent his actions?  The only unifying factor about his depression is that the violence he displays manifests itself when he is drunk.  I need your help suicide watch.  I feel like i should have got him help sooner.  What do I do to help him.
