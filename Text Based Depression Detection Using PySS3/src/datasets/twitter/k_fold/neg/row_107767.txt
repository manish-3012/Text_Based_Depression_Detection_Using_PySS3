Falsely accused of rapeWhen I was in high school, my then-girlfriend sent me snapchats of her semi-naked in her brother's room with him in the photo. I couldn't prove anything illegal was going on, but I was disgusted and creeped out, so I broke up with her immediately after. 

She wanted revenge. She took a knife and scratched into a bathroom wall "/u/falselyaccused214567 is a rapist. Don't go near him!" and went around telling everyone she knew. For a while people refused to speak to me, and I was gawked at with horror and disgust wherever I went.

  
Years on, the nightmare just never ends. My brother works kitchens at a local conference centre, and the girl working there decided to tell him and show him the photo of the carving. People instantly block me on social media once they find out who I am. If I say hi to anyone, they look down and walk away quickly.

  
We live in age where accusation = guilt. Nobody cares about the character of my ex or what she did, all she had to do was say it and was instantly 100% believed. My ex didn't need to say anything to the kitchen girl either: she decided to do her work for her. As if my life wasn't ruined enough, this random girl decided just to make me suffer some more and cause more of a reason for division and hatred in my family.

This will follow me for the rest of my life. You know Brett Kavanaugh? I don't know if he's guilty or not. I wasn't there, and I'm not a judge or jury. But what bothers me is that he's on trial in his 50s for what he supposedly did in high school. And in my case, it was a lie for revenge to begin with. You can throw whatever statistic about how common it is all you want, whether it's 2% or 10% or whatever the feminists come up with nowadays. It still happened to me and I'm innocent. But that doesn't matter- I'm just a worthless, disposable adult male, and I can have my life ruined on a whim.
