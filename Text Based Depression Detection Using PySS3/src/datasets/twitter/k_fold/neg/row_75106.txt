I hate myself so much, I can't stand living anymoreI am such a fucking trash pile of a human being. I'm selfish, unstable, an incredible fuck-up and an irredeemable piece of shit. I am fucking stupid, too. Far beyond the idiocy of even the biggest imbecile. If there were really a just and loving god, I would have been aborted so the world could be spared my wretchedness. I hope there is a hell because I deserve to burn there for all time.
