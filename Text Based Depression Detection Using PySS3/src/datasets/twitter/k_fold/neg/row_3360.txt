I deserve to dieI hate my life. I go to this elite school in my city and I feel inferior because I am not as rich as the other kids and I have an Indian accent. I am not the greatest at my studies, but I try hard and I still don't get good grades. My parents have high expectations for me and want me to become a marketing manager. But I want to be an actress, they tell me that they understand what I want but all I see is disappointment that their kid is not getting good grades and wants to pursue a low paying job. I can't talk to anyone about my problems because they will never be able to relate to it in any way. I want to tell my brother that I feel like a worthless piece of shit whenever I enter the school and I think of killing myself every single day but I don't want to burden him with my problems.  I am kind to everyone and always wish that good things happen to others. I try to act happy but I feel like stabbing myself or shooting myself in the head. No one talks to me properly at school and people have broken my trust so much that I don't trust anyone anymore. I am thinking of distancing myself from the only people that love and respect me because I don't deserve them. I try to laugh by watching stand up comedy but my parents have taken away my internet privileges. My mom beats me up every time I don't get a good grade and I take it quietly because I think I deserve it. They will never understand the fact that I hate myself so much that I can't do anything about it. I just don't want my brother to grow up and be like me. He's the ideal kid that my parents need. I'm a nobody. And maybe someday I will have the courage to kill myself. I will watch myself bleed to death and feel happy that I will finally make someone happy. Once I die they'll mourn me for a day and then go about their lives. It's okay. I am worthless.
