Help/advice in the UKI'm new here, looking for somewhere that someone may be able to offer support. I live in the UK, and have suffered with mental health issues since my early teens or perhaps earlier. 

Right now I'm going through crisis; my mood swings are out of control, like scarily so. In the space of 8 hours I could experience extreme anxiety so bad I'm having a panic attack, then depression so bad that I feel unbearably bleak, then a rage so intense I can barely contain myself, then be completely normal laughing and genuinely at peace, and back around again - they change so quickly and intensely it's genuinely scaring me. I've been suffering increasing dissociation, started self harming again and the suicidal thoughts have taken up firm lodgings.

Last night, after realising I had experienced some auditory hallucinations, my suicidal feelings became deafening, as I now feel I can't even trust my own senses. I don't know how much more I can take. I already know what I'd do, I made my plan a long time ago.

I got an emergency appointment at my GP this morning at the urging of a close friend and my partner, however nothing seemingly is going to happen; I was given a leaflet to the NHS mental health website and was referred to the mental health team I think for counseling. This was done a couple of years ago when I was in crisis; it took 6 weeks before I saw anyone. I barely made it then, and I was not as bad then as I am now. I feel like in 6 weeks I'll likely be gone, out of my mind, or will have come out the other side thanks to friends support (ha!) 

My question is, can GP's even do anything in these situations? If not, why are we told to go to see them? The only thing I know for certain is I don't feel safe, and I have no idea what to do about it.
