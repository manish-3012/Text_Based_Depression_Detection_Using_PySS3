Iâ€™m planning my death, I donâ€™t feel welcome in this society.I was going to be the youngest budtender in my state in 2016, at 17 years old I achieved my dream of becoming a patient-consultant at a very reputable dispensary. I blew it because I had to be hospitalized twice due to attempted suicide, and they laid me off.

Since then Iâ€™ve had two jobs, vitamin clerk at a grocery store (tried to kill myself near the end of my employment), and then finally this year in March I got a job at another dispensary at age 21. Three months later I found out my boss was using deceptive buisness practices to milk customers of their money and I felt immense guilt. I quit and tried to kill myself (and ended up intoxicated on lethal amounts of Clonazepam, Gabapentin, Alcohol, and Propranolol) because I was forced to lie to these peopleâ€™s faces, people who already didnâ€™t have much money to begin with since Corona virus began. I felt like scum that deserved to die.

 My sister was going to give me a job at her pizza shop, and she told me I started in a week (last Monday). Then she called me at 10pm on Friday and said â€œYour shift starts tomorrow at 8amâ€. I told her thatâ€™s not what we agreed to and that I couldnâ€™t do it as I had plans. She told me I was the biggest disappointment and that sheâ€™d never help me out again.

Iâ€™m a failure and a dead beet, I no longer feel comfortable in this world. Itâ€™s too much pain everyday, I just want to die I just want to die. So hereâ€™s my plan.

1.) Stockpile my script of Clonazepam, so I have enough to disinhibit myself (at least 40mg)

2.) Take a whole bottle of Gabapentin (of which I have x4 100 counts

3.) Take a whole bottle of seroquel

4.) Before I fall asleep, have my last glasses of scotch Iâ€™ll ever enjoy

5.) Hopefully Iâ€™m dead so I donâ€™t have to think about all the shit that gives me PTSD and all the people who treated me like shit.

End
