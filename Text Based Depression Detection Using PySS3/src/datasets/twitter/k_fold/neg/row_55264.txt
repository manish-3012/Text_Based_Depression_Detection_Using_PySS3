i have this weird feeling....It's crazy actually,  I feel like i genuinely have no reason to be alive. I feel like i'm not going anywhere mentally, socially, physically, etc. I feel stuck and confused.  in the back of my head i am constantly reminding myself that i am too skinny and so on, i feel over worked, and this guy ive been seeing on and off for the past 5 years has been difficult on my mental health.  The weird part out of all of this is, this feeling fades in and out but gets strong some weeks dies down other weeks.
