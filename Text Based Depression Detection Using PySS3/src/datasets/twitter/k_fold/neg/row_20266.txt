I'm sad and hurtI was rude to someone online earlier. It was uncalled for and then they told me they doubt I have mental illnesses and shit maybe they are right. My OCD makes me doubt everything so I constantly doubt if in even mentally ill. The thoughts tell me since I can workout , play video games , meditate, etc.. then that means I'm not depressed. But I am , I hate life and i so badly dont wanna live but I just cant do it. I cant go through with it I've tried. The rest of my life I'll be alone and in my own head working a shitty job if I can even find one which I cant for over a year. I hate life man
