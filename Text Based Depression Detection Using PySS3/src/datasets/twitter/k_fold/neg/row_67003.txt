Havenâ€™t felt this way in a whileThings have been great in my life for the longest time, now theyâ€™re starting to take a turn for the worse and itâ€™s such a slippery slope. 

The pressure of school is starting to really mount and Iâ€™m already falling behind for an exam I need to take in June, and itâ€™s causing me to unravel a bit. At first it starts with drinking while Iâ€™m around friends, then soon Iâ€™m just drinking for no reason and cutting myself... I used to do this in high school and I really thought I left it all behind in college but clearly itâ€™s back. Part of me enjoys the stress relief but I hate that Iâ€™m resorting to these awful things. It feels like attention whoring.

Thereâ€™s also this girl who I adore profoundly but have never really been able to catch the attention of, Iâ€™ve spent some time with her and eventually asked her on a date to no response. Itâ€™s certainly not the worst thing in the world and Iâ€™m doing my best to get over it all but my feelings are sort of amplified by my stress right now.

Recently Iâ€™ve been having this reoccurring fantasy of hanging myself on a small overpass over a creek just outside of my apartment complex. I donâ€™t understand why suicide is an ideation. That bridge is so eerie, Iâ€™ve walked down below it a few nights and I remember being so creeped out and nervous, so it doesnâ€™t make sense to me why Iâ€™m so drawn to it right now.

I donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m posting, most posts here donâ€™t seem to get many replies and I donâ€™t mean to be a bother. Donâ€™t get me wrong though, Iâ€™m not to romanticize any aspect of dying. 

Thanks for listening.
