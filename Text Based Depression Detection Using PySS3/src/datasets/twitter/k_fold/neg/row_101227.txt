I went to kill myself again, but couldn'tFor the second time I went out to kill myself, this time I went out and bought a gun after deciding my other options were too risky. I cried a bit, but I'm so ready to go I wasn't so bothered, but I realized I couldn't reach the trigger due to the length of the barrel. Now I must suffer a few more days and find a way to secretly cut the barrel, on a gun no one knows I bought. I wish I could just go to sleep and not wake up.
