My anxiety is going to kill me.I just weaned myself off of antidepressants. I still had some anxiety while I was on them, but I wasn't as depressed anymore and overall I felt ok. 

But lately, I've been getting cycling thoughts and so much anxiety and obsessing over things and suspecting my boyfriend of things and the usually irrational thoughts. Totally irrational. I can't get out of it. I don't know what to do.

I graduated last year and I still don't really have a job. I went to so many interviews that I was perfectly qualified for and it was the same every time. "Hey, awesome! You can do all the things this job requires! You got the education for it! We'll contact your references and get back in touch with you" and then boom, someone else was better.

I don't know if I can do this anymore. I'm taking the GRE this Friday and I haven't even really studied because I don't fucking care.

I know I am loved, but I don't feel loved. I feel like I will feel this way forever and do stupid things to make it stop. I'm all talk and no action, but I don't want to exist anymore because I'll be plagued by these thoughts.

Also, the suicide prevention chatline has a longer wait time than any other customer service chat I've tried. That's probably not a good thing.
