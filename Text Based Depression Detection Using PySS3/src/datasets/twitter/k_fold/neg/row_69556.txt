Time to dieHello, not many people will read this and that's okay. I am going to kill myself. I have felt this way a lot in the past but this time I have a rope. I had no one I trusted to turn to, so I went here. The crisis textline abruptly ended our fucking conversation for no reason. I said "okay, I'm done my breakdown" and then they fucking left they thought they meant I was done they didn't give me any fucking guidance. And now they only take 1 conversation per 48 hours. I don't trust my friends, I hate going to them, I feel annoying, I don't see any reason to like me. I'm going to be like my mom and I can't bare to see it. I've gone to many friends in the past but I only now realize that I shouldn't. Also many of my closest ones are drifting away due to us having different classes. I'm going to graduate soon, and I will never see these friends again, and life will be boring, because I'm unremarkable and forever depressed. I do hate myself. I would love to confide in an adult, but I dislike my parents, they don't understand mental health and they're so fucking dramatic and gross. I have teachers that I love but I can't go to them because they will send me to the hospital. I am severely suicidal. I cut myself very frequently. If I do not hang myself tonight I will surely cut some. I hate everything. My body has so many problems too. I don't want to get into them, they're more of just annoyances, but I still wonder why I had to get them. My bedroom air smells like it shouldn't be breathed in. I haven't showered in almost a week. I don't want to graduate high school. I'm constantly dissociated. I hate myself more than ever. I cannot live comfortably. I hope at least someone sees this. I think I am serious this time. I always think I'm more serious than the last time when I'm in this state. Maybe this time I'll actually do it. Goodbye, if I am gone.
