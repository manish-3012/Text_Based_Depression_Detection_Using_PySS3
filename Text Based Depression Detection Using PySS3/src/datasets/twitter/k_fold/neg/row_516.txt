The only reason I have not killed myself is because I don't want to be selfish.. but I really want to do it.For the past 4-5 years, I've wanted to kill myself, but I don't want to hurt the lives of others.  I know that if I killed myself, I have friends and family that would be very upset and would wonder if there was anything they could have done to stop it.  
So, I guess it's good that I recognize that I have made some impact on others, but that's not the issue here.
I just don't want to live. I don't like life.  I know that if I were more "optimistic," I could maybe have a better life.  but, I've tried being optimistic and that doesn't work out, either, because I always end up disappointed.
I've gotten to the point where I'm just faking life.  I do what I need to do to fit in.  
I know it's been five years (ish) since I've felt this way, but I'm wondering if there will ever be a point that I just say "screw it" and do it.  I also attempted, once, about 5 years ago (when I first started having these thoughts) and one of my close friends (no longer close) helped me out and stopped me from completing my already started actions.
So yeah, I realize that other people would be disappointed.  But I want to do things for myself. Well, I guess by that, I mean that I want to do this one thing for myself..
I hope that was coherent. Your thoughts/reactions would be appreciated..
