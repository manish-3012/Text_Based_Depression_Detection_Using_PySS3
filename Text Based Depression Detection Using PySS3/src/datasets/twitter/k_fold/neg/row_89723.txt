Iâ€™ll probably kill myself in the future idkIâ€™m so worthless, my little brother has a better grasp at life than I do. I feel Iâ€™m giving up slowly, my grades are going down, Iâ€™ve turned to alcohol when Iâ€™m really sad. Iâ€™m constantly made fun of for my various flaws, it hurts. Iâ€™ve resorted to isolation in my room years ago. Iâ€™m not good at being social. My eyesight is literally worse than anyone I have ever met and Iâ€™m 17, I canâ€™t see my screen from 2 feet away. I feel the switch will go off once Iâ€™m blind in my thirties, but probably not considering Iâ€™m a coward so Iâ€™ll just live in misery. The only good thing I do is being a helping hand for others. I am not normally this angry and sad about my life, but I have this often and I canâ€™t see myself living like this for the rest of my life.
