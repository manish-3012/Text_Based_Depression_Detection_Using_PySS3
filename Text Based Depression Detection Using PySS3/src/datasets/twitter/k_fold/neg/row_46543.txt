i can't cope anymorei wanna start cutting again. Everyday I wake up tired and suffer from terrible head aches. I have a time table that isn't even really full, but for me it's exhausting. I am exhausted all the time. Sometimes I think that I just was born weak and lazy. I try to make this work, I try to study and work but I'm already exhausted at noon. I just wasn't meant to be in this world, I'm not able to be a productive member of society.

I don't have the energy to let this continue for years and decades, I'm not even able to brush my teeth everyday.
