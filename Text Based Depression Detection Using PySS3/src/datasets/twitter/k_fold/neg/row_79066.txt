I attemptedThe night before last I tried to overdose but I woke up the next morning. I felt like vomiting but couldn't, I ended up sleeping through most of the day. Now I don't have enough pills to die, I feel like shit and since I thought I would be dead I hadn't done the homework for weeks and now my parents are so mad at me. I don't know what to do, I can't tell them "oh yeah sorry I didn't do that I thought I would b dead by now"
