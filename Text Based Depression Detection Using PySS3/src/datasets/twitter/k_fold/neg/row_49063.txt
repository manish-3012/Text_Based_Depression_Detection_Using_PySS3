Weekend PlansI turn 28 on Sunday. The person who pushed for us to be besties has magically disappeared, again. The last time, I heard every reason but the real one, and then I forgave the real one. This time, well they say they're doing this or that (I'll take it as true) and they've got some real huge stuff on their mind and finally relented and told me.

I mean it does make perfect sense, just still odd that they didn't tell me a thing when they tell me everything, and I mean everything. Even stuff their dad told them under oath of secrecy. Then they kinda talk again and then abscond.

Today they sent me a message. "Happy early birthday in case I forget." in case you forget. Wow. Thanks. 

I get that they have a life but it used to be that they shared every detail, they just had to keep me in the loop. Up to Sunday before last everything was as normal. Then poof, but again, the lots of stuff on their mind.

But this feeling has been a long time coming and that just pushes me over the edge, because last time pretty much they lied to me, so I am trying my hardest to trust but I do have reason not to put faith so blindly.

So now it's come to this. Nearly 28, no family, no kids, no pets even. The plan is to go to Wal-Mart tomorrow morning and get my birthday party stuff, cake, all that, just to have it ready.

Sunday, I'm going to celebrate alone like last year. A small cake and a pint of ice cream. Maybe hang up a decoration or two. I'm going to celebrate being 28. Then, I'm going to give myself my gift.

I won't be found for days, maybe weeks. Who cares. Can't even invite the person I thought was my best friend for my party because everything seems to add up to just using me. Just a handy source of attention, someone to pal with, a fallback plan. That's all I was last time and I forgave it like an idiot.

So I'm going to celebrate alone and lonely. The way it was meant to be. And then I'll never have to worry about one more day waking up feeling like this.
