Tired of life in generalI wish I wasnt such a pussy and would just kill myself. Maybe it's because I have kids and I'd feel bad ? I dont know I'm just tired. My boyfriend doesn't make it better. It seems like he makes it worse. I tried a few months ago. Chickened out and went to the hospital. I regret that everyday honestly. Thinking about doing it again but every time I get scared. Ugh I hate this
