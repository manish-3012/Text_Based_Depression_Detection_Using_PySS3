I caused someone to commit suicide and now feel like shitHi Everyone, 

Iâ€™m from Australia and I caused someoneâ€™s death. I never really liked this person to begin with. We were acquaintances and talked a few times every few months when a circle of friends met up. He plagiarised at the university he attends and being the person I am I reported him to the university and show them the evidence (donâ€™t ask me how I got the evidence I just did). He plagiarised multiple times. He has done a few things to me which caused me to take action against him (really wish I didnâ€™t).

Few days later I found out he was expelled from the university. I was happy this was the outcome( although I did not know the consequence will be that severe, I expected a warning) More days come after he figured out it was me and some of his friends lashed out at me. I believe what I did was right anyway. You donâ€™t get anywhere in life by cheating. 2 days after I found out he killed himself. I was shell shocked. I was devastated. I been feeling extremely guilty and every time I think about this it makes me stomach feel sick. I been so devestated. Although I never liked him I would never wanted him to kill himself. Some of my friends said I did the right thing and his death wasnâ€™t my fault but I feel 100% at fault. Any words of advice will be welcome on how to feel less guilty will be great. Would I also be charged with his death? One of his friends messaged me and said heâ€™s reporting me to the police for what I did.
