I need something to keep me herePosting again. Gor broken up with today. Job is dead end. Fojr stripped tires and I'm broke as hell. Molested twice. Ex thought I needed to get over it. No. I need to heal. I'm remembering more. He broke my heart. Only guy whose been there for me 100%. I was gonna drop my job to move in with him. Thats a bust. I camt hamdle the stress at work and I don't know if I can be alone. I'm disgusted in myself. I don't see a future anymore. The world is a blank page. I don't know if I can make it this time. Whats the point. Whats the fucking point.
