i'm feeling suicidal. please help me if you love me.I just want to know what's wrong with me. After that I'd know where to start and get help before I do something I'll regret. I can't go to a doctor right now, my parents I guess don't care enough to help me. I have no one else to take me either so... I got nothing.

Obviously I'm not asking for someone to "diagnose" me. I don't think I'm that stupid to think that's how it works. But if ANYONE knows anything about what I could have please tell me.

I have the usual symptoms for depression except for one thing. I feel really sad most of the time. The reason why I say "most" of the time is because sometimes my mood improves to the point where I'm not depressed anymore. I don't get happy, but I just go back to normal as if it never happened at all, fully recovered. This only adds to the frustration. Why does this happen? When I do get to the point where I'm okay my mind makes me feel terrible. It tells me things like "just kill yourself" "you don't deserve to be happy" and other things. Keep in mind I said my HEAD says these things to me, I have no control over this at all. After a while of my head uncontrollablly telling me these things I'm back to being depressed and the voices stop. So it's like my brain doesn't want me to be happy? I don't know I just feel like a idiot.

Maybe I should just kill myself. I already sound like a crazy person.
