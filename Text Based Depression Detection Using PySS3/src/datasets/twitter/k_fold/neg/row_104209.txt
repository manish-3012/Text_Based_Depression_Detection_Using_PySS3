Thrown under the busFound a teacher I trusted. I felt like I could tell him that I want to kill myself. So I did, forgetting that they're required to tell someone else if I'm in danger. So he did.

Appereantly me telling him broke him and he said he just feels empty, that he never wants to talk to me again.

Got pulled into a social workers room at school. She said that me being transgender is a joke and kept shaming me of how I put a giant burden on the teacher.

They promised to help. They threw me under the bus and made me the bad one.

If I don't kill myself tonight, then I will definetly do it tomorrow.
