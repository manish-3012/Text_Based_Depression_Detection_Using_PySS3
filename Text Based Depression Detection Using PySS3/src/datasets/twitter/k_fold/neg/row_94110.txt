Need help!So, I come home from work and I notice a note on the table, itâ€™s a suck idea note from my wife. I go into the bedroom and find her fast asleep much to my relief. But wake her up and ask her about the note and she explicitly s how she tried to commit suicide buy taking a bunch pills from the medicine cabinet . She has a history of depression and always sad. Her mother committed suicide a few years back and ever since sheâ€™s been feeling as if she was destined to follow in her footsteps . I want to call her family to ask for help but she asked me to promise not to. Iâ€™m in the process of removing all pills and alcohol from the apartment . I feel stuck. Iâ€™m with her now so o canâ€™t really call the hotline but I need to find a way to help her . Sheâ€™s been on antidepressants for a couple of months and she suddenly stopped taking them probably because sheâ€™s an alcoholic and mixing the two has been a problem. Fortunately what she had taken were muscle relaxers that were prescribed to me so I think it put her to sleep for the whole day. Any advice, words of wisdom. Thanks anybody .
