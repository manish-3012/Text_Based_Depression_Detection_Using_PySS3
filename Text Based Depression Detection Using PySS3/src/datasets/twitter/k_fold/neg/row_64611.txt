(18m) I'd do anything to get out of my own head.I hate everything about my life and myself. Im very introverted and shy so it's hard for me to make any kind of friends, in fact I don't have any friends, and I have a very small family (just my mom and older brother) who I don't get along with anymore. Needless to say I'm very isolated and alone with nothing to do or look forward to, I've even started working 12 hours a day 5 days straight at my factory job just to preoccupy me so I don't have to think about this shit, and even though it's really good money especially for my age, I don't use it to buy anything because it never makes me happy. Nothing I do makes me feel like I'd be better off alive, or like I should keep living, it's like a slow burn that's been building up in my head for a long time and I've been in denial. I keep telling myself things like "you're fine, everybody feels like this, you'll get through this, it's not as bad as you're making it out to be." Etc. But I think I've finally broke and am coming to terms with this. I want to die. I don't know if I'm going to kill myself, or how, but if this is surviving, than I just don't want to survive anymore. I'm posting this because I need to say this somewhere, regardless of if this helps or not, I just needed to say this.
