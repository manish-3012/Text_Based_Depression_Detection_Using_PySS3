Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse.I wasn't accepted into the university that I applied to. Unfortunately I don't have a purpose on this earth but getting a degree would've been my shot at trying to change my life around for the better and finally be a somebody.

I guess I should've listened to my gut from the beginning - I've always been a failure.
