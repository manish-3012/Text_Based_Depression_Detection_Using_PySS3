Was raped a year ago, verdict was Not Guilty. Have had a drinking problem ever since and I got a DUI last night. I don't think I can afford the DUI after my recent attempts in court that resulted in nothing, I'm so exhausted. To elaborate a little:  I was drugged and stranger raped last september, I had a rape kit done the very next morning and took immediate action. At the time I was optimistic about following protocol and finding peace, but everything backfired. Thousands of dollars later and "loopholes" in my 
he said she said case" resulted in a not guilty verdict. I was devasted, hearing that was like insult to injurty, but I did my best to cope. I was honestly starting to regain my footing again and slowing down what was starting to become a drinking problem, but last night I was pulled over and arrested for a DUI, blowing a .08. I actually thought I was good to drive after allowing 3 hours time between drinks and driving and I felt competent during the field tests, brethalyzer test, and arrest process, but I did blow a .08 so legally I was intoxicated still. After some research today it looks like finding a good lawyer and resolving this will cost upwards of about $10,000. I cannot take a financial blow like that, nor can I have a DUI on my otherwise clean criminal record. My work requires a security clearance. I am feeling very lost and very hopeless. Please advise.
