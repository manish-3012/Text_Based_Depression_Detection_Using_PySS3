I worked at a shit company called TMZ and left last month, my life is now wreck and I don't want to continue! I want to die!I left my terrible job at TMZ last month and my whole life has been destoryed, no one wants to talk to me because of the job I took up, I needed the money and they offered a lot of money to me. It was a shit job and now I want to fucking kill myself, knowing that i won't be able to get a job anymore because TMZ will be on my CV and no one will hire me and call me a fucking asshole! 

I want to fucking die!
