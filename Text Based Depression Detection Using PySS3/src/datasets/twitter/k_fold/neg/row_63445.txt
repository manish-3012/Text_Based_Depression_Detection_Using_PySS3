How did you spend your Friday night?I've had a varied night. I've had a nice little mix of crying, cutting myself, getting angry and having panic attacks for the past 5 hours. I feel calmer now though. My arms are fucked. Won't be able to wear short sleeves for a long time. That's a shame. I bought some nice T shirts a few weeks ago.
