Done with lifeIâ€™m a 16 year old and my mental health has ruined me. i just lay in bed all day with constant thoughts running through my mind. itâ€™s affected me in many ways and iâ€™ lost everything. i keep getting these suicidal thoughts constantly. my grades have dropped and i have no chance of getting into a ivy college now. i let my parents down and iâ€™m a failure. i see no future for me. honestly iâ€™m done with life. iâ€™m just waiting and increasing the chance of natural causes to take my life away. if that doesnâ€™t happen then iâ€™ll end it. i just want to rest in peace
