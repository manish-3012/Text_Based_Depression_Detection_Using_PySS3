I'm 26. When does it get better?It's 2am. I've been awake for hours bruising myself to Hell and back. I've hung up on the Veteran's Crisis Line twice after scream-sobbing in my car. I can't fucking sleep, I can't fucking eat. My mind is racing. I've been pacing and hitting myself for hours. I've been pacing. I'm exhausted. I don't feel well and I can't sleep. I just want to sleep. 

Sometimes, I feel like I've decided that life is a joke. 

I just don't find the punchline funny.
