Friend made a suicide joke on cam and now it's all I can think aboutMe and my friend were videochatting on Discord recently and he was playing around with his belt, ended up looping it around his neck pretending to hang himself. I attempted hanging and almost succeeded awhile back using a belt.

At the time my brain did go off and go "woah, that's not okay" and I started feeling really sick and my chest leaped and it got hard to breathe. I brushed it off really easily I think because my friend didn't really say anything to me but ever since I've been thinking about it nonstop, seeing the image in my head and just looping the situation over and over until I'm in tears. I didn't think it bothered me that much then, I'm frustrated it's somehow getting to me now.

I didn't know where to post this, sorry. I can't sleep and needed somewhere to get it off my chest.
