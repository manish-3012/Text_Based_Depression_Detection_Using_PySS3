Feel like a failure because I can't get a job.I applied for 15 jobs. I'm 18, no previous experience. It's been 4 months since I started applying and nothing is happening. I'm fixing my resume up, and it's much better than before, but no one is hiring. I feel like a mess up, I can't even get a job at a fast food restaurant.
