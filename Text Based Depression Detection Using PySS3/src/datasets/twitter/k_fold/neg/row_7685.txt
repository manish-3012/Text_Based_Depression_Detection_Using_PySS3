thereâ€™s no hope for meafter four years of therapy, getting off drugs, alcohol and cutting with help from my boyfriend and my best friend, iâ€™m still depressed. i thought therapy will help but nothing can. btw iâ€™m suffering from bipolar disorder and anxiety too. after few suicide attempts i wanna do it again. i wanna do drugs and alcohol again. life just isnâ€™t for me. donâ€™t say iâ€™m spoiled or some shit cuz iâ€™ve been raped and had a lot of abuse trough my whole childhood. my mom still says no one will ever love me and stuff like that. and this reddit is full of hate too.  just please DONâ€™T COMMENT ANYTHING  thanks. just wanted to write this down idk cuz iâ€™m rlly sad atm.
