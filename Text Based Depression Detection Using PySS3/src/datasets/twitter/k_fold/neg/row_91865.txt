In 2 hours I turn 25. After 10 years of battling extreme depression, I have decided to take control and end my own life. My music is all I leave behind. I hope that maybe it can help the world in some small way. Thank you reddit, for all you have done for me without even knowing it. I ask for no sympathy, this is my own adult decision. My family is clearly distraught but I cannot endure this agony any longer. I have tried every form of medication and therapy available under my healthcare plan.

Here is my new mixtape which you can download for free: http://soundcloud.com/ericposton/sets/pos-10-evolution-mixtape-w-dl

Here is my youtube channel with videos and alot of other songs I have made over the past couple years: http://www.youtube.com/user/ThePos10?feature=mhee

I apologize for the "trolling" I have been doing in attempts to get my music out on reddit recently. 

All I can say is, thank God there is no God. Thank God there is no Hell.

Goodbye, brothers and sisters. I wish you all well.
