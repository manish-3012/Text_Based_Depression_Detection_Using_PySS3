I feel suicidal but i love my family and my lifeim quite sure that i will be happy next or two years later due to highschool exam which decides if im enough for a college or not.  This is not the problem anyways , thank god my family can pay for it even if i suck at that exam. The problem is my highschool. Its been alot of fun my past two years , i mean A LOT i would like to go to school everday but this year most of my friends gone to another classes. I can change my class maybe but that will fk up everything but it can be better lets not think about this one. Im a regular gamer kid , been playing LoL and CSGO in both high ranks , used to go to LANs but now im burnt out from this too. I enjoy from nothing. I would do anything to play CSGO with my mates i could play 15 hours daily but the next day i always meet with ex-girlfriend. Its been 3 months. We been together like 3 years i know i need time but im the one who left her , can't lie i regret sometimes but when my parents learnt about their ''best friends'' daughter i got fucked up. Nothing gives me joy i think im done however im sure i need help
