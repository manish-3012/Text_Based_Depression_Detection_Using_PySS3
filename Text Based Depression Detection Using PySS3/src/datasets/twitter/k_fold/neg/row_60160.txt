I just want to talk to someone.There's way too much going on that I can't talk about, either because I'm nervous of the police being called for the fifth time, or out of fear of judgement. I haven't been able to talk to a counselor or anybody and I've been bottling up everything in me for months and months now. I'm really sorry if I sound whiny or needy. Thank you for reading this.
