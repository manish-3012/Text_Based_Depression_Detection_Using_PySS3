Anyone have experience with Serotonin Syndrome after attempt?So two nights ago I got very drunk with friends then had a horrible argument with my husband, and finally gave into my impulses Iâ€™d had for weeks to kill myself. They got me to the hospital within an hour (I stalled like crazy) and then after a few minutes there it hit me. I was having tachycardia, shivering, auditory hallucinations, some tremors, extreme confusion (and within that some anger because I couldnâ€™t interpret a text Iâ€™d received, I thought the person was insulting me), and I was barely responsive even though I could hear somewhat what was going on at times. They had to pinch me hard to make me answer what my husbandâ€™s name was. I didnâ€™t know why I was there half the time. I also puked and had some upset stomach but I think it was from the charcoal or the alcohol, impossible to tell. When I was beginning to understand the conversations around me more and my husband left to go grab things from home, I heard the nurses talking about serotonin syndrome but they never later confirmed to me what had happened. They didnâ€™t put me in the psych ward because they didnâ€™t have a way to monitor my heart there but they also didnâ€™t get me admitted to a regular bed before I could walk pretty normally. They made my husband sit in a plastic chair in the psych ER cubby with me for 12 hours. When I was coherent I said fuck it, Iâ€™m still hallucinating and canâ€™t speak straight and canâ€™t walk perfect and have upset stomach still but we needed to go home and talk things out. I managed to sleep it all off by another 12 hours. It was a crazy time and it was oddly peaceful in that delirium thinking that I was dying but I couldnâ€™t ask. I also heard them mention the ICU as maybe they were going to attempt to monitor both my heart and my mood but I donâ€™t see why. The doctor woke me and I said I was feeling fine now and I fibbed that no event had been a catalyst, but then as I woke all those symptoms I mentioned going home with really caught up with me. They didnâ€™t seem to want me there or know what to do with me. I felt really at a loss because I needed to stay in the hospital but I didnâ€™t want to take a bed from someone and I didnâ€™t want to make my husband suffer in the ER any longer. Overall Iâ€™m confused as to if it was a regular celexa overdose or if it was serotonin syndrome, mainly because of the hallucinations. I told them I was having them before I left but the doctor waited so long to see me that I gave up. Thing is, last night I had some hallucinations for about 30 minutes where I could swear up and down my neighbors were playing punk rock music but my husband assured me they werenâ€™t.

TDLR: my docs didnâ€™t tell me if I had SS or a regular celexa overdose (they mentioned SS while I was half conscious) and sent me home while I still had auditory hallucinations. they popped up again for 30 mins two days later. 

Does it sound like SS? Is it possible SS can cause further hallucinations?
