Roughly 18 hours to go.Hey all, I didnt make my own post at start but I'm still set on ending it tomorrow. 

I've had people reach out with information on services or advice, I really do appreciate it, but I just cant do homeless again. It's not even that, I've had a stagnation cycle for years, I get or attempt momentum and it goes south or doesn't start. I dont mean to sound "like a victim".


Back in day if I bugged a place, eventually they'd see I want to be there more than their current employees and hire me. I have been bugging everywhere, for at least 3 weeks, going in face to face. Roughly 75% have more or less told me to stop coming in, in nice, vague words of course.

I hate how seemingly anytime I try "the right way" it just sets me up worse in life. Rather than just "being a homeless person living day to day" with my 3 days on streets, 1 day in hotel I did this 3 weeks and job hunt thing (SSI came Nov 29th).Rinse repeat each month w my SSI. Living just to live with no prospects is numbingly depressing. 


I dont do drugs or drink, so being homeless is extremely boring, which means my thoughts, anxiety and ruminations snowball as I go days without sleep. 


All week, once I realized temp agencies had no jobs w/o STBoots and that I was back on streets Thursday I've had this numb acceptance.  The thought of killing myself tomorrow isnt terrifying, saddening or even instilling apprehension. Now, if I think about being alive &amp; homeless again- my heart races, I sweat, I fidget, I want to cry until there's no moisture left. 

I was going to end it here, but hotel staff has been very nice. Worked with me regarding $ or even let me pay later a few times, I dont want their place to make the news (the arrogance of me. Impeachment and I think an aspies suicide will make a mention).
