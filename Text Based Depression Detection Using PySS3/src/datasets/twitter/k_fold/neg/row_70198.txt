I feel terribleUsually i have so many thoughts but now i don't even know what to write ._.
I just... feel so bad. I feel like everybody hates me, even my guinea pigs :/// They always run away from me. Idk. 
I don't have any friends or peopl i could talk to. And i can't even find any. I'm too shy to even write to people on internet. My parents don't care about my problems, if i ever told them i wanna kill myself they'd probably tell me i'm exaggerating and there are people who have it worse.
I feel like i'm disappointing everyone, my parents the most.
Most of the time i feel empty. Sometimes i am happy or sad but this emptiness always comes back. I've felt like this for over a year. But suddenly i started to feel way worse this week. I wanna kill myself. But I've never felt this way about it. I only thought about suicide, i never really thought i could do it. Now i just wanna die. I don't know what to do :(
I don't really think i can achieve anything in the future, i'm not doing good at school even now. No one is ever gonna be my friend and no one is gonna love me. So whats the point of living.
