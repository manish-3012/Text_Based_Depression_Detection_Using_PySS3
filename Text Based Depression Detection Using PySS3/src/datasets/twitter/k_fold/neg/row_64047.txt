I think its time to do it.I think its time to kill myself I just can't handle the stress and anxiety of life my depression is winning the battle. I don't think I can take another week no one likes me at school. My parents seem to not like me or how I live life. I completely hate myself and I can't seem to find happiness or the light at the end of the tunnel.
