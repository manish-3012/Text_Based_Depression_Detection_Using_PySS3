I've made up my mindI've been sheltered my whole life. Raised in a private school I don't know how to live on my own. I'm 17 and have no one. My parents disowned me because I smoked weed for three months. My aunt took me in for 5 days then sent me to a homeless shelter. My parents lied to my family and told them I wouldnt go seek help for my "weed addiction" I don't see anything wrong in smoking weed perosnally but I said okay anyways to them. Only person who's on my side is my cousin who had been kicked out by his own mom as well but he lives at my grandparents. Everyone had turned their backs on me and thinks I'm a pothead which I am. When I plea with them that they can do random drugs tests on me they hide behind the fact saying I chose this and these are my consequences. They then hide behind the fact that God will help me out and that this is his way for me. I'm exhausted. December 23rd 2016 is the day I've decided I'm through with life. You're truely on your own and can't rely on anyone. I won't be alone on Christmas because I'll be in deep sleep. Goodbye everyone.
