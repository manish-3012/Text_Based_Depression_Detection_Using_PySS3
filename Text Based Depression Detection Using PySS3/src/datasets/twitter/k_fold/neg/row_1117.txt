Almost everything about the future makes it seem not worth itWhat do I have to look forward to when I get older? I have no friends, have zero social skills AKA zero chance at finding a partner or even just basic friends I feel genuinely attached to and also means my chances of getting a job are significantly reduced since I can barely talk to another human being, I have zero future in regards to my education since I lack motivation and direction, I don't have any chance at making myself worth anything to anyone I'll likely come into contact with. I'm ugly, have zero fashion sense, am generally physically below average. The only things I can reliably assume will be true are that I will probably end up getting kicked out at some point and that my physical health will only deteriorate from this point forward. The job I currently have is pretty taxing on my wrists, and my hearing is already suffering for no apparent reason. Why should I feel obligated to hang around? I'm not in a crisis, but killing myself a little after I turn 30 is looking extremely appealing. I know it sounds selfish, but I'd have literally nothing to live for at that point, so why continue to exist only to have my physical health take a turn for the worse until I die, working a job I'd likely hate, still wishing I had friends or anyone to share my life with to a reasonable extent.
