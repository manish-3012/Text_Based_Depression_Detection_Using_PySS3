Todayâ€™s the dayItâ€™s been going on too long. I canâ€™t do it anymore. Iâ€™m so tired of everything, bone tired. Breathing is exhausting, existing is exhausting. Iâ€™m doing it today. Iâ€™ve already cut everyone off. This is the closest Iâ€™ve come to feeling any kind of peace or happiness, but itâ€™s still just apathy 

Wish me luck
