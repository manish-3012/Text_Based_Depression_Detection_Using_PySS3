Is anyone else scared of their mindLast week was so horrible. My suicidal thoughts were so consuming. I spent hours and days researching suicide strategies and forming plans to the point where I created a noose. But then after my failure the next few days I transformed. I canâ€™t even fathom suicide right now. My life hasnâ€™t gotten any better, probably more worse but suicide doesnâ€™t seem to even be an option anymore. 

I frequently go through these really low lows and super high highs but this was the most severe. Iâ€™m really scared for the next time  now
