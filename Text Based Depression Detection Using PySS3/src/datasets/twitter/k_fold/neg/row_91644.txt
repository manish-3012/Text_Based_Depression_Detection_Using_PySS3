Why do people only care when Iâ€™m actively suicidalRight now I have been feeling suicidal pretty much everyday. I used to try and tell more parents I was but they donâ€™t even do anything. I feel ignored. They have only really cared when I went to the mental hospital those two times. Once I get back it only lasts for a few weeks and then they donâ€™t care much again. I mean I know they probably donâ€™t want to stay up all night listening to me cry and repeat everything over and over but I donâ€™t know what else to do. I keep thinking I should try to attempt again. Both outcomes seem good to me. The first one is I die and be freed from the pain of living and the second on is my parents will care about me more for a few weeks. I just feel hopeless. I donâ€™t know what to do.
