How do I make and maintain friendships outside of LGB/TQ and mental health communities?I want to find interesting people with whom I can have shared experiences, not just vent about depression or disclose that I am transgender.

I have had such friends before, and it was so amazing with them. But later they eventually dumped me because I was too much for them.

Right now, all of my friends are either depressed or gay/transgender people, which makes me feel like a waste of space. I want someone to appreciate my true self, not just give me a safe space.

I feel diminished down to my gender and mental health issues. Who I am as a person, doesn't matter anymore at this point. I want to seriously kill myself over it.

Any help?
