aI have a really hard time being around people. I've always been quiet, especially with people I don't know well, but I feel like it has gotten worse over the years. The sensation of being observed or considered by people I don't know well or how they think tires me out so much that I stay inside all the time to avoid as much human contact as possible. 

I get almost no joy from anything, and if I do, it's a fleeting feeling. I'm so depressed all the time I can't even imagine a possible scenario where I am able to support myself in a way that wouldn't lead to me killing myself with a few months. I worked at a super market when I was 16 while doing independent study in highschool. It took so much out of me having to interact with that many people on a daily basis and having to do the things that were required of me that I spent all of the money I earned the second I got it because it was the only way I could justify forcing myself to go to work. I quit after about a month or two. One day the manager told me I didn't greet people enough and had me stand by the front door and greet every customer that came in for half an hour and told me if I couldn't do that all the time I should quit. I called in after work and told them I quit.

I worked construction through a friend of my mother's for about a month after highschool. I had planned on earning enough money to pay for a year at a language school in japan because it was one of the only things that sounded interesting to me. It was a little bit better than working at a supermarket, but I just felt so out of place there that it was mentally draining me again just being there. There was no way I was going to be able to do that for an entire year to pay for the trip. I had put in a request for information on the Marine Corps website the day before and got a call from a recruiter the next day during my lunch break at the job site. I agreed to go in after work and that was that. I gave my boss my two weeks notice but he said I didn't have to come in if I didn't want to anymore.

It's a long process to actually get into the Military once you start doing all the paperwork, and it took me about a year total to actually go to bootcamp since I had to get a waiver for eczema that I didn't have. I took the asvab and got a 97 and they said I qualified for every job, but I wasn't going to take anything but infantry and I told them as much. Started going to training sessions at the recruiting office and a year later I'm in bootcamp hating life. Everyone hates life in bootcamp so it wasn't really that unexpected, but then I go to school of infantry and hate life there too. Graduate as an 0311 after 9 weeks training and 6 or so weeks in guard on the night shift, walking around in the dark and hiding in porta shitters, trying not to freeze to death on the especially cold days. 

It was during this time that I got a call from my mom that her and my stepfather for a month went on vaction to hawaii for a week, and when they came back our dog was gone. We had lived with her in California in the suburbs for two years, and then took her into the country to stay with us at my new stepfather's. I loved that dog more than any person I had ever known, and I never have really been able to forgive my mother for just leaving her there and not caring enough to put her in a daycare for a week. I never told her this though and suffered her loss in silence. 

I went to Recon training for about a month after graduating and dropped out once my buddy told me he was going to quit and I couldn't convince him otherwise. Wasted away in a holding company for a couple weeks and then into the fleet we went. Got sent to the same unit as my buddy but got put in different platoons and basically never did anything together again. Don't think it bothered him that much but was really disappointing to me. 

Hated pretty much everything about being in the fleet. Had nothing in common with any of my peers and got punished all the time for things they did or didn't do, or things that people that had nothing to do with us did. All of our seniors were barely older than us and only in for a year longer, but liked to treat all of us awfully because they had been on a deployment already and played around in the dirt doing the exact same things we were doing here but somewhere else instead.

I had thought about killing myself many times throughout my life up to this point, but had never attempted anything. But after already having all of my other plans fail, and hating my existence as much as I did. I didn't see any way I could manage to do what I was doing for another 3 years, and I knew there was nothing for me to do afterward. I tried to shoot myself in the head during one of our ranges, but it was a lot harder to pull the trigger than I had hoped it was going to be. There were a bunch of people I didn't care about trying to talk me out of it, as well as one of my old squad leaders that I thought was okay. It really isn't fair once people start talking to you in a situation like that. As much as I wanted to, I thought it would be really rude to just coat them in my brain matter in the middle of them trying to talk to me. Eventually someone snuck up and took the gun from me while I was removing a glove, thinking that I might as well feel the sensation of pulling the trigger while shooting myself in the head since it is the last thing I'm ever going to do.

I spent the next 10 days in a psych ward and then started the long process of getting administratively separated. Spent the last few months there bouncing between appointments and doing nothing. Lost my mind and broke my hand on a concrete wall 5 days before I was supposed to be separated. Got sent to the psych ward for another week and finally got separated the day I was released.

I'm back home now and taking community college courses, but I still can't see anything I could ever imagine myself doing. Going into class makes me depressed and nervous about the possibility of doing group work and having to interact with people. I just skipped class today since I couldn't muster up any motivation to go. 

I am going to kill myself. I don't know when exactly, but I'm not capable of doing what I'm required to do to live. There is almost no joy in my life at all and all of my minimal responsibilities depress me to no end. There is no path for me to sustain myself that I am capable of and frankly no reason for me to. There will be people that will miss me, and while that gives me some mental distress, I'm not going to be guilted into living. I can't force myself to live out the rest of my life in depression so severe, and a life so meaningless that I spend every moment of consciousness wishing I had never been born.

I don't know why I'm posting this or whether or not I will delete this later. I don't want any sympathy, my life was hardly that awful, I just don't really know what else to do.
