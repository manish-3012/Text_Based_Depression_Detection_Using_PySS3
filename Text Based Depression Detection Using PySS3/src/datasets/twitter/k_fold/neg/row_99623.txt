Anyone else kinda feel like you're not gonna kill yourself rn, but so little would be needed to push you over the edge?It's like, I hate being alive but as of right now, I doubt I'll kill myself. However if something happened I probably would. If that makes sense? 

For example, I am a talentless piece of shit/waste of resources but I am okay at the bass. At this point it is literally the only thing that makes me feel a modicum of self worth. I bought a very nice expensive bass somewhat recently and it ever broke or got stolen I'd probably off myself. Both due to the cost (I dont have a lot of money) and what I'd be without it.

Which in turn makes me feel even worse about myself that I'm pathetic enough that the only thing keeping me from committing suicide is a damn guitar? 

I'm currently applying to college and I dont need to get into my top school or anything but I honestly depending on where i got accepted that might be enough.

I know for sure if something happened to my family I'd be dead, due to the fact I wouldn't need to feel guilty about it anymore

It's just kinda weird that my will to life is that fragile
