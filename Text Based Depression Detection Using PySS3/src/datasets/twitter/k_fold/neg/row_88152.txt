Can't do it anymore...I just want to be left alone... I left the Army a few months ago, and attempted / thought seriously about suicide on multiple occasions when I was in. I was always told to "man up" and whatnot. So I bottled it all up for 6 years. Now I'm in the national guard. I signed that contract to avoid  reactivation and redeployment, but my armory is 300 miles away, and it costs me 100 bucks to get there and drill (after I get paid. Yes, I'm being forced to pay 100 bucks a month or go to jail). My grandpa is dying, and the place my grandma is buried is going up for sale because we can't afford his treatment, I'm struggling with bills, and to top it off, my car's gas pedal is sticking, and the car doesn't even want to start. The thought of putting my uniform on throws me into depression and I feel like shit most of the time because I'm always thinking about having to go back there. My car being broken has pushed me over the edge, because if I miss drill this month, I might go to jail. I'm sick and tired of being threatened. I'm tired of feeling helpless and useless. I work my ass off and can't give my family anything nice to show for it. I just don't know what to do right now, and can't even get my thoughts together on this page. My daughter is the only thing keeping me from blowing my brains out, and with this new threat of imprisonment, I'm feeling that I should just do it and get it over with already. The army won't give a damn about my problem. My wife isn't helping. She won't even get a job. Nobody gives a damn, and I just can't do it anymore. I want out, and I'd rather do it on my own terms than someone else's....
