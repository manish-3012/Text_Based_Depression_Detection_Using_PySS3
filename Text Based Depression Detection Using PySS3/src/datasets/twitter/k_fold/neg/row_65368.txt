Someone just sent me money...A total stranger. They didnâ€™t know who I was, they just knew a bit of my situation, and decided to send me a couple dollars through PayPal..... I didnâ€™t know there were people so kind to strangers.... I donâ€™t know how I feel right now, I donâ€™t know how to process these feelings...... Iâ€™m going to get high AF and avoid these feelings if I can.... is it guilt for taking it in the first place? Is it shame for having someone feel that I need a donation? Is it joy for knowing thereâ€™s such people in the world?? Iâ€™m not sure what to do, how to feel, or even if my suicide plan is going to go through at all anymore..... this just blew me out of the water... all I know is I have to use the money for food or Iâ€™m going to regret it if I donâ€™t.... just enough for some rice and a bag of beans..
