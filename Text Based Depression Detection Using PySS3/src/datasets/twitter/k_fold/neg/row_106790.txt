Just getting it outThis place is getting loads of posts so feel free to skip this one for someone who actually deserves help. I hated this year. I hate the new year. I can't find the rope I had lying around and I'm upset at the fact I don't have a method to suicide. I don't care anymore. I don't have any interests in absolutely anything anymore. I just want to die and I don't know how.

Everyone is out there celebrating while I'm upset that this whole year I've been too cowardly to just fucking end it. Positivity can go fuck itself hard. I've been like this for too long and it's time for me to go. What's the point in living when the only reason I'm not dead yet is because I know that my family will be confused why I did it? After I die I'll just be called selfish for what I did and so fucking be it. I don't want to get better anymore
