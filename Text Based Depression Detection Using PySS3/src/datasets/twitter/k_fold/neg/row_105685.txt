Are suicidal thoughts/being very sad normal?I've never been to a therapist or anything like that. I was bullied for around 8 years and switched schools but it didn't help. I'm not bullied anymore but have extremely bad anxiety, ill skip class and get an F rather than presenting in front of people, even if it's just the teacher. I'll work hours on homework only to read it think it's horrible and delete it, which makes me grades even lower. I've self harmed since i was around 10 and relapsed a few months ago after being clean for 2,5 years. I've just stopped caring now. I don't care if I get bad grades, thinking "I'll be dead soon anyways". I can't get out of bed and rarely shower or eat. I've messed up my sleeping schedule too, it's currently 4:30 am. I'm having suicidal thoughts all the time and really want to do it, I've thought about how and when and sorta have a plan but I'm scared I'll be too much of a coward. I've tried talking to my parents but they just say it's normal for teens to be anxious and sad and that I just need to quit being afraid of talking to people. I have very few friends and am extremely bad at communicating. I'm far too scared to call a hotline or talk to anyone professional about how I'm feeling so idk if I actually am "sick" and need help of if my parents are right and I'm just dramatic since it's all normal and part of being a teenager. I just wish I could die but I'm scared of doing so since I'm scared of failing and having to face my parents about it. They think and say I'm fine, but I don't know if I need help or if I'm just like attention seeking?
