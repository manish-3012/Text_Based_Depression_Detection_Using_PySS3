I'm fine for now, but I know it's just sitting inside me. Watching, and waiting.I've been depressed for a long time, but it kinda just went away without any explanation when summer started. Before that, I was planning to stick a knife in my throat, but a few friends talked me out of it. Now, I don't plan to do it - I want to sometimes, but I don't want to act on the urge anymore. I'm happy, but I know that it's still in me, lurking, waiting for me to reach my lowest point, and that's when it'll strike, and try to take me out for good. Bastard. I wonder if I'll make it through the next time, or if I'll finally give in, and die. I'm unsure of which I want to happen.
