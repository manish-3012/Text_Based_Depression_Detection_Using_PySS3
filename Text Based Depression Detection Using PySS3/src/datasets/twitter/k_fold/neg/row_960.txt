the secret to happyThis world exists to cut you down and hurt you and inevitably kill you.

I tell myself "To be happy you must give everything away until you are nothing. Your sadness and your pain and your anger IS your happiness. Hurt yourself when you feel anything but happy, hurt yourself before someone else does, hurt yourself and be happy you are in pain, be happy you are suffering, be happy you are starving, be happy you are hopeless."

The secret to being happy is torturing yourself until you're no longer human.
