I have nobody.Friends left for college and I dropped out and now im stuck outa town with no job living with my parents with no N. Don't talk to my friend's much online except for one. I was told when I became an adult I would feel so happy. I cut my wrists and pray to find drugs to ease the pain. Talking to my parents never helps. Both addicted to alcohol and yell at me for being ungrateful. Im not a soulless robot that can work without interaction. God I hate life.
