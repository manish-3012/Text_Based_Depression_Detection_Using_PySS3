Don't want to do anything anymoreThis entire last month or so things have just gotten so bad that I can't get myself to sleep until like 3 am and I just wake up at around 5 am. I lay in bed doing nothing until about 7:15 or so and during that time I just keep questioning why I continue to go through the same crappy routine everyday. My motivation to get up for school and stuff has completely diminished and I don't have anyone to talk to about my problems. I have literally no idea what to do with my life.
