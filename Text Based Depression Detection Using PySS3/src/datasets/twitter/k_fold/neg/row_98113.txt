Just want it to be overI can't deal with life anymore. I'm 24 years old and have never been able to keep a real job. I just now started college because I fucked around these last few years. 

I have a long list of mental illnesses and personality disorders, I've been physically, emotionally and sexually abused my whole life and it's messed me up so much. I only have one friend and she's mad at me and probably won't ever forgive me. 

I have no one else to turn to and I don't think I can go the rest of my life being such a failure. Sure there are happy moments in my life, but its not worth going through all the shit to get to them. I'd rather stop feeling completely.
