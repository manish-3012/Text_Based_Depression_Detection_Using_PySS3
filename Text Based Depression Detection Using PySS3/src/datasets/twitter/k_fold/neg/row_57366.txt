Want to end it.But I'm stuck here suffering so other people don't get depressed about me killing myself. Why do I have to live in pain to keep others happy? They're not even happy about me because they're stuck with this loser in their lives. Even if I was free to commit suicide I would be too worried about failing and becoming paralyzed or something. I hate my life and I wish I could go to sleep and never wake up.
