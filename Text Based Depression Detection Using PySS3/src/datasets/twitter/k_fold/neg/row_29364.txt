Can I just die in my sleep?I wish I went to bed and never woke up.

I'm so done with my life. I ruin everything.

Addicted to weed, big pile of debt(80k), dead end job, took 7 yrs to complete a 3 year degree. Lost most of my friends.

Literally forgot to go to (online) class yesterday, now I might be kicked out of this class/course because I've missed too many classes already

Single as fuck. Ruined three relationships in the past 6 years due to my addiction 
None of the relationships went on for more than 3 months 

Realized that I've been hanging out with bad friends / people who just used me for the past 6 years. 

I'm probably going to end up smoking weed again today, even though it has ruined my life completely. I keep on keeping on. How stupid can someone be?
