im not the same as regular humans, i need to diefor some reason i dont deserve the same qualities of life as regular humans do, like siblings, friends, people who comfort them. life just doesnt want me to have those things. so i need to suicide quick in order to make life for other people more enjoyable

at only 16 years old im dying already. feels like I'm already a ghost
