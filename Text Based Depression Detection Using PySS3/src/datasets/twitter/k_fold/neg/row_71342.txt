Tomorow or next week I'm gonna be dead can't take it much moreMy family is forcing me to start working everyday yet all I'm thinking about is being free from this horribile prison life.I feel strangulated by society and system.I almost commited suicide with duct tape today I used the last bit of strength to get out.Because I wasn't fully prepared.
