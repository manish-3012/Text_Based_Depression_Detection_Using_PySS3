Feeling like a failure and sleepless. Not depressed but mind fucked.I'm not really sure if I'm suicidal or self crumbling my soul into millions of pieces.

I'm getting fucked up with my grad school and want to change the course but I'm really anxious that right now my brain is so stressed out and want to scream out loud and cry hard. A billion thoughts that I'm a failure in life, I'm scared to death right now what is gonna happen.

I'm feeling like shit, a total trash right now. Totally worthless of existence.
