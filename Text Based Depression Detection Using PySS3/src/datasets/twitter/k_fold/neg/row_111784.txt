Contemplating about it... it's becoming reality Hi r/SuicideWatch,
You don't know me and I don't know you. I'll be kind one and introduce myself.
My name is Jacob, I am 18 years of age living on the south east coast of USA. I came from Japan 10 years ago. That said, starting school was tough and later on [now] has become worse. The amount of harassment I get because I am Asian, I mean really? Is that the reason why they do this to me and torment me? I've been isolated my whole school years. Being alienated by my peers. Facing such humiliated from them, deriding me every moment they get. I honestly can't take this anymore.

Not to long ago I posted about this issue, issue about racism and how it affects us (Asians). [ I'm not saying all Asians get teased and what not etc etc and get easily offended etc etc] Anyways... I posted it and all I got was negative comments like I get in the real world. Getting down voted when I made a comment. Sending me racist slurs to me by message and telling me to go back to my country. You get the point. Of course there were people who showed admiration and strong understanding of what I'm trying to say and I appreciate you guys.

But lately, it's gone to far. Myself anyways. I've witnessed so much **** in my personal life, on here (Noticing alot more post about Asians on r/funny). I don't know. I can't take it personally anymore.
Every new day is hell for me. Walking down the street, getting taunted. Going to school, expected to become a stereotype. Having to deal with the same jokes that people tell me, which are getting old. UGH idk anymore

Right now (11:37pm) I'm really tired to type anymore. I hope some people understand.

Cya tomrrow?
