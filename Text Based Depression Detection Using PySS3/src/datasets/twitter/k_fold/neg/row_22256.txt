DownNo kids this week the ex has them. Feeling depressed. Still dunno why she left. Why is the world punishing me so much? What have I done to it? I tried to be a good person on this planet. Treated her good treated everyone around me good. Id give you my last dollar type of person.  Yet here I am now alone. I dunno why. What did I do so wrong? Please someone tell me. Sat in the kitchen wishing I could talk myself into killing myself. I cant. I am a coward. I wish I could. All my problems would be over. I woudlnt be alone.  I wish someone loved me. I wish someone wanted me. I wish someone cared about me. I wrote the ex a good bye letter on my computer months ago. I add on to it every once in awhile. I hate my life. I want it to end. I go out only hoping to catch the virus but I know I wont or I wont die from it. I want to die.  I sit here crying listening to sad music. Talked to both my parents and my kids earlier. Helped my father set up his ex box so him and his wife could play a game together.. I miss having someone to do stuff with. It was cold last night.. I cant even sleep in my bed since she left. I have horrible nightmares. I sleep on the couch now. When I can sleep. Tired of being depressed. Tired of being sad. Yet I dont see it changing. I could find someone else but I dont want to. She was my one and only. I dont want to continue living without her. I hope one day I can talk myself into doing it. No one will probably know for a few days or till someone needs me for something. I want to die. I wish I could pay someone to do it.I feel bad for my kids if I do finally do it but I dont see an alternative anymore. back to listening to sad music and google video games. Im lonely. I miss companionship. I miss just rolling over to feel for someone. I miss the dorky parts of a relationship. Sex is easy to find I want intimacy again. I want someone to roll over to.. to talk to at 3am. Why does no one love me? Sigh.
