I think im done on this planetmy whole life ive tried to keep on coping with depression and as every day year month minute second that goes by it just gets worse and worse. I feel guilty about feeling this way because i have a lot of materialistic things but that doesn't matter to me. all i want in my life is to be freed from this and i think i just might do that. i wake up everyday remembering why im the only one in class not smiling or the only one not laughing my ass off play CS:GO with my friends and im frankly tired of it. i just dont know how to finish it all, ive tried before and nothing has worked
