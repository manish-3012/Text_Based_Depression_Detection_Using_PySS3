Really been on my mind...Iâ€™ve had suicidal thoughts for I donâ€™t even know how long. A couple years? I want to do it, but maybe not now. Maybe Iâ€™ll do it a month from now. Iâ€™ve just been really considering it the last couple of nights. The bottle of pills I plan to OD on are on my dresser. Theyâ€™ve been sitting there for a month or two now. I donâ€™t know, maybe something spectacular will happen, and Iâ€™ll second think this.
