I can't get attached to anyone and value the wrong things all the timeM16 in case anyone is wondering. I can't fucking get attached to people JRL. Not a family member, people in school, nobody. I only get close to people online. I'm confused about my sexuality (I consider myself gay but tbh I'm probably just some sex addicted Aromantic/Asexual pile of trash) and have had 2 boyfriends, my first relationship lasted about two weeks before he broke up with me because he couldn't handle the distance, and the 2nd one which is my current boyfriend has been going on for a week now. However. I'm not in love. I don't actually have feelings. Well, I did for both of them, those feelings stopped after 1-2 days in both relationships. It's just me being desperate for affection. Seriously what the fuck dude why do I have to be like this and cannot be normal. It's really making me wanna kill myself because I don't wanna have to tell my bf that I'm lying to him about my feelings, especially because we plan on meeting in 2 weeks.
