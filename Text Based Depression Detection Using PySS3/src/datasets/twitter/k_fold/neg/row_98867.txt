A friend of mine needs help.A friend of mine from steam has recently been talking a lot about killing himself and it deeply concerns me. I believe he is serious. The problem is, I have no clue what any of his real life information is so I do not know how to go about helping him. I talk with him as much as I can and reassure him that people (myself included) honestly do care about him, but I don't know how to really help him beyond that. Could someone please tell me what to do?
