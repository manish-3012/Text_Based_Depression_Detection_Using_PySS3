Just need to get things off of my mind and vent.Okay, I'm trying to be as brief as possible. I'm 17 years old and I've been depressed for three years. Years of PMO (porn, masturbation, and orgasm) have ruined my life. It has caused me health issues, both physically and mentally. The time that PMO took up, I could have used towards better activities. It most likely was a major contributing factor to my depression as well. PMO even led me to get into weird fetishes (which is the case with most PMO people) - eventually incest came into play. Last year I almost committed an incestual act with my own mother, and these experiences keep coming back to haunt me. I'm being haunted by my own past. Keep in mind, I was also on Zoloft last year for my depression. While it did help, it probably led me to committing a stupid and vile act such as that above. Now I'm actively rebooting (basically giving yourself a rest from PMO and artificial stimuli like porn) and I seem to be pretty successful in doing so. I'm just bothered by my past and the fact that I feel like a total loser for the stuff I did in my past. Also, I'm essentially a high school drop out - I'd always had problems attending school, even when I was very young. I'd always hated school for SOME reason. Anyways, right now I'm trying my best to get right with God and accept Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. I repent for all of the stuff that I did in my past and I want to change. But it feels so hard to change when you're really down and depressed. My life went even more downhill right after I weaned off of my anti depressant, but I feel that I HAD to do it. I feel much more mentally clear now that I'm off of it, but simultaneously more depressed and discouraged. Suicidal thoughts plague me everyday but I really feel that I don't have the guts to commit suicide. Anywho, thanks for listening.
