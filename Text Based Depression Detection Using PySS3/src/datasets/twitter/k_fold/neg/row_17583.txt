The Snoos of this subreddit are triggering an irrational guilt trip for me.I don't really know what I'm doing here. What I do know is I'm fighting back self hatred just from looking at the Snoos holding up the sign to talk. Like the fact there are three inanimate clusters of pixels smiling at me, giving me the time of day to talk... it's giving me anxiety and guilt, and developing a lump in my throat, holding back tears. I'm very self aware at how ridiculous this is, and I don't know how I let myself get to this point. I don't think I'm truly suicidal. Pretty sure I'd flee from danger to preserve my life. I'm mostly posting in defiance against the voice in my head telling me not to take up people's attention when I'm significantly less-at-risk. Consider me low priority or delete this post if it doesn't belong here.

So... hi Snoos. Thanks for the friendly offer to talk.
