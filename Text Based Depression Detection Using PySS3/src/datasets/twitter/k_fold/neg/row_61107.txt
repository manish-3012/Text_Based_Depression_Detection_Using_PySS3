I really just hate myself.So within the last week I managed to ruin my 9 year relationship with a girl I was absolutely in love with. We have had two kids together. I just stopped doing everything I used to do for her because I was so stuck in my own head I didnâ€™t check to see if she needed anyone. I hate myself so much for it. Iâ€™m a giant piece of shit. I really want to kill myself, but I canâ€™t leave my kids without a dad. Iâ€™m so tired, I just want this pain to end. I havenâ€™t ate anything in 4 days, I havenâ€™t been sleeping either.
