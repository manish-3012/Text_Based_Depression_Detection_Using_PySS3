Feeling suicidal just after breakup, is thinking about coming back good to prevent thoughts?I broke up with my girlfriend of a few months, I know people have it much worse, but I'm really scared, I hurt my hand punching the wall. The relationship ended because of things out of our control, she has troubles with her family and prefers to deal with them alone, and does not want to be with me.

The only thing that makes me not want to die for a second is thinking that maybe If I do things right and the situation changes, in a few months we might be back together, or at least be friends.

Is fixating my mind on that hope a good idea to prevent the suicidal thoughts I'm feeling right now? For a while it calms me down, but then I lose hope and it all comes back rushing in, and I alternate between those 2. I don't know what to do.

Everything was going perfectly, I was always kind of depressed, but I was happy with her, and really hopeful about the future, now it's all gone, and I simply don't feel I have the energy to continue without her, to return to my old life or to build a new one.
