How is it possible to be so worthless?I've let everyone down, I'm 19, dark skin, 5'5, ugly, scrawny, small in all the important places and to top it all off I'm a dumb balding pothead.  I threw away money we didn't have to put me through college only to get all D's and F's.  I wanted to be an engineer but can't pay attention to calculus for 15 seconds.  I got high and literally cried laughing at how worthless I am, it was one of the best laughs I've had in a long time while also being the ultimate low point of my life.  If I kill myself maybe I can reincarnate as a normal human being, fuck being a tree would be better than this shit.  I don't want to make my parents sad by purposely ending my life, I'll probably make it look like an accident, or just jump in front of traffic, maybe even make it look like it was a murder.
