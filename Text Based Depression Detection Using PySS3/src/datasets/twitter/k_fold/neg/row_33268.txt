I Hate EveryoneIm interested in politics, science, and I want to get into philosophy. No-one else in my school is interested in those things. All of my conversations are trivial, and have nothing to do with anything I like. I believe this is one of the main causes of my suffering. I feel like no-one else values what I have to say becuase it is either â€œboringâ€ or â€œtoo serious.â€ And the. They start talking about shitty memes. I wish I could just fucking punch them in their stupid fucking faces. But, it would be out of jealousy of their happiness, and their ignorance to how shitty their life will become. 

Another cause of my suffering is my thinking about the future. The skills I harbor are not valued in the job market. I already know I will be poor, and my parents will make fun of me, and call me â€œlibtard.â€ They are brainwashed by Brintbart, and believe anything on Fox News, especially my father. I want to read Nietzsche for Christmas, but I doubt my parents will buy the book, becuase it makes arguments the portray Christianity negatively. My parents keep telling me Iâ€™m smart because I taught myself some Math, but they canâ€™t trust me to read something that portrays Christianity negatively. Fucking hate these stupid brainwashed fucks. 

Finally, I canâ€™t have a Cat. This is mostly out of my control, since my mother is allergic, but it makes me really sad. My friend has a cat and I spent hours petting it and loving it. It made me happier, but No. I canâ€™t have that. Fuck you â€œbenevolentâ€ God! 

I think Iâ€™m going to start cutting myself. Fuck this. I canâ€™t do it anymore. I get good grandes but theirs no point. I canâ€™t get a job with Philosophy. Fuck the world, and everyone in it, accept you guys. You guys seem a little nicer, and we at least have a common interest in killing ourselves. 

Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ve got now
