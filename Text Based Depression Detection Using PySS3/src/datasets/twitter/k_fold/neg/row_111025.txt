Waking up is the worstI donâ€™t know about you all, but when I fall asleep my brain clearly lets me know that itâ€™s consumed by whatâ€™s eating me up inside. I dream about it all night, several times per night. Sometimes I have dreams about the situations being resolved, which ironically turns out to almost be worse, because then I wake up and realize that Iâ€™m still broken and nothing changed
