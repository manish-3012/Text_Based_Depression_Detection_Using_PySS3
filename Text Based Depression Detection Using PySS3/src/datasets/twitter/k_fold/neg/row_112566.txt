Im There.Ive been coming to this sub for about a year. Ive talked to many many people and hopefully ive helped them. 
I know for a fact that Ive helped 2 because both contacted me a few months later to thank me. Im very happy that I was able to help.
I came here to try and help people because I want to die as well and I thought it would help me.  I think it did for awhile. 
But my time has come I think. I can no longer handle the pain in my life. I can no longer handle being taken for granted by my family anymore.
I am so very tired of everyones life being so much more important than mine. I am so very tired of being ignored and walking on eggshells in my own home.
Ive had a plan for awhile now. I know how I will do it. I guess I just wanted to say goodbye and to those folks I talked with I hope you continue to blossom and live life. I also wanted to say Im sorry. I really really sorry.
