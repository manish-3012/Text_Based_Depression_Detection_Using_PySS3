Canceled my treatmentI lied and said I wasn't a danger to myself. Everyone saw through it. I told them not to worry because I was seeking treatment...

Suddenly, I had a change of heart. Either I need to get life insurance ASAP for my wife and kids so I can wait out the suicide period, or I need to play it cool for a month so I can get the tool I need for my own demise. Either way, therapy would spoil the plan.

I am grateful for the short term resources such as the prevention hotline. This is all so exhausting.
