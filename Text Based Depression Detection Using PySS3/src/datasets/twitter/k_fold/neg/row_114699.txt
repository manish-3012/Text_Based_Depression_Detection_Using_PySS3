I want to thank you all in this community for reminding me there are good people out there.It's been a really long day, I haven't slept in 24 hours after the day I've had, but I want to sincerely thank you all for your kind words of support. 

I honestly don't I would get through some of those dark nights without it.


So, thank you all.
