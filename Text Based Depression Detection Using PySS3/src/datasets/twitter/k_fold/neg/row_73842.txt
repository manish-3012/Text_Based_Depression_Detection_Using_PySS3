please help. been close to the edge for 13 years, today i think I've lost all hopei just woke up and feel the emptiest ive felt maybe ever.  i had dreams the last many hours about my life when i was younger, all the people i knew, all the things i fucked up for 13 years straight.  im just sitting here thinking and feeling like everything in my life thats happened feels like a sad sad terrible dream, like one so bad, so bad that you couldn't even write it if you tried

i dont know if ive ever felt this suicidal


but today i truly feel so utterly empty about how ive fucked up my life that I want to drive to a building and leap
im just realizing, its all hitting me now more raw and more clearly than it ever has, how ive fucked up LITERALLY, not figuratively, but literally every single year in the last 13 years.  I've met hundreds upon hundreds of people and came away with 0 friends, i've lost every real friend ive ever had, i don't keep in touch with a single soul, i have no money, im failing out of college and have lost financial aid, my car essentially just died on me two weeks ago, i cant concentrate ever, im 23 and have severe depression and social anxiety, and every day is the ultimate hell i have never realized i was building for myself for 13 years

I wish there was a way to fix everything, but everything's so fucked up beyond belief that i believe its too late.  I wish anyone could give me hope that it isn't too late to be successful and make friends and be happy.
