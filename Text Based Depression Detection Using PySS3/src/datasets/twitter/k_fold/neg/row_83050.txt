Numbiâ€™m losing myself again. somehow this just always seems to happen. itâ€™s good for a while and then i breakdown and slip again. my heart is tired, my brain is tired, my mind is tired, iâ€™m tired. at the end of the day, somehow i always feel empty. i just want to be happy. behind the smile of mine i am broken. my thoughts consume me and my mouth wonâ€™t let me express the way I feel properly so I donâ€™t speak. i hate talking. i lost desire to even say anything at all. i donâ€™t like to burden anyone with my sadness or my emotions because why should they feel the way i do? they donâ€™t deserve this pain or sadness. iâ€™m so used to dealing with things in my own that iâ€™m used to no one offering me a helping hand. but even the strong people get tired of being strong. i have been recklessly spending money because itâ€™s the only way i can feel something. on shit i donâ€™t even need. it makes me forget. sometimes i wonder why i was chosen to have such a complex personality and mind. i donâ€™t understand myself. even writing this gives me anxiety because im afraid itâ€™s not making sense like itâ€™s not showing how it really feel inside. it hurts. everything hurts. yesterday, i tried kill to myself twice. it took everything in me not to proceed. i am drowning. the pain in my heart just wont end. i want to do it again today, thatâ€™s all iâ€™m thinking about. the deadliest thing in this world is your own mind. i canâ€™t even type out what Iâ€™m feeling this is the most pathetic thing Iâ€™ve ever written. i actually feel embarrassed I even wrote this. i donâ€™t wanna do this anymore
