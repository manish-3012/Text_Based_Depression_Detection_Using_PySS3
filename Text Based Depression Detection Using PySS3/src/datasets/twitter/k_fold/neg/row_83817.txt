I've lost.This is it. I've made up my mind. I'm going to go to work tomorrow. Withdraw all the money I have left and leave it for my roommates as to not screw them over when I leave, and I'm going to leave. First I'm going to drive. Drive and drive until I run out of gas and money to keep filling on gas, then, I don't know. I'll just jump in front of an oncoming semi on the freeway, or find a steep cliff to drive myself off, who knows where I end up. At the end of it all, I will be dead. I'm only leaving this post here so eventually someone will connect the dots to find my suicide note that I'm about to write. For any friends or family that find this, it will be in the second drawer of my desk. I've just broken, I've given up on myself, my future, anything. There's nothing left but fear, anger and hatred. I've gotten so bad that all I can think about is either killing myself or going on a complete rampage and killing as many people as I can. I don't want to hurt anybody so the clear choice is to kill myself. I'm so angry all the time, I just want it to stop. I'm destroying myself. The way I'm doing it is more painful and longstanding than just taking my life. I'm drinking, not sleeping, not working, mentally tearing myself apart, ruining relationships (the few I had left) and I already had any sense of a future ripped away from me. Everywhere I look for happiness or hope, all I find is the opposite. I can't even look at my parents anymore, my only source of hope and reason to continue in this world without getting angry, jealous and spiteful to the world and what its done to me. I probably don't even deserve to live anyway. God I wish guns were easier to get in the united states, I'd just shoot myself. But I don't own any guns or know anyone who does. So I'll have to resort to more crude methods. As long as nobody else gets hurt I guess.
