I'm a wasteMy whole life I just wanted my purpose to be to help someone but I'm not helping anyone. I'm just a bother and no one truly cares. My life doesn't matter. I've barely made an impact on anyones life if any. I'm just someone people like to use and then throw to the side. I feel like I have to die, I feel like I want to die. But i cant tell if deep down I really want it all to end once and for all.
