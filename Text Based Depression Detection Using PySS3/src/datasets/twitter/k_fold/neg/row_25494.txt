Can't stand one more night of feeling like thisI don't know what to do anymore, I'm just gonna yell into the void here a bit because I don't know what else to do.  I'm so fucking sad and alone. I'm at the point where being awake is too exhausting and depressing.

I wake up most mornings feeling so empty that all I can do is lay there and cry. Getting out of bed is excruciating, but staying in bed is also excruciating. I find myself spending hours doing nothing but staring at the ceiling. Sometimes I can use my sadness for something like my art, but more and more I've become even so sad that it's to the point where I don't want to draw anymore, let alone do anything else.

I dread the nighttime, because I can barely sleep anymore. I usually am up until an ungodly hour stewing in my own sadness, unable to get myself out of my own head. 

Nothing can distract me from my head anymore. I'm on medications for depression and anxiety (have been a year or so now), but they clearly aren't doing what they're supposed to. I've been like this for so long that people in my life are fucking sick of it (myself included), and expect me to be better by now.  But I'm not getting better, I'm getting worse and worse and I feel like I'm fucking drowning 24/7. I've stopped talking to people because I can tell I bring them down. I don't know how to interact with anyone anymore. I've become so reclusive and don't have a way to really change that, and even if I did have a chance to get myself out there and make some more friends and have a life...I know I would fuck it up because I always do. I just don't want to try anymore.

I don't know how I can handle making it through tonight, let alone the rest of my pathetic life.

I just wish I were dead.
