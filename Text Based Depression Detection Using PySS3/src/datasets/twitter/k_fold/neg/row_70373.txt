Just feeling soo emptyIts really to the point now,its obsessive pervasive and All I think about is my suicide plan and how badly my mortal body wants to die.I suffer from bipolar disorder/major depressive disorder and its so overwhelming Im on meds now but nothings really helping. Im so sick of feeling everything,and just want to disappear forever, I find it so hard to believe it ever gets better... :(
