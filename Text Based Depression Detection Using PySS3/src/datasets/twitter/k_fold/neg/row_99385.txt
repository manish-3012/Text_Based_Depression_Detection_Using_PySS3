Persistent SI, thinking about writing a letter to my fatherI've been diagnosed with generalized anxiety and major depressive disorder. I left my stable but boring job two years ago to do something I had no experience with and had a massive anxiety attack, then quit the next day. Since then, I've had about ten different jobs, my car was repossessed, my relationship of a year with a woman I loved ended, my relationship with both of my parents irreparably fell apart, I was kicked out of my apartment by a discriminatory act on behalf of the landlord, and I have been turned down for each and every job I've interviewed for that could fix my financial situation. My health insurance premium just skyrocketed, so now I can't afford the insurance I need to treat myself.

This is the lowest I've ever been. I can't think, I can't focus. When an opportunity for positive change comes, I get anxious and ruin it. I can't get out of my own way. The only thing I can think to do is jump off of a bridge nearby. It was fleeting at first, and now it's all I think about.

Googled how to kill myself with cough medicine two nights ago.
