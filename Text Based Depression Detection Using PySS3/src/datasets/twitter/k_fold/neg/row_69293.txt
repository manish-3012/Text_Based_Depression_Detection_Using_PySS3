Is it wrong?Is it 'wrong' to want to kill myself small things. Sure they are small, but they add up. It's to the point of where its hard to get through the day. I just don't want to do anything anymore and I feel like no one cares about me. I feel like people would be better off without me. I feel like people would be happier if I died cause then I wouldn't be 'annoying' and I wouldn't be getting into other people's friendships to try to make friends because I don't have any. I also think people would be happy if I died because then I wouldn't try to force myself into a conversation. I'm just so tired of everything and I'm ready for it to end. I'm not really afraid of it at this point, heck, I'd welcome my death.
