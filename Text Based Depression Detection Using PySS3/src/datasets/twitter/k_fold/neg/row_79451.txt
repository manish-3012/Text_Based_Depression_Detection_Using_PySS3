im thinking of doing it after this summerI like the summer when im back home. its quiet, im with my cat, swimming. Ill give this last luxury to myself, and once its over i iwll kill myself. Why? I dont need a why. I dont want to bore you, but the main reason is unemployment. I was adopted as a child, i did shitty things when i was a teen, had the police involved, my dad almost had a heart attack from all the shit i was doing. My relatives, all of them, hatem me. But i managed to get into a very prestigious uni and graduated. I tried to 'make up' for all the pain i caused. I lived abroad, was...em...ok. Lonely. So i came back to my home country. More than 600 CVs in 3 months, no interviews, well...one. In a call center. I now feel ashamed again, just like when i was a teen. My parents spent their money on my education and im unsuccesful. My home country is corrupted. Its crap. Its an unfair place. You cant find a job unless you know people. i dont. they hire young people..lile 22 or 23 years old im 34. I tried so much...its not happening. I went to seminars,  everyone got hired (all of them younger than 24) except me. My parent has cancer, my best friend has cancer, i have no other friends here. I dont want to move abroad again.

Im stuck in a corrupted shithole.

So ill just do it. No more emotions or will left.
