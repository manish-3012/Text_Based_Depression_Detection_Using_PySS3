My mom died, i never really had a reason to live beyond that.My mom died Christmas Night 2017 due to Stage 4 breast cancer. Shea was 55 and didn't deserve it but she did everything within her power to make my life and my sisters life the best it could it be. I know she wouldn't want it but I really have no other reason to live. I realise I could do anything but in the end but what's the point? I'm going to die regardless. I'd rather make it sooner than later. It's just really tough. Facing the death of the only person who meant anything to you. My dad and sister we're never really there and I hardly have any friends to hang out with.

I just sit at home in my cold ass camper and wish I had someone to talk to.

I'm not crying out to /r)suicidewatch for help. I just really needed to type this message to feel better.

Didn't really work but was better than nothing.

Goodbye.
