Is there anything I can do to surround myself with this suicidal feeling?I want to drown in it. It's been about 10 years of me trying to fight this feeling. Begging for happiness. But I decided I'm done fighting it and just want to embrace it. I want the feeling of wanting to die to kill me. I realize this sounds edgy and annoyingly abstract. But I seriously want ideas for what to do to fall so deep into the hole of suicidal thinking that I can finally kill myself in peace.
