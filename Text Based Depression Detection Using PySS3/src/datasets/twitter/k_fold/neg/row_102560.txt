The end is nearI'll have everything ready for my method of choice within a few weeks at most. I've done the research and know exactly what my plan is. I doubt I'll fail.

Life just isn't fun anymore, and I don't care enough about anybody to stick through what I have no reason to believe could possibly end soon. Either I have depression, which doesn't go away, or I'm just an unmotivated, overly-needy person who won't be satisfied with the type of life I'm capable of leading. Either way, it's either decades of discontent or suicide. I'm picking suicide. Wish me luck.
