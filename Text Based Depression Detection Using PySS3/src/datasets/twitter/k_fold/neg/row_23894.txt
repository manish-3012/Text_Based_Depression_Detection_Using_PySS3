I feel like I'm out of placeI've been slowly working away my major depressive disorder with medication and some therapy/lifestyle changes, but sometimes I feel like I was never meant to get out of my depression. I feel lost and confused as to why none of my suicide attempts worked and it feels like simply existing is wrong? Has anyone else felt like this?
