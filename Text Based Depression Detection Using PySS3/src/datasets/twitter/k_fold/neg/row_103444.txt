Been dead inside for 5 years. It's reached a breaking point.My plan ever since I was 17 was to wait for my parents to die, and then kill myself. 

I figured I would not have to face that reality until i was at least 30, but here I am at 22 having thought about suicide every day for the past two years. 

I don't know why I'm posting here there's nothing I can learn from this thread that will help me. I'm past the point of saving or convincing not to do it. The only thing that was stopping me from not doing it with my parents, but all suffering is temporary just like all life is temporary. Taking my life sooner would nothing off the total time I spend dead (infinity). So what's the point in continuing.

The first time I thought about killing myself was in the fifth grade. I was 10 years old, crying on the floor with a knife aimed at myself. 

The 12 years I've spent since then I've been mediocre, filled with nothing worthwhile. life Has provided me with no reason to consider my existence anything less than insignificant.

at this point, the only people that would miss me more than a few months after my death would be my family and a couple friends. 

so why should i continue living in fucking dread and torment just to keep a few people from feeling sad a few times before they die. 

it doesn't make sense to me. we'll all be dead for eternity. none of us will be remembered. 

Someone just give me a reason why i shouldn't kill my self now instead of after my parents are dead. 

 btw limit is 2 weeks; that's as long as i'm giving the rest of this existence.
