At what point do check myself into a psychiatric ward?I'm 22 and transgender. I'm waiting for gender therapy, even just to talk to them would be something. Recently I have been feeling angry, depressed, have been thinking about death and suicide (but I would not say I'm suicidal). I have been trying really hard to try and get rid of it, and thought I did. But yesterday I got really drunk and all I can remember is standing outside of Accident and Emergency, and the guard telling me to go inside and talk to someone. I was thinking about jumping in front of cars all day (not thinking about doing it, just thinking about it), so my educated guess is that is I tried to do that. Whatever I did, it was enough for someone to call me a taxi and drop me off there. Eventually when I was sober enough I got to talk to someone. He was pretty cool, but he didn't really get the whole trans thing I think. I didn't really go into how much I was thinking about suicide. Strangely it didn't come up? I'm gonna go back to them every so often, they want to observe my moods to see if I have bipolar disorder, and I'm trying to get a professional on a weekly basis to talk to. Sometimes I feel as though I'm fine, and sometimes I stay in bed all day without eating much and think about suicide. At what point do I go in? At what point? I don't want to waste anyone's times or resources with something not big enough.
