Feel Suicidal Because of Sexual Preference and The Planet 

To introduce myself. I'm male, I have no family or friends.

And just to note, I've never abused a child. I would never abuse a child. My issue comes with my sexual preferences, which is pedophilia. I was exposed to child nudity from a young age, as most do. And had witnessed abuse once or twice. From what I can tell, this caused my attraction to children. I've been to therapy for this because, I value other lives over my own. I don't want to bring harm to anyone. What this made me realize was how others are not helped at all, let alone made aware of it. With all this stuff coming out on the internet about people supposedly being involved with rape and grooming, it makes me wonder, how can we prevent this from happening? There's a lot of focus on imprisoning people, and even the death penalty/torture to these people (which is a human rights violation). But not enough about preventing, about not committing these immoral acts.

When I realize that there's many other issues with myself and the world, it makes me begin to feel hopeless. Because nobody wants to change. Nobody wants to look past that stigma behind these issues. They don't look at it from the other point of view. Part of why I hate my life is because of my autism. It has caused more suffering in my life than anything else. This combined with my sexual preferences. It's created this hole that I can't climb out of. I have these sexual thoughts, and they are my only way of coping with it. There's no way to get rid of pedophilia.

I've done all the research I could on it, and nothing comes all. All people want to do is castrate those who have it. Or enact the death penalty. As far as I know, this gives more reasons for someone to act on their sexual urges. Especially those who have already done it once. And it doesn't solve the core issue, which will no doubt come up regardless of the percentage of cases of X.

my motivator for wanting to die is the suffering that happens all across the world. To all sentient life. It saddens me to see violence used against anyone, for any reason. I wonder if there is ever hope out there. To see change in the world. Whether it's our attitudes to certain topics, or the way we treat each other. So much injustice happens, and yet, I find myself wanting to die before anyone else.

I don't listen to violence or negativity. I listen to reason. Perhaps I have overlooked something here, which is why my will has bought me here.
