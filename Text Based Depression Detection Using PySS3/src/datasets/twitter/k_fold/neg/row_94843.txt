I hurt the person I love the most and I can't cope with itLast night I told my girlfriend the best thing to do is to break up before it's too late because we weren't going anywhere.  
We dated for about a month 2 years ago but it was something very superficial and we both got the wrong ideas from each other. After we broke up she was pretty affected and she started dating a good friend of mine for about 6 months. (It's worth noting that my friend didn't know that we had been together until they were already dating). That hurt me for a while but in time I understood that they were both happier this way and that gave me the power to get over it. I also didn't talk to her until like a month or 2 before they broke up when I messaged her saying that I want thing to be okay between us. She also apologized for some things and we remained friends.  
Recently, after about 10 months, we started to talk more and hang out and one day she said that she wants to have a serious discussion with me to talk about some things that remained unsolved between us. After we talked we both realized that we were in love with each other but I told her that nothing can ever happen between us because she really meant something for my friend she dated.  
But I couldn't do it. It felt like the universe was giving me a second chance, to do things right, and I rejected it. So I told her that if she can bear waiting for a little longer I will do everything that was in my power to make this happen. She understood me and helped me with everything she could. After weeks of frustration, thinking and talking with people I realized that the best thing to do is to talk directly to my friend. So we both talked with him about this very in depth and he said that he is fine with it. So we finally went for it but it was obvious that he only said that to be a good guy and he still had feelings for her, because I have been through that.  
And now I got to the point when I can't hold it in me anymore. I knew I was being a shit friend for doing that so I told her that if I continue like this the relationship is going to fall. I told her last night that it's better to finish everything now since the more we wait the more it will hurt. We also decided that it's better not to talk with each other at all from now on.  
And today she scared the crap out of me because me and some good friends of ours tried to contact her and she didn't respond to anyone for a good part of the day. After she told her best friend that she is fine I calmed down a bit but now I can't stop thinking about the fact that I ruined everything life could give me and I the woman I love told me that nothing ever hurt her as much as this.  
I know she would never forgive me for this and I know that if I try to enter in her life again all I would do is more harm. My soul is crushed right now and I thought that at least writing this here will keep me from physically harming myself.  

**TL;DR:** I broke up with the woman I love in the worst way possible and I hate myself to death
