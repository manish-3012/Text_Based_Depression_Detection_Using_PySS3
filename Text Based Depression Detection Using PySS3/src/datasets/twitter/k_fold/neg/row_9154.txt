I have a plan and I'm finally feeling real happiness.I know I've posted here a lot, and I know that may seem attention-seeking. Hell, maybe it was. But I'm not posting this to try and have someone talk me out of it or someone to convince me there's more to life. I'm tired of reading things about people who have attempted to kill themselves and are so glad it didn't work because guess what? When I woke up the next morning after swallowing all of my pills I screamed and cried because I was so angry to still be here. 
For as long as I can remember I've been going back and forth between feeling normal and slightly upbeat and depressed, but now I am so happy. Because I finally am doing something that's not selfish for once, something that's going to benefit everyone that I care about. I've analyzed all of my close personal relationships and every single one of them would have more positives than negatives if I just finally died, even my fucking pets. I'm waiting until after I go home for spring break so I can have a nice week at home with my family for them to hold onto and remember me by, and so I can have a little bit to straighten out all of my personal things and get everything in order. I'm finally at peace with myself and my life, but I want to thank you all for always being there for me in my lowest moments. Some lives are worth saving but I decided that mine wasn't, but you are all doing a great thing by being there for people who still have hope. Thank you all.
