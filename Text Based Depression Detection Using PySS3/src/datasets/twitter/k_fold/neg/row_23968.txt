My parents abuse me mentally and physicallyIm really here to cry out in help,ro see if im in the wrong or im in the right.
 
At Christmas 2018 I spent the day locked in my room without being able to leave because I didn't want to change my clothes at midnight. 

That same day my mother jumped up and slapped me in the face while her nail stuck in my skin i have a scar to prove it.

My father already slapped me that made my mouth swell, and I saw my mother in the background satisfied with that and I just answered a question. 
She  hit me with slippers (i was 9) until my legs turned purple and forced me to go to school with a leggin pants showing my leg and she wanted me to talk if someone asked why my legs are purple i responded with i disobeyed. 
I've lost count of how many blouses she thinks are old and musty she already tore because she they weren't pretty enough 

she has an  shoe drawer that she doesn't wear, I just got two new ones because she didn't want to wear anymore 

my father forced me weakly and dizzily down 40 stairs 

I inadvertently gave her the middle fingers and she slammed me in the ass and hit me mostly in the face.
