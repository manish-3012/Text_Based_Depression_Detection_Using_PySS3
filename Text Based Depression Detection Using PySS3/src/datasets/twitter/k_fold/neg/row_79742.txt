She save me and I told herI got my shit together and I told her


I was suicidal and I had to tell HER


I told her how I felt through the last weeks and how sheâ€™d been absent. She was sorry, as she doesnâ€™t want to lose me.
She told me how important I was for her, that touched my heart, something that didnâ€™t ever happen before. She was worried and I felt bad, because I felt like she was wasting herself over me. 
I begged her to be happy, as she always is. She always is happy, sheâ€™s the most optimistic person I know. She understands me really well. She might be the only person I know of to really understand me. Iâ€™m crying right now, as Iâ€™m writing.   Sheâ€™s special, she really does understand me, she goes deep into my subconscious. She knows more than I do about myself.

I feel better

I hope you have a great evening or whenever youâ€™re reading this

Thanks
