A year ago today.I was awoken by a phone call from my mom at 4 am, was surprised I had actually missed 10 of her calls. 

Was working an internship in a distant city and was told to come a hospital 2.5 hours away because my brother wasn't feeling well.

Heart and mind racing I sped to the hospital and was brought back to a room. With parents and a doctor sitting and waiting, i was told my brother was dead from intentionally overdosing on diet pills. I will never forget any of it.

Ran to my brother's hospital room and have never felt lower in life than when I saw his lifeless body on the table. I cried and screamed and wanted to take my own life then and there.

Life moves on but you never fully forget what happened. 


For those in a tough and scary place, please reach out to me, for this world is simply too beautiful to leave before it's your time.

The pain and heartache I feel a year later still hurts immensely. No one should ever feel this way. It's too sad and painful.


Much love,
