Everyone will be laughingMy existence is a joke to people in my life. People underestimate me to the point where they actively try to sabotage my efforts. Ever since I was little I never felt like I should have been alive. Men just take advantage of me because they see me as vulnerable  even if I try to be the coldest that I can be towards them which led to multiple incidences of abuse that I cant seem to escape no matter what I do in life. My parents cant get me help from any professionals because we dont have any money at all. Coincidentally my parents are also the ones who gaslight me every single day about their abuse towards me. I remember it all. And I will die laughing with the rest of the people who laughed at me. Everyone will be laughing at my grave laughing at how pathetic of a person I am.
