My life is okay. But I feel depressedI have loving parents.  I have a high paying job although I'm not financially responsible at all.   Im great at what I do.

But at the same time. I have no friends in this town  (broke up with my charismatic but abusive ex, and typical bullshit happened).  I have body issues.  I feel like an obese buffoon.  Still not over the abusive relationship.   I feel weak.  Oh and I'm not financially responsible.   I live paycheck to paycheck,  often overdrafting.  I don't know how to make a budget  worth a damn.  I have no savings.

I feel sick,  I feel sad, and I just want to be a dead,  bloated corpse.
