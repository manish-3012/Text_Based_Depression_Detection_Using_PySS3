Iâ€™m tired of staying alive for someone else.iâ€™m very close to my mom. we didnâ€™t always have a good relationship, but we have for the past several years now. sheâ€™s single, my father is dead, and iâ€™m her only child. sheâ€™s close with our immediate family too so itâ€™s not like she would have no one if i wasnâ€™t here anymore, but i still canâ€™t imagine what me killing myself would do to her. 

but iâ€™m so, so tired of suffering every day for the sake of someone else. i know thatâ€™s selfish. but iâ€™ve been ready to die for a long time now. iâ€™ve been in pain for as long as i can remember, and despite the best efforts of me and many amazing doctors, itâ€™s only gradually gotten worse. iâ€™ve given up on myself. iâ€™ve been privileged enough to get help from so many dedicated people, and it was still somehow never enough. the only thing left to do is let go of this waste of a life.

but my heart breaks for my mom. i donâ€™t think many other people would care or really even notice so sheâ€™s the only one iâ€™m concerned about. i know it would crush her. sheâ€™d never be willing to understand why i need to do this and let me go voluntarily. thereâ€™s nothing i can do to make it easier on her. i wish there was.

a big part of me wants to just be selfish about this. but thereâ€™s also a part of me that feels too guilty to hurt my mom like that. i donâ€™t know why iâ€™m posting here, i guess iâ€™m hoping for reasons to not feel guilty anymore.
