Fix everything the "easy" wayI'm not depressed nor suicidal, but I must admit is really tempting to end my life now, I have made some research and can definitely do it just to fix everything.

Background: I'm studying computer engineering, my studies last around 10 semesters, but I'm currently in semester 13, this is costing my mother a lot of money and by a lot I really mean a lot, I see her struggling everyday with bills, I have a job, but is not paying me much so I can't help her, every time I try to do something for me and improve my grades (marks) it just blows in my face and makes everything even worst.

I need to graduate, get a good job and help my mother, maybe buy her a house or something, she have given me a lot but it just seems I can't even give her my fucking graduation.

This suicide option is getting really tempting, if I do that she won't have to pay for my college and that will give her a lot of money to pay everything she needs to pay, she won't be dealing with a failure anymore and move on.
