Genuinely feel like I canâ€™t get through this.My girlfriend and I have been together for over 6 years. We started dating my senior year and through undergrad.

She recently broke up with me and I have no idea how Iâ€™m going to get through this. Iâ€™ve been on the verge of tears all day and I just had to rush into the bathroom of my building so people wouldnâ€™t see me cry. I already deal with abandonment issues and she was my support system cause itâ€™s hard for me to open up to friends and family.

I genuinely donâ€™t think I can get through this. All I can think about is our relationship/memories or ways I can take my life without suffering too much. Iâ€™m in grad school during the hardest part of the year and I canâ€™t focus during class or in my office. Nights are near impossible.

I just donâ€™t know what to do. Itâ€™s overwhelming. The only thing keeping me from taking my life is imagining the effect itâ€™d have on my immediate family and my close friends. But I just donâ€™t want to feel this anymore. 

I know itâ€™s so cliche and seems dramatic but I just needed to say this somewhere.
