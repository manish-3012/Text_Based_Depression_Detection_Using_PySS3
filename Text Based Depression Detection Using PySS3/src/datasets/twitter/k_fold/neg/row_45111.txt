Nobody Will Ever See Me as a Real WomanI simply wish I had the courage to commit suicide. I'm trapped in a house with a hyper-conservative, unsupportive family, I have no possible hope of ever getting HRT and even if I did, I'll be discriminated against for the rest of my life. Society as a whole will never see me as a real woman and even if people respect my pronouns and act like a woman to my face, most of them will never see me as a real woman at all and would no be comfortable with me being in woman's areas (locker rooms, bathrooms, etc.).

Honestly, I wish I had the courage to commit suicide but considering the fact that I've wanted to kill myself for years now, it seems like that won't be happening because I'm too much of a coward. The only thing I'm courageous enough to do is try reducing my lifespan by eating as much shit as possible and not bothering to fix anything that goes wrong. Maybe at some point I can be courageous enough to do other things to kill myself faster, like smoking or drinking. I just want something that will numb the pain because it hurts so bad.
