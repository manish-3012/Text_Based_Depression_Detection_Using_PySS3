School sucksIt is a pain to go to school, my anxiety has gotten worse. Being around people makes me anxious. Some people avoid me, and my friends, I'm not even sure if they want me around. I'm not very smart , I'm a failure. I see kids getting hundreds and then there's me stuck with a 70, 60 or 80. I feel like I'm being judged every step I take. I hate group projects, I'm always left out. Some how I stopped carering, I'm just sick of the whole thing. I wish I could end it. None of them care. You'd think if I cried they would, I've done that before, I broke down and they all stayed quiet, staring at me like I'm a weird person. I don't want to go there.
