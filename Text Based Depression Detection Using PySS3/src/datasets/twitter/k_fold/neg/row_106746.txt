Alone please helpI ran into my ex who really hurt me in bad ways at the mall just now and Iâ€™m in Barnes and Nobel crying. I canâ€™t leave til 10 since Iâ€™m waiting for my friend to get off work here. I canâ€™t talk to anyone, I donâ€™t want to open up again. One of the things my ex did was somewhat push me to close myself off from things she said. I donâ€™t want to go into detail I just want to kill myself and itâ€™s an awful feeling I want to cut myself but Iâ€™m going to be with my friend all night so I canâ€™t even do anything but I donâ€™t want to tell her anything. I canâ€™t even talk to her for another 2 hours. I feel sick.
