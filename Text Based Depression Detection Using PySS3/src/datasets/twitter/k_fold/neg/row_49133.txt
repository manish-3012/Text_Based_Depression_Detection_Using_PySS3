I have trauma and would like to not have to deal with that anymoreI tried to kill myself two years  ago because i was in a terrible and abusive relationship. i ended up breaking up with him a year after that and i was diagnosed with ptsd . he started dating another girl who was friends will all my friends and i had to watch her go through everything i just went through almost exactly. he broke up with her tonight as a manipulative way to get her to trust him more and me less. they got back together after she promised she wouldnt listen to me or our friends warnings about him anymore. i am so worried. i cut for the first time in months. i want to die. i want him to leave me and her alone. she is five years younger than him and very unstable. i am so worried. i want to die
