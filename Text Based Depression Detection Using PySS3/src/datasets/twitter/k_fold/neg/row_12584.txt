Got a birthday coming up...I fucking hate birthdays (my own not those of other people) I'm going to be 21 and I have accomplished absolutely nothing. I'm honestly at the point where I don't really have an immediate desire to kill myself but fuuuuuuuuck I hate my birthday, at least I'm working that day and won't be doing anything special or celebrating, so there's that. Celebrating is rubbing salt in the wound, makes everything 10 times worse. I thought I had decided to not kill myself for the immediate future but hell, my birthday coming up is making me question that. Like maybe not existing would just be easier ya know?? I don't fuckin know, sometimes I just kinda wish I was aborted as a fetus.
