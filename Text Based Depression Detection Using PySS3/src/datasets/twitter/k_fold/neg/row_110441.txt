Thinking of acquiring and ingesting poisonI don't have it yet, the poison I mean. But I'm planning on getting it. I've written a note explaining everything. I just feel hopeless and helpless. There's nothing I can do to fix my life situation. 

I'm currently unemployed. With no perspectives. I'm a fuck up. I graduated and I never got a job. And I never will at this point. Not v with this economy.

Also, my love life is a mess. I always fall for the wrong people. And when the right people show up, I'm not interested. Because I'm fucked up. I don't deserve love or understanding. I just need to go.

A friend just committed suicide recently as well. And I was supposed to have helped. But I wasn't able to. Anyway, I know exactly what he ingested. And I plan on to ingest the same.

I just can't live like this anymore.
