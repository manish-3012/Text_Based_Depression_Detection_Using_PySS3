I AM JUST DONE!!!!If you are truly not living anymore, but just existing.....then what's the point?  I understand that people will be sad, but let's be honest, they get over it and life goes on.  Isn't life supposed to be for the living?  If you are unhappy and see no way to change it and don't even want to change it.....then why is it so wrong to choose to be done??
