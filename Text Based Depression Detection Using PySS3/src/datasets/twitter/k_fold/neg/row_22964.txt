Tried to hang myself... here goes attempt #2I tried to hang myself last night but I wasn't strong enough. I met with a crisis worker instead who told me to wait the night. I did, but this morning when I woke I truly wished that I had died instead. Sometimes I feel like I'm too weak to keep on living, but not strong enough to just end it already. This has plagued me for so long. I feel like I can't do it anymore. I just want things to be over with.
