How do I bring up that I have suicidal thoughts to a therapist and not have to worry about being institutionalized?Most of the time I dont really take ths thoughts seriously, but I think they slowly are getting more serious whether I want it to or not. How would I bring this up with a therapist and not have to worry about being institutionalized? If I was forced into anything like that, I really worried that could make me feel like that whole process would be the last straw in a way.

Sorry for the extremely negative post in your day, but I didn't know where else to ask this. Something to note is I'm not this way right now so nothing to be concerned about.
