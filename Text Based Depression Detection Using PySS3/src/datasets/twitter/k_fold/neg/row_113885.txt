How does anybody deal with this?I feel like such a cunt. I have a good life. My family's cool and supportive, I have a couple close friends, and I'm well off in all regards. But I don't want to live. I don't want anything to live to be honest. Not just humans, but any and all forms of life. It's just a big, painful struggle to live long enough to reproduce. Why the hell do people live? For "fun"?? For "meaning"?? How can people go through their whole lives and not come to the logical conclusion that life is not worth living? Do they try to hide it with religion and hope? Camus said to rebel against the meaninglessness of it all, but I don't want to be a slave to the biological drive to keep living. I won't contribute to this painful cycle of life.
