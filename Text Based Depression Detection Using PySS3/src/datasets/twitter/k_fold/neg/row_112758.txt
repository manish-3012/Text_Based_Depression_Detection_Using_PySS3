The suicide note I intend to publicize on my Facebook.Don't ever cry about it, stop playing the victim. Do what you did last night, keep attacking me. Tell them it's all in my head, tell everyone how you know me better than myself. Tell them what you told me, that I'm less than human for being too tired to say good morning, that I'm not even me because of some unproven chemical imbalance, that I'm too incompetent to think for myself, that I'm too much of a burden to continue putting up with. Tell them how you just want to leave me here, that you want to go some place far away and forget that I exist. Tell them how you couldn't put up with me anymore, about how ready you were to kick me to the curb because of misperceived slights. Tell them it's my fault, it most definitely is but don't lie to them about how much you cared. Tell them how after everything I did to myself, you didn't for a second bother to consider it. How it all went out the window, the second you felt like the center of the universe. How you chocked it up as me being the villain.

 You want to tell me that you're done, that you're fed up, I've been trying to kill myself since I was fourteen. Despite all the overdoses, despite all the psych wards and treatment centers, despite jumping off a bridge and ruining my back, you continued to put me down and paint yourself as the victim, when all I did was mind my own business. You were the one always pushing me over the edge, and here we are again. 

You talk so much about getting rid of me, and for so long I tried to do it myself but I think I've finally found the way. I'm not a victim, victims don't find success in their suffering and that's what I'm about to do. I'm free, I'm motivated and pushed forward to the goal I've for so long chased. The goal I threw away my future in pursuit of. So thank you for finally helping me to realize how alone, misunderstood, and uncared for I truly am. I always knew that of the outside world but for some reason, I thought that despite everything, deep down inside my family was different. Thank you for helping me to better realize how much you too want me dead, like the other night when you told me to kill myself. Oh but she'll deny it. She'll lie through her teeth until even she no longer sees herself as culpable, just like she's always done, like the narcissist she is. I know the truth, that her true feelings slipped up, that all she could see was the positives in me not being here, that's she's sick of seeing me fail to go through with it. 

To my associates, you're only a witness. To my childhood friends, there's nothing you could have done. These days, I'm more terrified of friendship than prison. I never would've let you in anyway, we were always miles apart. That is, if you ever even care. 

I know what you're thinking: whatever, he's insane, an attention seeker, he just wants everyone to feel sorry for him, nobody cares, get over it. When it comes time to respect the dead, I want you to remember those thoughts. That before the sadness, before the sudden empathy, before you acted like you cared, what you felt was hate and anger. I want you to remember that, that you didn't care, and out of respect, you should quit acting like you ever did. Of course, I'm only dreaming. Because all that matters when people look at you, is that you weren't wrong.
