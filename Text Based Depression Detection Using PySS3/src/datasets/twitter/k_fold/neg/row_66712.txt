Posting this feels selfishTyping anything at all just feels selfish. All I wanted to do was live a stupid life but it's all selfish ambitions attacking other selfish ambitions. Even wanting to die is now selfish. I tried to cry and guess what? Just selfish and self loathing. It doesn't count. It's just a bunch of fake tears and pain so the world will look at me. It never has looked and that should be fine. I keep trying this and that but it's all pointless. Look up, trip on that. Look down, shit from the sky. Look left, slapped on the right. Look right, slapped on the left. School? Yeah guess what? Covid DESTROYED that ambition. Selfish as it was. You can't be a fine arts major and not CREATE FINE ART. I don't have a studio in my bedroom unfortunately. Learn some yoga and mediation. Guess what? Family offended and masses confused! WTF is this guy doing? Is he a satanist now? Great. How about that music hobby. FUCK YOU that's what about the music hobby. I'm a fucking joke with everything I do and nothing ever amounts to anything that matters. My family is JOYOUS without me in their lives and my Partner seems to think that I just need to fix my mindset and get the fuck over it already. Sweet. Lemme do that right quick.
