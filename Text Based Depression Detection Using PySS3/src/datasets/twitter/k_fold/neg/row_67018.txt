My friends make me want to kill myselfI was hanging out with two of my friends with one of my friends dog and I decided to run with the dog then I could just hear my friends laughing at me because of my run and they started imitating it which really made me feel so insecure. They do this a load of times whenever I go on a walk with them, they're either making fun of my walk, run etc. I tried to commit suicide a few times but stopped because of fear and guilt because another friend of mine lost someone recently due to suicide... Please tell me what should I do? I told my parents only about the part where my friends laugh at my run etc and they tell me I have a normal run.
