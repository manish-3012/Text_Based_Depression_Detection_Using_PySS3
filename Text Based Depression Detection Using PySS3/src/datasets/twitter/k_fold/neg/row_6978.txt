My friend tried to kill herself last nightI just don't know what to do, or what I should expect. I didn't follow the ambulance to the hospital because her family and one of her long-time friends were going to be there with her. I've only known her for a few months so I wasn't sure if I she would want me there and I didn't want to impose. I contacted her aunt,  who said she wasn't allowed to see anyone,  and that she would keep me updated. I assume that means she can't use her phone or anything either,  so I haven't tried contacting her because I don't know who is holding on to her phone at the moment. I don't really have anyone else to talk to because some of my friends are understanding,  but don't have experience with a situation like this/don't know her,  while the others don't really like her/seem not to care very much. My family hasn't had much to say on the matter either. I'm just really worried and waiting for her aunt to contact me is tearing me up inside. I guess I'm wondering how long the hospital will keep her,  and what to expect if I am able to go see her. Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit, I'm not sure where to post it
