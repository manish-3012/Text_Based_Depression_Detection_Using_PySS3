nothing's wrong. but I still have the urge to hurt myselfthis happens all the time. I just got on new meds and I feel exactly the same as I did on the old ones. everything's fine. but I hate getting up in the mornings because I'm afraid. and I'd rather sleep than do anything.

i guess maybe it's something to do with my mother. I live with her. whatever I do there's always something I fuck up when I just want to make her happy. she's been through so much and I love her but there is no pleasing her. 

and of course I'll never be a man because of the set of genitals I was born with. and no one will ever see me as one. 

but life's fine. things are a ok and I still have an urge all the time late at night to just end it.

at this point my mother thinks I'm doing this for attention because of how often I get to this point. but it's real. I have great friends and a huge support network but nothing helps and this feeling will always plague me.
