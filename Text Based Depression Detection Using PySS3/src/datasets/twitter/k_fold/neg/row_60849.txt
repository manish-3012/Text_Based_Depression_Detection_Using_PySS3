My friend says if she doesnâ€™t pass her nursing test in two days, sheâ€™ll kill herself. She already has the pills.Iâ€™ve talked to and comforted her about her mental health in the past. She recently got into therapy and started taking medication, which I thought was a good sign. But we were supposed to play DND today with our other friends, yet she isnâ€™t coming. She has left our Facebook chat and has personally messaged me to lie about her to the others, saying sheâ€™s said bad things about them. She said that it would make our friends less sad if she kills herself. I started messaging her back and comforting her as I have done in the past when she isolates herself (this past year she moved back upstate to start commuting and has left the group chat before). And then she said that, if she fails her big nursing test on Tuesday she will certainly kill herself. She claims to already have the pills lined up. I asked her to please not hurt herself, but she didnâ€™t directly respond to that plea. What should I do? 

TLDR: Friend has history of isolating self during moments of extreme depression and is going to hurt herself if she doesnâ€™t perform well on this critical test in two days. I donâ€™t know what to say/do.
