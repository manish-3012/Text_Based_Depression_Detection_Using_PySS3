I need someone to know how miserable I am, but I'm damn sure not going to say anything.I'm miserable, and right now, the plan for me is to ace my finals, head down to the little gun shop in my town, purchase a shotgun, and paint the walls of my apartment with my brains. No note, no warnings, no clear motive, no nothing, just fuck it. I'm taking the 12 gauge exit path.

I don't really want to do that, but I'm just so fucking done.

I really need someone close to me to help me. But I'm not going to say anything to them. Not my therapist, not my family, not my friends. I can't.

Why? Because they're going to ask for a reason I feel like I do. And I can't feel like my reasons are valid, and because of that, I am afraid that they'll look down on me or pity me for feeling the way that I do, and for the reasons that I do. I can't have that. I'd rather die. 

I hate pity. I hate sympathy. I hate being looked down upon. If you pity me, fuck you. If you feel sorry for me, fuck you. If you look down on me, fuck you.

Sure, they probably wouldn't look down on me or pity me, but I can't be sure of exactly how they'll react. So I say nothing.
