Why am I trying.
Hello. I wrote a poem called "Why am I Trying"

Thought you all would want to hear it. If it doesn't rhyme, it's really not suppose to. K. Enjoy

Why am I trying, if I'm holding onto nothing?

Why am I crying, if I don't feel sorrow?

Why am I in pain, if I'm so numb?

Why am I smiling, if I'm thinking of a rope?

Why am I caring, if I don't have hope?

Why am I trying, if I'm ready to jump?

Hope you liked it. Bye
