no logic in thisI am the black sheep from a family of high achievers. I am alone every day. Yes I do go to work but I'm the boss of a team. There is this invisible barrier to making friends with coworkers. It is frustrating to spend all day with people,  witnessing them having more detailed/animate conversations with each other then they have ever had with me. Yes I have tried inviting them to hangout, and a few times people actually showed up; yet I am never included in their weekend plans, etc. I only receive a personal call about once a week (from my father). I live alone, and due to current financial circumstances I am hesitant to uproot. In January my partner left, ending a 2 year relationship. It is what it is. 
 These last few months I have been working on myself; got a promotion, pushed myself to be social, attended 5 therapy sessions, got medicated, did CBT, etc. And despite all my efforts I am no further ahead psychologically. I've tried to get out dating again. Lots of phone numbers, tinder convos, snaps. Never an in person meeting. Some have ghosted from text conversations, like "wtf please reply" *(of course I wouldn't type that irl). I've even started to open up to 'friends' about this depression. (not my first major depressive episode. Maybe I've just been depressed constantly, but at a lower intensity?)... people dont like seeing weakness. After mentioning suicidal thoughts, I had one 'friend' yell at me "don't ever  talk like that to me again". So I just can't shake the idea that nobody will be impacted in their day-to-day by my exit. Yes, a few people will be sad but not many would show to my funeral. Even less would remember 6 months later. It wont get better for me. As Darwin would say 'Nature has selected me out of existence'. I am ashamed for failing to reach my 'full potential'.
