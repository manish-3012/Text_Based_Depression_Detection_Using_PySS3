Why am I so obsessed with suicide if I'm too afraid to do anything?For nearly a decade, I've been constantly thinking about it. It feels like its my ultimate goal in life. Whenever the opportunity to kill myself arises, I never go through with it though. 


I know that some people say that the reason I do this is because some part of me wants to live. That may be true, I'm not really so sure. That doesn't explain my obsession with it though.
