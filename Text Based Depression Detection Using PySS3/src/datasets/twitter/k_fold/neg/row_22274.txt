Your post history and comment replies can (possibly) show you how your mental health is day by day. What are some habits you've noticed you do that can show the same information?First off, not suicidal at the moment, but I feel a conversation about habits and how they can show you how your mental health is day by day is something interesting I've noticed about my own profile.

So I wanted to ask the SW community, what are some habits you've noticed that can hint at your mental health as days go by? Whether it's online, in person, or in your head? What do you do to improve? Do you want to improve? Do you do these habits for a reason? Do you feel like these habits are permanent? What do you do, or try to do, to try and fight these habits or change the behavior? If you don't or feel you can't, is there anything the SW community can do to try to improve or help your routines?

Of course, I am no one special, I don't ask these questions to pry, or try and bleed information from people. I feel that every so often talking, venting, or ranting can help just get the thoughts out. To see if someone has a different perspective on things.

I'm sorry if a post like this isn't allowed. But it was something I noticed and thought a good conversation about such things might help people out.
