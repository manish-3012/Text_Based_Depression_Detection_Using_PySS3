Even if itâ€™ll never be good itâ€™ll get better and maybe thatâ€™s enough?I (28F) tried to kill myself at 25 when I had a quarter life crisis. Iâ€™m very lucky because Iâ€™m surrounded by good people I love but I couldnâ€™t help but feel like I was beneath all them or that no one ever loves me as much as I love them. 

I know objectively I have a good life even with prior trauma. Itâ€™s been very good and Iâ€™m grateful. But Iâ€™ve been battling depression for all my adult life and then some. Iâ€™m so very exhausted. 

Iâ€™ve been hospitalized, on medicine, in therapy with 3 different providers and I believe itâ€™s all helped. I think the key is hope and wanting to get better. Misery loves itself. I tell myself to stop being willful and approach life and treatment with willingness to try things that may help even if they ultimately fail. I have gotten a lot better so you please hang in there. 

But life is still so so sooo very hard; Iâ€™m so sick of it. I want to be at peace for a sustainable amount of time like normal people; Iâ€™m not. 

I am so lucky in many social ways but I am a romantic failure. And if though Iâ€™ve gotten better and have a decent sense of self, it antagonizes me to my core. My boyfriend of 4 months (miracle I was even in a relationship) broke up with me yesterday. Heâ€™s a good man and I know inside Iâ€™ll be okay. But that and the uncertainty of graduate school which Iâ€™m applying to at the moment is killing me. I want to start a family more than I want to go back to school even if school and career goes well to me. 

I wish I were dead. I wish small things didnâ€™t bother me. I wish I could accept things that I objectively know but donâ€™t feel. Instead I want to die all the time. I want to stop wishing I were dead because on the inside I want to live a good, decent, peaceful life. But all I can think about, as better as things are, is wishing I would just drop dead. It just occurred to me maybe this is as good as itâ€™ll get and itâ€™s a lot better than attempting (Iâ€™m not attempting but just wish I were dead). Iâ€™ve come a long way and I have seconds of enjoying things like friends and movies. Maybe this is it; maybe Iâ€™ll always be plagued by desire to die but at least Iâ€™m a lot better even if not at â€œgoodâ€ and maybe thatâ€™s enough. 

Letâ€™s hang in here and fight for our right to peace even if every second we hope for death. Letâ€™s not try to die, letâ€™s spend every second trying and maybe enjoying the few things one can enjoy and love like a pet or crepes. Hold on to that while wishing for death and keep moving toward good be what may.
