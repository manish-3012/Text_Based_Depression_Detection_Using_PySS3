Last PostThis is my last post and i want to say thank you to who supported me .
I always knew i have never made for this life , i just wasn't made for it .  Despite the all of setbacks i have tried my best but still not enough 
Because of the loneliness and all of the Goddamn world hates me . I know iam not perfect but still ...
I just wanted to be loved , I just wanted to be loved by someone ... 
I just can't take it , even my family hates me and all of the person in my environment are fake  and Iam so untalented  to finish a university , can't find a jop .  I have stucked in this hell and don't know how to get out . I have tryied my best to become a good people , attracking positive people in my life but always negative people finds me ...
I don't have a future , i don't think i will be able to become fully myself , finding true love or have a child . I feel so worthless and unloved i don't think it will worth to stay in this hell .
I didn't made for this world , i am tired of becoming others voodoo doll .  I can't wait to finish it but when i do bye cruel world ...
