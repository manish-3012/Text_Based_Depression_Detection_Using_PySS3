TW/self harmIâ€™m three years clean from self harm but I want more than anything to just do it again. Iâ€™m 22, married but I got covid in June and was out of work for two months and my husband just lost his job as we moved into our own place together. We are newly weds and now I donâ€™t know how we are going to pay our rent this month. I thought about putting my cashapp in here and asking for even a dollar to help but morally that doesnâ€™t feel right. Iâ€™m beyond stressed, my hair is falling out and I canâ€™t eat or drink. I havenâ€™t been getting more than three hours of sleep a night because Iâ€™m constantly worrying. I just had to spend 100$ to get my cat medicine and that set us back so far..Iâ€™m overwhelmed beyond compare and I just need to get rid of the emotional pain. C*tting helps relieve that a little but I canâ€™t do it because my husband will see it. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore.
