even in my dream, i thought of killing myselfit felt like i was having one of those heavy days, but now the weight couldn't be ignored. i couldnt distract my way out of it, my chest felt heavy, my limbs couldn't help me and i just looked down.

i was looking for a way to hide for the end of the day from all of the people to finally end it, but i was in a fairly crowded place.

i could see the edge, i felt like jumping. i saw her, and i swear she ignored me. i couldn't do that though but i carefully observed the place for the best part to do it.

somebody offered me sleep medicine, and i spit out my first cup but drank more. suddenly, she went near and held me.

it's fake. she just doesnt want to be caught being in the same place and not doing anything and i dont want to settle for lies.

im awake, and my limbs hurt as if it carried on grom my dream. i feel the heaviness enveloping me, it holds me more than the people id rather have holding me.

i accidentally gave myself a wound recently with a knife while i was cooking, and ive been wanting to do it on purpose. this doesn't help.

i hope my dream will be better tomorrow.
