Every little thing makes me wanna dieIâ€™ve been wanting to die every day nonstop for the past several months even tho Iâ€™ve been working with my counselor. I had to get her to fill out some forms for my academic concession I sent her before our appointment. We took the entire hour filling out the forms (it was two pages) and didnâ€™t get to discuss anything. I felt pretty stupid and shitty that I just paid $200 out of pocket for no therapy and just to fill out forms. I went to r/talktherapy and asked about it and the person who responded was rly passive aggressive. And I just felt so hurt reading it. A dumb comment from a random internet stranger. Iâ€™m so useless that even text from an anonymous nameless faceless person Iâ€™ll never meet just makes me wanna die.
