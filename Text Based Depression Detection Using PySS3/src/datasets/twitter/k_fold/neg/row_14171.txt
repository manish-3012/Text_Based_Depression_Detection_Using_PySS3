OK, so I tried hanging myself...... and it didn't work. No matter how much pressure I try to put on my arteries, all I feel is the explosive head sensation, but won't black out. Wtf? The one thing I want in life and I can't accomplish it? But I gotta say, it feels peaceful to do this, maybe if I keep trying, one time I'll get the right spot.

This is what my whole life has been building up to. This is my destiny. I can feel it.
