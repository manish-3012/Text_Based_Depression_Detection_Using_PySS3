idk what i am doingI have reached the lowest point in my life right now. I can't live any longer, and every day that I stay alive is nothing short of torture. I wish every single day of my life now that I wasn't born, that I just ceased to exist. I have no one around me that I can talk with, and there are so many things stuffed in my mind that they are eating me from inside. I can't release them, because that will overwhelm me so much that I will take a drastic step. I really wish that I had someone who could understand me, understand my situation, help me with life, but I don't have anyone. No friends, nothing. Contemplating suicide is something that I have done a lot of times, even attempted it twice but failed both times due to basic human instincts kicking in at the last moment. If each day is so painful, full of torture and nothing but meaningless existence, isn't it better to just end everything ? I can even see physical effects of this mental torture coming into place, I can't sleep, my appetite has reduced drastically . I really need a quick way out, please help me. Please someone help me, please.
