I wish I was making this upYesterday I tried my best for maybe the 50th time in my life to be as honest about what Iâ€™ve been going through with my mom. As usual i got the usual bible-thumping, praying, and what-Iâ€™d-like-to-hear response. Even though her response was the same as it is with any other problem Iâ€™ve encountered I think she finally understood a little bit more of what was going on. I donâ€™t think it comes from me repeating myself trying to get her to understand but the progression of the emptiness I feel. 

With all of that being said, today my mother told me she knows how Kobe Bryantâ€™s mother feels. I thought it odd at first why she would say that. Yes sheâ€™s a mother but none of her children have died. Then she told me that I shouldnâ€™t give up or feel so hopeless. I wouldâ€™ve thought that this comment would have been significant enough to be a wake up call before. Honestly, i found it a bit humorous because Iâ€™m not surprised she would feel that way, Iâ€™ve felt dead for several months. 

On a final and different note, as a person who used to have a burning passion for basketball growing up I feel terrible about the death of Kobe Bryant. Being one of the most memorable figures and inspirations of my childhood I hope his family is doing well.  Iâ€™m sure itâ€™s not helpful to think that someone who had such a fire for life has it cut short when someone like me must continue to stain the earth.
