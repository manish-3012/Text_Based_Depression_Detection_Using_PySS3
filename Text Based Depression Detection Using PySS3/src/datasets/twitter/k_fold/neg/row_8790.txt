Maybe I'll finally do it on my birthday...It's been a long time coming. The only thing that's kept me from "pulling the trigger" is that thought in the back of my mind that maybe just MAYBE one day I'll finally be able to get over this hurdle that is my anxiety and depression. Maybe I'll be able to forgive myself for pushing away the only woman who ever loved me and find someone new. Maybe my parents will stop hating me for no reason and stop treating me like a burden. This has been going on since I was 16, I'm about to be 21 in a few days and absolutely nothing has changed. No matter how hard I try everything always falls apart. Every time I decide to end it I back out with high hopes but things just end up getting worse. Maybe I'll finally do it on my birthday. 

I'm not looking for help, I just wanted to write something out and have someone read it because I have nobody in my real life that would care.
