I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with meFor the past 3 years my mental state has been slowly declining and I donâ€™t know what to do Iâ€™m only 17. Every day I wake up feels the same. First thing that happens is I notice that I donâ€™t feel real and everything around me seems like itâ€™s fake. Iâ€™ve been having derealization for years and it just gets worse no matter what I do. My biggest fear is being alone because I canâ€™t hold myself together and I need other people to help me because Iâ€™m weak but now the only two people live for donâ€™t even want to see me. The only reason I keep living is because of them and they always tell me how bad it would be if I killed myself but they donâ€™t even want to be around me. Itâ€™s all my fault though because I constantly push people away and act like a fool.

I feel like I canâ€™t explain how I feel. I donâ€™t know how to talk to people and it just drives me crazy. All I do is sleep because thatâ€™s the only time I donâ€™t feel like shit. I feel like I am completely useless and nothing I do matters because my life is going to end up the same anyway. I feel like I donâ€™t make any sense when I talk and my mind just seems to wander all day every day. My thoughts seem to trail off and not really feel connected at times and I feel like Iâ€™m going completely insane and Iâ€™m sick of it. I always ask why am I like this why canâ€™t I just be fucking normal. Iâ€™m not sure I want to live if I canâ€™t live a normal life.

My dad killed himself 3 years ago. Thatâ€™s when all this bullshit started. I feel like he was carrying the burden of living for his children and he gave up so now I have to carry that burden and live for my siblings even though I just want this fucking nightmare to be over.
