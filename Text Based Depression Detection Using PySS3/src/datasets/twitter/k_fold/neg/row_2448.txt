I want someone to hear me, but I have nothing to sayEven if I am constantly experiencing new things, from work come to another part time job I feel like I am not improving socially or intelectually even if I am around people all the time. I am stuck and after end of each day I fall into hard despair.

What I am doing wrong? I am just stupid with only high self realization thanks to internet? Is something wrong with my attitude? 

Thank you for your reply.
