I am going to kill myself this yearThere is literally nothing in life for me that's worth living for. I am completely useless and lonely and will be in the future, too. I've never done anything I could be proud of or that would make my future seem any brighter. I am just a sad, pathetic parasite.

I'm going to get a firearm. Or look for trains between my city and the next one over. I don't care about the pain anymore. I just want out of my misery.
