I don't know what to do.It's been too long since I've felt truely happy in life. I'm decent at things, classes, a sport, hobbys, but never good enough. Just mediocre, better than an average person, but not good enough to be considered for the sports team, to be wanted as a first choice as a date, etc. 

Thoughts consume me. When I don't think about anything at all, my mind idles to thoughts of just not being alone, having someone there to wrap my arms around and such. And yet I can't seem to soothe or complete those thoughts.

I can't sleep without pills, and even then it's still a struggle. Trying to find something to just turn my mind off and get rid of the thoughts that are destryoing me enough to doze off to bed. 

I'm failing out of my classes, and while I have a job lined up for me in a few months after this semester, I just don't have the will. I don't want it to be like this and yet it's just too much of a struggle. I'm tired of being alone and not having anything to deal with. When I'm alone and can't sleep and can't find anyone to talk to, I get consumed with these thoughts of dying. 

I've tried a couple of counselors through my school ,and they haven't worked at all. I don't know what else to do about it.
