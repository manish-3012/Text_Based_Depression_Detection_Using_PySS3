if this lockdown lasts all year I'm killing myselfI did a year as a shut in with no friends and no connections outside of my home back in 2012 and it was one of the most painful things I've ever been through, it messed me up to the point where I still have trouble being around people today, so much so that I can't do it again, in fact I won't, I need it to be over soon or I'm taking the easy way out, I'd rather go out on my own terms than be forced to do this all over again
