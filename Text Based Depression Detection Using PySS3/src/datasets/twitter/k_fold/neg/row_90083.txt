i hate that i cant pretend im fineif i could pretend im ok for just a day i might get happier. i feel like talking about how shit i feel just drags my friend down, and hes been through so much worse shit than me and yet of course i have to feel horrible and tell him stupid shit, theres so much nice shit i could say to make him feel better and i cant even say it. for the past few months ive been feeling extra shitty, im 16 which makes me feel too young and too old at the same time, i havenâ€™t got any hobbies or anything, ive been smoking a lot more recently which just means im wasting more if my moms money, i do nothing all day and im shit at everything, nothing much has changed after quarantine since i dropped out of school when i was 13 so ive basically just stayed home since then, i dont have any irl friends and im worried that if we eventually move out of this town things wont get better like i hope, and ill be too socially inept to make friends. It makes me hate myself and everything more when i think about how my friend has tried to kill himself, but someone like me cant even try to do it. The closest ive came to killing myself was a few days ago, (i got fairly drunk but i think it was mainly me trying to seem drunk so i could actually be fun to talk to) idk what exactly set me off but i felt like shit, i was messaging my friend a lot and telling him some of the shit i want him to know and how hes the best thing thats happened to me in a long long time, i had some pills which if i took enough id definitely die, but knowing my luck id probably just feel like shit and worry the fuck out of my mom, i obviously didnt end up taking them so i just smoked for a bit and threw up a lot. What worries me the most is that a situation similar to that has been happening repeatedly for the past fee months, something stupid makes me feel like shit (usually me overthinking or being stupid) ill get drunk and smoke for a bit, say some stuff to my friend, feel a lot better after talking to him, go to sleep and boom, as soon as i wake up something else will happen to repeat it. idk if any of what i said made sense, i dont really care if anyone reads it i just needed to say it somewhere.
