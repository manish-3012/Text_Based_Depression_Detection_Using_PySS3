I look forward to dying. I'm ready to end it. I've tried reaching out for help. I've tried improving my life by attempting to go back to school. I've made my way from North Carolina to Washington state looking for a job that would allow me to pay my bills and let me set a little aside for a rainy day. For the past 15 years I've been talking to therapists and been drugged up in an attempt to force me to just accept life for what it is. I'm tired of the way things always turn out. I'm tired of starting over just to hit the same road blocks over and over again. I'm tired of talking about. Venting doesn't help. I need a solution and the only viable solution is killing myself. I've been toying with this idea for 10 years now. Friday it really hit me hard that no one will be able to help me. I tried reaching out online and there were no real solutions. It seems like people approach the problems I have just like I would if this was 15 years ago when all this started. I wouldn't expect anything different really. I've some how fucked myself over so bad, that there will be no advancement in my life. Life isn't for everyone. Even if there was a way to fix everything, I'm at a point now where there would be no way of saving enough so that I could retire one day. If anything serious happened I couldn't afford to fix it. There are teenagers out there that have so much more resources than I have at their disposal. I can't even afford to get my vision fixed in my left eye. 

If things were better / normal I would want to stay in this life, but since even the most basic of things are too hard to get I think I'm going to end it all tonight. 

I just don't want to compete anymore. I'm just happy that I can kill myself so I can end this right now. At least there's some kind of control for me.
