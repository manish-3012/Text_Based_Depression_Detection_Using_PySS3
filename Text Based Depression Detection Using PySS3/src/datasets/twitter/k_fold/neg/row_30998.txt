I gave upI really tried but I can't stand it anymore, working in a job I hate from the bottom of my heart just so I can survive, I have no life, I'm tired all the time because I'm not sleeping - because I don't want to sleep - because I'm wasting half of my day at that fucking shithole so I want to be up as long as I can when I'm at home, I'm trying to come up with something for months, I want to quit that job but nothing, no opportunities, no ideas, nothing, I'm done I'm supposed to wake up in less than 2 hours and go there again and waste 8 hours of my day there, for less than 500â‚¬ per month

see you on the flip side
