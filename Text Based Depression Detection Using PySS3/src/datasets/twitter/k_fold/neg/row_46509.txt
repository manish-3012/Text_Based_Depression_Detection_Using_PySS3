Worst panic attack of my lifeI had the worst panic attack last night and it lasted over an hour before I started to barely settle down. I couldnâ€™t breath or talk and today Iâ€™m just done. I have chronic and mental illness and it hurts so bad all the time. I just want it to be over. I can barely walk or talk today, Iâ€™m just so sluggy. I want it to be over Iâ€™m sorry :(
