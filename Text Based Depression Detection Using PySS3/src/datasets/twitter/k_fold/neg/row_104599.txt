everyone just wants me gonehell, i even posted here and no one replied. the friend i was talking to just stopped talking to me too. my family seemed to be in a rush to get rid of me back at college. now i'm all alone, and all the things i'll miss out on don't bother me. i don't know why i'm posting again, i guess because typing is making me less shaky. maybe i want one reason not to do it, but i don't think i'll find one anymore.
