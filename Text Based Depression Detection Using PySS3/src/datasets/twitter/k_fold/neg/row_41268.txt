Is it weird that sometimes I'm suicidal as hell and sometimes I don't think about it at allOn some days that I reall am suicidal to the point that I stepped out my balcony and ready to jump or had both hands full of pills and ready to swallow it. But some days I really don't think about it like it's never been in my head. It's like episode that comes and goes really randomly.
