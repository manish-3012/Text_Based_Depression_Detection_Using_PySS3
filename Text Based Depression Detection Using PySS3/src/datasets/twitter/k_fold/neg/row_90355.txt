i donâ€™t know who will read thisI have completely given up. i am going to do it tonight. i finished getting everything that i need for it as well. I canâ€™t stand that i exist, i hate myself with everything iâ€™ve got. I just donâ€™t want to keep on going anymore. i am such a disappointment and have let down everyone whom once depended on me. i donâ€™t care anymore, i feel empty in the inside as it is, in just wasting energy being here. iâ€™ll only be a memory in a couple of months and nothing more, i just got tired of crying, tired of being stressed, ive lost most of my hair due to it and that only depressed me more. iâ€™m done.
