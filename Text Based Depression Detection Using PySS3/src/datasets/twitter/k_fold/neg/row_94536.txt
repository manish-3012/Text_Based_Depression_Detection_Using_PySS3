Iâ€™m about to hang my self. I will never be a doctorIâ€™m about to hang myself.

I am about to commit.

Iâ€™m about to commit the act of dropping out I canâ€™t take this shit anymore. 

Iâ€™ve been struggling in chem 125 this whole semester and I feel like a dumb ass who canâ€™t do ANYTHING correct. Save your insults, Iâ€™ve used worse and harsh critiques on myself. My grade in the class surely reflects it too. 
*chem 125â€“intro/general chemistry lab*
Could someone who has had the course or currently has it help me? Please. I am in the brink of just giving up on my education I am a fucking retard in the class and I know people shit talk me. I deserve it. 

Please. Iâ€™m not asking for answers. Just asking for simple concepts on things so I can apply them to my late work. I looked up countless YouTube videos and the lecture videos for some reason arenâ€™t clicking for me. I am a fucking retard how did I even get here.

Could someone please help with simple 2D excel plotting that involves Absorbance/Concentration/Mathematical equation of a line/regression factor?? 

THIS WAS OUR VERY FUCKING FIRST ASSIGNMENT IN SEPTEMBER AND I STILL NEED HELP. MY TEACHER REFUSES TO HELP ME. PLEASE. I AN ABOUT TO DIE. Please. I will even pay if I have to.
