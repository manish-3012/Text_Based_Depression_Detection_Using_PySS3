Its not killing myselfIts comming on winter in Australia, the weather has turned shit

If i walk out my house into the bush wearing basically nothing warm then the elements get me and its not suicide!
I hurt all in my life like a small handful,  but my gf will be scarred to point if no return!

Been to Prof help and been on meds, no help

43 yo and ment to know better

Wtf why am i like this

Wanted death since 8 yo

No job, trying to train to be teachers assistant

How can i help kids if im like this?
