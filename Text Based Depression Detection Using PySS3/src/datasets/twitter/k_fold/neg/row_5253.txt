HELPIve been extremely depressed for nearly three years. I almost dropped out of highschool, but I managed to get into an alternative program, and I'm supposed to graduate this winter, 'only' a semester later than I should have. I had intelligence and so much potential, but it's all gone now. Just someone talk to me please, because I don't really want to die
