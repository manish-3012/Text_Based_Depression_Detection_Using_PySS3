I'm close to having a mental breakdownMy feet are cold, I can't stop rocking myself back and forth, I feel very nervous, I'm shaking, I feel like my throat is dry and everything I've ever believed is shattering...

Today I found out the truth, or, a possible truth of humanity.

Utility.

Some people were born to dominate, or to use others, and some, like me, were born to be dominated or to be used.

The realization yesterday was so strong that I relapsed in self-harm...

Everything makes sense now, how I've always been used and then discarded.

I'm a broken tool.

I served my purpouse, and now that I'm not needed anymore, I was forgotten...

Fuck... It's just too much to bear or digest...
