Dreaming of suicideMy suicidal thoughts have been very bad lately, but I had a dream about hanging myself last night. I always dream in the third person, so I saw myself hanging in a completely white area with a chair to the ground. It looked extremely odd. It felt sad and cold and pathetic. Oddly enough, I looked like a man in my dream as well. I point this out since I'm a trans boy, but I am fifteen and completely in the closet and usually dream as a girl, so it was weird. It's been the only time I didn't feel happy dreaming as a man. Most of my suicidal thoughts come from the fact I'm a closeted trans boy and can't transition now. 

Wowzers. Until now, I didn't realize the connection of my dream dreaming myself as a man and having me commit suicide. It was to show that I want to die immensely because I can't be that man yet. Holy shit. My mind is being deep again.

 I just thought I would post something different here because why not and I don't know a better place to post this other then here.
