I didn't kill myself today, and it's because of this community right here. Thank you.I suffer from pre-menstrual dysmorphic disorder (PMDD), and one of my most frightening symptoms is an urge to commit suicide. Every month for one or two days I am intensely depressed and paralyzed by suicidal ideation. Today I didn't even feel safe running an errand because I was afraid I would turn my car into oncoming traffic.

So I stayed in bed, and read reddit. Honestly, I just lay there, still as a rock, except for my browsing fingers. Have you ever been so depressed that you just slow down into stillness and become like a rock? That was me today. I could not muster up the energy to write this post a few hours ago. But I could click and page through other posts and pretend the responses were aimed at me. It helped tremendously.

Thank you.

On the one hand, I have hope. These episodes stop immediately when my period actually starts, but I know the suicidal ideation and urges will return like clockwork next month, and every month.
