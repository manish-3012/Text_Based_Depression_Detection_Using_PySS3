I would like to dieI want to die. There isn't any hope for me and I want a shotgun in my mouth. I can't regret killing myself because there's nothing good in my life and things aren't getting better. Nobody could ever love me unconditionally or conditionally and nobody wants to be my friend. All I really have are acquaintances. I work in a prison where I wouldn't mind getting shanked a few times. I keep bashing my head on the wall every other week hoping that my head will fill up with blood and that I'll die. I can't even get my driver license because there's nobody who will help me enough. I'm gaslighted into believing that I'm such a terrible person. I've submitted myself to the hospital twice for feeling suicidal. I came home and I had every part of my bedroom gone through. Even my underwear were touched. My mother made fun of me by saying that she just needs a vacation too. Could I have some advice on how to get the things I need to die without anyone suspecting about what I'm going to do? And since I don't have a license and it's illegal to carry on public transportation...
