Today was it for meMy heart is broken beyond all measure. When i'm not laying awake all night i'm pondering the most painless death. I want to leave letters for my family and my loved ones, but would they even care? My fiance will move on, and in death she'll still be with someone else which breaks my heart even more. There was a point when she couldn't live without me, and like most men I took her love and everything she was for granted. She was my success in life, I wish I could have learned this sooner. The lump in my throat is constant as I call and hangup on suicide prevention centers. I want to call her but I can't, I want to email her but I can't. I can't breathe I can't eat, I can't sleep. I dont want to spend the rest of my years longing for her, I've already spent enough time losing her. I just dont wan't to be here without her. I cant, and I dont want to try. I'm sick from all the cigarettes i keep smoking and the random pills im taking to numb myself enough to do this. I'm going to make sure this is successful because I don't want to be comforted for an "attempt" at taking my life. I feel as though only in death will she ever feel anything for me. At least she will be in love with my memory, and I won't have years of memories without her. All of my memories will be of us together. God bless and thank you for giving me some place to make my peace
