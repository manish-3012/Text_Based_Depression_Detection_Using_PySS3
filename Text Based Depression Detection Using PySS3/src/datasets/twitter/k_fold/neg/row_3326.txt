Confused and emptyI think getting some of this off my chest might help, but im not exactly sure. I am scared of what i might do, i dont want to die or hurt myself. 
I admit i have had a bumpy past, most of my childhood/teenage years were really bad. Its taken awhile to get past a few problems of my past (parental abuse, sexual assult) but at this point i want to say my life is good. From looking at it on the outside it is honestly a good life from what ive had. But im not happy, i feel alone and like i dont matter to anyone. I dont have any friends, and im fine with that. Ive always had a hard time making them and its just easier not to bother. but its a different type of alone i feel right now.
I get really depressed and upset, i have hurt myself a few times over the past year but after i do it i realize i dont want that. Its been more and more frequent lately. I dont know why i feel like this im really confused. I dont know what to do anymore. I really want to be happy and enjoy the life i have now, can anyone help me or know something i can do? Please.
