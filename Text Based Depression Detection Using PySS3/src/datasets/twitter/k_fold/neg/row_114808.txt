wild mood swingsI am in my late 30s. I found out last year that I have a progressive neurological disease.  It's genetic and mild enough and obscure enough that it doesn't have a huge public image.  It doesn't ever affect the brain. So far I'm getting chronic pain and muscle wasting in my feet and, to a lesser degree, my hands.

This problem has been hard to deal with on top of depression, anxiety and OCD.  I find myself obsessed with every dent and anticipating malfunctions everywhere. for instance now I fear for my speaking, even though that would be a rare complication.  

My GP saw the muscle wasting on the top of my feet last friday and was kind of spooked (after a year of being not that impressed). Watching people see that something really is wrong has been creepy.

anyway, I just have so much trouble tolerating this.  Every other day I just want to try to see if the Swiss suicide org would take me. I don't have one of the biggies but I do have a progressive neurological problem. Then I bounce back and am like, wtf, I'm still walking fine.  Then I go down again.  I don't even know what's the real me.

I do see a therapist but I keep feeling she's out of her depth because I have this weird physical issue she's never heard of before.
