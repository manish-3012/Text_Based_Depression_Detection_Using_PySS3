Just tried to kill myself.Had a mouth full of painkillers, decided to chew them to make them go down easier. Apparently chewed up painkillers taste terrible. Posting this as I think of a better way to kill myself. Might try mixing some more crushed up painkillers in a drink so I don't have to taste them. I don't really see a reason in trying anymore, this seems like the only way out.
