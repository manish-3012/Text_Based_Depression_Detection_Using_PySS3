I'm so tired of dealing with lifeI can't stop thinking that everyone would be better off with me gone. My family would have my life insurance money if I make it look like an accident, I don't think they would miss me or even notice I'm gone. This year has been so rough and don't see it getting better, there's only more pain ahead and I'm so tired of feeling like this.
