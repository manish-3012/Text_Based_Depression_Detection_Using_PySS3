I'm going to start running and just not stopOut the door now.  Threw keys into the trash, will smash phone and throw the pieces off a bridge when I'm done here.  Left wallet inside so I can't even buy food or water if and when I break down and get weak.

Going to run and run and run until I physically have to stop, or until a bus hits me, whatever comes first.  

Then I'm going to do it again.

And again.

And again.

Hoping it hurts.  Hoping it takes a long time.  Hoping I get raped and stabbed too.  Really hoping to get raped for the extra shame.  

Hope some big fat hairy fucking hillbilly just jumps out of the bushes and makes me squeal like a fucking pig and cuts my tendons when he leaves to go git Emmet &amp; Burt &amp; Mordechai &amp; Jededededediah &amp; Buford &amp; all his other brother-cousins to rape me some more, so I can't get away.  And they keep me alive in their hillbilly fuck-dungeon for *days* and barbecue me for the 4th.

Or a fucking bus hits me.

I'll take either.
