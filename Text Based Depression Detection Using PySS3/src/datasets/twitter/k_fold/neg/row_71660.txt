Why give someone that power over you?I haven't been here very long and yesterday was the first time I read and responded to a post of someone who said they had taken pills. it's been 22 hours and they've not been back, so, maybe they are gone. This person did this because of a boyfriend. I just realized something -- Why give someone else this kind of power, literally over your life and death? My depression isn't because of a lost love, but it is, mainly, because of someone who hates me and therefore, I need to ask myself the same question. Why, in God's name,  have I given the power of my happiness or sadness, my life or death to someone who hates me? Then I realized it's not just that, but whenever someone, anyone, aggravates me (cuts me off in traffic, or cuts in line at a store, even small things like that) I stew about it for days and get angrier and angrier. People who do things like that basically suck and their lives suck and they take the suckiness out on others and I'm going to fight like hell to not let anyone's suckiness ruin my life anymore. My new mantra is going to be, "Take back my power and stop giving it away to sucky people!" Hell, can't hurt and I've tried everything else so maybe it will help.
