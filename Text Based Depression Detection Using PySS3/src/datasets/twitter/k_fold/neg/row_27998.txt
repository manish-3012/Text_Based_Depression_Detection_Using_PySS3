Homeless soonI have nothing left in my life. My love left me, no friends or family, no money, nothing worth waking up for. I have no interest in even changing my clothes. I'm in thousands of dollars of debt. I've been strongly considering suicide. I tried the suicide hotline, and I know for a fact my best option is being homeless and trying to start over somewhere. I have no car, and I live in NY so being homeless in the winter is going to kill me anyways. My only hope is to walk south for thousands of miles so I don't freeze to death. I have no motivation to even live anymore. I hate that I have to work harder than everyone else just to fucking survive. I wish I was just born rich. I think I'm just going to shoot myself in the head tonight with my shotgun in the apartment I'm going to be evicted from soon. I fucking hate my life, I swear I exist just to suffer and be fucked with. Nothing ever works out for me, and I don't want to put vague hope into a shitty minimum wage future I don't fucking want.
