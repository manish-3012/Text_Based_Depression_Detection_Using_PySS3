Writing my note..Unfinished, thoughts?Suicide is something I have been giving a considerable amount of thought to as of late. If? How? What to leave behind and for whom. Notes and possessions, is that really all thatâ€™s left after it all?
What I do know is that this has all been hard for a long time, I am absolutely exhausted of life and when I really think about, I can trace it all back to when I was 14 or 15.

I know that after that moped accident, my mind does not work the same way that it used to. Early memories are not there, and while people tell me how intelligent I am, I know that I am not what I used to be. I donâ€™t have those warm and fuzzy childhood memories that people seem to have in shadowboxes in their minds. Were they ever there to begin with? I suppose itâ€™s only when you are older that you take time for that type of reflection and by then if you havenâ€™t taken a net to those memories, maybe they disappear?

Looking at how my relationships have evolved with, and perceptions have changed of my parents through the years, I honestly donâ€™t know what my childhood memories would look like. 

Mom, where are you? I donâ€™t find myself talking to other people about you that much and I honestly think itâ€™s because I donâ€™t know who you are. Were we ever that close? Why did you think that walking away from the marriage, meant walking away from everyone? You left because you â€œcouldnâ€™t take the abuseâ€ anymore, which I donâ€™t fully buy, but what did you think leaving me alone with him would do for me? Did you care? Anthony was sent to jail, dad was heartbroken, and I was alone. To this day, you never make the effort. I see TV shows and movies where the characters make such a fuss about their mother calling and â€œbotheringâ€ them all the time, but adverse to their reactions, all I can think is: what a luxury. I never hear from mine unless sheâ€™s moving and needs help carrying furniture.

Dad, I know that you did the best that you could. I do. Bipolar Disorder has been your white whale as long as I have known you and while there has been a fair amount of struggle between us over the years, I canâ€™t fault you for it. When mom left, it was just us and a few giant holes to fill in our lives and hearts. Anthony was in jail, losing his sanity, and there you and I wereâ€¦. Seemingly 2 strangers sitting in a house that felt empty for so many reasons. You retreated into yourself and then to Cindy, both of which I understand. If the woman that I loved for 20+ years decided to leave in a puff of smoke and not to reappear for months on end, I donâ€™t know what I would do.

I spent a lot of time alone in that house, sitting in that empty bedroom thinking about how it all went wrong. I was 15 and remember Mom talking about how important of a year it was supposed to be, and it turned out that she was right â€“if only in a way that she could never have imagined. That was the year that our family shattered.
