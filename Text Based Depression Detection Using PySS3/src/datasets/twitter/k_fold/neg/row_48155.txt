I wish I wasnâ€™t so damn scaredI wish I wasnâ€™t so damn scared to call it quits. I find myself wanting to end it but just fucking canâ€™t. I feel so selfish, like how lucky I am I can even sit on my phone in my comfortable bed and write this. I struggle with whats real and what isnâ€™t, what love is and what isnâ€™t. What truth is and what isnâ€™t. I feel like Iâ€™ve lost whoever I was meant to be and thereâ€™s no turning back. Iâ€™ve lost my fire, my soul, I wish the people around me were open and honest
