Got a DUIA few years ago I was fucked over by the Army hard. Reprisal got me kicked out and now I owe over $70,000. It really messed my life up and my mind. Recently, I went thru a breakup with my long time girlfriend. Now I got a DUI. I can't afford it and it practicality destroys all the plans I've had.

I'm a Christian and I have hope in God's plan, but it's looking pretty bleak. But at the same time, without my faith I would have bit the bullet a long time ago. This just really pushes it over the edge. I'm usually pretty resourceful and can usually work things out, but for the first time in my life, I don't see a way through... And that's terrifying. I'm not sure what to do.
