I need some helpHey guys. I've been a redditor for about a year now and have always heard good things about this sub. I'm using my side account for obvious reasons.

Recently my fiance (girlfriend of 5 years) has broken up with me. She says she has been unhappy for a long time and no longer loves. I'm taking it really hard.

I gave up a ton to be with her I even moved half way across the country to make her and her family happy. I try to do everything for here.

Last night was the first night in 5 years that she didnt fall asleep besides me and wasn't there when I woke in the morning. It took all I had not to down a bottle of pills and I don't know how I can make it with out her.

She was and I hope she still will be a huge part of my life. I still love her and even though we're avoiding each other being in the same house is difficult. I plan on moving back with my parents In Nova Scotia as soon as I can but for the interim im stuck here with her
