Better Be Reborn As a PetPet owners dont tell their pets: "Hey, you've grownup! TiMe to return what we spent on you WITH INTEREST." Its normal to have a gratitude to family but its a different matter when you're famioy SUCKED everything out of you. I cant even see a good future for me anymore. I told my mother yeas ago that if Im gonna file a loan in the bank, I better invest it on my dream business(trust me its gonna boom)or at least buy our own house. Then my mother told me we better spend it to my stupid brother so he wont experience my suffering in college where I didnt eat for DAYS to save my money for thesis.Then my fucking brother failed to graduate college trying to live it like its a fucking High School Musical WITH MY MOTHERFUCKING MONEY!!! FOR MY FUTURE!! MY MASTER'S DEGREE! FOR MY FIANCE! Now my fiance told me she's fed up with our lives and consider leaving since its really impossible to have our future, our dream life. Please dont be mad at her she's not a bitch. She accepted and loved me at my worst. Its just simply a fucking logical decision since if we force it, she'll just live with my fucking messed up life for the rest of her life and she dont deserve it. Actually, both of us see no future in our relationship anymore because of this.Fuck, I cant take this anymore. Ive been rehearsing lately. Trying to choke myself with a towel every night so I'll know how it feels. Fuck the wooden parts of our roof. Im too heavy to hang in my roof. I cant even afford to buy cheaper pills! Fuck!!!!
