I don't know what to doI have been locked in my house for 5 years. I'm turning 21. I haven't gone through high school, I have no friends, I have no job experience, and I am probably the most stupid and repulsive person alive. I have nothing anymore, and the only reason I'm trying to hold on is because I don't want my sister to live the rest of her life without her little sister. I just feel like I have reached a point where I just don't have any options that I can take to fix this. I was born wrong, my monstrous looks mixed with my complete lack of intelligence proves it. I have had on and off suicidal tendencies since age 8, but I always counted on growing up to be just like everyone else. It never happened, it kept getting worse and worse. I can barely take a shower and see my naked body, that's how disgusting I am. I'm so angry at being born as this, and I wish I at least was of average looks or intelligence. I could study like other people, get a job like other people, or if only the looks were okay I could at least make money by being a prostitute. But I'm stuck in this monster who has to be locked inside and there's nothing else I can do to fix it but kill it.

I really wish my only chance at existence didn't have to go this way. I'm worthless
