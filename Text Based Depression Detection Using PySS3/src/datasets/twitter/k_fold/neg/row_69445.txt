I feel unloved/hatedSo Iâ€™m a very extroverted kid, but Iâ€™m Rey depressed and lonely. I put on a facade for my family and friends acting happy because I know theyâ€™ll never understand. But today I feel like Iâ€™m gonna end it all, because my mother, the person who is literally half of me said â€œI hate youâ€, and â€œdonâ€™t talk to me.â€ How am I supposed to handle that? My dad, and my 2 sisters also donâ€™t like me. And youâ€™d think Iâ€™d have more friends in online games right? Wrong. Iâ€™m often called a fag, and a girl just because Iâ€™m  a pre-adolescent boy that sound like a 10 yr old girl. I often take lengths of rope lying around and I tie it around my neck just know what it would feel like. And it gives me clarity and closure. Everyone expects so much of me and yet I under preform by miles.
