My pseudo-content existenceThe thought had always lingered and i've never really acted on my thoughts as such without thinking them over. I've never given suicide the consideration it deserved. I understand there will be some who will call this post some sort of superficial statement by one radical thought i'd just received however it has been a thought i've paid attention to.  

I've always been considered to be well off; fed, clothed and sheltered. However there's always been this feeling of innate loneliness that i've felt all my life. When people ask what a full life encompasses i honestly don't know what to say. People assume that wealth and a humanistic approach to life makes one happy. I watched my father leave due to lust; starting when i was around 5 years old i would see him around once a year, even when his own world started to fall around him i would be the outlet to his anger. 

My mother has been relatively absent to my life, she spends her time with the others in my family as she believes they have more potential exceed in life then i ever had. 

By terms of school; my results have slowly decayed, i think as a result to gain some sort of attention, Pathetic right? I merely exist. I'm at wits end and honestly just wish my life away.
