BurdenI've tried alot.
Medical help, friends, changing place, Yoga and so on. 
Four psychotherapists, special clinic.

It's not getting better. Just worse.
I don't want to live like this and I'm a burden.
I love my parents, friends, colleagues and that's another reason for suicide - noone wants to endlessly try to help, even if noone wants to admit it.

I don't know why. I want a solution, an answer.
But it seems a lot like there is no solution, just lying in each others faces about being fine. 

My plan simple. I'll leave a note that will say something like 'don't worry, i'm alive. you know my condition very well, i need to leave my past behind. I'm sorry, goodbye'.
So, noone thinks that i'm dead, okay, now i'm going very far to find some lonely place where noone will find my body for alot of time.
