What a great way to start off the year.Cried myself to sleep last night, wasn't on the agenda at all. Siblings treat me and each other like shit. It's driving me insane. 2017 wasn't a good year at all. I wish I could honestly just hit my siblings and show them their place. They're ungrateful, they fight with the whole family. I'm so tired and i'm a failure of an older sibling.
