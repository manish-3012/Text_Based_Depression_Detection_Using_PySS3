Academic suicide...I have bipolar II and it tends to flare up in the spring and I get into a funk that's really hard for me to deal with. I've had to withdraw more than once during spring because of this. It typically starts when I fall behind for some reason and it's so hard for me to catch up again or when I think I won't do well on an assignment so I beat myself up mentally about it. 

Normally I cope with it by talking to my family but they're busy today. I just missed the deadline for a take home test which I haven't even started. I know what I want to write but I can't bring myself to start typing. This is killing me because I have some teachers who know about this and have worked with me in the past to help me out, this is a new teacher for me and I really wanted to make a good impression. For once I didn't want to be that student who can do good work, but can't do assignments on time due to depression in a teacher's eyes. I regularly earn A and B's on my assignments when I turn them in. I just want to break this cycle for once but I'm just having a really hard time doing so.

I've been meaning to talk to my school's disability office about this but I've inquired in the past and they've always told me that I need an official diagnosis which I can't afford right now. I can't use my current one because they say it has to be within a year but stuff like this doesn't just go away... Ok.

This is so frustrating since I know it'll happen again during midterms (depending on the courseload) and ALWAYS during finals. I think I'm in real trouble this semester because I'm taking mostly challenging classes and don't have a blow off one to help restore my confidence.

I'm not suicidal per se but this feels like committing academic suicide. I've been doing everything else except writing my test because I'm just so freaked out and worrying about not doing well.

Not sure if I want to talk to a hotline... Just need someone to talk with me.
