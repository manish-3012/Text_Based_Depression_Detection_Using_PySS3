I feel like postingIâ€™m doing alright. I donâ€™t feel in control of my emotions all the time. Iâ€™m hard on myself. I donâ€™t want things to get bad again. 

I felt very depressed a month or two ago and posted here. A major transition is happening in my life and Iâ€™ve felt weak. Iâ€™m feeling not quite happy but at least not in crisis. 

I donâ€™t know how Iâ€™m feeling all the time. I can be majorly sad and feel it in my body but not know it. Iâ€™m afraid of not knowing myself. 

I want to keep track. I donâ€™t consider myself suicidal right now but Iâ€™m tired and sometimes almost think terrible thoughts about no one caring. I am a bit isolated even though I have family. Iâ€™m maybe not so good in isolation. 

I will try to help people here and keep myself in check. Does anyone else do this? 

Thanks for reading.
