I donâ€™t know what to doI have been really helpless lately. I feel like nothing matters and nobody cares for me. Iâ€™m only making this entry because I want to see if anyone out there is feeling what Iâ€™m feeling and if we can help each other. A big factor of what is dragging me down is my parents, my parents arenâ€™t abusive but I feel like Iâ€™m nothing to them there only nice to me when Iâ€™m doing something I donâ€™t want to do like playing hockey. Iâ€™ve been playing since I was 5. (15 btw) Iâ€™ve lost my drive for it and every year I dread doing it. Iâ€™m on two teams, a travel and my high school. I live half an hour away from my school so I usually get home at midnight and half to wake up at 5. It may not seem like a lot but itâ€™s hard to fall asleep. My grades have been dropping and I have to take a special reading class because my SRI score isnâ€™t high enough. I tried telling my parents hockey is getting on the way but the automatically started yelling at me and scolding me. I donâ€™t really have any friends or anyone to look up to. I usually just stay in my room and cry and hurt myself. There is so much more happening in my life than what I have described but I feel as if I shouldnâ€™t expand that far. I want to commit suicide but I donâ€™t want to go to hell. I want to go to heaven when I die. My family doesnâ€™t believe in god but I do. Iâ€™ve never gone to church but I feel like he may help me. But nothing has happened yet. Iâ€™m just stuck here. With none to love or to depend on.
