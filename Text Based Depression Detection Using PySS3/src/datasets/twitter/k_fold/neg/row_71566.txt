I'm tired. I want to end it once and for all.I can't keep doing this anymore. I finally got a handle on my depression with meds, but now it's all gone to shit. I have nightmares every night to the point I can't sleep. I wake myself up from literally crying in my sleep. I have no idea why this is happening to me. It's only been three days like this and I'm ready to call it quits this shit hurts too much I can't handle this anymore. I feel like every time I get a handle on my depression it just comes back again. I just want this to stop. I'm hoping I'll have the guts to do it tonight. 

I can't talk to anyone about this. My ex broke up with me after dating for six months when I told him I was having suicidal thoughts. My therapist told me to open up to him, and he fucking dumped me. This time I'm not telling anyone, not my friends, not the guy I'm seeing, not my parents. They don't care about my problems, and I don't really blame them. I've got pills. I'm going to get some alcohol tonight and die somewhere private. I don't have a gun, otherwise that'd be my first choice.
