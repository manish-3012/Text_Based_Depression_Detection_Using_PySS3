I don't have anyone to talk toI don't really know why i am posting this. I just want someone to listen. 

I want to kill myself. I feel like a complete failure. I'll never be good enough for my father and mother, and they let me know. No matter how hard I try in sports, school, extracurriculars, its never enough. I have been wanting to kill myself for the past few month, but after more bad things happened very recently, these feelings have intensified. 

I have always been kind of afraid of my father, but a few weeks ago, i finally told him and my step mom how I was feeling to hopefully get some help. But instead of being understanding, they punished me. They thought i was just seeking attention and when i told them i wasn't and that i actually didn't want to live, the only thing they said to me was "just stop thinking that way." Now i know they aren't the most understanding people, bit even thia socked me. Tjey seem to not care about my feelings at all. I really don't know what to do. I feel lost. I feel like my life is crumbling underneath my feet. And it feels like nobody understands me. I feel so isolated. One of the only things stopping me from killing myself, is right now i don't have a good method to do so. If i did...i don't know. 

Again, i didn't really have a specific point to this post, just wanted to rant. Maybe someone is going through something similar. 

Thanks
