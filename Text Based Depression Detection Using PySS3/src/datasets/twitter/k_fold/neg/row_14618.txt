I feel like everything bad, big or small, pushes me closer and closer to suicideI take alot of things to heart. I can recall almost every cringey, embarassing and terrible momet in my life. It's only getting worse and more is piling on. I feel peace when I consider suicide. Suddenly my problems don't matter.
