I don't remember the last time I was genuinely happyI was depressed most my life, I always kept on living with the mentality of "life has ups and downs. Sure I could end it, stop existing and there are no downs anymore, but the only way to experience ups is living." 

I was used to a world full of greyness and numbness, but I just realized I don't even remember the last time I was genuinely happy. While this alone is depressing enough, I was always able to endure it until the next "up-phase'. 
But recently I started to hate myself. I don't know if I fit here since I don't have concrete plans of ending it yet, but everyday I come closer to the conclusion that 'enduring' life is just not worth it. I started therapy and was gonna contact a doctor for medication, but is a life you are only able to endure because you are on drugs everyday really worth it?
Thanks for listening to my rant.
