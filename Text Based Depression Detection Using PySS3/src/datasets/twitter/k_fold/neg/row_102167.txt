It feels really weird reaching out here.It feels really odd for me to post this here, because I have an immense amount of support around me, but it's all too personal and intense for me to handle right now. I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but I think I just cannot handle the reality that my actions affect those around me.
Two weeks ago I tried to kill myself. I tried to strangle myself with a rope, unsuccessfully, and cut my wrists, but looked down at my phone to see that my best friend had texted me. In that moment I considered the possibility that it was more of a moment of impulse and depression than an actual desire to die, as I could have done something more effective to kill myself, so I ended up reaching out to my friend. She came over with resources to clean up my wrists, and a week later I went to both a psychiatrist and a counselor. Here they told my mom what had happened, took me off of the medication I was on (prozac), and told my mom to keep me on suicide watch for the next week until the medication wore out of my system. Well, a week has gone by, and I don't feel any better. The reasonable thing to do would be to tell someone, like my mom, who surprisingly has been very supportive this past week, but something inside of me is telling me that I can't. It's like I saw my best friend and my mom cry over the fact that I wanted to die, and suddenly it felt like I wasn't trying to hurt myself, but trying to hurt them. I know the only way to get better is to be honest with them and ask for help, but I'm honestly so terrified of disappointing them or hurting them more than I already have. I don't want to be around anymore, but I don't want to leave them.
I'm not in any way trying to sound ungrateful for the support I have, but it's just nearly impossible for me to understand why they think they're better off with me around. It doesn't help that a large part of my struggle with OCD is intrusive thoughts, and my current obsession is anything that has to do with death, especially my own. It's almost like the entire world is full of triggers that set me off, and it just makes me hate myself more when I start thinking about killing myself again, because I saw how much it hurt two of the most important people in my life the first time. 
I don't think I'm worried I'm in any immediate danger, as I've only starting thinking about suicide seriously again in the past couple of days, and I'm seeing my psychiatrist and counselor tomorrow morning, but I just don't see how I'm going to get any better. Eventually my mom is going to start letting me use razors again and leave me alone in the house, or I'm going to be prescribed a medication that's easier to OD on than prozac, and I just think the temptation is going to be too much for me to handle on my own.
I'm sorry this post was so long, I just have a lot of things running through my mind right now, and this is my first time reaching out here.
