Apathetic levels are highBeing 16, out of touch, and simply just emotionally unstable, I'm slowly getting tired playing this game of wearing my different masks. I'm slowly becoming someone I never wanted to be.

As a result from failing 10th grade, barely passing 9th, and failing both 7th and 8th grades, my brother now bullies me. Despite being an adult (23), he's a douche and am asshole for his age. If I even make one simple mistake (drop something on the ground), he'll make a big deal out of it and call me an idiot. Every. Fuckin'. Time. "You're a fucking idiot", "Why the fuck would you do that?", blah blah blah, shut the fuck up already and get the fuck out of the house if you're gonna complain about my faults. Not only that, but my mom is also fucking clueless. Fuckin' Asian parents can't even help out their children. This is why I'm in this spot.

My mom has never offered to help. Never. Not a single fuckin' time. Yet she criticises and complains about everything as if she's better. My sisters wedding is coming up soon and my mom tells her this, "if my husbands sisters and brothers can't come, then I'm not coming!". She acts as if my sister is fuckin' rich, but she can't afford a bigger venue. If you're gonna complain about relatives WE don't even know about, then pitch in for another venue.

Mostly everyone is emotionally abusive. It has led me to where I am, contemplating about hanging myself soon, a failure at life, and overall shitty social life.

Did I mention that I'm a failure at life?
