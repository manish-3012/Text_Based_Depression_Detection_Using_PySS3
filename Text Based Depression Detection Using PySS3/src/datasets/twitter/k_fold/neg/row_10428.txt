Iâ€™m such a failureI canâ€™t do this anymore. I canâ€™t do anything right. The canâ€™t be the person others want me to be. I canâ€™t even be the person I want to be. Everything I do somehow messes up. Life just sucks. Itâ€™s all the little things that pile up and just never go away. I just want it to end
