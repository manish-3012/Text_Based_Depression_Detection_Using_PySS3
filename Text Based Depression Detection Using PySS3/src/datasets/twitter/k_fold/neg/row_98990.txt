My birthday is soon and I had two miscarriages, I can't take this anymore.I'm going to miss my family that I haven't seen in years. And I'm so sorry to them for not keeping in touch. My boyfriend could give no fucks if I died, in fact he would get more sleep if it wasn't for my crying if I left (his words) so I doubt anyone but my family would miss me and I'm a coward for not staying alive for them.  Me and my boyfriend have been fighting lately since he's been lying again and just disregarding my feelings. Along with that, I just feel disconnected from everyone. I would have been 25.....I've been suicidal since I was seven and I have PTSD. But last year and this year I lost a child each year, while their father doubts I was pregnant in the first place....I know this is going to get lost in the internet and no one cares but I just wanted to tell someone. I'm too afraid to tell my family and my boyfriend won't care.  I'm tired of the tears, yelling, sorrow,  and nightmares from my dreams. I am just tired of everything....I know it would end like this and it's time for me to end it. I'm going to listen to fly me to the moon one last time....
