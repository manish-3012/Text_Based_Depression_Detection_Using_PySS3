i might as well post here in case i never do.well hello! I have no idea how to start this but there may be a lot. so I'm going to be 20 in October but I said that to state my age in case anyone's curious. I've been suicidal for probably 7 years at least and depressed since forever. a few months ago I established what day I was going to do it and at the time there was like 130 days cuz it was February but now its almost June so there's like 40 left. I've had nightmares longer than I've had depression cuz ptsd and establishing the date really made my quality of life better. for like a month and a half my nightmares went from actually constant to just like 5 in that possibly 2 month span. that's done now though and they're back but idec cuz maybe it'd push me so I don't have to wait till my predetermined date I'm only alive now cuz drugs alcohol and the ability to chain smoke cigarettes constantly. I can go on with words forever but idk what else would be important. I'm about to see how many days are left cuz I lost count after a few weeks and I'll post it in the comments. thanks. 

TLDR: i wanna die lmao but thank you for reading this.
