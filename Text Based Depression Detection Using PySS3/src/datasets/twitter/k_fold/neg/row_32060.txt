The thoughts are coming back again.I have been sad for about 2 years and now. It started of when I was 13 Iâ€™m 15 now. And itâ€™s a lot of loneliness and my diagnoses ADD and Asperger. I feel hopeless and I donâ€™t know what to do. I donâ€™t show that side of me at all. And there arenâ€™t many people that know that about me. People wouldâ€™t believe that Iâ€™m sad. Because mostly think that  Iâ€™m just a awkward guy. And when I was around 14 I almost killed my self. But I didnâ€™t. The thoughts are coming back again and I donâ€™t know what to do
