Not now, but I know I will do it one day.For years, since 6th grade I have just had horrible mental health. Years and years later i still feel like shit. I have dealt with bullying, and mentally abusive relationships. I almost killed myself, had a plan, a note and everything. I have been doing really well recently, I have been happy with friends, but constantly in the back of my mind, I just think about killing myself. I canâ€™t look in the mirror without crying, I hate my looks, my personality, my intelligence. I told my parents about how I wrote a suicide note back in grade 9 but they just called me attention seeking (they both work in mental health so i thought they might actually help... but no). 

I donâ€™t plan on killing myself anytime soon, but I am so mentally weak, I donâ€™t even know how to describe it, my chest just feels heavy, and I feel worthless. The littlest things set me off, make me feel like suicide is the answer (and i mean the LITTLEST like an argument). At this point I dont even care for my life, I started abusing shrooms in grade 10 because it gave me a good high, followed up by coke.

I was sexually abused by my brother when i was 3 to when i was 6. He is ten years older than me. Granted, he is much nicer now and acts like a good brother but I still have flashbacks and nightmares. My parents donâ€™t know, they favour him, and would never believe me.

I harmed myself for over 5 years, I have lost so much blood I almost passed out. I stopped thankfully â¤ï¸

I canâ€™t help but feel like everyone secretly hates me. I feel like such a burden to everyone.

I seriously donâ€™t plan on killing myself soon or even want to, but i have been so mentally weak for so long. I just know that the second something bad (such as the death of my dog, a friend, another assault, etc) I will just end up killing myself.

Sorry this is all over the place even if anyone cares to reads this:/
