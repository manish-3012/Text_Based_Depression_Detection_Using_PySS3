Is this bullshit? Sister says therapist asked her to write a "safety" note that looks like a suicide note...My mother found out about a note my sister had written, the gist of which was "If I kill myself, please call these three people: [Person A], [Person B], and [Person C]"

This was of course alarming. When my mother asked my sister about it, my sister said that her therapist has all new patients (or at least all patients seeking therapy for depression) to write notes like this even though they may not have any suicidal ideation. Essentially, the story was, the therapist makes her patients write these notes so that **if** they ever start to feel suicidal, they should look at the note and be reminded of who **they** should call.

Is this complete horseshit? This sounds crazy (please forgive my insensitivity) to me but I've never been a therapy oriented kind of guy. I just feel like if I did go to a therapist because I had issues to work out, or felt down and in a funk, and that therapist pitched this idea to me, I would have very serious second thoughts about their practice. I've never in my life heard of this, from anyone. So my alarm bells are ringing - is my sister making this up to downplay the note and just try to soothe my mother's (completely understandable, from my perspective) incredible panic at discovering this note?
