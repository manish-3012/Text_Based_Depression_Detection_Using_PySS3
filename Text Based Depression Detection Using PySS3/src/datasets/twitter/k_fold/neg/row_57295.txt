I don't know what to doHonestly I don't even know why I'm posting here but I guess I just want to get it out but not tell my friends or family. Everyday I think about dying and how it would be easier for everyone if I was gone, me, friends, and family wouldn't have to deal with me anymore I'm an annoying no talent waste of space who is terrible at everything I try (well... Other than tf2... Sorry humor kina helps) I'm only a 20 year old but honestly I don't see my life going anywhere other than being homeless, I can't afford bills cause of my job, I keep applying everywhere for jobs but never hear anything back and I just keeping shit for not having  a good enough job from my mom. It's be easier if I was dead... Plus the life insurance from me would help out my family so dying might be a good thing actually, I just don't want to have anyone come across me when I'm dead and that's really the only thing keeping me from doing it honestly.
