Suicide by Cop FantasyI'm desperate. I want to escape this shit existence.And when I get like this I like to fantasize my own demise.  I don't want to hurt anyone but myself. Are cops trained to shoot to kill? I wouldn't want to mentally hurt a police officer (or police officers if more then one is called to the scene) but I feel it's apart of their training to potentially take a life. I fantasize about a group of them just shooting me to death. I fantasize about aiming a black spray painted water pistol at them and them responding by spending their entire magazines on me. I fantasize about having my suicide note zipped up in two ziplock bags so that it's legible after the fountain of blood coming from me dousing it.

The fantasy of this actually makes me feel a lot better.
