Maybe it is time to punch in my ticket. I have had a good life and really don't want to experience ruining it.I always was like NO I WILL NEVER DO SUICIDE how could I do that to my family. I also love many things about life, got a gf, good family, and Iâ€™m fascinated about the world around me. I have ADHD, and I started med school this past year. My dream is to be a doctor because medicine is one of the few things I can really focus on and enjoy. Unfortunately Iv missed a few classes, even though my grades are good, I might get kicked out. Honestly, I just donâ€™t know if the brain I have is built to function in modern society. I work really really hard at it but it does not seem to matter. I always lose things, always lost, always make people angry. I wonder if maybe itâ€™s time I punch my ticket and enjoy the life I had, just a thought I have.
