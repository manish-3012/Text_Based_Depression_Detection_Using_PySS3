Feels like I don't have much time leftI've always felt like I would never live past 18, and now I'm 24, confused and just trying to pretend I belong anywhere. I always feel depressed in waves and it's finally coming back again. My relationship is falling apart, I keep saying things that are rude or unfriendly to people I care about, I'm crying constantly about barely anything, I barely feel like a real person, I hate seeing myself in the mirror, and I can't think about the future. Honestly I think it would be better for everyone in my life if I wasn't around anymore.  
Today I was feeling depressed and crying as usual until I realized I'm probably going to be not alive for much longer. Once I had this thought it felt like everything made sense. Like everything didn't feel as bad anymore cause I understood I wasn't going to feel anything in the future. I laid down on the ground and stared at all the details in my house. I don't know if I've ever felt so alive. I don't know where else to talk about this. If I say this to my friends it will just hurt them again or make them pity me.
