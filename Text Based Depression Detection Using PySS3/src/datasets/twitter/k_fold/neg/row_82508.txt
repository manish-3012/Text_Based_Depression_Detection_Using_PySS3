Depression won.Well, it won. Iâ€™ve gave up, I gave up on school, keeping friends, happiness, &amp; hope. Iâ€™ve taken every advice I was given, wrote it down, talked to someone, watched advice videos, everything. But for some reason Iâ€™ve gotten nowhere, &amp; Iâ€™m tired of hearing the â€œthings take timeâ€ excuse, I want it OVER with now! I mean fuck, itâ€™s going to be a new year, but Iâ€™m still in this shit hole. Iâ€™ve been in this state for so long that Iâ€™ve became comfortable in my depression, sadness is the only thing I know now. I canâ€™t even keep a friend around without pushing them away, or just getting cut off. Gosh, why couldnâ€™t it be over with the first time I attempted, I was ready to die that day. I just canâ€™t take it anymore, the misery &amp; feeling hopeless. Life is just so shitty, and the only time I feel happy is when Iâ€™m making fake fucking scenarios in my head to escape from reality. I just feel so down bad, and the worse part about it is no one decided to â€œcareâ€ until I didnâ€™t want help anymore, because itâ€™s already too late.
