No hope at allAll I want to do right now is jump out of a window. It's the only way I can end my misery. I feel like no one is there to talk to me. In my dorm hall, I knocked on some friends' doors and they weren't there. I texted one friend asking her if she wanted to go to dinner with me and she never responded. My college has no open parties and I never get invited to any. No one texts me asking me if I want to talk or hang out. I cry all the time because no one wants me, and whenever I cry, I make sure nobody hears me. Not because I fear I'll get attention, but because I fear no one will care. I cut myself in the shower a few days ago. What gets me even more than the people who never talk to me are the ones that reach out to me once, then disappear. Like that one friend I texted. In the year and a half I've been diagnosed with depression, I tried everything. I was hospitalized three times, went to counseling once a week, and took three different kinds of antidepressant meds plus two mood stabilizers. Nothing ever worked. The only way I can ever feel better is to be accepted like everybody else or die, and I'm sure the former will never happen. I was told that a death on campus would affect the entire community, yeah fucking right. If I get ignored in life, why would I not get ignored in death?
