college is giving me an existential crisis rnim 19 and just finished my first year in community college and realizing i have no idea what to do with my life

im majoring in film because i love being creative and telling stories but i understand its next to impossible to get into the industry.

ive got a few fallback minors but me and my family are dirt fucking broke (ive got less than $1000 to my name rn) and probably wont be able to afford uni next year. i dont want to take out any loans and risk fucking myself over for the rest of my life

plus because of the pandemic classes are gonna be online next year and so im debating on wether or not to take a gap until things get back to normal

im just super fucking stressed out and i just want to slit my wrists to make all of this go away and i just need someone to talk to
