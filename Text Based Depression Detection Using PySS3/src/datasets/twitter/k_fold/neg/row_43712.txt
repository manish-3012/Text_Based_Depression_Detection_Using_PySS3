I've been told by others that I'm suicidal.Maybe my depression has never been intense enough or maybe I'm just misunderstanding the definition of suicidal. I am transgender woman, currently becoming the woman I need to be. I have never considered my way of thinking suicidal until my family expressed their concerns.  I feel like such a burden to all my supportive family and a nuisance to those who are not. One thought plagues me all the time. It would just be easier if I was gone. It has never driven me to self harm. But I just wish things would end. I know my family would survive without me. It just seems easier. I am also the least successful of my family.  I'm the only one without kids, a meaningful career or even a college degree. I feel like I just drain the world without giving anything back. I just want my time to be done, but don't have the strength to end it. I would accept my fate if something happened to me. I just can't find a reason why I deserve to be alive in the place of so many good people and the pain of life just keeps eroding me. I'm not sure this is the place to post this. Remove it if you need.
