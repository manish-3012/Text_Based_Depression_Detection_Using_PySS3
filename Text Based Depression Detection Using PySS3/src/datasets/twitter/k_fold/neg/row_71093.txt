I don't know. (Long post. Sorry)I am so tired. I can't even get relief from video games, my depression creeps up on me and leaves me a mess.
I feel so alone where I am. I feel like trying is pointless, that all of this is for nothing. 
I messed up and slept with my ex last night, and the fact that I love him makes it harder to accept that he doesn't think that we are a good idea.
I'm tired of feeling overstressed from work, and incoming student loans that might not be covered by only one full time job, not to mention my own physical health problems that I stress and worry about.
I just want to not deal with any of this anymore. I don't want to have to "be strong" and "hang in there". I don't ever want to wake up again or even have to see another day.
