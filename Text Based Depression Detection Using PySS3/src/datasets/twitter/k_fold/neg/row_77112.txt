I haven't felt happy since I was little. It's honestly just time to leave.I've put this off for far too long, and honestly, I'm not sure what else to do. I'm stuck in a rut. All i do is go to work and play fucking video games. I can't take this shit. Honestly, is this what adult life is? Just two fucking things for eternity? Because if so, fuck this shit. I'm out. 

And without going into specifics, I've planned this for years now. There's no living from my method. If anything, i've almost romanticized it at this point.
