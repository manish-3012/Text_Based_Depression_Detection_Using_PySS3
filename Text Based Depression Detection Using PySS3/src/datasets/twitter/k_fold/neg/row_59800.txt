Realized for sure I (36m) will never, EVER find someone or find love in this lifeFuck this shit. And yes, as an intuitive spiritualist, I *do* know *for sure*. Definitely not worth staying alive, especially now, now that I'm having non-stop hallucinations.

Next few decades are gonna suck if I stay any longer. It truly isn't worth it, and it *for sure* will NEVER get better for me. Ever :/
