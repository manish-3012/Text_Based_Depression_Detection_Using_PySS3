I want to end my monotonous lifeI'm a 20 year old guy and all I've ever really done my entire life is play video games and watch tv. When I was 17 I fell for a former coworker/friend and after she rejected me (kindly) we remained friends until after I quit and had one of my famous melt downs and ghosted her. I eventually apologized but now I'm turning 21 soon and I still fucking think of her all the time. These past few days all I've really been thinking is how the reason i will never kill myself is because of people like her who I like and who I won't want to hear about my suicide, but I just can't take it anymore. I don't have any hobbies and I'm sick of just going to work, coming home, video games, shows, crying, sleeping, and work. I need to fucking kill myself!
