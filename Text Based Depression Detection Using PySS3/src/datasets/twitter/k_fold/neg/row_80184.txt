I want to dieI want to kill myself. I've been thinking about it nonstop for weeks. A lot more recently, I have started doing research and I feel like I'm really warming up to the idea. I have lost the motivation to do anything. The other night, I went for a walk because I wanted to throw myself in front of a car. I learned how to tie a noose. I'm also considering trying to cut my radial artery and bleed to death.

I really don't want to devastate my family and I know my dad would take it really hard because we're really close and he knows how much I've been struggling, and he's been doing everything he can to try to help me. That's what's keeping me alive right now. 

I just hate living and it doesn't seem worth it anymore. I'm in pain all the time. I'm 21 and I honestly feel like I've finished with my fun years and there's nothing left to look forward to.  I'm not excited about graduating or having a career. I'm not convinced that I will find love. I don't have a lot of friends. I don't enjoy any aspect of my life. I want out.
