Idk anymore...So and i know this is still young but fuck it, I'm 21 in a month and basically I haven't had a single good year of my life, my mom is a drug addict with mental illness, my dad a no show and the only father figure i had went to jail for touching a woman at a party (not much more detail needed) after beating the shit out of me and my brother for 8 years, after this happened i went to live with my aunt and uncle who decided to take me out of the streets where i was stealing food from walmart and publix to get by (13-14 at this time) 

Even though they tried to help me they couldn't see a deeper problem inside me, i had stopped caring about anything and idk about you guys but that's usually the point before you start asking why you're even here, and at least for me that just leads to the thought that this life is already hell why not give yourself some peace.. well after a few attempts failing i decided i would just try to make the best of it and just try to be like everyone else, sad but concealed.

Jump forward a couple of years and i had formed a fairly strong addiction to some very potent drugs, I'd write the list but i don't think youbguys care all that much about it, but it was after looking in a mirror and seeing my sleep deprived eyes stare back empty that i decided fuck it let's try again, this time i just ended up in my bed shivering and puking for a couple days hoping it would end, I'm moderately pleased to say I'm not an addict anymore and i really have a decent life going, but still i can't shake this feeling of emptiness and at times complete apathy, I'm too scared to talk to a doctor about any of this in fear that I'll be locked away but at the same time idk if i can deal with the thought and basic knowledge that i am worth absolutely nothing, to myself, my "friends and family", and sure as hell you guys, so i just don't know anymore, i don't want to dwell on these thoughts anymore but i know it as the truth, so do i keep living a lie as this happy guy or do i show people in my lives this person i am deep inside a bitter young man with no sense of reason and nothing to give anymore, i just don't know anymore
