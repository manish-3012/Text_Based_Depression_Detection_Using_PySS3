Give me a reason to go on and try to live lifeSee, I always dreamed about getting out of school, then starting a family and having a nice job, but now it all seems so pointless. I see all these people doing things they love and actually making a living off of it like touring playing music, playing professional football, basketball, soccer, or there's even those huge gaming competitions with like millions of dollars in the prize pools. They are just doing what they love with their friends, and getting paid way more than enough. I just can't see myself being that successful with a hobby, and hate the idea of ending up in a normal job that I'll have to go to everyday, and just waste life away. 

I just need to be talked out of this mindset, please.
