I am so disappointed in myself that I think I do not deserve to live anymore so I need to kill myself, but I am to much of a cowered to do so! I make the most stupid mistakes every day that I can not even get a proper job or to find proper friends. I was so happy at a point in my life that I cannot stand what I am today. From a tall mountain I am at the lowest part I just need it to stop, I need to kill myself now!
