Feeling suicidal again after a failed attempt last week...Last week I tried killing myself via overdose. Didn't work out, but I had texted my friend beforehand to let her know (she knew I was going to eventually, and asked that I tell her if I do so that she can cope). It was... rough for her... I don't feel like I can tell her again.

I am not sure if I can keep going on like this with my life, but I don't want to fail again and put her through that again.
