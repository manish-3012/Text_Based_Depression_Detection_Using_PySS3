All my insecurities built up and I can't handle them anymoreI feel worthless. I'm not strong enough, not tall enough, I have eczema from dry skin AND I have acne from oily skin it's so fucking stupid. This is probably the dumbest of them all, but my penis is also really small and I want to kill myself because of it.  I can't stop thinking that no matter what I do, even if I work out and get bigger, even if I get better skincare one day, I'm never gonna keep a girlfriend or whatever. I know my problems are so small compared to other things people go through, but it still eats away at me. Maybe that's another sign of my own weakness.
