My anxiety is killing me.Save me from this place.
Itâ€™s so dark.
Iâ€™m scared.
Of being buried alive.
By my own thoughts.
I feel betrayed.
Iâ€™m sorry.
For being like this.
Donâ€™t tell me.
â€œItâ€™ll get betterâ€
Iâ€™ve waited too long.
Life.
Is a competition.
Between lovers.
Families.
Friends.
Countries. 
Iâ€™m losing a battle.
Within myself.
Itâ€™s not just me.
How is that possible?
I canâ€™t trust anyone.
Theyâ€™re out to get me.
I donâ€™t wanna die.
But Iâ€™ve got no choice.
Either.
I die.
Or I die.
Itâ€™s hard to choose.
Iâ€™m only a teenager.
But I feel like.
Iâ€™m 30.
Some of us.
Arenâ€™t being edgy.
How can someone like.
You.
Understand?
So stop telling me.
Itâ€™s like telling.
The deceased to.
â€œWake upâ€.
Iâ€™m dying from.
The inside out.
I canâ€™t help it.
Iâ€™m sorry.
I donâ€™t wanna die.
Save me.
