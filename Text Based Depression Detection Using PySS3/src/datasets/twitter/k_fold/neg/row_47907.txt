Suicide has been on my mind lately and i have been planning quite meticulouslyI'm 25 and I am thinking of ending my life sometimes in early July. I have been depressed since 18 and I don't see the brightness at the end of the tunnel and don't feel like I have a good future ahead because everything I do to improve my future goes upside down(it's like I have been cursed).  
I was bullied like crazy in middle school and I hate that the bullies are doing better than me and I am living a shitty life. I lead a pedantic and pathetic existence for instance I still live with my parents(who also played in part of robbing me of opportunities in life such as living and having college experience, didn't let me work until I turned 21) not only did my parents not allow me to work they didn't give me any money for food because they were paranoid I would just date girls and feed them(HA like that could happen I am ugly as shit). MY depression also left me with a poor GPA when I graduated from my community college.  
I feel like I have been robbed of a lot of life experience while everyone around me is living up their life I am at home being miserable. I am just tired. I feel like I am too old to do anything anymore. My therapist sucks hardcore.
