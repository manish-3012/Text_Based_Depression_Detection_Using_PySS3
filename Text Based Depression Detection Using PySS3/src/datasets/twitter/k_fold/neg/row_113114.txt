need someone right now.i am in class. i cant help but feel like i should just walk out, walk to the water tower, and just end it all. im tired of having no friends. im tired of nobody giving a shit about me. long story short my dad molested me a bunch of times and sometimes i have repressed memories come up. i had another memory today and called my mom who refused to pick me up from school. because, yes, sitting in a fucking classroom with fake bitches and crying my eyes out is fine! thanks mom for really being considerate. fuck. i dont know what to do. im so fucking angry and depressed and i just want to die. you know every night before i fall asleep i pray to a god i dont believe in to let me die in my sleep. but of course i wake up every fucking morning. i just want someone to talk to. thats all i fucking ask for is a friend but i never seem to achieve that.
