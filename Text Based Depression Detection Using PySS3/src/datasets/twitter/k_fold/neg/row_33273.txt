I canâ€™t get myself out of this rut and I canâ€™t get help, Iâ€™m trappedAbandoned and abused by both parents. My mum walked out and was a bipolar schizophrenic. We talk now but Iâ€™m a drain on her. Iâ€™ve benne rebuilding myself after a 4 year relationship in all the wrong ways. Iâ€™ve just been dropped by a person who told me we had a future and made me believe it. Nobody ever sticks around. I canâ€™t stop self harming. I shake and cry constantly and I feel numb. All Iâ€™m doing is smoking cigarettes. I canâ€™t keep waking up to this life. Iâ€™m terrible at my job because I canâ€™t function, Iâ€™m a manger letting every member of my team down with my own laziness and depression. Iâ€™ve been on so many medications and they donâ€™t help. I push everyone away. Iâ€™m on about five different waiting lists for help that I wonâ€™t get. I just canâ€™t keep doing this every day. Everyone says Iâ€™m so strong but I feel so incredibly broken that Iâ€™m never going to be even remotely fixed. Iâ€™m exhausted, truly.
