I feel like utter shit.I'm a teenage girl and I've been having suicidal thoughts for the past 3-4 years. Mostly fueled by bullies, who called me fat, ugly and a weirdo since 1st grade, and my family, who fat-shame me on a regular basis. My older sister has been mentally abusing me for all my life, every time I confront her abut it, she says it's my fault somehow and that I make her feel like shit everyday. It's gotten a tiny better since she's moved for college now, but she still visits us every weekend and I get the old treatment. Since I've been 7 I've felt pretty unwanted at home since I'm the youngest of 2 children. My mom seemingly hates me and I have no reason why. I feel unneeded. I really want to die.
I've been struggling with self harm and bulimia since 5th grade.
A guy I've started to take interest in seems to love this super petite, beautiful model like blonde who has the nicest personality. I look and act like shit compared to her. There's no doubt that he'd choose her any day. I really want him to share his feelings that I have for him.
I need motivation to exist right now.
