I am terrified to die but I don't deserve to liveI'm sorry I can't do this anymore. I hate my job, I'm emotionally abusive. Everything I try fails and I'm stuck in a place I hate. I feel like my brain is constantly betraying me and I don't know how to stop it. I just keep spiraling and I don't know if I can stop myself.
