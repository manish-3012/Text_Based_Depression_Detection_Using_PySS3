Iâ€™m going to start making arrangements for suicide tomorrow.My city looks like it will be going into lockdown again soon, and my mental health suffered so much from the first one that I cannot do another lockdown. This was mainly because I was stood down from my job with no certainty regarding if or when I would return. I spent nearly two months in a constant state of anxiety and fear.

Ultimately, I got my job back and got additional work at another workplace after working my arse off. However, I donâ€™t know if I will get my job back the second time around. Iâ€™m only a casual worker, not an unsackable boomer in a salaried job who has the luxury of working from home.

I have suffered enough and deserve better for my efforts over the years. If all I have to look forward to is a dystopian police state, then I refuse to live in it.

I will buy some rope tomorrow so that I will be ready to hang myself if another lockdown occurs and I am out of work again.
