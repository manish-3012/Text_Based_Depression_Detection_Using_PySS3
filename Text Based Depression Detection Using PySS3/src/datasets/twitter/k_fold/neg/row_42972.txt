How do I get a message to my daughter that its not her faultThe only thing keeping me around right now is her. I just want her to know when I cant hold on anymore that it's not her fault and that I tried. Shes only 1 so theres not much she'll remember but I dont know how much her mom will hold on to or what she will say.
