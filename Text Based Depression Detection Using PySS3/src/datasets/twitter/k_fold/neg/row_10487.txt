I leave this sub because I feel on top of the world. And come crashing down every time.I cant get away from it.
Lately ive been feeling the universe calling me home. I need to die. Thereâ€™s so much happiness on the other side and so much suffering in life. Theres happiness in life but its too hard to get, i try and try but nothing ever works out.
I want to go home. I want to die and let my soul be free again. I hate the confines of humanity and the limits set on us by the elite and rich.
My soul just cant take it anymore. I dont fear death because I know whats waiting for me, relief. Freedom. But for some reason i just cant get the balls to end it myself...
