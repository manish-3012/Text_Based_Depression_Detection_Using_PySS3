i'm scared and afraidI'm drunk but i fell empty.   I used to have plenty of friends in high school but one by one they found wives, gfs, or new lives that did not include me.  I never wanted us to be separated but he separated us and everything else by ignoring my calls and voice messages.  I'm bioplar and scared reddit.  I dont want to sound like im some spoiled brat, in face I cant afford health care. Maybe it would be best if i was some forgotten character and no one remembered who I even was.
