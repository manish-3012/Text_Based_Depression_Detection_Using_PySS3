I'm lonely. Like, really lonely.What makes it hard is that I'm not alone at all. I have a bunch of friends and they're all really great. So I feel really awful about still feeling lonely. But I can't help it. It's impossible for me to have a connection with anyone or anything. Nothing feels real, you know how if you watch a movie and you go along with how the main character feels, and for that hour or so you kinda just don't exist? That's how I feel, except constantly. It feels like waking up with amnesia and being given all these memories and thoughts and feelings that aren't really yours. 

I don't even have anyone to talk to about it. No one wants to hear that their friend doesn't feel like there's really anything "there" between you and basically sees you as a stranger. I feel like such a terrible person because I should feel happy with my life and I should appreciate my friends and I do.. But I just can't take feeling so lonely anymore. 

I've wanted to kill myself for over a decade now, but I'm too much of a coward to go through with it. I've always thought "I wish I would just die somehow" but lately I've been struggling so much trying to cope with this that I've been planning how I should do it myself. I really don't know what else to do. But everything is either too painful and scary or not possible (I live in the UK so getting a gun is really hard)

I lost my job because of my anxiety and now I spend most days asleep. I had saved up a lot of money but now it's running out. Soon I won't be able to pay rent so I'll be kicked out too. I've had therapy and I've taken meds, I'm generally healthy, I don't know what else to do.
