Unapologetically fuck you allFuck you for wanting to brag about me on your social media when I get into a top college so that your followers know your friends are smart but being conspicuously absent when you know I feel terrible, fuck you for texting me for academic advice then never texting me again, fuck you for offering to be there for me but making it clear that you feel my problems arenâ€™t as important as yours, fuck you for knowing how much I careâ€”how open and tender to the touch this wound isâ€”and stomping on it.

Fuck you for looking at me with disdain, fuck you for seeing me as lesser because Iâ€™m not as thin as you, fuck you for seeing me as a sexless inanimate object because no one that average-looking deserves anything beyond platonic relationships in your heads, fuck you for using my ideas to make people laugh because you know your delivery is funnier. 

Fuck you for crying on my couch but never even half-assedly returning the favor, fuck you for texting every single girl in my friend group except for me because anything I have to offer sure as hell isnâ€™t visible to the human eye, fuck you for knowing my insecurities and joking about them because weâ€™re friends and thatâ€™s what friends do.

Fuck all of you for making me feel this way, but fuck myself most of all for allowing any of it to happen. I wish I had the courage to commit suicide.
