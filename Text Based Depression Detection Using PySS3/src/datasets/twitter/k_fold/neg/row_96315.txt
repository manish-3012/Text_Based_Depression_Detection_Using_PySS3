What is the point?I have nothing to live for. I'm terrible person, I blame all my problems on the people around me and when they point out how retarded that is, I get mad. I hate my sister cause she is more happy then me. I hate my parents because they try and help me. I hate myself because i'm aware of how shitty of a person I am, I'm not going anywhere in life after I graduate, I don't even know if I will graduate. I have nothing, so why do I still bother?
