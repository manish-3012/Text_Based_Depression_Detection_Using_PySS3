Iâ€™m done for realIâ€™ve really tried so hard. Iâ€™m a nobody, and Iâ€™ll die a nobody

I always wanted to be famous and make people proud. I failed. All I have is my dog and when she dies Iâ€™m killing myself. I donâ€™t want to die but I canâ€™t live without her sheâ€™s everything I have 

I laugh when I remember I wanted to be an entrepreneur and a YouTuber. Iâ€™ve failed at both of those, my parents are gone, I have nobody.

I just want to die. Everyday is hell and Iâ€™m going to be forgotten about when Iâ€™m dead
