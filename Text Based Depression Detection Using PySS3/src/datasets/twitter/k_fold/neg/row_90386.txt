Why am I depressed all the time?Hi reddit.

I have what you may consider a perfect life. Upper middle-class guy in his 20's, university student, fraternity guy and an engineering student. I study, work and play daily and for some reason, I'm not satisfied.

I entertain suicidal thoughts on a regular basis and derive little pleasure from most activities. I went to Six Flags the other day and the few thoughts that I had drifted to wanting the roller coaster to derail, but how painful it could be if I fell to my death. Why do I feel like this constantly? How can I make these thoughts stop? And how can I finally be happy or at least satisfied? This has been going on for a very long time ...

Thanks.
