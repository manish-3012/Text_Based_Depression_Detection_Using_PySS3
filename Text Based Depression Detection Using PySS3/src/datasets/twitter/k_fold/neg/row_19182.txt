I dont know what to do.I have no fucking idea what to do. I'll give some basic detail

I'm a heroin addict and I lie to everyone. Usually pretty well.

My mom caught me a while ago and I got clean for a while, but I ended up getting back on. SHe went into my room yesterday and I'm pretty sure she saw my needles. She hasn't said anything about it, but she fucking went in again while I was gone. I don't know if shes just waiting to say something or what, but I'm pretty sure I'm fucked.

 I missed work today just because I couldn't handle the stress. I cashed my check and I'm already basically broke more or less. I can't fucking stand this feeling. I've been depressed for a long time, but it hasn't been so bad lately. I've actually been cutting down befoe I try and switch to suboxone because I'm so tired of lying to everyone that loves me. This though I just can't take this. I haven't had this gut sinking feeling stay around for so fucking long in my life.

 I feel violated, unloved, unwanted, and I can't fucing go on. Pretty sure I'll probably get kicked out and pretty sure she fucking hates me. So, I'm pretty sure tomorrow I'm just going to buy a few benzos and slam a gram to get this shit over with. I can't stand it and my life is going nowhere fast. Even if I get on suboxone it won't fix anything. It cost a good bit of money too so I'll still be broke most of the time. I don't want to live anymore. I don't want to tell anyone bye and I don't want the attention of doing it. I don't know why I'm making this post. I guess so when I do it she'll know it was on purpose. Fuck this shit and I'm tired already.
