Suicide due to potential unemployment?How many of you are unemployed or soon to be unemployed and struggle with suicidal impulses?  
I had ambitions and dreams. I worked hard but the goddess of failure seems to be in love with me for years. Nothing seems to work. In the future I am looking at, It seems I will become a parasite. I live in a place where the economy was already crap and the few companies that hire fresh grads have reduced hiring numbers due to Covid. I live in a kind of abusive home with a highly bipolar parent who now and then guilts me for being a failure. There is no social safety net here either and I don't know how to get out of the home in empty pockets and rebuild my life.  


 For most of my life I have been alone and have always played safe.  As a teenager, I always wondered why are some people so lost, homeless and hopeless, with sad and dead eyes. Now I think they are pretty brave that they don't kill themselves even when they realize they won't achieve or do anything significant in their life.   


Sorry for this rant of an immature kid. Just wanted to vent somewhere.
