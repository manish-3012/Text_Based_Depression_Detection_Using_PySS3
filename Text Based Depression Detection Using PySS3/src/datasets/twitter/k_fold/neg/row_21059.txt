Idk what to doI'm severely suicidal bc I'm a huge burden on society.  I have this one friend who's a cop, and he spends up to several hours on Facebook.  I've tried to ask him for help a few times, but only now is he saying he wants to help.  I'm not trying to cause problems, but every person I've asked for advice has said that I sound like I'm entitled to others time and that I'm treating my friends like employees.  I'm sorry for being a bad friend.  I'm sorry for being a parasite.  I dont deserve to live at all.
