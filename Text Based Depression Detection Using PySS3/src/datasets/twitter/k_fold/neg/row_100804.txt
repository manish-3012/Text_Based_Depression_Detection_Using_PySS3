I NEVER ASKED FOR ANY OF THISIm on a spiral right now. I never asked to be on this planet and now im just expected to be ok.
I have struggled with mental health issues my whole life, which impacts me being able to work. So i receive support from the government.  Thats being threatened right now, and i feel so helpless. 
Im a single mom of a 2 year old, with a baby girl on the way. I left my ex due to abuse and right now i feel like if my income is taken i have no options... except to go back to him. He was a good provider,  but a horrible partner. There was some physical abuse but mostly emotional. 

And i feel horrible for thinking about how i have no options and dont want to be on this planet anymore, especially when i have two amazing little girls in my life.

I hate how someone else just decided to have me and im just expected to figure out my crap and survive and be ok, and you are damned if you go against the grain and need help surviving in life... sorry for my ramble...
