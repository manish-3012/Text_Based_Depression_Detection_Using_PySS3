The realization that I'm gonna die from suicide is hard...I'm pretty sure I'm not gonna be alive in the future, and the biggest possibility is me dying from suicide or other causes if there are chances.

The future looks dark, I don't see myself being alive and the fact suicide is gonna be the main reason is hard to process...
