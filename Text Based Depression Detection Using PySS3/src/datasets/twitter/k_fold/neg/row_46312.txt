Can anyone help me out?Summertime insomnia sufferer here...every night is like being tortured. Thereâ€™s only so much I can take before I start to get very depressed. I can make myself fall asleep, but I can only stay asleep for 20 minutes or so. Iâ€™m at about two weeks now, and I feel like I canâ€™ t go on. I have done so, every year until now, but every time, it feels like the first time. Please tell me how you continue. (I have been dealing with this for at least 30 years, and have unsuccessfully tried to kill myself at least a few times over the years). Please help.
