Spent an hour on a hotline to not have my only question answeredSo ya thanks for all the help. They just kept asking me questions. I have body acceptance issues. Basically I feel extremely violated that I was circumcised as a baby. If I was female people would be up and arm but yea for double standards. So basically how do i not hate my body?
