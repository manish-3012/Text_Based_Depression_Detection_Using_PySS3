Am I suicidal?I'm not sure if it belongs here, I don't know where to go for an advice. If it needs the rules, I'll delete this post.

I suffer from anxiety. I've been going to a therapist but they didn't help much. Lately I just don't want to live anymore. I don't want to kill myself but I just want to not exist anymore. I feel so much better when I'm asleep and not being conscious. Almost everyday the thought "What would happen if I killed myself?" crosses my mind. I probably won't do it, because my family and my bf would be sad. But on the other hand I find myself looking into what dose of pills is deadly to human. I don't know if it's something that will pass or if I should talk about it with someone but I don't want it to look like I'm trying to get attention or to get people to pity me and also I don't want to bother anyone with things like this. After all they have better things to worry about.
