Has it ever gotten better for anyone?I've been dealing with suicidal thoughts since I was in middle school and its been worsening over time. During my senior year in high school I got better for a time, "stronger" I guess you could say. I made some friends, went from 300lbs down to 240 in that one year, and over time got down to my now 225. Now though I'm worse than ever. i realized my friends from senior year really just pitied my lack of social skills, and even if I lost weight I'm still sorely unattractive. I think about suicide almost constantly, I try not to get involved with others due to my experiences in school, and I made the mistake of telling my parents about my thoughts recently. My dad doesn't understand what it's like at all and told me it's my choice I'm not happy, and now either pretends I never told him or cracks jokes about me killing myself. My Mom told me she would breakdown if I killed myself, she says she wants me to go to a therapist, but she wants me to go to the same place she goes to only and that I can't have any antidepressants. I can't got to a therapist, tell them I'm suicidal, get locked up in a hospital for weeks or longer only to get out and have my mother dump the medication I would be given down the drain. I don't see any way out of this. Has anyone actually comeback from this? Is there any case where somebody stopped idolizing suicide 24/7 and actually became happy?
