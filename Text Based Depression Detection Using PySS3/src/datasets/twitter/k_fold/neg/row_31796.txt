I donâ€™t want to ruin the tripI have a big blue vein on my arm that nurses always use when I have my blood drawn. It goes downwards. I know that if I cut it deep enough I will eventually bleed out. 

I want to do it and then undo it because I donâ€™t want to ruin the family trip.

We bough tickets to a large concert around a year ago. I hate the band and I have absolutely no desire to go but my entire family (dad, mum and sister) are beyond excited. We also havenâ€™t seen each other for a while because they were away for holidays without me. They say they missed me and that theyâ€™re happy about finally spending some time together.

Everybody in this family is just so fucking sad. My mum is hugely insecure about her weight and aging, my dad spends most of his time at work, my sister fakes a mental disorder for attention and Iâ€™m transgender. They have their own problems and thatâ€™s why theyâ€™ll never accept my issues as something serious, they will never accept me as a man, they will never see me or refer to me as one. 

They say they love me though. I donâ€™t know if thatâ€™s true or if itâ€™s just something they say because it should be said. But they are so fucking excited for that fucking trip with me.

I want to die finally and I want to bleed the fuck out and I want to see my own corpse on the bathroom floor because Iâ€™m worthless. I will never be a man. My family will never be normal and they will never love each other or me.

Iâ€™m on the verge of losing my mind. Iâ€™ve been thinking about it for so long but now I feel like Iâ€™m finally going to do it. Iâ€™m just so sick of the idea of ruining the trip for them. I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™ll have the courage again if I wait.

How do I undo suicide for everyone except myself?
