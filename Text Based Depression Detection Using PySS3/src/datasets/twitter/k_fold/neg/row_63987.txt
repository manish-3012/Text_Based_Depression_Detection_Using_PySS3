Im giving it one more month.I don't know how to put my feelings into words properly most of the time so here's my last attempt at living I guess.  Im not gonna tell my life story or anything because that would be to much for me right now but I'm gonna save up for a month to get a gun so I can finally put an end to this horrible pain.  I don't care about the impact my death could have anymore, through other deaths I've seen that even after death no one in my life will actually give a shit and don't tell me that they will because I've seen and known them well enough to know the grief will only be momentary.  Im probably just ranting by now but the last thing I want since my depression started getting worse was to be alone but my wife left me alone again after a stupid argument.  I don't know what else to say I'm sorry this is feeling a lot easier the more I write, but I guess I'll stop now.  Thanks for being entertaining for so many years reddit.
