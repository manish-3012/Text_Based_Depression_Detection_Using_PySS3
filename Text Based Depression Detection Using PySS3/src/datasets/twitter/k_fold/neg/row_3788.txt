My 33rd birhtday.I can't think of any better place than this. 

On the 13th of december 1987, sunday, 16 something, I was born. Hopefully this will be my last birthday, ever. 

I don't even celebrate it, because what for, and with whom?

That's it. There are so many posts here, so keep scrolling up, or down.
