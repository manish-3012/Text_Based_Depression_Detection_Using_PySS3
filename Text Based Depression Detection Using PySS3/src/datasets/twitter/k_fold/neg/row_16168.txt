Thereâ€™s no fucking way you could justify meIâ€™m gonna kill myself as soon as I get the chance. Iâ€™m worthless. No, thatâ€™s too damn generous. Iâ€™m a dumb retard, Iâ€™m a cunt to everyone yet wonder why I have no true friends, and everytime I get one they leave me a mess giving no reason as to why. Everyone would be better off without me, and Iâ€™d be better off dead. I dated the most perfect girl ever. No one could compare. She had a radiant smile, dimples to die for, sparkling eyes that were the only ones I can stare into, and just an amazing body. She was so sweet, and made me feel like I was the best guy in the world, despite being the worst. Then we started getting distant, and I donâ€™t know why. Then we took a break to see if that would help. Immediately after, she called this other guy and started dating him. A day or two after, she told me we were through. Now, after I expressed I wanted to die again, she decided to check in on me everyday. This was the first day, and she ended up getting mad and telling me that we would never talk again. Iâ€™m thinking of a plan to kill myself, but I have no workable ideas. You canâ€™t convince me not to die.
