9 years down the drainIâ€™ve been with my S/O for 9 years total, 2 of those years includes us being married. Iâ€™ve messed up a lot in our relationship, like not being a better girlfriend/wife but Iâ€™ve always done my best being loving, loyal and there for him.

Last night, he decided to drop the bomb on me. He wanted to ends things and try to pursue something with his ex. I canâ€™t and didnâ€™t stop him.

My depression and suicidal thoughts have always been a problem and has affected me throughout my high school to adult life. I came from a dysfunctional family and everything else in life never felt like it was going right for me.

Iâ€™m devastated that it has come to this, because I really do love him. Maybe this goes to show how much of a fuck-up I am and that I am not deserving of love.

Thereâ€™s a lot of thoughts on my mind and suicide is one of the main ones. Iâ€™d be leaving my loved ones behind, but I can only handle so much. I think that.. my time is coming to an end. There isnâ€™t much to live for and I feel hopeless.

Iâ€™m sorry for rambling on. Iâ€™m crying as Iâ€™m typing this. But thank you to those who are reading.
