Why the fuck is depression so needy!Like fuck, I get it Geeshie you want to put a bullet in your head but does it have to dominate your entire life?  I'm  sick of feeling so emotionally needy twords my friends, I feel like I'm bringing them down with me and that makes me hate myself even more. Like yeah I'm going to die alone, yeah no one cares about me, yeah I don't have a future but fuck, that can't be my entire my entire life. I'm sick of feeling like I need to be catered to all the time, that all the attention needs to be focused on me. Can't I think of anything else? Fuck me in the God danm ear I'm so sick of myself. I should give myself an ultimatum either swan dive off the tallest building or move the fuck on with my life because I can't take it anymore! Fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK!
