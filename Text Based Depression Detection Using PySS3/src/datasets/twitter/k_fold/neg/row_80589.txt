I saw something on Facebook that made me really sadEnglish isnâ€™t my first language so please excuse the mistakes. Iâ€™m a 28yo male currently being treated for my borderline personality disorder. Tho Iâ€™ve been lucky to have support from my parents whoâ€™ve been helping me get treated for my â€˜conditionâ€™, I saw one of my friends posting an online funding website on his feed, trying to get people to donate to him because heâ€™s having suicidal thoughts and needs to be checked by a therapist or professional. I chatted him and asked him what happened but they were all vague answers and it scares me that he will do something if he doesnâ€™t get the help. He recognizes that something is wrong with him and wants to seeks help but he cant afford it,. To me itâ€™s just sad because even though Ive been lucky enough to get help that I need, he still hasnâ€™t. I want to donate to him but unfortunately I donâ€™t have the money either. What should I do?
