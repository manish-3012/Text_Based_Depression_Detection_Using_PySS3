My demons are chasing me and I think I'm ready for them to catch me so I can end it all.When I mean my demons. I mean my depression and ptsd and anxiety. They haunt me have been for years. Ever since I was 14, since that monster of a man ripped me apart and almost left me to die. I had to have part of my body reconstructed after what he did to me for those two whole days. And no matter how hard I fight or kick or scream. I'm still trapped in that never ending hallway. Restless sleep,hell no sleep at all sometime. I just am ready to give up. I honestly didn't think I'd make it this far. But honestly I'm so tried of fighting and getting nowhere. I think I'm ready for that dirt nap. Find someplace far far away where no one will find me dig a hole and just end it. No one to find me. Just me alone in the void. I guess its time for me to go. To all I love I'm sorry. But I just don't know who I am and how to go on. I love you all. Goodbye.
