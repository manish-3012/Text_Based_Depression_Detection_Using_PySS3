I'll begin to blog on here before I end it on Christmas Eve.There was one person who got me through the worst of times. They stuck it through with me and I stuck it through with them. Our bond and connection never faltered because of how close we have been up until now. The achievements I made and happiness I thrived was a product of our bond, a true fruit of our labor. But now it's as if the work to cultivate that fruit is forgotten. In the matter of a few days, a relationship of 2 years was destroyed not by wrongdoing but by her simple choice. This holiday and this next decade is one of opportunity and growth. Without her I have none, so I have decided to end it on Christmas Eve with 10000mg of Benadryl and alcohol. A near painless death in sleep. My decision has been made and as I experience the raw pain every day until the 24th. I will express to the world my story.
