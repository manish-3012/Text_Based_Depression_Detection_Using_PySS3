There's Only ONE Thing Holding Me BackPlease don't make fun of me, I'm 13 and everything right now sucks, no I'm not getting bullied, I'm just struggling a lot with school. I know for people that are adults you guys think quarantine is nice, but it's hell for me, I am struggling adapting to online school, I have ADD and can't focus well in school already, but now that we're online, it's gotten even EASIER for me to goof off without even realizing I'm doing it, I know that there are probably a lot of you rolling your eyes since you got dumped by your girlfriend or something, and I understand it, so please don't make fun of me.

What's the one thing holding me back? Well, me and most people in my family are Atheists and don't believe in god, so I don't believe in heaven, SO, I believe that, when you die, you just see a black abyss for eternity, or you just... don't exist. I'll forget everything, my parents, my friends. I don't know if other people that commit suicide do it just because they want their life to end and to go to heaven, or they just want to not exist and not see anything.

So yeah, if there was legitimate PROVEN evidence that there was a heaven, or ANYTHING other than a black abyss when you die, I would definitely end myself.
