I have been thinking about suicide for awhile nowIâ€™m a fifteen year old kid almost 16, I live in a dead end town, and I canâ€™t seem to be happy. I have a gun, I have plenty of reasons to live, but my reasons to die always show up no matter what. I wish I could just push through my struggles but I waste so much time, I want to live without worries of high school and class grades, but I just canâ€™t seem to shake them. I was in love deeply, for eleven months, but I left her, I regret it every morning when I wake up, and I see my fathers face in the mirror.


My father is in prison on attempted murder, he used to hit me and my mother when I was younger. And I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m the reason this happened, I canâ€™t help but feel like Iâ€™m the reason my mother is a crippling addict now too. My lifeâ€™s a complete sh*t I live in a hell, and I canâ€™t shake the thought of suicide. Iâ€™m failing high school, all of my peers hate me, my brother tells me to always look to the sky, that gods always got a plan. Iâ€™m not sure I believe him anymore...
