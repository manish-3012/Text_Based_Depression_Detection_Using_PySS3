I finished my Bachelor's degree yesterday. I'm sorry for the wall of text. I just need to get this out.Hello again, /r/SuicideWatch. My last post was a couple years ago, when I was twenty. I'm 22 now.

It's almost 4 am, and I'm sitting here in my room, on the brink of another breakdown. I know, I accomplished something good, by graduating, but I just cannot shake this looming feeling of just dread inside of me. So far, I try to see the good in what has happened, but so far, it been feeling like there's a lot more bad than good, like always.

Nothing has changed. I'm still depressed. Everyday, I fight to just get out of bed and get on with my day. I keep asking myself, "what now?"

I've graduated. I should be happy. I'm really not. I'm afraid of the future. I still have the same SHIT job, no friends, broke and feeling helpless. I can't keep forcing my way out of bed. I can't do it anymore. School used to be my escape, my distraction to how bad it has gotten. Now, all I have to look forward to is long hours alone, and my shit job. I'm just fed up.

Maybe I should have taken my own advice two years ago. Maybe I should have done it already. I really don't know where this is going, but I'd like to thank all of you guys here on this board for talking to me the last time I was feeling like this. Really. I appreciate everything this board has done, but I think this time, nothing will help.

Good bye, and good night.
