Just need someone to talk to.Iâ€™m at no real risk at all at the moment, just recently had that â€œoh wowâ€ moment in the past day and it kinda impacted me a bit hard. 

It recently struck me that Iâ€™ve already hit the high point in life, and that life is probably just going to go downhill from here. All I have planned for life is just for it to drag me down the river and see where it takes me. And it just makes me think â€œwow, that sucksâ€. My life isnâ€™t even that terrible but it just feels like Iâ€™m never going to hit that high point ever again. 

I just need someone to talk to, thatâ€™s all.
