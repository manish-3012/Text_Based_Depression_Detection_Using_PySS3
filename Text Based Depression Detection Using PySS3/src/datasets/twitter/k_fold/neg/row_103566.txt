The fact that I can die is the only thing keeping me alive right nowLife is tedious, if not rife with suffering. We have to jump through so many hoops just to survive. 

We have to be interviewed and be "passionate" just to get a job that we need to survive. Gotta go to school to study something and act like you like it to survive.

The list goes on and on really... till you're old and dead. 

Man, the only reason why I bother to put up with all these rituals is just so I know I can die at any moment. Don't really care about people who care about me, pretty sure they will get over it just like how they always tell me to.

Death just keeps getting more seductive, and honestly there is really no better therapy other than pretending you're dead, for me.

It's just such a soothing feeling to know that when you die... nothing matters... nothing at all. Job interviews, GPA, money, fame, status, relationship problems... all you can have then is peace and security. 

No more chasing the joneses, no more anxiety over your social rung on the ladder, no need to learn the 101 monkey dances and whatnot just to get a girlfriend. 

Life just seems better then.
