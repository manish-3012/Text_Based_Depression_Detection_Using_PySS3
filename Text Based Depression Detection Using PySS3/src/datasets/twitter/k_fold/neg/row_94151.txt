You have to care about yourself to feel sadI honestly hate myself so much that I donâ€™t even feel depressed anymore... just completely empty. When I cry itâ€™s for my family and the people who love me, because they deserve so much better than an empty shell of a daughter. The only reason Iâ€™ve stayed alive for the last few years is because of them, but Iâ€™m at the point where I just canâ€™t do this anymore. Iâ€™m wasting resources and my familyâ€™s emotional energy.
