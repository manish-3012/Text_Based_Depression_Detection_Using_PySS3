Have you ever checked in to the hospital for suicidal thoughts?Thinking about going. Parents are sleeping. Iâ€™m 24 and scared. Donâ€™t know if I should or not. I tried to talk to my dad tonight about my issues and it blew up in my face. He says that I blame everyone else for my problems (might be true) but it was a really nasty conversation. He said he is fed up. Pretty much just laid into me about coming to them when Iâ€™m crying and he doesnâ€™t know how to help. He later sent me apology and I love you messages (he is a good person/father) but what he said really got to me. There has to be some truth behind it. Iâ€™ve had a serious depression issue for 4 years. I feel like there is no end to this problem in sight. Not sure what to do. Iâ€™ve been to therapy so many times, Iâ€™ve tried taking many different medications and nothing is helping. I guess I am looking for a wake up call but am having doubts that the hospital is the answer. Please any helpful tips would be immensely appreciated.
