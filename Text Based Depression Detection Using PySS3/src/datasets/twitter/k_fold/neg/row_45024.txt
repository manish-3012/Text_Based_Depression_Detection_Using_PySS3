I want to die, but I am scared.I am scared of failing. When i was a teen i told my father If I ever attempted suicide, it wouldn't be an attempt. I would kill myself. I am working, can barely pay my bills. My husband of 4 years is going through the SSI machine because of ADHD. I have many demons in my closet and between those and the weight of supporting us both despite my own handicap (albino and legally blind) and my crippling social anxiety i can't do this anymore... I want to finish this stupid misery i never stared or asked for... But i am afraid of what my husband would think of me once i am gone. I wish someone would kill me. Get run over... Something. I am receiving therapy. Started 3 weeks ago.. Iam taking anti anxiety medication...  I feel empty and dead inside... What do I do? I figured what to do to end it but i am pushing the thought away... But it's getting harder
