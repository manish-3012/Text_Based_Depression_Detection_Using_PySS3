Why dont i have the balls to do it!!!It gets worse and worse and worse. Its been since early childhood. 2 decades of this is coming up shortly. Its not going to stop and its hell! Why do i stay here in this hell! I can stop it and i want it to stop... why dont i just do it... this will last decades more to come. 

Not everyone is destined to have a good life, and mine isnt going to get any better. I just need it to stop.
