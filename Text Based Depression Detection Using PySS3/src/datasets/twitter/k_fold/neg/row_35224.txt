I have nothing and need to dieThere is no future with me in it. Just a present where I am totally alone. Yes, more alone than you. I guarantee it. I am in a sort of constant withdrawal. Worse than a nicotine withdrawal. Maybe a few things could satiate it. All I've found is arguing myself into a frenzy. Getting more and more suicidal. With a real person. Crisis lines feel absolutely fake. I need toxicity. But I don't even have that.

Its impossible for me to not be alone. Why? Unattractive, trans, and autistic. Not only that, but a lifetime of building up to it. Indigenous histories. Living in a place of genocide no matter where I go. I need out before it all falls apart.

I feel like I need to break something and scream but don't have the energy or strength to. I just want to sleep. I'm sleeping over 12 hours a day now. Sometimes 16. I will wake up at noon and fall asleep at 6. Sleep until 1am. Maybe stay up a bit. Maybe shower or eat. Then sleep again until noon. Everyone else things this course load is easy. Almost nothing. for me its impossible. I can't do it. Please just let me die.
