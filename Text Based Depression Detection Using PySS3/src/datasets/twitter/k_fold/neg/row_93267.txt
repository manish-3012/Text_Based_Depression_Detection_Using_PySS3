Planning to die at the age of 19Im a student who is 14 years old, i feel like people just dont care and use each other as they please. Shit goes down for me everyday emotionally and i dont show it. Im like dying inside, the only time i show these affections is when someone mentions reasons that why most people turn to suicide. Ive been called an accident by this one loud bitchy person at school and this one person also calls me out in personal for not having friends when i chose to be like it. I play video games and read light novels to cure it but i dont know how long it can cure. Ive also tried fixing my procrastination shit when it comes to school but my emotions just drag on and makes me go to sleep. I dont do self-harm because inside of me im actually resisting the will. Thats how strong i am, on top of that i still feel like i have no mental ability to think at all. When it comes to genes i feel like ive only obtained the will to work hard but only towards my desires which is video games and these novels i read. My thinking and handling in common sense, ive tried fixing it by sleeping more but it doesnt help. So  went back sleeping 4 am and waking up at 7. Thats all i have to say, please suggest anything to help my resistance
