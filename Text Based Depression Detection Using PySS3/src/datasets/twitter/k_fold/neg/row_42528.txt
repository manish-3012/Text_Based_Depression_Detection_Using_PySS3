What should I do?My family life is shit at the moment. My mom goes from being the nicest person in the world to insulting me in a heartbeat, my stepdad means the best but can't help me, and neither can my brother. My dad is in a whole different country, so I can never really talk to him, and my other family really isn't an option either. Also, I can't stop lying and I feel that I have no empathy. I'm also having more violent impulsive behavior, making me an even worse person. I have no future that will help anybody, so I really think dying is the best option. I can't talk to anybody around me, and I can see myself doing awful shit if I'm allowed to live.
