My life is trash.Every time I fall asleep I dread waking up, because itâ€™s just another day of living. 

Every time I wake up, Iâ€™m disappointed, because every morning I wish Iâ€™d have stayed there, wherever I go when I shut my eyes. Because Iâ€™m happy there. Iâ€™m away from all this pain I have inside me. 


Iâ€™ve only ever attempted suicide once, and the only reason why Iâ€™m here is because the train didnâ€™t show up. I just got up and walked around my city. It was cold and I wish hypothermia had set in. I wish I had slipped and cracked my head open. 


Sometimes I hold my knife to my heart, and I love to imagine what it would be like if I had the balls to just end it. Sometimes I play with electrical devices in hopes I get the shock of a lifetime. 


I donâ€™t do that as much anymore. I just stay in my room and hope I drop dead somehow. 


Iâ€™ve been told time heals, but it hasnâ€™t. Everyday I want to die. Not a day goes by where I wish I wasnâ€™t around. My days havenâ€™t gotten brighter and I havenâ€™t found a sliver of hope. 


I always beat myself up because Iâ€™m too much of a chicken shit to slit my throat or jump off a building. I donâ€™t want my mom, or my brother to be sad. 


I know if I kill myself, others will follow suit, so many of my family members are broken people, and I fear if I kill myself Iâ€™ll set off a chain reaction. 


So Iâ€™ve been looking for special ways to die. So my loved ones donâ€™t suspect a


Maybe someday Iâ€™ll wander into a bad neighbourhood and act like top shit. Maybe Iâ€™ll join the army and do my part. Maybe someday, someday soon, Iâ€™ll actually find the courage to just kill myself by any means. 


Iâ€™m fine with dying. I donâ€™t have any talents. I donâ€™t have any bright futures. I barely have any friends and although I have great love for my mom and brother, I fucking despise the rest of my family. No one has any use for me. Iâ€™m never the person people reach out to. Iâ€™m never heard by anyone. Iâ€™m poor. Iâ€™m not handsome or physically attractive. 

Iâ€™m funny and I can lie to anyone. Thatâ€™s all I am. 

I do know that I donâ€™t want to live a long, sad, lonely life, and sooner or later, I will go through with it. 

Iâ€™m waiting.
