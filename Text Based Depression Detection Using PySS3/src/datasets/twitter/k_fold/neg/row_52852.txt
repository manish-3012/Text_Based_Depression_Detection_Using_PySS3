I'm always gonna be alone by myselfIt sucks. Nothing's ever gonna change. I'm always gonna be alone by myself and I'm never gonna have anyone and because of that I have no will to live and no motivation to do anything. That's what people don't understand. I can't have any will to live my life knowing I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life. I can't live like this.
