My life is at a complete standstill. It wont matter if I'm alive or dead.Seriously. The last two years have been rough for me. I worked my ass off the last 8 months to make up for everything, been nice to people, stopped smoking/drinking. I got rejected in an interview today, the result of which caused a big red mark on my profile. I can't do anything anymore. I'm drunk now and have decided it's not worth it anymore.
