27 year old vigrin losers last words.As the title says, I'm a loser with no friends no job no licence no money still live at home leeching off my mother. Have never had a girlfriend or lost my virginity. 


I am sad all day everyday. I have no desire to live at all, haven't for many years now but this year has been the worst. 

I dont leave my house I'm NEET and the only person I ever have to talk to is myself. I think about killing myself all day everyday, and now I'm just going to do it. I have literally nothing to lose anymore. I fucking hate waking up every morning I wish I would just die in my sleep.


I have no hobbys or passions, depression has killed any thing I used to enjoy. I hate everything, and if I do start to enjoy something, the depression kicks in and its not fun for very long. I am literally a waste of space. I wish i could have been normal person and had friends a girl friend and all that shit, but I was cursed to be a shy autistic fuck up from the start.


I love my mum and that's why I have waited so long to finally go through with this, but now I don't care that it will upset her. Why should I go through a life of deppersion and loneliness just so I dont  hurt somebody else who will die some day anyways.


I have written her a letter of apologize for being such a fauiler of a human, the disappointment I must have caused her  by now must be huge. I have also asked her not to have a funeral because no body will show. It will just be a waste of money and embarrassing.


Life is shit and I am done with it. I can't wait to never wake up to another day of misery again.
