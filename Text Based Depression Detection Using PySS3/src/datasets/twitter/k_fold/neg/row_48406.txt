If Iâ€™m going to live I just want to have funIf I am going to live life, I donâ€™t want to deal with sadness, anger, hurt, see people suffering, see tragedy, or anything else negative. I donâ€™t want to work a job I hate or pretend to be interested in things Iâ€™m not. I just want to do things that I like, which for me (right now) are to sit outside in the sun, travel to interesting places, spend days cooking fancy dishes in my kitchen, and in general, live a violently hedonistic life knowing I will never have to enslave myself to ideas that I feel are unimportant. Obviously not possible but does anyone else relate?
