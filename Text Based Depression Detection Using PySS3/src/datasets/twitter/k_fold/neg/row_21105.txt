Struggling for so long and never able to ventI loathe that I am so hopelessly unhappy that I want to die and that, like a cruel joke, if I tell anyone how low I am I am ostracized, berated, guilt tripped with "how selfish I am", and met with no empathy. The world keeps selfishly saying "don't want to die or you're a piece of shit coward" and miraculously wonders why depressed people don't reach out.
I've talked to friends "just stop being depressed dude"
I've talked therapists for years "take lots of drugs and if you admit you're super depressed we will ruin your life and flag you as a dangerous person"
So there's no one to talk to. Talking literally makes it worse it seems. The only reason, besides fear of going to hell, that I haven't killed myself is because I know my mom would die from grief. And now my mom managed to get diagnosed with cancer, bit by a tick and get Lyme disease, and get bit by a brown recluse spider all in one day. 
Considering I am recovering from breaking my legs and arm and feet from an accident and I still can't recover from my partner of 5 years telling me to go kill myself I just don't think I can hold on much longer. I can't help but see this life as a sick comedy with how terrible it is. "Laugh and the world laughs with you. Cry and you cry alone"

I guess I just wanted to rant and talk to myself. Sorry to bother or annoy anyone.
