I think I've had my breaking point.I've always thought about suicide and thought about how easy it would be to just not exist and when I thought about it it always makes me so scared and emotional but now I'm at peace and I'm calm. I think it's because I'm ready. I think i may actually have to courage now to go through with it. 

I guess I just kept hoping that eventually I would make friends and people would care about me but I'm a shitty person and people don't like me or care about me. I try to hard to make friends but I can't get anyone to stay because of how annoying I am I guess. 

My own boyfriend I can't confide in because when I do he doesn't want to deal with my pity party and that I get annoying when I hate on myself. If I can't confide in my own boyfriend, my one friend, who can I. Not to mention he's been "cheating" on me, flirting with this other girl, sending nudes, telling her how much he wants her. Makes me feel pretty worthless and unimportant and i already felt that way to start.

I feel alone. The most alone I ever felt. Even in High school when I was bullied I had friends. And now, nothing. Writing this is cathartic but I think it's mostly because I think I'll skip The Who goodbyes and suicide note thing. The last thing I need is to be baker acted. I just want it done. I'm stuck at the hospital I work at in Florida because of the hurricane so idk how I can go through with it. 

I just wish that I had been good enough for someone. Anyone.
