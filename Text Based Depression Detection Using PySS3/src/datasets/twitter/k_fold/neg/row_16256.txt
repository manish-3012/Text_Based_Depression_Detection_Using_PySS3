Itâ€™s inevitableWhy am I such genetic trash. Iâ€™m short and ugly, and avoidant due to that. I have depression and think about suicide everyday. 

If I had been born slightly different my life would be so much better, but Im not good enough to change it, and some things cannot be changed at all.

I canâ€™t increase my height, I canâ€™t change my bone structure, I canâ€™t go back in time and make friends when I could, I canâ€™t change.

At this point suicide feels inevitable. Iâ€™m literally one tragedy away from doing it. I have no one to stop me.
