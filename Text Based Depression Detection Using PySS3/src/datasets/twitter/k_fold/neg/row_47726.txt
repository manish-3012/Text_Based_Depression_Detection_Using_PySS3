Thank You All!!!Thank you to the few kind people who helped me here during my dark time. Ot was in 10th grade and my life seemed pointless and it seemed like taking my life was the best way to feel happy again. Im so glad I did not and took up the tips suggested by some of your awesome people here at /r/suicidewatch. I found a girlfriend who is the most incredible person in my life, I am always happy around her, and I feel happy and accepted by those around me. I am so grateful to you guys here, without you i probably wouldn't have made it to college where I am now.
