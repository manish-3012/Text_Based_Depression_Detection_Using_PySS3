Donâ€™t really know what to think anymore. Anybody have advice?Well Iâ€™ve been debating posting here for a few days but what the hell. Iâ€™m basically a depressed mess, Iâ€™ve been depressed for over 5 months now. I literally have 1 friend who doesnâ€™t understand me and bother with me which Iâ€™m starting to think are they my friend at all? I have no other friends left as I pushed them all the way. Iâ€™ve got the worst relationship with my family. I hate College, I hate people, I hate myself. Iâ€™ve also started cutting myself and It feels good at the time but I feel disgusted with myself afterwards. Iâ€™m known as a happy go lucky guy so whenever Iâ€™ve admitted to depression Iâ€™ve been called an attention seeker. Iâ€™ve got clear plans to end my life and I might follow through with them sooner or later.
