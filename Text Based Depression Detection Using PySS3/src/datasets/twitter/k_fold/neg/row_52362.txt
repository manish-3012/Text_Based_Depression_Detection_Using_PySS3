As a friend of several people who have told me about their attempts (even though they're not a pressing issue now), I'm wondering how to deal with  these situations.Twice now within several months my best friends have each confided in me with an attempted suicide. The first one called me the day after and I told him to tell his parents (whom he lived with at the time) and I stayed on the line until I heard him talking to his mom. The second one was tonight. Neither of them are in any emergent need of help, and the second friend has scheduled therapy sessions thanks to his girlfriend and mom. My question is, since I am not a licensed anything, what is the best way to go about these things when it's not an immediate issue but a long term one?
