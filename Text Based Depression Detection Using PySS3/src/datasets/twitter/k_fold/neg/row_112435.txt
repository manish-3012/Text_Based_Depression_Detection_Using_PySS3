I just got an adI just got an ad from the suicide prevention hotline and it hit me really hard. Just wanted to share it with you guys as I donâ€™t want to talk about it to my friends and family. I occasionally make a joke about suicide or being depressed like the memes from r/2meir4meirl for example and sometimes when Iâ€™m drunk I breakdown and I let the river flow, but everytime I shrug it off. The effect is that no one really knows I want to kill myself. And thatâ€™s why i found the commercial a little touching and in some way comforting.
