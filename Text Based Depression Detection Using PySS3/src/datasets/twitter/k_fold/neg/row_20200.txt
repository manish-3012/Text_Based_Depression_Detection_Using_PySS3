Getting better doesn't mean shit to meEverything I do has given me no changes for the better. I got a job I'm good at and gives me good pay and isn't entirely borin, and I have just bought a nice car so I finally have the freedom to go places and I just figured out that it was easy and fun to visit a freind which I really haven't had any of since I graduated college  and that should all be wonderful but my emotional state doesn't  change I'm still miserable on the inside it's been so long and I hate it all. I have the same depressing thoughts and would trade anything in my life now than to have whatiI had before it's pathetic
