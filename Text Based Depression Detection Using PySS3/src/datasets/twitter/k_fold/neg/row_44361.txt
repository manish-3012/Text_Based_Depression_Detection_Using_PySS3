I had a dream where I killed myself last night, what does it mean, should i tell my parents?so for context, the night I had the dream I was in a very bad place and almost killed myself, i didn't do it and cursed myself for not having the balls. this happens almost once and weeks and I regularly dont have motivation for things. my depression is impacting my grades and it sucks. and my parents tell me im just a normal teenager and my life is so much easier than they had it at my age.
