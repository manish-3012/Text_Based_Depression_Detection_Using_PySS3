What do I do...?So, I've been in love with a girl for 5 years and haven't had the balls to confess. And just last night, we were talking as usual, until I had found out that she recently got a boyfriend. I got upset, so I messaged her that I had to go, but she somehow saw that I was upset and asked what was wrong. I said that there was nothing wrong. She said that I was easy to read. I said that I wasn't. Then she asked whether it was because she had a boyfriend. I lied, and said "Nope xD" and one thing led to another, until she asked "Do you like me?" I haven't replied since, and right now I'm just bawling my eyes out and shaking, and I'm seriously ready to end it. I can't do this at all.
