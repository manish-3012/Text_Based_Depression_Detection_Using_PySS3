Just lostFor the last few years I have felt nothing but lost. I am a senior in high school at this point. I know the whole "I have so much life to live" &amp; "things will get better". I've been told that a thousand times, by a thousand different people.  I am just tired of fighting this feeling of not wanting to be alive. I feel so fucking alone, always. I feel like I have no one to turn to. I told my ex girlfriend about how sometimes I think like this.  She told me I was crazy and left me. Do you know how bad that fucking hurt? I know a lot of you go through worse than I do everyday, but I just can't help feeling like a piece of shit. Always.  And now I just can't seem to do anything but thinking about ending everything, moving on.  I don't know what would happen if I did, I don't know who would hurt and who wouldn't. I just don't know what I have to live for, I don't know why I'm even alive.  I am bad at everything I try, and have never made anyone proud.  I have nothing in my life anymore and all I want to do is move on.  I got in my car to end it last night but ended up going home. I didn't sleep for a second and I regret going home. I am going to drive my car into a tree and hope people think it was an accident so they don't think I'm crazy.  2015 was the worst year of my life, I lost so many family members it's unbelievable. I have no one to turn to anymore and I just can't fight this fucking feeling. 

Also, if anyone in my life comes across this: Sam lindenfeldar- I'm really sorry, I just want what's best for you and I hope you don't blame yourself. And dad, I love you
