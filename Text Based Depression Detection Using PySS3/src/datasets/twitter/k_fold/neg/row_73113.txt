I don't know what to doI have dealt with depression for most of my life.  Abuse as a kid and all that jazz.  When my dad died I went through a pretty rough time but I feel like I have come a long way in that aspect.  This past week I have had to attend 2 funerals, one of which was a very good friend of mine who committed suicide.  Our friendship was unfortunately based upon common experiences of childhood abuse, alcoholism and all the other shit that comes from being fucked up.  I now feel totally alone and feel like I should have been a better friend to him.  I know I shouldn't feel guilt in this situation but what if it was my fault?  This past year has been pretty rough and I can't help but wonder about joining him.  I don't think I will soon, but it isn't out of the question.  I am totally shy about posting shit on the internet so I feel like I am really putting myself out there with this.
