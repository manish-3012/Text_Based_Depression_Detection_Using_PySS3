I wanna dieI feel like shit, I look like shit, I am shit. I'm anxious every moment, every day. I wake up nauseous, it takes me a bit to get over that. I hardly eat, I'm way too thin. When I do eat, it's just a bunch of crappy snacks. I feel weak and hungry.

My brain is just really effed up too. I'm so up and down, I don't even know. I hate my bisexuality too, because I'm not right in the middle of it. I'm, like, a 5 on the Kinsey scale and never want to be with a man, yet somehow I'm a member of the bisexual community, and I can't relate at all.

Just tired and wish someone would shoot me, honestly.
