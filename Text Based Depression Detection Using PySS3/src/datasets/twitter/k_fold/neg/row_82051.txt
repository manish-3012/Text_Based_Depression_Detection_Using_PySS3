Help me please...Hello, I am a 2nd year college. Does anyone of you have an old laptop which you never use/broken but still functions? Can I have it? I badly need it for online class, I cant afford to buy one. I've looked for jobs and its hard for mw because I live in a remote area. I dont know what to do anymore ðŸ˜”
