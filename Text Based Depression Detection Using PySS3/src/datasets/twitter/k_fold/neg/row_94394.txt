Canâ€™t make friendsâ€œI canâ€™t make friends no matter how hard I try to put myself out there.â€

â€œOh, youâ€™re just limiting yourself to the friends you can make outside of the internet! There are tons of friends you can make online if youâ€™re shy!â€

â€œI canâ€™t make online friends no matter how hard I try.â€

â€œOh yeah, itâ€™s actually extremely difficult to make online friends outside of small hidden communities. Youâ€™re better off just making friends normally.â€

Guess Iâ€™ll just fucking die alone, then.
