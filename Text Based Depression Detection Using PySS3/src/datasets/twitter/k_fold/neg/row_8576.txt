Just sick of it allI just want to fucking kill myself. I'm such a garbage human being; I've done so many shitty things. I don't even really care about anyone but myself, and nothing in life interests me anymore. I've wanted to kill myself for so long, but I'm too much of a goddamn coward to do it. I tell myself I'll end it all next year or next month or next week, and I never even come close to actually doing it. I don't even know why I'm posting this crap; I already know that random-ass anonymous redditor is going to be of any help.
