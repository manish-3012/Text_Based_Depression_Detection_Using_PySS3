"Basically, what I'm trying to say, is be fucking happier. For crying out loud."I feel stupid coming to Reddit but I don't really have anyone to turn to. It's 1 AM, I typed up a massive post but deleted it all, and I have no one to talk to. I'm scared to call a hotline because I'm broke and should be homeless, but don't want something like this on the roommate's phone call history or whatever, if you can even find that shit.

I'm sick of being the butt end of every joke involving violence, dismemberment, death, etc. in my group of friends. People that I thought were my friends and were a safety net finally revealed they were sick of my depression after one of them snapped, "Basically, what I'm trying to say, is be fucking happier. For crying out loud." Everyone echoed in agreement and then proceeded to ignore what I was trying to say in return. I thought they were only joking every time, but now I look back at the past year and I can't help but wonder if the "Kill yourself." statements were sincere or not.

Everyone that I could turn to is now either against me, or more than a thousand miles away back home. . . I just wanna go home. I haven't seen my parents in years, I'm in a different country filled with people who want nothing to do with me other than my roommates, and I feel useless. I want to end it all, but I can't, because I know there's one person who cares. One person who would be crushed. And I can't do that to my mother. Not after she was "so proud" of me for graduating a few weeks ago.

But I'm poor and hungry and don't have anywhere else to go. I'm stuck, and I'm feeling trapped. I just want to curl up and die at this point. My life has become this downward spiral that I just don't see an end to. It's either now or fourty years from now when I'm a fucking waste in society and have nothing to show for myself. So why not just do it now, I figure.

I want to go home.
