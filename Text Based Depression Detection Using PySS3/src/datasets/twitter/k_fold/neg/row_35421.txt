Boyfriend keeps saying he wants to die. What do I do!???Boyfriend keeps saying he wants to die (21 M and F couple). What do I do?

Iâ€™ve been seeing this guy for like 4 months and I think heâ€™s an absolutely incredible, talented man. I tell him this everyday and he says itâ€™s the first time getting so many compliments. We get along very well.

However, he does definitely have severe depression. He canâ€™t really go see a doctor for diagnosis as heâ€™s in military and military will kick you out for mental health stuff. Heâ€™s struggling with school significantly and with getting everything he needs done. He hasnâ€™t beeen the best about hygiene and cleanliness unless Iâ€™m there. Whenever something goes wrong itâ€™s always â€œIâ€™m such an idiotâ€ â€œI f*cked up.â€ I have encouraged him to seek professional help and he did once in the past. 

He keeps making comments about wanting to die. Last night he texted me â€œbabe I want to dieâ€ while he was drunk. When I ask about a plan he says he has none. He also talks about our future together which gives me a bit of hope. However, Iâ€™ve had two close friends attempt suicide and see all the warning signs again with him. In March, I know he was very close to ending it

I have significant anxiety about him hurting himself especially since he owns guns. What do i do? I donâ€™t want to ruin his future as heâ€™s dreamed of being in military his whole life.

Im considering reaching out to his parents and having them come take his gun cabinet keys. I donâ€™t want him to be mad at me. What would you do in this situation.

TLDR: boyfriend (21M) says he wants to die and seems depressed. Heâ€™s in the military so Iâ€™m concerned with ruining his future. What do I (21F) do?
