Last day on planet earthI am a failure

I wish i was more special, but i'm a subhuman
21 years of pain, of joy and hope. I realize it will always be the same shit. 

You guys are great, i love this community, but i decide to go tonight

Its 2 pm here so i will have time to listen to music and go for a walk 

Tonight is the night
