I am lonelyI dont sleep well. Not anymore. There were times when i was truly happy and enjoying life. I had friends and hobbies that i was passionate about. These days i done even feel like im the same person. Like i dont believe that that guy was me.
I lost all my friends. I no longer able to do things i like. Maybe it's partly cause i dont even know what i like anymore. Its hard for me to admit that lonely. But i am. Most of the times i talk to myself.  Not that i'd be crazy but its just what i do to deal with loneliness. I also watch a lot of netflix. Its like a drug. I know that afterwards i'll feel bad and sad when i come back to my real life, to real me not the one that i imagine in the series, but nevertheless i'll do it. Just to get that momentary feeling of. I dont even know what. Like i matter. Like im not a disaster anymore. Sometimes i just feel like quiting life. Thinking something like: I wont ever be better or that i will never find a person that will actually care about me. Be happy when she sees me and sad when i go somewhere alone.
I dont even know why im writing this. Its 2:20AM im laying in my bed after 30min mental collapse and i just dont feel like sleeping even though i have  to go to school in 4hours
I just want to talk but at the same time i just wanna shut the door to the world and be alone in my room forever.
