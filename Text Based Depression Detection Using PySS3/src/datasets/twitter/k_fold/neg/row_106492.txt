What do I do now?I've struggled depression and anxiety since I was 10 and I used to frequently hurt myself. This was because I found child and rape pornography on my dads computer. Initially I suppressed what I'd seen but I suffered from anxiety, panic attacks and was terrified whenever he was home. He went to jail when I was 15 and I thought I'd get better because I moved out of the house and cut off all contact. 

I'm in my mid 20's now and I don't know why but the anxiety and panic attacks have stayed with me all these years. I don't really trust anyone anymore and because of that I distance myself from most people. I've been asked out a few times but I'm scared to be with anyone because I think if my own dad was capable of such terrible things why aren't other people. I try to stay optimistic but the more time goes on the more I realise I'm never going to really get better. I just want to feel better and have a normal life but no matter how hard I try I can't get over this.
