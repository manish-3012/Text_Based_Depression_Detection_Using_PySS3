What would you do?If you someone you loved unconditionally for so many years left and never spoke to you again, with this weight stacking up inside of you everyday, would you kill yourself? 
What if you had no more ambition, no hope, no joy- and you couldnâ€™t trust anyone to understand you or to help you ever again.
What if you ran out of distractions and ideas? 
What if you ran out words to say and thoughts to think. 
What if the only true relief from your internal misery was that person you loved coming back into your life, but you had to let them go to be true to them and what they want.
Well, obviously youâ€™d let them go, right? 
But then what? Letting them go doesnâ€™t negate everything else, so what do you do?
Would you continue living in this warped existential purgatory for 60 more years, never fully happy or whole again, or do you get of the ride and kill yourself?
