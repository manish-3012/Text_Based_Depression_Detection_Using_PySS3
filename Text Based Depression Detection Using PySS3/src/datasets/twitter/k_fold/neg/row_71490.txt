How to keep going?How do I  keep going when it's physically painful to be in my own skin? How do I keep going when my husband (the literal only person in my life) is chosing others over me. How do I stop feeling alone when I have no one to reach out to?

I've been taking way too much xanax,  but it's the only thing that numbs the pain. 

Please. If you know what I can do to make the hurting stop.. to make the wishing I would die stop tell me.  Im desperate.
