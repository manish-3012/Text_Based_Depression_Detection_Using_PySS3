Iâ€™m afraid of myselfI believe Iâ€™m too stupid to be at my college. Everyone else knows what theyâ€™re doing except me. I feel like a failure and like I only exist to drain my parents money. If I was gone, theyâ€™d be happier. I hate my parents. I hate myself. 

I almost killed myself last night. I canâ€™t stop thinking about it. If my husband hadnâ€™t grabbed the blade from me, I wouldâ€™ve done it. I wouldâ€™ve sliced vertically. I cut enough to fling blood all over the bathroom floor, my hands, my clothes... This scene will not leave my mind and I canâ€™t shake the desire to recreate it. Maybe I traumatized myself. 

Iâ€™m writing this in public where anyone could look over and see it. Maybe I want someone to see it. 

When I tell my parents about my thoughts, my mother tells me to stop pitying myself. She says no one wants to be around me because I bring everyone down. It reconfirms the belief that, at the core, it is my existence that is the problem. 

My thoughts are commanding me to die. But when I cry, I start repetitively screaming â€œI donâ€™t want to die, I donâ€™t want to dieâ€. I donâ€™t know what I believe. I stopped caring about whether the neighbors can hear me. 

I am lapsing into drug addiction to cope with my thoughts and actions. I donâ€™t want to do this anymore. I have an appointment with a therapist scheduled for November but it feels so far away and I donâ€™t want to keep suffering until then. 

I truly feel like I am completely worthless and that I have no attributes society deems worthy. I have always been ignored and tossed away like garbage and Iâ€™m starting to believe that thatâ€™s what I am. 

I donâ€™t want to die but I donâ€™t want to keep living like this.
