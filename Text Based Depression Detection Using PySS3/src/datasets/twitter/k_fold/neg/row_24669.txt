Why can't I just dieI've had 2 failed attempts this week and I feel like it's really damaging my brain but not enough to kill me.


No one understands. I can't talk to anyone about this. They're either too busy dealing with the same thing themselves or just won't understand how much I want this to be over. No, I don't want help. No, I'm not going to keep living my miserable life just to not sadden you guys. And no, I'm not like this just because I'm lonely. Is it really that hard to grasp?


I'm ruining my grades and my almost-non-existent social life to stay in my dorm room for days and try build up the courage to end it all. If I don't succeed, I'll have a huge mess to go back to, and I can't deal with it anymore. I can't do this. Why can't we make assisted suicides legal already? It's literally OUR lives to end.
