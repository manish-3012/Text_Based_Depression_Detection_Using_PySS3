Just very sadI never cry and I know I need a good one. It's been almost a year since my Dad died and he was the only person I could really talk to. My family is annoyed by my depression. I keep thinking about ending it tonight, but I also know that makes no sense. There's no logical reason for me to be this sad. 

The thing is, the older generation of my family took care of each other. I just feel used by my parents and siblings. When I was successful and earning more money, they took and took. Now that I am struggling, they are too busy to answer the phone. What is even the point?
