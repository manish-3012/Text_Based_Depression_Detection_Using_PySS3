I need helpFor the past few years I've been feeling extremely depressed. I've never really told anyone or sought help before. I'm writing this in woods behind my house phone in one hand and a bundle of string, ment for a weed whip, in the other. I've always considered myself a rational person and I know I won't act on my ideation this time, but for me I find that my depression comes in waves and I'm unsure how many more will come before I do something stupid.
