Everything has to be perfectLet's say I have 10 problems in my life and all of them is connected and they bother me every second in my life, to solve this problems everything has to go perfect just like I always dream but they will not, why would they? Why would anything be perfect for me? Nothing good happened to me without a flaw. All kinds of things can happen yet still my stupid head thinks something will go right. I just can't stand this life anymore. No one knows how fucked up I am because no one knows and loves me enough to understand my situation. I am just 18 but I already feel like my life is basically over, I don't even know If I'll be able see the new SW movie I shouldn't feel this way.
