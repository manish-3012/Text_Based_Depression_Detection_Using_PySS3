Can I be loved even though I have scars?I had my body botched last year through Cosmetic Surgery. It was the worst decision I ever made and regret it beyond everything. I have very visible ugly scars all over my body now, which I myself can't come to terms with. I have isolated myself since then. I dropped out of vacations with friends, have not even talked to a potential new partner since then. 

The surgery has definitely ruined my self esteem and my entire life. I'm 31 now and my clock for a family is ticking. 

Do you think I still have a realistic chance to meet a potential partner even though I am scarred for life?
