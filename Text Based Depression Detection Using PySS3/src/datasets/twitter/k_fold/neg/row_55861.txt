Lost my job and no with no way to vent because I can't pay my gym Membership I'm angry and thinking about jumping into trafficStupid title right?
But I used to spend something like 4 hours at the gym daily. 
Long story
Live in middle of nowhere Texas no jobs, no one hires me cause my name is arab. I mean 3 years of applying over a hundred times to McDonald's to me screams RACISM so to hell with anyone saying otherwise.

I just wish I could pay like.... a month of a gym membership and release all my anger at being poor on some weights. Life's sad. Wish I had weight equipment.
Considering jumping in traffic. Not being able to do anything besides goddamn pushups and jumping jacks is pissing me off. I don't want to do Richard simmons dances I need to work like an ox otherwise I'm depressed, mad and hate everything. :(
