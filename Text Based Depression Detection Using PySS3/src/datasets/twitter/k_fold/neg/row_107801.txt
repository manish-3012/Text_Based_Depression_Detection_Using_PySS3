Having a bad time and I don't know how to cope.I don't even want to get into the weeds with what's precipitated tonight. Essentially, I've had a lot of rapid fire changes in routine and life that has me feeling insecure and off kilter. I have a job where I'm not respected and there's a current situation going on there where one person is contributing to my extreme anxiety by manipulating our conversations to make me doubt myself. I have reason to suspect this is being done on purpose. 

As a result I've been feeling empty and no matter how much evidence I get to the contrary like no one likes me and it would just be fine if I killed myself. 

I also recently got into it with my supervisor and tbh he hurt my feelings. Tonight is the first time I've had a day off in 8 days and I was isolated all day. I went to D2L Revolution bc someone in another thread recommended it. Their 24/7 chat was down. I emailed to let them know and added that it felt kind of crappy to encounter that when this was my last ditch effort at getting some support. 

I went to 7cups and the site wouldn't load. But tbh I was relieved bc the last time I went there 2 years ago they person said I needed to be a better person and told me my ex fiance broke up with me for good reason. 

Then I tried another chat and it timed out and rest my place in line. Then I texted a crisis line and it was obviously a robot. 

A bit ago, I got an email back from D2L that said "Nit the only way to get help" which I found to be dismissive. I wrote back saying so. I realized after that there was an accompanying image that didnt come through the first time. So instead of a "oh well go elsewhere" it was like a "here are other options." I still think it was a bit short. In the tone sense, not in the length sense. 

Then the same person wrote back and mocked me. Mimicked my language and sentence structure and was just a dick. 

And I feel absolutely worthless. Even the crisis people don't like me. Find me so unworthy of care or kindness that they find it acceptable to mock someone who is seeking help and admitting to being suicidal. My logical brain knows I've hit bad luck. But my sad brain sees this as a pattern because of the other 7cups experience and if it's a pattern ot must be true! 

I am beside myself. My support system people are all asleep. I feel so alone and just...disgusting. Like I must be just foul if this is how the crisis people are going to treat me and I should just go ahead and do it so everyone can breathe a sigh of relief.
