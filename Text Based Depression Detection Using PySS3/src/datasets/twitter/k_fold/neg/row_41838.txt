Need hopeI'm 17 and I'm slowly losing all hope in my life. There are becoming increasingly fewer things that make me happy. I hate my home life, my work life, and my school life. I have one true friend I sometimes feel completely at ease with. I haven't been able to do homework lately because all i do is waste away in bed when I'm home. I'm meant to go away to uni in the fall. I'm afraid that going away will push me to the edge because I will lose the support of my dad and best friend. I feel like everything is downhill from here. I self harmed yesterday. It caused relief but I'm guilty and ashamed now. Anyway that's my rant. Not gonna do it for sure, But definitely contemplating.
