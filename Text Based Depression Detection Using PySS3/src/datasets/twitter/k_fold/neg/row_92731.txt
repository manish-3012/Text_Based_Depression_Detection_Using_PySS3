Lost and running out of optionsHey, r/suicidewatch, I don't have any idea what I'm doing here. Like, I'm contemplating suicide strongly once again in my life but this time I've grown cold and numb to all emotion. Caring about my friends and family and not wanting to put them through a such a senseless act is keeping me going but I don't know how long that will be enough. I'm 24 and when I look around at society I'm sick of what I see. Corrupt politicians, racism, acts of violence all for money, power or even just 15 minutes of game. It's rare to find a real sense of community anywhere I've looked and coming from a family who's never known anything but being poor and trapped where we currently are I just see no hope for an escape. I have a great paying job for someone who could never afford post secondary education but it barely helps me to scrape by from pay cheque to pay cheque. I appreciate a good challenge as much as anyone but I fail to see what point there is in moving forward. I don't see myself having children, I want to be the kind of parent who can support a child's dream and that just won't happen any time soon. While a common theme here seems to be about significant others I personally don't want to drag any woman down with me while I'm in such a dark and negative space. Oh and winters in Northern Alberta? The long dark and cold winters do nothing to help the situation. If anyone took the time to read this thank you, I just don't want to hurt the 10 people in my life who really do care :(
