How can I hold on for a few more days?It's my birthday on the 8th and I just need to keep up the lies until the attention dies down and I'm left alone again, a few days should be enough? I'm not a very noticable person. 

The people I live with are going to visit family next week and that's the only alone time I'm getting until Christmas. I'd rather not have my exit decided by other people's plans but I'd hate to be an inconvenience to other people's schedules. 

I've planned ahead and booked some time off from work and have what I need but it's just so damn tempting to get right to it knowing that I can.
