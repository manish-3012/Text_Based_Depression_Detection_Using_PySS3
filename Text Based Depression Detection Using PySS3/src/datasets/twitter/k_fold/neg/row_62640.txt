Tips for dealing with loneliness?Getting so rough dealing with this day in, day out. 30 years alone. Seeing everybody else with someone, seeing me alone. I dunno. It's rough. Don't want to hurt my parents - especially my dad - by doing anything. But it doesn't ever, *ever* get better, despite my efforts. Sitting at s group dinner with coworkers right now, seeing them with their SOs, and just feel terrible. I just don't want to feel so alone anymore...

I'll probably delete this later like I've deleted most of my other posts here. I just wonder if I can find any solace or reassurance here...
