I've never been so conflicted in my entire life.I'm not scared to die anymore. I have decided that even if I continue to live on, the repercussions of my actions are unavoidable. I feel so guilty and awful all the fucking time, I just can't talk to anyone I know about it. Whenever I vent to my friends I get an "oof" Or "um..", which makes me feel really awful, so I've cut everyone off to deal with this myself.
All I do is unintentionally make people worry about me, and at least if I died, there wouldn't be a need to anymore.
The reason I am hesitant to do anything is because I haven't even fully lived yet, but if I have to stick with my suicidal thoughts for the rest of my days, then I guess this situation unavoidable. I also feel really bad for my friends, even though my family wouldn't give a shit if I killed myself. Mental help is unavailable for me due to an unsupportive family, and I'm pretty sure all a counselor could do is tell my parents, which would lead to all hell breaking loose. Fuck it all, I know I will never live to make it to adulthood anyway. 
I feel trapped, and the only way out right now is to die.
