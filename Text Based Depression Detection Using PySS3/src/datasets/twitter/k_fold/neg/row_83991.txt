Can someone please give me a reason to stay aliveI attempted to jump off a bridge about 3 days ago but a bunch of kids who looked about 10 ran up to me and I didnâ€™t want to do it in front of them.
 
My sertraline &amp; risperidone arenâ€™t working, the only time Iâ€™ve felt happy for a week is with LSD, Psilocybin (I live in the uk where they are both illegal) and Solvent Abuse.

Iâ€™m currently 14 and I live with my mum and dog in this shithole of a town, thereâ€™s nothing, no shops, no public transport, nothing. Iâ€™m isolated from the people I like and living here is fucking killing me. weâ€™re trying to get out but 8 months is the most optimistic timeframe. 

My current escapes are -

A bridge which has a 5m (16ft) drop onto tarmac, it could probably kill me if I land on my head but I would have to do it right.

Panadol Overdose 

Risperidone overdose 

Hanging myself in the woods

Suffocating myself with a plastic bag

Going to a quarantine rave and trying to get COVID-19 

Abusing solvents until my heart gives out 

Mixing bleach and ammonia in my house 

Drinking hand sanitizer
