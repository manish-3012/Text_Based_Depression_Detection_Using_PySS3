I think my family is stopping me from getting help.So thos happened the other day. I talked to my folks about getting help, possibly going to the ER because I didn't feel safe by myself anymore and they told me not to go because I would miss work. 

Sidenote: I owe them money. And i live by myself. I was short on Bill's last month and they helped me out.

Anyway I dont know what yo do, I dont feel safe being alone and I dont have any friends in my area where I live that can check on me. I'm running out of options. I'm not a to see a doctor until October. And I know if i go to the ER they might put me away for a few days. That has happened before.
