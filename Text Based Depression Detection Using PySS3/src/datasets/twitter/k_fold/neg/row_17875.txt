How can I just die without anyone worryingI wish there was a fucking device that could erase the memories of my family, friends and anyone who has ever thought of me so I could erase myself from their brain. 

But this isn't fucking fiction.

And I'm called selfish for wanting to not have to deal with this shitty and pointless reality.

Eventually if im able to cut off from everyone, people will have no idea that I died. I fucking hate humanity.. fuck these idiotic fucking brains. I dont need these emotions and fucking horrible regrets.

I just want to no longer exist. Is that such a hard fucking thing to ask?
