Tomorrow maybe.Gonna get blind drunk tomorrow and see if i can pluck up the courage to slit my wrists in a quiet place. I could probably do it publicly and no one would care. I was crying publicly with my head in my hands for hours earlier, if i had to guess maybe 200 people passed by without so much as a second glance, someone even sat next to me at one point to wait for a friend, must have noticed my distress! then he and his friend start talking about fucking oat milk whilst im dying inside. Fucking oat milk is officially more important than me. I doubt theyd even give a fuck if i was bleeding to death. Some of the passers by even brushed past me as i sat and loomed over me as they passed from behind. Just close enough to feel utterly invisible and insignificant. Even those with smiles were impossible to connect with. Think ill find a spot in the woods tomorrow see if i can just bleed out alone, as iv been living for a long time.
