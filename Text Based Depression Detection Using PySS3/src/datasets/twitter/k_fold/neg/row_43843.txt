I snapped over spilling a plate of FUCKING DORITOS.How did I get to the point of snapping over a plate of Doritos? I'm not talking slightly pissed, I'm talking frothing rage where you aren't even screaming words anymore. It's a cycle. I snap over something dumb, I go through some self loathing, things slowly get better over a week or two, and then it starts over. Nothing helps either. Therapy, food, video games. Even my friends are drifting away.

It's fucking pathetic.
