Iâ€™m a dick and drunk!I really fucked up. I was having a good time with someone - someone who I enjoyed chatting with  but I messed up. 

I was supposed to be spending time with them, but I got drunk. I didnâ€™t realise my being drunk would upset them, but I should of. Anyone who was sober would have realised. Who the fuck wants to listen to some fucking drunk, rambling on? I just didnâ€™t think and totally pissed them off. 

Iâ€™m trying to balance so many balls, but what I failed to realise was that all the balls are already on the floor - Iâ€™m just pretending that Iâ€™m still keeping everything in the air. Iâ€™m faking it so well I even began believing the lie. 

The thing is, this person, for a brief moment when we chatted, I completely forgot about the balls. It didnâ€™t matter where they were. I was lost in the moment but tonight I failed. Being drunk ruined everything. 

Now Iâ€™m not writing this post for sympathy, to make them feel guilty, or as some kind of - itâ€™s not my fault please forgive me crap. My actions are my own, no one elseâ€™s. I just want them to know that appreciated the time I spent with them. That for the short time we spoke, they made a difference, and that I truly appreciated their presence - however short and random it may have been. 

Thing is, this isnâ€™t the first time something like this has happened. The common denominator?Me. There is no easy fix. If my attempt had worked a few days ago, then this wouldnâ€™t have happened. I would have been forgotten like a dream. I wouldnâ€™t have known their disappointment. 

There are a few things I know for certain -
1. I wrote this for myself. Iâ€™m not looking for forgiveness. In fact, I hope they never find and read this. They donâ€™t need to. 
2. Iâ€™m a dick. A complete arsehole. 
3. This world is better without me. 

I will fix this. I will erase my presence. I will make everything right.
