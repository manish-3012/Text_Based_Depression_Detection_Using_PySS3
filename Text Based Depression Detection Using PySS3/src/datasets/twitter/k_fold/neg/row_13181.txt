Had a plan to end it today but my therapist helped me hang on appointment before last. Couldn't go to my last appointment because of car trouble. That was my sign, I'm buying some sturdy rope tomorrow and doing it.I'm so sick of being psychologically abused, gaslit, falsely accused of shit and not even being able to do the same thing to others. And apparently my ways of thinking are logically reasonable but superficially appear to be manipulative, which must make it the case

So yeah this is it I guess. Actually excited to go to the store and buy rope tomorrow and do what I've wanted to do since I was a kid. I've done pressure tests before and know exactly how to make it so I pass out and don't come back.
