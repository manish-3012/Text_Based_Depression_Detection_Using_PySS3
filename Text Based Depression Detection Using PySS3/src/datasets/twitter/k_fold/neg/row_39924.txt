I might not be alive in the morning, but there's something more concerningI'm thinking very seriously about attempting to kill myself (again), but I don't feel like it's really me doing the thinking about it

There's things coming into my head and I can't stop them from nagging at me constantly, like a force pushing me to do things that are completely unreasonable, like intrusive thoughts but ..stronger and darker.

It's encouragement that I don't want and can't ignore

It's not right I didn't put them there it's like they aren't supposed to be there

This scares the hell out of me but it sounds a bit like schizophrenia and I don't know if I could live with that

I'm scared to go back to the hospital

I'm going to go drink heavily, since that's all that really helps me at the moment

PS sorry if this isn't okay to post here and for the terrible writing
