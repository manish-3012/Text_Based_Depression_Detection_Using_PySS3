Any words of advice?Hanging on by a thread and feel like I'm spiraling. Keep crying. Death sounds amazing right now. Planning to go buy a shotgun, pretty sure I could hold it together to get someone to sell to me. I want to check myself in somewhere, but know I'd lose my job. But I really don't want to die or hurt my family or the poor asshole that has to clean up my brain
