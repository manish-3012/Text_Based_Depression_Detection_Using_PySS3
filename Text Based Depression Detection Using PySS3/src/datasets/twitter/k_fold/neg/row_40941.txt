i wish i could not exist and come back when iâ€™m ready.i wish that i could just take a break from life. the reality of everything and how shitty life actually is. i hate that everyone expects me to have my life planned out by the time iâ€™m 18. i havenâ€™t even been here for 1/4 of my lifetime and iâ€™m supposed to know what i want to do for the REST of my life? i hate being forced to go to school. i hate that â€œbeing smartâ€ is determined by letters and percentages. i hate that i feel like a failure and a â€œbumâ€ if i donâ€™t keep moving or keep busy. 
 
i want everything to stop. i want to just live and be me. i want to love who i want and be who i want to be. iâ€™m so tired of trying to please everyone. iâ€™m so tired of having to meet a certain standard to SURVIVE in this world. itâ€™s so exhausting and iâ€™m so done with it.
