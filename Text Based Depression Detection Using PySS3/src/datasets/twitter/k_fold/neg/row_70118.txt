I can do it any day I want and that day is coming closerPoverty is an arse problem but homelessness is the worst. I can live with poverty but not without a home. I don't have a home and we have a guaranteed suicide bridge nearby so i can do it any day. Why does this stupid work have poverty and homeless. Especially here in the UK. So it's Xmas time and homelessness and having the bridge nearby. It is becoming closer and closer. I feel lost because I can't have a home. I just can't. But I can have guaranteed death just by jumping off this very high bridge.
