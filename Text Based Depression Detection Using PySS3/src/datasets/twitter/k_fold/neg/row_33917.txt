The only reason I'm not dead is because I'm afraid of fucking it up.Fact is, I'm so ambivalent about my life that it really wouldn't bother me at all if I died. I'm not afraid of dying because it can't be that much different than living like I am now. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live. If I were to die, if I could look back, I wouldn't be upset. 

I'm engaged. I don't love my fiance. He infuriates me, he's a child wearing a man's body. He's completely dependent on me and I feel trapped and frustrated by his very presence. He never learned to do anything on his own, he's no more a 'partner' in our relationship to me than my damn cat. I mailed out the invitations to our wedding last Monday; calling it off would be too humiliating for both of us. 

He says he'll change. I made him cry last night. I care so little about what happens, where he goes, where either of us end up, I just want to not be here, feeling like this, doing this. 

I can't stay with him, but I can't leave either. I don't know what to do and the only friends I have are in my fucking wedding party, so it's not like I can talk to them. 

I'm already on medication for depression that I know works (I have bipolar. I know what major depression feels like. This... it just feels like being empty). I've been suicidal before, several times. I'm afraid I'll get to that point again. I don't know what else to do. 

If this is in the wrong place, let me know. I just don't know where else to go.
