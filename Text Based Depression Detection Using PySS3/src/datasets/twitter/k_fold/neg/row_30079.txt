I cant go on with the path my life is going on...It is too much.Throwaway --- obviously...

I hate every aspect of my life, my relationship...my job...my financial status. 

I am about to lose my home. I have never said (typed) that out loud before. No one knows this and I am too scared to tell anyone. I am too scared to call the loan company for assistance. I dont have money to save anything. Bank account overdrawn, etc. I am scared. I feel that if I am no longer here it will just be easier for everyone since I have fucked up so much financially. 

The only thing that keeps me here is my child. They are 5 years old and light of my life. I do not want to leave them alone in this world. Yes, they will have the other parent and family, and I am hoping they will care for them as I have. I hope one day they will forgive me for taking the "easy way out". I just cant. I am waiting on a "hookup" for some pills to come through then I will just take them all. I am at my last...I just cant.

I'm sorry...I dont know where else to release this...
