I want to die without killing myselfThings have been better the past few weeks. I've been out. I met old and new friends. And yet I still really, really, really want to die.
I have a younger brother though. He's 12. Living with my parents. My parents are not great. They told me to live alone since I was 13, meeting me once a week (until I was 16, and then once every three months or so after). They admitted that they couldn't take care of me properly. They're not great parents.
I really want to kill myself. I just really want to die. Not because I'd be relieved, or anything like that. I just. Want to die. I don't want to be here anymore.
But killing myself is really difficult because I keep thinking about my brother. But I also want to die. Really, really, really badly.

I'm out with my friends now and the only thing I'm thinking of is ways that I could die. Maybe I shouldn't pay attention to where I was walking. Slip and get hit by a car. Or a bus. Or a train.
I don't believe in religion. But I've spent so much time praying that I'd just die.
Please let me die. Please make me die.
