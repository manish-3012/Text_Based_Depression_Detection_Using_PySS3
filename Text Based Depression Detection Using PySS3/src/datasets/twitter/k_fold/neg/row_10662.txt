Last night I had a dream that never felt so real.I'm pretty depressed a-lot of the time, But last night I had a dream like none other. I was happy for the most part and it went on for hours, at times I felt like I was in control and I don't remember feeling that relaxed in a long time. It felt so real and I actually felt happy, until when I turn round and someone I knew was sat on the window-sill outside of the window with the window shut. No one was really shocked about it other than me and my friend who just asked if she was alright before walking away. I immediately felt sadness like never before and woke up straight after. I can't remember who they were, but they just meant a huge amount to me and I don't know whether this has anything to do with me feeling suicidal. Whilst I was on holiday a few weeks ago I felt utterly suicidal at one point and put my legs out of the window for around 5 minutes before backing off. The dream was a really surreal experience, almost as though the person on the ledge was me and I was someone that cared a-lot. Has anyone else ever had a dream like this?
