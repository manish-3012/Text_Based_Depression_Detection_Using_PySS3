Just got the most "helpful" advice everSo I was talking with a doctors assistant, probably waaay over her head listening to my fucking problems, about my suicidal thoughts. My mom decides to chime in that "the doctor spoiled your plans bc he said you can't overdose on your pills."

Like, thanks thats exactly what i wanted to hear. I know shes probably scared, but it sure doesn't help to just hear that you just need to find another way to kill yourself.
