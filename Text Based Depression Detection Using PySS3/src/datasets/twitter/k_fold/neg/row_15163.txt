Doubt Iâ€™ll survive the weekIâ€™ve been suffering from depression for a while now but Iâ€™ve recently had a serious brain injury that means I can no longer use my left arm which makes me feel worse because I see myself as a freak. My family hates me I have no friends and Iâ€™ve never got close to a girl so I have nobody to turn to. I hate everything about myself, Iâ€™m a failure. Nobody will ever love me. I have no reason to live and every day I contemplate ending it and itâ€™s gotten so bad Iâ€™ll probably end it soon.
