I'm the real life Meg Griffin.For starters, nobody really cares about me. Throughout all of my school years with the exception of kindergarten and first grade, i was always the loser kid who had no friends and had to sit and eat lunch alone. Im 19 years old now and in nursing school, and i thought i would change but i am still in the exact same situation. People are always running all over me, because they know how insecure and shy i am, and i get treated like shit a lot. I am also ugly, thought its the kind of ugly where you don't really see it until you look at my face for a few seconds and your eyes settle. I have acne all over my face, and severe acne all over my back, and a weird nose, and you could probably park a plane on my forehead. The only thing i have going for me in the looks department is i have somewhat of a nice body. I don't know how im gonna be a nurse with how socially awkward i am. No guy is ever gonna want me for a relationship, so can anybody give me advice on how to deal with being alone forever in my hellhole of a life? lol
