This Has Been The Worst Month of My Life and I'm Ready to DieI'm not even going to use a throwaway because I just don't care anymore.

I had my 27th birthday last month. I was feeling pretty lonely and I was tired of being a virgin so on April 2nd I used Grindr to hook up with some guy. I'm not even attracted to men. I just wanted to lose my virginity. So I did. And I hated it. It wasn't painful. I just felt nothing. I almost overdosed that night. I spent the next 3 days feeling sicker than I've ever felt. But when it was all over I realized I was okay with dying. I've dealt with these thoughts in the past but my attempts were always half-assed. I know next time will be the last time.

I've dealt with severe arm pain for nearly 3 years now. It's prevented me from finding work. I have no money. My insurance doesn't pay for much so I can't get my arm fixed. It's gotten worse over the years and now my whole arm is nearly useless. I wake up crying at night because it hurts so much.

That's just a small slice of my medical agony. I'm also MtF trans but can't transition because of insurance/family/etc. You'd think transitioning would be a higher priority on this list but honestly I gave up a long time ago on that. At this point I'd rather just die.

I've just felt alone my whole life and I feel like all my "friends" are leaving me behind. I've got friends becoming nurses and therapists and managers and teachers and I can barely write my name without being in pain. I can't even get a minimum wage job. I'm fucking useless.

Between my health and depression and everything else I just feel like it's finally time to give up. I lose. Nothing new. So I'm going to tough it out and watch Infinity War and then probably kill myself.

Edit: I feel like I should expand on why this whole month has sucked. Losing my virginity wasn't really a problem. It was the fact that since then I feel almost traumatized by the event. I can't get it out of my mind, but thinking about it makes me feel sick. Compounding with my depression there have been at least 2 days this month where I spent the entire day crying and dry-heaving. If I'm not crying because of that I'm crying because of the pain in my arm. The only thing my insurance really pays for is certain medications so I've been taking advantage of that. But it takes me 6 Aleve and 3 Gabapentin just to feel slightly okay. But I can't take that many pills every time my pain flares up because I'd be going through a prescription bottle a day. The only reason I'm not dead right now is because I spent the last 10 years of my life waiting for Infinity War. That's how pathetic my life is. Waiting for a movie before I end everything.
