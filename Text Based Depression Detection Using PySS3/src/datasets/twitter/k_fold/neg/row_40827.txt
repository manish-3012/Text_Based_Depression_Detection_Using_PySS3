How do I get rid of this "call of the void"/intrusive thoughtsTitle says it all, but for context: whenever I'm not distracted I just start thinking about killing myself/ random violent things. Especially while going somewhere (I cycle nearly everywhere) or at night. I think it's a bit of a "leftover intrusive thought" from a time when I did contemplate suicide and even though things have changed and I don't think I'm even considering it anymore, I catch myself having these awful thoughts. 

I think they're that "call of the void" that people describe (like when you're on a tall building and you think "I could technically jump, but of course I'd never do that!"), however it's not really as neutral as that and it usually ends up with me fully playing it out in my head and seeing my grieving family etc. So many times if been crying on my bike, arrived somewhere completely drained or ruined a good night of sleep for myself! Anybody know any way to distract yourself/learn to think differently etc.??

(PS listening to happy music or anything doesn't help, often makes it worse)
