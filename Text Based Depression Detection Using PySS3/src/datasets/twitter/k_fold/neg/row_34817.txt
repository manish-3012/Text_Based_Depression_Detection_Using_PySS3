No one cares if you are depressed and suicidalHonestly. All people want is to gain something from you, if you don't benefit them they have no need for you. I've seen this time and time again. When I post attractive selfies suddenly everyone is my best friend. When I talk about depression which is rare no one wants to know they avoid me like the plague. My own family didn't give a shit about me on christmas/my birthday every year because I can't get a job so no one can get money off me. Social media is this fake bullshit thing and it's all nonsense. I talked about my boiler breaking during this winter and how miserable I am no one said a thing yet when I posted an ass photo everyone loved me. I hate the world. I hate how my family mentally abuse me I hate how I don't have one single friend. I hate how poor I am and how the only place i can vent this is reddit
