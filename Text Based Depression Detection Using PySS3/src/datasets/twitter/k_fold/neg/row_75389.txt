Just wanted bye to this sub (NOT suicidal anymore!)Around 1.5 yrs ago I became depressed. Nothing felt real, I would have crying episodes for around 2 hours at a time. I would self harm every-night before going to sleep. I ripped a lot of my hair out. I also thought about death and suicide, nearly every night I would hope that I would die in my sleep. I would always think about how to kill myself I looked for places to potentially hang myself, I would look up how to extract cyanide from seeds and pits of fruits. I would look for places to jump to my death. I would imagine myself jumping into a train. During that time I really wanted to die. If I had a gun during that time I would be dead, I would have shot myself. I would have committed suicide.

Luckily I am MUCH better. I have posted on this sub before and I just wanna say thanks to everyone who has been there for me during my harder times. To everyone who feels like shit, though it seems like life will never get better (I have denied this before) it will. Good luck and hugs to everyone here.
