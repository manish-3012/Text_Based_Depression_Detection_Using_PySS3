does someone as terrible as me even deserve to eatim truly awful. selfish and annoying. i deserve nothing but the worst treatment. letting me eat is the same as throwing perfectly good food away. in fact i donâ€™t even deserve to breathe, just the fact that im taking oxygen should be a crime

i feel like my mind was conditioned to think a certain way. my parents did it. because of them i think like this. but im too fucked up and thatâ€™s my fault. i hate how my mind works. i hate myself. but i cant imagine living any other way. itâ€™s become a little comforting now. hating myself is the one constant. i care about nothing else 

my friends donâ€™t deserve trash like this. when they pick me apart and point out my flaws i can only think that itâ€™s what i deserve. im an asshole, im lucky to have anyone who will spend time with me. but thatâ€™s why i should kill myself. im just a roadblock to their happiness

iâ€™ll disappear. hopefully no one will care for filth like me. no one should. what a mistake that would be, caring about something lower than trash

in oldboy thereâ€™s a line that goes â€œeven though im worse than a beast, donâ€™t i deserve to live?â€ when i apply that to myself, the answer is no, never. im barely a person at this point, i donâ€™t deserve to live. yet here i am, still being selfish. im a train thatâ€™s going off track, faster and faster plunging towards my death, bringing others down with me whether i like it or not. this train is about to go off a cliff
