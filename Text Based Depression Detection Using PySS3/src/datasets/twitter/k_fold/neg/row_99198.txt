I want to die on a beachi want to die on a beach. the warm sun on my body, the sound of the waves, the cool breeze. then iâ€™d just pull the trigger, and be gone in peace. I can buy a gun in my
state at 18, so only a bit more to slog through. Then iâ€™ll take a trip, go to cape cod, or oregon, maybe south africa, or the mediterranean. i just hope my family or friends wonâ€™t take it too hard, i know they will though. i hope that the afterlife is just a forever beach day. No stress, nothing bad, no pain that comes with the real world, just a life by the beach. i know it wonâ€™t be like that but it will be infinitely better than my life now. i know that i wonâ€™t live to college, and i can only hope that i will die by the beach. no worries, no pain, just calm and tranquility. iâ€™ll probably end up dying in the parking lot of the gun store, sadly, but one can dream.
