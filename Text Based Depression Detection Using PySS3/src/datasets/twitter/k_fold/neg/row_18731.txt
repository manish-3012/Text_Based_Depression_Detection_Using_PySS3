I needed a creative outlet, so I wrote a poem. I hope you all enjoy.Every time I close my eyes, 
I can see myself lying on the slab. 
A thin sheet covers my body; 
my lips are the faintest blue. 
The warmth has gone from me, 
My body is finally still. 
I never wanted anything. 
I want nothing. 
I want no-thing. 
I donâ€™t know why i am here with you now.
