I dont know what else to do anymore.I have been dealing with depression for the last 8 years of my 22 year life. 
I have been on antidepressants for the past 4 months. To make  a long story short, my decisions yesterday have led to my whole family despising me even more then they did. I live in my dads house and he will be kicking me out tomorrow. I see no way out anymore, just a dead end.
I have been searching for ways to kill myself all day now. 
I have decided to take all of my imipramine.
Please.. help me
