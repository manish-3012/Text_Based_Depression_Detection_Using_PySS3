Everyday gets harder for me, I donâ€™t know how much longer Iâ€™ll be able to last..Everyday is the same thing, I wake up wondering why I couldnâ€™t just of died in mine sleep.
I listen to my parents talk about how lazy and how useless and how much i mess up everyday.
I lose every job and everything good I get coming in my life cause I just mess it up.

I wonder why I even try to live, my dad told my mother he wents me out the house this weekend.
I donâ€™t know what Iâ€™m going to do, I have no money and just a car, no friends or family members who talk to me.

I think about killing myself all day, it makes me feel so good and just relaxes me but I feel like I been thinking about it so much itâ€™s became a reality to me to kill my self before I turn 20 this summer. Just need do abit more research on how Iâ€™m going to kill myself so it works.
