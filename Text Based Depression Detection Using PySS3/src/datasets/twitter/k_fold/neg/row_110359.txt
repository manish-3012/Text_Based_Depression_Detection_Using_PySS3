Summary of my yearSorry in advance if this isn't the right sub to post and for any spelling/grammar errors.
Also sorry if parts of it is incomprehensible I wrote it just so I can organize my thoughts and look back at how I was at the beginning of the year.

I'm an 18 year old male that just moved from home for the first time abt a month ago to University. Whilst living at home I had previously attempted to kill myself and self harmed on a frequent basis. 

April was the month I attempted to take my own life; I was doing well in School and had just been given a conditional offer to my first choice University. However, despite this I was depressed I didn't see the point in looking forward for the future or enjoying the present. In the beginning of April I attended a party with a few friends and drunkenly told one of them of my intentions. She was obviously concerned as she had also previously attempted numerous times. She encouraged me to talk but her concern sobered me up quite quickly and I managed to tell her little to nothing of my real intentions and remained quite for the rest of the night. All ready feeling low and now embarrassed that I had burdened my friend I was on the edge. By the end of the month I had managed to get a job interview at a local restaurant. I left my house early in the morning of April 23rd intending on going to the job interview despite being in a terrible state of mind. Once I arrived near the restaurant I had overwhelming feeling of dread and had low expectations for myself. I tried to compose myself and give myself time to think by walking around the town again and again; but nothing happened it persisted and I hit rock bottom. I'll skip over the details of how exactly I attempted I'll just say that I was interrupted and left the scene. That day I walked about 20 (which is a lot for me) trying to figure out my plan of action I returned home disappointed that I didn't go through with it but masking it away from my friends and family. 

After my attempt on my own life my self harm and thought of suicide got significantly worse. However, during May/June I was holding out because I had Uni in the back of my mind and thought that I might be able to "get better". 

June 2018 was probably the worst month in terms of how I felt about myself. My self harm had gotten to it worst point and suicide seemed to be everywhere I looked; For example Anthony Bourdain, Kate Spade and for the first time to my knowledge suicide had impacted my family it wasn't someone I had met a lot but I think her death made suicide very real and showed me that it could be an option. I would research about the "best methods of suicide" and the "most fatal suicide methods" and was now beginning to plan an attempt; which was different to April as that was rather spontaneous. I resisted the urge to kill myself in June and told myself that I should celebrate my birthday in July first

During the end of June/ beginning of July I went on holiday with my family abroad. I wanted to enjoy it but throughout most of it I was just paranoid that they will see my self harm scars. Eventually they did spot them but I blamed the cat and left before they could say anything else. Kind of embarrassed from the encounter I decided to self harm more discreetly and more frequently. That sufficed throughout July despite wanting to kill myself almost everyday. However, by the end of the month the sudden dread hit me that I might experience a similar event in University if someone spots my self harm scars and so I slowly began to stop self harming.

August came and the thought of suicide were less intense and my self harm had stopped (briefly). I was "excited" for the future and what University could bring.

September was a weird month because I had moved out with all these expectations; looking back I was quite ignorant lol, thinking I would easily be able to socialize with new people in a new city and in a completely different environment. I spent most of the first week in my room panicking over the smallest of things but I still made sure to go to my lectures. Freshers week finished and I managed to miss all of the events and join no societies/clubs, I had perhaps missed the easiest opportunity to make friends simply because I was to anxious to go out. I was disappointed in myself and so the fact that I didn't manage to make a single friend pretty pathetic. By the end of September I had begun to self harm again (on a infrequent basis).

During October I missed more and more lectures despite being wide awake and able to attend them I hated the thought of being in a room with 300 - 500 people. The self harm persisted but not to the extent it had been in April - July. I got more confident in myself and started to participate in the few lectures I attended. I still haven't made a group of friends and haven't completely stopped self harming. The thoughts of suicide still persist but not to the extent where it significantly disrupts my life. What I'm afraid of is the fact that I was in this exact state of mind earlier on in the year before I attempted and in July. I feel like something is bound to come to push me over the edge.

I haven't made an appointment with a councilor or GP to see if they may be able to medically diagnose me with something. However, I have realised that I seem to hit rock bottom every few months; last time being July and am expecting to reach the same low point soon which is going to destroy my productivity and put me under more stress seeing as I'm already behind from the lectures I have missed.
