I've settled on a date.I'm going to do it on December 29th. I would like to spend one last holiday with my family, but I don't want to live to see another year, so I think it's a good day to die.

Now to get my affairs in order. I'm married with no children, and my wife is my beneficiary. I really don't want to leave her with a lot of debt.
