third microattempt this monthI'm 17 for the record.
I just feel like I want to die. Not just get away from my current situation. I specifically want to die.
I tried once at the beggining of the month, the guy I love stopped me and told me he loves me.
Tried again the day before yesterday, he stopped me again.
This time he's not around to stop me, and I think now is the time.
