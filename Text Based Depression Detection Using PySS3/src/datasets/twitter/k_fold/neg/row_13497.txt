My cousin recently took his own life. I want people to know there are those that care about them, there are those that know their pain. You are not alone.My cousin recently took his own life.

I have dealt with depression most of my life, I know plenty that have. I'm always a mental health advocate but with what happen close to me recently I just want those that are down or feel hopeless to know you are not alone and to ask for help. Its worth hanging around on this planet for a while although it at times doesn't feel so. Hang in there.
