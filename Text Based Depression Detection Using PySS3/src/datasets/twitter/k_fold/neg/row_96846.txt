I don't see myself ever living a life that I can enjoyI think about ending it every day. I end up in tears for no reason several times a day. I just want to die. I need to get a job, everyone's reminding me of this and trying to help. I'm making every effort I can but I've been putting a lot of energy into not killing myself. I don't know if I'll ever get a job, and if I do how am I supposed to keep it? I just want to die. What if the job I finally get makes me hate life even more? 

Is there anything I can do? I hate disappointing my family, that's why I've been putting any effort at all into looking for a job. They would not understand if I told them I was suicidal. I am unable to get therapy and address my suicidal ideation so I'm just stuck dealing with it while trying to become a functional human being. I know it's going to overtake me.
