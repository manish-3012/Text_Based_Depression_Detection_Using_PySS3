I'm on the verge unfortunatelyIm 22 and I have to work to provide for my family cause no one else works and I never get to use money on myself only for bills since my dad left years ago i have to provide for my family. SO FUN RIGHT????.  I cant even go to the mall cause i have no friends and im so alone. I go home to a house that i hate constant yelling and arguing. Whenever i try to make an excuse to not go to work because of these suicidal behavoirs, I get constantly made fun of for being a pussy but no one knows that im tired of living so whenever Im at work i just clock out and cry til its time to go home and the cycle repeats.I dont even get paid much anymore. IM SO TIRED OF WORKING AT A JOB I HATE FOR A FAMILY IM KEEPING HELD HOSTAGE FROM BECAUSE WE HAVE NO FINACIAL SUPPORT. WHY DO I JAVE TO DEAL WITH EVERYONE ELSES FUCK UPS AND GET NOTHING IN RETURN IM TIRED OF IT AND DEATH HAS TO BE BETTER EVEN IF I END UP IN HELL IT CANT BE BAD AS THIS HOLY SHIT
