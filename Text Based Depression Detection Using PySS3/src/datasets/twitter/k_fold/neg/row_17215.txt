Living livingIt's so easy,

just one more breath to take

just one more dab of sweat

just one more look outside the window

or just one more step to take.

It's better to keep living now,

as there's just so much to explore

so many things, I've just,

never, seen, before.

Maybe just wash up for 

a while.
