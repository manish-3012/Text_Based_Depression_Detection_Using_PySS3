My mom says I'm psychologically abusiveI have a temper and I yell but that's my desperate need to get my point across I have never been violent or made physical advances or threats to anybody.  I've been desperately trying to get my mom to understand how I feel lately because she said some really mean shit to me and I wanted her to know it's not helping it's making it harder and I told her I wanted to kill myself.  Today her and her boyfriend, who I dislike very much, told me that nobody believes I want to kill myself or that I'm mentally ill but that I'm just rude and disrespectful.  Part of me wonders if I should just take all my Lexapro and get it out of the way now.  But how much Lexapro is enough to OD but not enough to throw it all up?  Thank you
