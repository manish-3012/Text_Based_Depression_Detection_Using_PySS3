Life just suxAnd it too much pain of being alive.

Each day is just 20 hours of constant pain, and reminder of how alone i am in this world.

Nothing helps. 

No need to tell me things will change, cause they wont...or maybe when they change, it will be too late.

I dont want to find someone when im 70 years old.
Thing never change for me, for some they do, i am not the one.

No need for telling me you love me, as you dont know me, if i have someone next to me telling me that they love me, i wouldnt be thinking bout dieing. 

Thats it.

We probably meet again when i am on the edge once more.

Take care
