I should not be alive. I was meant to die that day.I am currently detained under "Section 3 of the Mental Health Act" at a secure hospital. I have some leave to my parents house so I am able to access a computer.

2 weeks ago an opportunity presented itself where I was able to leave the ward and so I quietly gathered my things, took a bus to the city, purchased 96 paracetamol tablets and a litre of vodka.

I knew I had to find somewhere secluded and vacant in order to successfully put an end to things. I wanted nobody to find me.

Now, I know paracetamol is unlikely to kill you shortly after taking an overdose and that the actual process of dying is extremely painful and traumatic, but at this point I didn't care. I knew I could never bring myself to jump off a bridge or step under a train and I certainly didn't want to cause an accident and so this was the only accessible method I had (I had wanted to take a heroin overdose but had neither the money or the contacts). I also knew that I am allergic to the antidote they give you in order to prevent the damaging effects of paracetamol.

I was absolutely certain I was going to die. I cannot find the words to properly express how I felt that day. I felt like a ghost.

So, once I had everything I needed, a popped every pill I had and began swallowing them with the vodka. About 60 pills in, I remember looking at my hand and seeing it shaking violently, I felt drunk, but something seemed very different this time. Once I had finished all 96 pills, I felt an intense wave of serenity and calm flood through me. My vision began to fade and I remember everything turning "silhouette black".

It was at this point, when I knew I had reached the point of absolutely no return that I thought suddenly occurred to me;

**what if I had waited one more day?**

What if I could have had one more delicious meal? One more loving encounter with my parents? One more laugh at a stupid joke? I have abandoned everyone I know and I will never see them again.

I didn't panic or suddenly seek help. I just remembering thinking *what a waste*.

The next thing I remember, I woke up in hospital in intensive care.

It turns out a taxi driver had badly needed to relieve himself and had pulled up against the side of the road. After walking through the bushes to find somewhere private, he found me; unconscious and covered in blood (it turns out I had been vomiting blood).

An ambulance was called and as we raced to the hospital I began having a seizure followed by respiratory failure. I was put onto life support and my parents were called. They didn't know what was going to happen.

If it hadn't been for that man who found me, I am completely convinced I would not be here now, typing this message.

I have lived through this experience and now I know:

**SUICIDE IS NOT AN OPTION**

If I had died that day, it would not have changed a THING. None of my problems would have been solved, I wouldn't have felt the "relief" I was so desperate for, that would have been the end of everything. I would have entered the abyss, the nothingness, the eternal end.

If you have ideas about killing yourself or any serious plans, ask yourself; *what do I honestly think is going to happen as a result of this?*

If I ever find myself in a position where I feel as determined as I did that day. I will immediately tell someone.

Don't do it, there is always more, there is always hope, there is always help! It is either what you have now or NOTHING.
