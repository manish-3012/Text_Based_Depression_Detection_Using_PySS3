29yr old female, gambling addictThe stress of this addiction has taken its toll on me physically and mentally. My thoughts are a constant roller coaster of â€˜everything will be fineâ€™ to â€˜just put yourself and everyone you love out of miseryâ€™. 

If it was only money that Iâ€™d lost then I could live with myself. But Ive lost respect for myself, Iâ€™ve lost the ability to be honest with other people and Iâ€™ve lost any sense of normalcy that I ever had to begin with. 

My family has helped me out before, they were incredibly kind and understanding, but made it known that it canâ€™t happen again. That was around 2 years ago. Since then Iâ€™ve built up a lonely web of lies, about why Iâ€™m skint, why I go out, all sorts of things. 

I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t stop myself. I feel faulty.

Iâ€™ve managed to get a job that will remove my ability to gamble from Mid October to January. I canâ€™t gamble online. I have a way out of this hell for at least that period.

But I need to find Â£350 by the first of October. At this point, Iâ€™ve got nothing left to sell, nobody left to ask, and I am completely on my own. 
I am going to a GA meeting for the first time on Thursday, which is the same time I plan on telling my closest friend who I know will be understanding and I am not afraid of letting her down as itâ€™s an unconditional friendship. 

I wonâ€™t harm myself. Mostly because Iâ€™ve tried before and Iâ€™ve seen first hand how it broke the people I love down. If I canâ€™t live for me then Iâ€™m determined to live for them.
But the thoughts wonâ€™t go away. It feels like itâ€™s always an option, even though I know better. 

I know that things can get better and I know that I can change. I really want to. But I canâ€™t get over how much I hate myself. Iâ€™ve phoned help lines and spoken to doctors. 

Iâ€™m so sorry that this is so depressing. Iâ€™m scared of myself and my lack of impulse control. 
I just need someone to tell me that things will be okay. If anyone has ever been in this situation and come out the other end - please let me know. Talking to my family is not an option.
