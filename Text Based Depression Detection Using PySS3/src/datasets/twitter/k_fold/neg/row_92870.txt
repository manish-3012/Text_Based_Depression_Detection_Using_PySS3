My health, loneliness and past relationship are catching up on me.Hello folks.

It's been two and a half months since the guy I dated for a year and a half have broken up. I'll start with some back story and copy something I wrote recently;

Few months back, I was admitted to hospital and put on a high dose of steroids as my crohn's had flared up. It was a pretty lonely time and stuff, but I was dealing with it. Rang me once whilst I was there, was drunk and it was 1AM. Basically saying he loves me and what have you.
Fast forward a few days, didn't hear back from him. Tried to call his phone but he turned it off. Didn't come on Skype either. Didn't even call on valentines day.
Then finally he turns up on Skype about a week later, but to blame his inactivity on "being skint". I flipped, said it was selfish and just said I'll talk to him another time, as he was being outright rude and disgustingly brutal. All what he replied with was "No, you won't, we're done. :)". He never called or texted me again.
Shortly after I was diagnosed with Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis, and at the same time he was trying to hook up with people on dating sites.

All in all I'm having nightmares, getting the shakes and daily suicidal thoughts. I'm also on Prednisone (20mg) along with Azathioprine which isn't helping anything. I feel stupid, numb and dumb, and now struggle with conversations. My health is stopping me from being the person I once was, and without it I'm lost.

I'm scared of myself at this point, and shaking as I write this.
