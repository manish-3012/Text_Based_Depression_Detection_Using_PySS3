I attempted suicide yesterdayI just snapped, I guess... I made a mistake and lost my job, a job that means the world to me, and I felt like I had no other way out of this hell.

I tried to overdose on fluoxetine. 71 pills, or 2,840 mg. My normal dose is 40 mg 1x daily. Got brought to the ER about an hour afterwards and had decent test results, they couldn't believe the results on the EKG and bloodwork... to be honest, I'm not sure any of them believed I took the pills. Then I was on an IV drip until almost midnight, they gave me sedatives because I apparently seemed aggravated, and then I got to go home. 

Today I feel like shit. You know that feeling that you get when you stand up too fast? That's how I've been feeling all day. I'm shaky and struggle to stand. I threw up three times, just bile. I haven't eaten anything in well over 24 hours so I'm about to indulge in a bit of dragon fruit in the hope that I can fill my stomach without getting nauseous.

I guess my question is... where do I go from here? I'm getting screened at a mental health hospital later today, I'm not really sure what all they do but I'm really nervous. I'm so lost and confused. My job meant everything to me. I was there almost every day, even when I didn't have to work. It was basically my first major step toward being successful in my career of choice, and I genuinely don't feel that I'm good enough at anything else to start over.

I was kind of thinking of moving. I don't feel like there's anything here for me. My mom hates me, and so does my aunt and uncle, and my grandma. They're really the only family I have here. Unfortunately I just bought a house and now that I'm out of a job I definitely can't afford to pay off two houses.

To those that attempted and failed, how did you dig yourself out of this hole? It feels like the past few days have just been a downward spiral and everything looks so bleak. How do I get through this? I'm so scared and confused.
