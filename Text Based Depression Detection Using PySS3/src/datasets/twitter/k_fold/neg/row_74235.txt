Lost & ConfusedSo yeah I think it's either tonight or this week, I have no clue when it's going to be my last day, everyday is another painful day, no parents to see, no family, everyone is jealous and hating on me because I am not depending on anyone, I barely see my mom like once every couple of months because she works abroad and she lives in a womens compound, and my father is a dickhead selfish person, that made me suffer for the past 20 years, I do thank him for educating me and putting me in the best schools and universities.

I am graduating this year, and everyday I am living is getting crazier, I never plan anything for the next day because I know it's going to be so fucked up, I have a girlfriend and she's so good and so nice to me, she treats me like nobody else, and unfortunately she lives far away from me, and I have to travel every time to see her and people say I am crazy that I spend shitload of resources and money just to see my girlfriend, though she's loyal and she would do anything and fight her parents just to see me, and I am thankful.

I tried almost anything in my life, from partying to getting drunk, from traveling from a city to another country, from driving the shittiest cars to driving the best cars, from hurting myself, to tattooing, to enjoyable pain, to sleeping 18-20 hours a day by forcing myself, except drugs and I would rather die than suffering with drugs, everyday I feel like I wanna jump from this 6th floor, it's pretty high, but it's amazing, the view and the jumping experience would be more than nice to jump and crush on the ground or even jump in the middle of nowhere in the sea.

I just want to fucking die, I have ADHD, emotions panic, panic attacks, I barely sleep like 2-3 hours a day and god knows what the fuck else I do have. 


fuck life, let's end it tonight
