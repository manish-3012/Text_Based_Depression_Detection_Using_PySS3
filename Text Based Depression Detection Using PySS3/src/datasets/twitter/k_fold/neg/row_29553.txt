Partial Suspension HangingThis seems to be a popular way to go. I'm almost convinced I'm going to do it. Everywhere I read says to compress the carotid artery in order to lose consciousness but it seems difficult to do. I tried a couple of test runs (people say you should never test it because it might work but that doesn't really matter for me either way) and basically what happened is the ringing in my ears got louder and louder and my head felt like it was going to explode. It didn't feel like I was going to pass out though. Also I have a sore throat now from all the test-strangulations, luckily my voice is still fine though. I can't help but think it won't be much longer until I do this for real. I'm going to get super drunk and down a bunch of sleeping pills and anxiety meds before I do it.
