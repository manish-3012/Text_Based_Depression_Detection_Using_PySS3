IDK what to do anymore...Long story short, Iâ€™m in a shit situation...it isnâ€™t my first time here, but Iâ€™m feeling like itâ€™ll be my last. Iâ€™m facing homelessness, down to my last five bucks, and have even turned to reddit for help...

I got a new job, but it wonâ€™t start until five days after rent is due and wonâ€™t pay until at least a week after that. My roommates cool, but heâ€™s struggling too and canâ€™t do it alone...I feel like a burden.

Iâ€™m usually the â€œstrongâ€ one, you know? ...people come to me when theyâ€™re in need..but I canâ€™t be strong anymore. Iâ€™m tired. I know itâ€™d hurt my family and those that care, but in time...theyâ€™ll move on. 

I was in a similar predicament at 20, again at 23, and here I am at 26...in a worse situation 


Does this shit get better? Is it even worth it?
