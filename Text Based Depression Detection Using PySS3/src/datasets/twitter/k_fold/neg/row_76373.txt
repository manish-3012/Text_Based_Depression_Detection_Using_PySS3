Best friend is suicidal, and I have no idea what to do.I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit or not - it's 2:30am and I'm on my phone and I'm too tired to read the sidebar. I figure if this isn't the right place, someone will tell me. 

For the past few weeks I've been talking to him daily - telling him I love him, I care about him, that I'm here for him. I've promised him that things will get better, I've promised him that we want him to stay. I promised him that I would support him no matter what decision he made, but I'm sure he knows that's a lie. 

Recently it's been getting worse. This is day two now that he's mentioned how much he wants to die - before he would only talk about how much he was hurting. Today he mentioned a specific method and how he should have done it already and it made me choke. 

I don't know what else to do. I feel like I'm getting nowhere, I feel like I'm not helping him. I feel like I'm just repeating myself all the time, and I feel like my talks with him are becoming less effective because of it. 

I also want to ask a question - is it normal to feel drained and depressed yourself when trying to help someone who has actually been diagnosed? It's like I'm sucking all the life out of myself and trying to give it to him. Every day he gets worse and every day I get worse. The only problem is that I feel like if I don't talk to him, no one will, and so I can't leave him. Not like this. 

I just need advice.
