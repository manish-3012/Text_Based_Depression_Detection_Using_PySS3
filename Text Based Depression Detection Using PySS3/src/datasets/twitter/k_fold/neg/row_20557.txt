Advice?I'm going to kill myself tomorrow - I'm worried about survival instincts kicking in and not following through though. I've decided on hanging and im going to tie my hands out of the way as well, but I live in a fricking bungalow so I'm going to be hanging off window security bars.

What I dont want is to pussy out like my other attempts especially due to the high risk of brain injury from hypoxia. It's wont be a sudden drop snap neck hanging but a suffocation hanging. 

Reddit is the darkest platform I'm on so I'm asking you randomers if you have any helpful tips or ideas on how I can do this right - rope is being delivered tomorrow!
