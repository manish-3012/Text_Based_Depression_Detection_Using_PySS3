I've Finally Decided.How I'm going to die. I'll starve myself. I'm waiting to long and I don't think I'll be able to kill myself soon enough so this is the option. Starvation seems a lot better to me, even though ppl view it as more painful and drawn out. I just think it'll finally get me to do it. Something about not wanting to lose all my progress towards death will keep me going. I can't explain it. It's just a good option for me. Why am I making a post about it? Idk. Nobody cares and nobody has probably read this far. It's just sorta putting my realisation into words. I just have a really strong feeling that this will work.
