What's the point?At the end of the day, in 50 or so years, I'm just going to die. Fade away. Disappear forever. I don't believe in an afterlife or reincarnation; all that's going to happen is that my consciousness will fade forever into a void of nothing. Why not cut it short? I've never been successful at improving myself and my situation, life's always been and will be a few and far between moments of joy and happiness interspersed by monotone slogs at best and suffering at worst. My family and friends' grief won't matter to me once my mind is gone forever, the thought only saddens me because of self-preservation instincts. What's the point in carrying on and trying again and again only to fail? Why not cut the cycle short?
