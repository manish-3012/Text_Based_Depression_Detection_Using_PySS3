here it goes againThe past week has been tough with depression kicking me down again and again. It's a life-long issue and I tend to coast doing okay for a while and then fall down again. I have started to tell people I'm struggling but keeping it casual/non-invasive, "trouble sleeping" or "feeling fragile", rather than how low and self-destructive I actually feel. Tomorrow I have an appt with a support worker I see occasionally and I hope talking to her will help, and I can change my appointments from occasional to more frequent which should help.

I have learned from the past, I have warning signs I look out for, but almost every time this hits bad I start clinging to self-hate and not seeing any hope, despite knowing I've done this before and got out of it. I start to feel like every suicidal moment was leading to my current moment, and that this is my chance to fulfill what I'm desperate to achieve.

I know I can get through til tomorrow and start reaching out and getting help, but I am still worried at how I feel and how strongly I feel it. I despise myself. I feel I need to run and escape but I can't escape myself. Recently trying to sleep has been a battle with myself for hours - will I die or will I live. It's so hard to deal with these thoughts and feelings.

Anyone relate? Anything I can do to stop thinking? I'm going to try and take some prn medication and listen to podcasts and hope I will sleep eventually.
