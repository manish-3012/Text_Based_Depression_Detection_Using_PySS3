Feel guilty for considering suicide and not doing everything right and not avoiding anything conceivably wrong.Anytime I do anything remotely possibly wrong or don't do anything even remotely good, guilt. No hope.

Was suicidal before this. Feel guilty for considering suicide too. At this point, I'm tired. I don't think I'm going to win this. Almost my entire life since i was young i've been depressed, anxious, and suicidal. 

Even before all this. I want to give up.

At this point, trying to get high/buzzed on alcohol or other legal drugs to mellow myself enough to pick a spot and go.
