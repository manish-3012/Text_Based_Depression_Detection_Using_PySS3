Almost that time?Ive never posted on reddit before. But the more i read some of these the more i actually feel close to people. Though only temporary. Ive attempted to leave this world several times for so many reasons i cant even keep track anymore. Therapy didnâ€™t work. Pills didnâ€™t work. Being hospitalized didnâ€™t work. Though I voluntarily went for help I always said what I assumed was the right answer because I didnâ€™t really want help. Itâ€™s been a year since my last attempt. January 15th, 2019 I bought a gun. Had a day picked out to end my life January 23rd not sure why that day but it gave me a week to say good by to family and such. That night Im on my knees gun in my mouth and I start crying saying Im not ready yet. Not that I donâ€™t want to. So I call my mom and have been staying with my parents since. However this is this first time Ive mentioned this to anyone. But in 9 days is my birthday. Ill be 25. And the closer the day gets the more relief I feel of the thought of ending my life. I dont know how I ended up on this reddit page. Or why I decided to put this out to strangers but yeah
