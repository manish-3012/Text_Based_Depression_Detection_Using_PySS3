I hope to end it soonIt's getting harder for me to talk to people and harder for me to look people in the eye. I keep smacking my head recently and muttering stuff to myself.  I thought my new school I could make friends and restart my social life, but I can't make friends and it's been a couple months and no new friends, destroying any chance for a romantic relationship in the future. I keep getting angry and bitter to people and I wish could take it back.  I keep being the quiet, useless kid in a place where everyone is extroverted and have friends and can talk to people normally.  I tried to work on my grades but it's been getting worse and worse.  It's obvious i am not good at anything and will be a useless peice of shit.  If I go with this in the near future,  which I hope to achieve, then it will take the pain away I hope for me and other people so they don't take my shit anymore.  I am tired of being the bad example for everyone to fear.  If I don't die, hopefully I will be harmed at least.  I've given up trying.  I keep having mental breakdowns and I hate it.   It's been 3 years since I been having this shit and now it seems highschool hasn't been helpful, I just don't want to do this.  I keep having these hopes where I can suddenly be social, but they are only denying the inevitable.  I just want it done soon.
