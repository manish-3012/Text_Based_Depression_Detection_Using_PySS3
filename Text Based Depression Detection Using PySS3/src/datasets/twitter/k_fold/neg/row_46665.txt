Want to dieItâ€™s just really weird how everythingâ€™s happening for me. Iâ€™ve hated my life ever since I was young and I still want to die more than ever for the past year or two. Havenâ€™t had one glimpse of hope or positivity in the past two years. All itâ€™s been for me is just emptiness and I donâ€™t even care anymore. I just hate so many things and I donâ€™t enjoy one single activity. I never understood how I got here or why. Itâ€™s just like I was born to be this way. I always wanted to do good things but Iâ€™ve just never been good enough at anything. I donâ€™t even like anything Iâ€™m doing now but I donâ€™t know how to change that or where to go. I donâ€™t like anything so how can I find something that I like when I donâ€™t feel any different about anything. I donâ€™t feel any enjoyment for any single activity. Iâ€™m starting to fail my classes now. I just canâ€™t do any of my assignments. I guess this is where it ends for me. Never accomplished anything that I set for myself. I only ever had good intentions but Iâ€™ve only received bad back. Interesting how it all works out
