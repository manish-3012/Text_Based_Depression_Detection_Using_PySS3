Uhh.. just a little rantIâ€™m 15 and currently giving up on my classes. Nothing will matter because I donâ€™t plan to live past 2020, at most. I donâ€™t like to call myself depressed, more like sad. Though Iâ€™ve been telling myself this for the past 4 years. Iâ€™m too scared to go and diagnosed only for my dad to put me into a mental hospital. If my mom was alive sheâ€™d probably do the same. I have everything I could want, yet I am as useless as they come. I am literally a brat. I hate myself because no matter how much I want to change, I canâ€™t. I just go back to my old bratty habits and itâ€™s annoying the hell out of me. I just want to sleep forever. Just eternal rest because Iâ€™m tired of having to deal with life. I feel like those shitty edgy teenagers, I am probably one. I know that no matter if Iâ€™m dead or alive, Iâ€™m just a disappointment. Might as well try out being dead right? Living isnâ€™t something for me.
