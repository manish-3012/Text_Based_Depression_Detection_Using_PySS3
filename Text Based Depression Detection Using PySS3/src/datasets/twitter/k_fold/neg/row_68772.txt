Anyone in Grande Prairie, AB or area? I would love to reach out to you in person if you need help.Hi. My name is Nathan. I recently moved to Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada.

I am not trained in any way in regards to crisis counseling, but I can sit down with you and have a cup of coffee with you.

This is a standing offer. I canâ€™t promise I will talk you off the edge but if you are in that much pain then let me try to help in someway.

Feel free to PM me if you want to take me up on my offer.
