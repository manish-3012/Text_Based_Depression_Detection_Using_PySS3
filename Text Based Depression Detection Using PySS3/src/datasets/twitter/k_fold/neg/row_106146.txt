I am so doomed.I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know who I am anymore. These academic achievements, they aren't who I am. I wish my mother loved me based on the content of my chatacter, and not what I can bring to the table. I wish I could live my life how I chose it, not how I'm destined to live it. I wish I could have had that fun typical childhood or teenage life, but it's too late now. I'm going to be an adult soon, and it's too late to have those fun memories. I don't have anything to look back on. I wish I was never born. I'm a victim of my circumstances. I have a realm of dreams I wish to accomplish, but I cannot due to my circumstances. 

I wish I could never see my family again, but I don't want to bring them pain, even though they've done that to me without hesitation. I live in the house my mother built. A house built on agony and despair. 

The only people I cherish in my life are my sister and my boyfriend. They're wonderful, but I know that things don't last forever. Who knows until my boyfriend will stop loving me. My sister isnt obligated to help me, and I'd rather not open up to them about this and cause more pain. 

I resent the life I was born to live.
