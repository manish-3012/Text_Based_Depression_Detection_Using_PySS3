No one ever listens. The people who did left me.I donâ€™t have anyone to talk to. Iâ€™m hoping someone can talk to me here. 


Everytime I open up to my family on how depressed I am, they change the subject to ANY other things. 

When I finally got the courage to confess, they always shut me out. Our conversations goes like this:

â€œWhatâ€™s wrong?â€

â€œI donâ€™t know what to do, I feel depressed. I want to die. I feel awful. Iâ€™m not sure, but I think Iâ€™m ill.â€

â€œOh my! These oranges are amazing! You should eat one.â€

â€œ...â€

â€œSometimes, you just need to look at the bright side of life. Look how lucky you are! You have family, food, clothes and school. Youâ€™re just stressed!â€

To be honest, I never quite knew when my depression started. I think it was when my best friend distanced himself. Couple this with pressure of being an honor student, and the loneliness of being out of place among your peers. Itâ€™s really frustrating. Iâ€™ve read that depression is like a black cloud following you around; itâ€™s true. Everything is dark, suffocating, an endless gray life full of misery and pain that you canâ€™t explain at all.

Now, our final exams are coming. I donâ€™t have the motivation to study. I just scanned my notes. I think Iâ€™ll just die.

I have no true friends, a deaf family and a pressure-filled school life.

Oh and the person I loved rejected me. My only friend distanced himself.

Life is awful.
