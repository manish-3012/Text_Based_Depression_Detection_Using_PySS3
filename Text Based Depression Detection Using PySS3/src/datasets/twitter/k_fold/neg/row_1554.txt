Worthless in comparison.This is gonna sound jumbled and stupid and really first world problems,but here you go-

I'm the least favorite child. My mum is the one who gets say over everything and my dad might like me, and I know he thinks I'm decent, but he doesn't do anything to stop her. She just yells and makes all these snide jokes about how stupid I am and how I can't compare to my fucking brother, who is so perfect in every fucking way and I can't even do math or computers or anything at all. I'm really really worthless and I don't even want to say anything anymore, because I know that they're all smarter than me and I don't even understand what is going on.

My brother tells me that my family doesn't like me because I'm rude and mean and spiteful but I'm not, because I try to talk to people and yeah I do yell &amp; swear and I'm not the best person ever but at least I try, you know? But then my parents tell me that I'm just a bitch, just some rude asshole and I don't know what to do.

 This has all happened before and it will just happen over and over again and I don't know how to make it stop. My friends try to help me but they don't know how deep this goes and how tired and depressed and lonely I am, and I don't want to tell them. They are the only thing keeping me going, and I can't die because I know it would hurt them but I really want to sometimes, and death just seems to be the better option.

I really don't know what to do anymore, and I don't see a way out. I'm sorry if this all sounded stupid or anything because I know there are worse problems out there.
