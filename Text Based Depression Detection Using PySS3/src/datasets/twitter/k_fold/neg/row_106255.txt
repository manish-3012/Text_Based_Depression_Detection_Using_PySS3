Why should I not kill myself? I feel as though its intlevitableEverything just hurts. I feel like I don't belong to this world, I'm too mentally fragile and sick... I'm a misfit.

I care too much about what other people think of me. All I want is to be loved and appreciated for who I truly am.

I'm capable of faking it to fit in, but that just leaves me feeling empty and disconnected. Like I have no humanity or self.

I tried not giving a fuck about anyone and standing alone, but that ate away at me aswell.

I'm too unstable to function here. I'm riddled with anxiety and moodswings, I haven't gotten diagnosed with anything yet except a fast evaluation of depression.

I honestly don't want to get treated. I am afraid and ashamed to do it, and I feel like I'll never get fixed.

I'm too arrogant yet sensitive. I'm not a good person. I don't even believe in "good". I think that our lives and the universe has no meaning.

So if I am not fit enough to feel happy in this world or successful... if I'm so defective... why should I keep trying so *hard* to stay? To stay sane? When I'm not appreciated by anyone and I hate even MYSELF?
