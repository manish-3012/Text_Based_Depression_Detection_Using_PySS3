Don't know if i can deal with this much longerI've had intrusive thoughts for years now. They're usually something like "what if you kill someone" "what if youre sexually attracted to something fucked up". They've convinced me that i'm a monster. I'm stuck in my own thoughts. I don't want to hurt anyone and am not planning to, but my head is full of "what if" -scenarios. I feel like the worst person on the planet. I might just end it all in a few weeks. My suicide note has been in progress for about a month now, but i keep procrastinating with it.
I just can't keep living like this. I just want normal brains with no intrusive thoughts.
