No car and getting kicked out of my houseI'm 18 years old and I'm getting kicked out of my house for crashing my car &amp; my parents said they're done with my "bullshit". I clearly can't survive by myself at 18 I have no idea what to do, I just want to end it all. Even when I get a new (used) car I'll have to pay for everything (insurance and all that fun stuff). I told my parents that I wanted to kill myself and I was going to take sleeping pills to do it. Their reply; "that's the easy way out" I don't think it is the easy way out. I'm not the richest person, I can't afford all this. It's funny when I was born I can picture my mom and dad saying they'll take care of me forever. 18 years later they're kicking me out... Maybe I should just OD on sleeping pills. I've already attempted to kill myself once and was arrested and brought to a crisis center but my parents don't give a fuck right now about me. I think it's over for me, The Financial stress is killing me.
