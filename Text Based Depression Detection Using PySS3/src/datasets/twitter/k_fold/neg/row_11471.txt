feeling clearI have felt suicidal for around 5-7 years. I normally feel suicidal when i am very sad, usually thinking of suicide as a way to stop being a burden on my family. Today, i did not feel sad , i felt very clear. I felt like the best option for me was to disappear. I do not feel like i can function in society. I am ashamed of what i have done and how i have treated those who tried to love me. I do not pity myself at all, the condition i am in is all because of my own actions. I feel certain that my life will not get any better, although i couldnt possibly know that. Honestly, i am afraid. I feel disguting in my own body, i feel like every second i spend in it is almost torturous.
