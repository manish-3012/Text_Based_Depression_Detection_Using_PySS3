Why does it keep coming to this?I've been deep in love with the girl I've dated for 9 years and a month and a half ago I found out she had given me an STD, knowing what that means I talked to her about it and she had stated she had slept with someone else unprotected. I was crushed and went into a deep depression where I just couldn't do anything and I stayed like that for two weeks, going in and out of hospital care and I asked her to stay out of my life. She texts me a week ago and says she loved me and missed me, and like the idiot I am, I texted her all week until Thursday. She came over to my apartment, cuddled and we had sex. Today I asked her to come over and she did, she texted someone else through the movie we were watching and he called, she talked about a relationship, and said she loved him. I'm sitting here, in my own apartment after an argument while she sleeps in my bed. I have no idea where my life is going and above everything else, I wish I was dead. I love her more than anything I've loved before and I'm weak. I'm sorry you read this, I just needed to vent and hopefully clear my thoughts
