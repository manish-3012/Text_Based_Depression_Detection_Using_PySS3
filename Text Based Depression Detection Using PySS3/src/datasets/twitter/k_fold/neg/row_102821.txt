...lostI feel so disconnected from everything. I have no reason to feel like this but I am drowning.

I have a good job and an even better fiance. I used to only feel like this every few weeks but now it is

becoming more and more frequent. My waking thought almost every day is how I just want to die but that is a

double edged sword. How do you cope with wnating to die when you are terrified of death? I just dont

want to feel this way anymore. I just feel myself drifting further and further away from everything. I have

been trying to do everything i can do to make it stop. Gym, weed, talking, etc. but it doesn't help. I'll think I

am getting better but then within a day or two I am a lifeless blob in my bed or on my couch thinking about the best way

to end it. I feel so lost that death seems like the only option but I am too afraid to act upon it. There is a war inside

my head and I want it to stop.
