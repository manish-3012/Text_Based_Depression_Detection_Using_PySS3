Was this an attempt?After fighting with depression for a while, getting send from doctor to doctor, waiting list to waiting list, I got very suicidal. About a month ago I ended up tying a nouse, attaching it in my room, and just hanging into it, knowing that my feet could reach the floor. At the time I didn't consider this an attempt because, while I was okay with any accidents that might happen, I had no real intention of actually killing myself that day. I just wanted to know that I could, and allow myself the feeling of letting go. After reflection, and talking to friends, I am not so sure anymore. To attempt means to try... And in a way, I did try. Anyway, not that it really matters, I can't let go of the question if it's an attempt or not. 

Any thoughts on it? 

Btw... I'm doing better now. Still having suicidal thoughts but much less severe.
