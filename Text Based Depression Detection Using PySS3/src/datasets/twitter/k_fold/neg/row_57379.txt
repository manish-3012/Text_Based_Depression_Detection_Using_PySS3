Ideationwhere do people who deal with suicidal ideation go? Itâ€™s more than depression, but thereâ€™s no emergency. Hotlines havenâ€™t helped. You know the risks of suicide and have no intentions of doing anything but the thoughts are just constantly in your head. You canâ€™t tell anyone because they will be worried and you donâ€™t want to burden them and itâ€™s more unnerving than just simply saying you are depressed. But there are no sources out there on it either. Where do you go when youâ€™re trapped in your head?
