I asked God for a sign and then my car stopped workingIs there hope? Is there a reason to have faith?

I've seen a lot of weird and messed up things. Nothing as bad as other people I've known or heard about. Still, everything I've experienced has taken a bit more of my humanity. I wonder if I am human a lot. 

Right now I just feel resentful and bleak. Like there is some huge debt I have with the universe. I have a roof over my head, I have two cats that love me, I have a part time job, and I have my health, for the most part. But it's like I've been in a rut my entire life. There is always something majorly wrong. Whether that is me, the environment I'm in, the people, or all three of these things .. I'm always stuck, going no where. 

I have a dream and a life I would like to lead. I think I may be insane, or stupid, or both of these things. I talk to people as honestly as I can, about anything. I'm truthful about myself and about my perceptions of the world.. I think that pushes people away. I'm self deprecating, but not in a fake way. I can be an air head, forgetful, whiny, and self absorbed... but I'm also genuinely kind, helpful, and open-minded. I have my own values and ideas about things. You're supposed to be like that, right? I just feel like all of those things have set me back way more than it should. I feel like, at this point, if I were more of an asshole, more ignorant, more.. something, that I would get somewhere in life. 

I don't know where I was going with this. I've been contemplating death for a really long time because it just hurts. Everything bothers me about how I have to live, how the world works, about my self, about other people.. I must be a shitty person. That must be it. And if that's truly the case -- or even if it isn't -- why shouldn't I be dead?
