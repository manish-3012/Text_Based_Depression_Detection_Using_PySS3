Emo vs GothThe world is screwed. Optimists are like, yes, but you can change that! How? My country (which makes me sad to say) ignores logic and science.

Thereâ€™s no way out or to change things. Youâ€™re a little girl when you talk about politics, but youâ€™re a young woman when youâ€™re abused.

Even if people are changing, we have made virtually no progress. 

My inner monologue is always screaming at me. I have all the feelings all the fucking time, but I canâ€™t feel any of them. How is that even possible?

I donâ€™t want to wait for the world to change. Anything is better than humans. I want to kill myself and feel one last rush of adrenaline.
