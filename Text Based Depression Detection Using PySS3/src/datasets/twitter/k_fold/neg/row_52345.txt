I guess time's upI kept delaying suicide throughout my teens. Both the idea of suicide and my tendency to keep delaying it felt too cowardly. 

However I found someone special and had to keep him hidden from my family. From meeting him secretly to staying up at night to call him I have done everything. I just realised that I spent 6 years of my life (~Â¼th of my life) hiding this amazing person. 

I applied for PhD this year so that I could go halfway across the world and call him away too so that we can live in peace. But I made a huge mistake of taking inputs from my parents and my toxic sister who made me apply to USA as backup. I didnt have enough LoRs for my universities of interest and now I am being shipped to USA for a MS program (Just finished an MS and will get my degree this month) with a loan of 50k USD. I am fucked. No PhD till I return my loan. He is definitely not in a position to do the same.

I shouldn't have listened to them. My sister is so toxic. She blackmailed and abused me for years and when she left for USA I couldnt be happier. Now I will live quite near. My parents have and will always turn a deaf ear towards her. They're equally narcissistic. Sometimes I cant believe I am 23. I feel like I am 13 and helpless.

After numerous sleepless nights I have decided that if I dont get a positive response until the 22nd of July I will end my life. Killing myself will ruin him but going away will do more damage. 

And I will be free..
