having to face my reality again, and this time i feel like i'm actually gonna do iti've been here multiple times throughout the years, but this time i feel like i'm becoming a danger to myself. i just tried to start another degree, something that i thought would be more my thing, and that would challenge my mind. 

well, i'm having to come to terms with the fact that i'm an idiot yet again. failed every single one of my intro essays, whilst trying my best on every one. university was my backup plan, my safety net. turns out i'm not cut out for that either.   
my only strengths are in mental math, understanding music and writing hollow, pretentious paragraphs about stuff i think i have some knowledge on. Looking through my playlists on youtube i feel like such a pretentious twat i wanna delete everything and shoot myself in the head  
that's my whole life, i'm a fuckin idiot, failing everything, living with my parents while my friends are getting their master's degree. i can't even figure out what to do in order to at least not look like a complete idiot every day.

i don't wanna go out, i don't understand what's going on around me most of the time anyway. i don't wanna get a job to fund this miserable hellhole of a life. i wanna disappear, i wanna fucking die.
