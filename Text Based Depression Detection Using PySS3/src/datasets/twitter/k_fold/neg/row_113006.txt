I lost $2,000 and now its over for meI'm a fucking idiot.  I've ruined everything tonight. I'm 20, unemployed, no friends, no career nothing. I've been betting on sports and trading markets on betfair etc. Well it was going well I made about 1k from it. I enjoyed it and honestly that was the only reason I woke up in the morning. WEll just now ive fucking ruined it all. I bet 1k on a horse to place, and hedged at betfair for another 1k. If you arent aware hedging is betting the opposite, so I effectively canceled the 2 out for a small profit. My fuck up was that unknown to me the bet was for places 1 and 2, but the hedge was for 1-3 (as is custom). Of course tthe horse comes 3rd and I find out that only places 1-2 count. No where was this mentioned on the betting page, these slimy fucking cunts have fucked me over and ruined me. It is in the terms and conditions so I wont be able to argue it. Its my fault for not checking closely. But now Im fucked. Basically all of my savings are gone and its over for me. I dont know what to do anymore but ill probably kill myself tonight . I have nothing more to live for. If you bet or consider starting dont fucking bother. Betting was the last thing I was hanging onto and I was honestly fucking decent at it. But im fucked now. I have no money to bet with and i dont even want to after this shit. I feel like the dumbest cunt ever and I have no one who will fucking understand me with this. I cant talk about this to anyone. fuck me
