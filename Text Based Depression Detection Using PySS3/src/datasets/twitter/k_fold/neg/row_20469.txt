I'm part of the left behindI don't know what to say or where to say it. Today was just so fucked and it means I have to say something. I found out a good friend of mine hung himself Wednesday. He was a recovering heroin addict and father of a 5 year old. His untreated depression coupled with a felony from drug abuse made him feel he couldn't ever been normal and he no longer wanted to be a criminal. He felt trapped and found an exit. Life is strange. Technology is weird. My phones predictive text now fills in "hung himself Wednesday" whenever I type friend. I just want you to know I had a friend, his name was Anthony, and now I don't and this kind of pain never scars over.
