Conclusion. Hello there fellow Suicide Watch sub-reddit community, my name is Antonio and I am a 17 year old high school senior. For starters, I have been heavily depressed since I was 8 years old and I am pretty sure I have Clinical Depression. I have not been diagnosed by a health professional but I know for a fact I have this mental illness since I researched the symptoms and I'm sure I have it. 

At this age and point, I have come to the conclusion that I really want to commit suicide more than anything. I feel so relieved because I will actually go through with this. I may have an out of the ordinary and insane method, but it will surely get the job done. Death is my only benefit and I can actually tell you from experience that it is awesome. I love the feeling of this because it will egg me on to commit this atrocious act. 

Nothing and no one can stop me. I will leave this post as a backup suicide note to whoever wants to read it. After years of suffering, doubting myself, and having a cynical view of the world, I can finally rest in peace and go to the pit of despair and nothingness. I don't feel pity, remorse, or regret for this epiphany. My self doubts are true, my life definitely stinks and will continue to stink, and this world is most certainly an evil land. 

I may be young, but I know more than you think. I've thought about this for a while and I'm ready. I just need to plan this and everything will go smoothly. This burden is finally off my shoulders.
