Ways to DieLately I've been wondering about how to die as painlessly as possible. Any suggestions? (btw, I am NOT planning on committing suicide right now but I'm still curious, just in case that day ever does come). 

I've heard some myths that if you jumped off a building, you'd die from shock/fear during the fall (before you hit the ground). How true is this? 

Also, what are some instant ways to die?

Kind of unrelated but what's it like to overdose on medicine? Does it take a while?
