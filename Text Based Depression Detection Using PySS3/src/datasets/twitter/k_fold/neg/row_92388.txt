Why do you keep living?I think, for a lot of us, itâ€™s the pathetic â€˜mum and dad would be sadâ€™ type thing. 

Thatâ€™s definitely what I fall under.

Iâ€™ve been under the impression for years now that â€˜things get betterâ€™ and god I wish it was true... first I thought ok if I can just make it through middle school... then high school... now uni... when does life actually start? I feel like Iâ€™ve been so caught up in wanting it to end just so that I can stop setting these mindless goals.

The hardest part is realising you never have the courage to take your own life so you are stuck in this dull void, where you wish it would end but simply continue to keep â€˜livingâ€™ despite the fact that you wouldnâ€™t care if you died.
