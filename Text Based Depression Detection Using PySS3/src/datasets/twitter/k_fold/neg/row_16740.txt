The pain isnâ€™t temporary. Stop lying.Itâ€™s not fucking temporary. Iâ€™ve been going through the same shit since I was 11 and now Iâ€™m nearly 18. It doesnâ€™t get better. I donâ€™t have the patient to wait anymore. Why wonâ€™t these sleeping pills work.

I canâ€™t stand people. People suck so fucking much. This world sucks. Call me a coward for not wanting to live, I donâ€™t give a shit.
