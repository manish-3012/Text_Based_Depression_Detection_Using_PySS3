My friend try to attempt a suicide today. What are something (encouragement, positive things) I can say to her?I have a friend who try to OD herself today. When I found out she was in the hospital because her mom called the cops to stop her (we're in college), I drove to the hospital immediately to check on her. Apparently, she was on the hotline with a lot of pills in her hand when the cops arrived. She's a bit better now. I know she has a lot of family problems and things that she can't control, but on the surface she's a very bubbly happy girl. It broke my heart to see her at the hospital today. I told her that don't worry about school or family at the moment, just try make herself whole again. I then had to leave for class.

Planning to visit her again tomorrow but I don't know what to say to make her feel better. Growing up in a bubble community, this is the closest I've came to see someone I care for can just leave the world, it's a scary thought. Any advice on how to talk to people with suicidal thoughts would help a lot!
