Want to help us prevent suicide on the railways and other public places?Hello everyone,

Our  team at Middlesex University London is focusing on suicide prevention on the railways and other public places (see [https://madeatuni.org.uk/middlesex-...t-suicide-railways-and-other-public-locations](https://madeatuni.org.uk/middlesex-university/research-prevent-suicide-railways-and-other-public-locations)). **The research was commissioned by Samaritans on behalf of the Network Rail as part of their suicide reduction and prevention work**.  There is around one suicide on the UKâ€™s railways every 32 hours. The  emotional costs to the individualâ€™s family, friends, fellow commuters  and transport staff are immeasurable.

This study aims to develop **a better understanding of how to support people in crisis and prevent suicide attempts**  and how bystanders react when they come into contact with people on the railways and other public locations who are in distress and/or suicidal.

We want to hear everyone stories and thoughts - those who have been experiencing suicidal thoughts and were  interrupted by someone, those who have stepped in to help or wanted to but did not know what to do. We would like to understand what makes a safe and effective bystander intervention, what can be helpful or  unhelpful to someone who has been interrupted/stopped, factors which  would discourage someone from intervening at all in situations like  these and any fears/concerns surrounding bystander interventions. Previous research conducted by the same team for Samaritans and Network Rail suggested that a small talk can disrupt someonesâ€™ thoughts and save  a life.
