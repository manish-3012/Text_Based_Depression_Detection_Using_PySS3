Depression is backHello guys I've been depressed months ago but I started fighting it and I almost got over it, the feeling when I breath make me wanna kill myself, when I see my parents cry for me I always feel guilty and start crying alone, lately I started smoking and its the last thing I still enjoy. I just don't know I made them live in pain just me existing, they're supportive yes but what deep they feel, the pain I feel inside my chest keep burning I just dont know I thought I would beat depression.
