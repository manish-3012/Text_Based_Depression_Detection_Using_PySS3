Just in case, please see /user/h3lpme0ut[/user/h3lpme0ut](http://www.reddit.com/user/h3lpme0ut) mentions suicide as an option, he has recently been exposed to suicide in his family (Dad), and says "this is my last effort to find some advice". I'm going to try to reply to his itgetsbetter post but you guys are experts at this so I thought I'd point his posts out to you. Maybe since he didn't post in /r/SuicideWatch I'm being premature; sorry if so.
