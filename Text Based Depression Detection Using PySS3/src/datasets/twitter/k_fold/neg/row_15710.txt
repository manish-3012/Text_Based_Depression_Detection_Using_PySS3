I don't think I'll ever be content. seriously considering suicide.Can someone talk with me?

I'm a 17 yr old female asian with huge expectations for myself. The thing is, I can never fulfill them. I want to go to Harvard or Princeton, and I'm really smart. But I'm not smart enough. I have mistakes. You can call it "being human", but I see it as "factory errors". I feel like it was predestined, someone *made* me like this. It feels like I'm pushing against an iron wall and trying with everything I have to change it. The reality is that it's not going to move, no matter how hard I hope and pray. It was predestined, I was already chosen to fail. Nothing is going to change that.

I can't leave and forget about it. I want it so much, I want to have that letter in my hands telling me congratulations! I've been dreaming of it for four years; I can't imagine life without it. I'm just as stubborn as that iron wall and my mind demands that it happens, or my existence would just vanish. I haven't planned what would happen if I didn't get in, so my brain automatically computes that as null. There's no answer, no life. So I should die.

Even if I did get in, I'll eventually have to face failure someday. Whether it's a test score or job interviews, I'll see it again. I'm so scared of failing, I don't want to think about it. I don't want it there. I wouldn't be able to handle it. It's so horrible I'd rather die than face it. I want to die right now and save myself all the pain. Please help me. Someone talk some sense into me.
