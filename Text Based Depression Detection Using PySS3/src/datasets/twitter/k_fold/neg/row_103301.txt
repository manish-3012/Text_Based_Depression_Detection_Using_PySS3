Idk why I even tryWhy havent I just given up and turned to alcohol and die like my dads side of the family did. All around me I see very very smart people, but me? I am a dumb motherfucker. I am doing online college now for accounting and on the first assignment already i am struggling hard to remember everything. I am not smart, or good at math , i'll have to study like 10-12 hours a day i think meanwhile someone else can just breeze by. Everything is so fucking difficult to me, especially with bad depression and anxiety for 10 yrs. That wont go away. I am such a joke, i'll also die forever alone, i am a zombie for surviving this long
