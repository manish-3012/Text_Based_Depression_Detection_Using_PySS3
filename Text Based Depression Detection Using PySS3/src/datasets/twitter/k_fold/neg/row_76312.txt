What should I doI donâ€™t know what it do. I feel like I have no purpose and my dad makes me feel like a complete waste of a son. He tells me I should kill myself and that he wouldnâ€™t care. My mom doesnâ€™t do anything to help. My stepmom doesnâ€™t care and just lies to my dad about my problems. And my sister threatens to kill me in my sleep and that she will slit my throat. I donâ€™t know what I should do someone help me please.
