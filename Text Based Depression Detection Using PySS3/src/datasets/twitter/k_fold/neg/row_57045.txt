Would like to hear you guys opinionsSoo.. I donâ€™t really know where to start and Iâ€™m not too eager to talk about what has led up to the state of which Iâ€™m in but letâ€™s just say Iâ€™ve knew this day would come some day eventually because of the fact that I have been suicidal since I was about 10-11 years old. I canâ€™t set my thoughts straight, all I can think of are dark thoughts, real dark. And I have this unsettling rage inside me that just wants to burst out. My emotions are just gone, except for that rage.. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever loved someone, which makes me just feel so.. empty and exhausted, but not lonely... 

Iâ€™ve never attempted suicide, all I have done is basically wishing someone would kill me so I can be free. I feel like a waste of life. I didnâ€™t ask to be born, and I wish I never was. I donâ€™t know what to do, really, I donâ€™t have any drive left, any motivation, any dreams or whatsoever. 

Thereâ€™s just emptiness inside of me, except for that rage, itâ€™s the only thing that have kept me alive for all of these years, itâ€™s my fuel.. and Iâ€™m just tired of having that rage as fuel, so tired.. 

I donâ€™t know why I posted this here since internet is probably the shittiest place to open up to. But Iâ€™d like to hear your thoughts, is anyone else feeling this way? I know Iâ€™m not special and thereâ€™s probably a thousand more feeling this way but I have no clue how they make it.. 

Iâ€™m open to discuss with anyone who wants to..
