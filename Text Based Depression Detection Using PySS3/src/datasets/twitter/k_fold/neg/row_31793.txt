I don't want to go on.I'm 20 years old. I'm NEET and it's all I'll ever be. I'm going to kill myself today.

I could hold on, because I'm only 20 and have my whole life ahead of me. So what I messed up in education, plenty of people have. And they're fine. It's not like I don't have second chances and stuff. I can find work or education, I have the relevant experience. There are ways to get out of this. This doesn't have to be the end.

Why go on? I'm only 20. My point is made. I'm only 20 and have been through this much bullshit. I know I'm useless, I've had a fucking MILLION opportunities to get this right. Instead I fucked myself and now I'm in the shit. No work and I'm not getting into university. What's left for me? More bullshit? Am I gonna lay down and let life fuck me over and over again? No thanks. I never asked to be here. I'll show myself out. 

I never wanted to be in university. It would have been nice if I got in but I didn't want it. The idea was doomed to fail from the fucking get go. My grades are shit, just like me and everything about me. There's no fucking way I'd get accepted into uni. Even if I did, I wouldn't find a place to live. I would fail my exams. I would drop out and continue being useless. Seriously I must have some severe fucking brain damage and the biggest stroke of luck go have made it this far fooling idiots like everything is okay.

I'm done. I'll show myself out. Life's not for me, I'm not cut out to have a life. If we have souls then mine is dark and broken. If we're products of our environment my environmrnt made a suicidal loser. GG no re, fuck everything.
