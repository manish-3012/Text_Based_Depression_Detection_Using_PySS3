HeroinSweet warm decadence â¤ï¸ after trying it a few times Iâ€™ve found my new love. Itâ€™s better than most anything Iâ€™ve ever tried, and that includes loving humans. Itâ€™s kind of like life and death in one needle. Life because it helps my day go by without boredom and sadness. Death because if things get too shitty I just have to use too much and maybe mix it with some other fun pills. Thank you.
