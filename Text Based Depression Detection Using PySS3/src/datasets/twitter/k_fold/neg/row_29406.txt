I'm an assholeBasically.

I am a 27 year old female. I have a boyfriend, we live together, I have one or two friends, my parents live 15 minutes away. I am unemployed because I had some big problems in my last 3 jobs, with the bosses and co-workers. I was in therapy occasionally but it didn't help much.

Now, the thing is, I really am a bad person. I have bad thoughts about everybody. I just hate to be around people, sometimes I even have physical pain from this. And I get jealous at everything and everybody. Don't know how to really explain what I mean here, but I don't want other peolpe to be happy or successful, I wish bad things would happen to them. 

I am terrible. I am a bitch and I deserve not that little love I get from people around me. And I don't think I can every be happy or normal, there is no way. "Therapy" they say, yes, that sounds so good and you don't have to deal with my shit anymore, better pay someone else to deal with it. But that didn't help either, I mean you just sit there and talk, how does that solve anything? Yeah I told them about me and my problems but they are still there, no matter how often you talk about it.

I want to die. I don't want to be there anymore, I want people to move on and leave me alone. Nobody understands, when I act bitchy, they just call me a pussy and say that much worse stuff happens to other people, an yes they are right, but does that mean my problems don't count because there are bigger problems somewhere else in the world?

I don't get people and I don't want to be part of this anymore.
