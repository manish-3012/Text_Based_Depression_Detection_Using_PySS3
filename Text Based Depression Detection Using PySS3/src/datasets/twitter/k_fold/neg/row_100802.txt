I can't take living anymoreHi I'm a 24 year old Male, from the UK. I've been probably depressed for probably 4 years if not more now. I say probably cause the last time i saw a doctor (about 6 months), he said that he didn't think I was depressed, but suffering from Anxiety. 

Either way my day to day sucks. I have a huge problem talking with anyone about anything really. I've gone from School, to uni, to working in a different part form where I live, and yet i don't have any close relationships. I've been living where i currently am for about a year now, and still no friends that i socialize that aren't from work. My parents keep insisting that I should go join a group or two (mainly choirs) to meet people, and I know i should however my Anxiety stops me from going. Not that I know where to go, as I don't know anyone in the area to find out about the things.

And over the last few days, the stress has got the better of me, and I just want it to end, I just don't feel like living anymore.
