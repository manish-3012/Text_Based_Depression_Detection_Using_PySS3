Being dead would be better, so why canâ€™t I just do it?I often fantasize about dying and being free from everything that I have to do in life. I wouldnâ€™t have to spend money out the ass to keep going to college, I wouldnâ€™t have to face whatever goddamn clusterfuck is going on with my countryâ€™s politics right now. I wouldnâ€™t have to worry about anything. Itâ€™d just be over. 

But every time I try, I just canâ€™t do it. 

Online articles say that â€œoh deep down inside, you really donâ€™t want to dieâ€ but I do! There is literally more net positive to dying than there is to living. But every time I put a belt around my neck and pull, I just canâ€™t go through with it. The thought of cutting myself scares me. I cannot actually bring myself to end my pitiful existence and itâ€™s so frustrating. I feel like Iâ€™m stuck here without a choice.
