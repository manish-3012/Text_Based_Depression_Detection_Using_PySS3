I don't understand.The thing i don't understand... if i know someone is going through a tough time, and tell them i'm here for them, and that i care about them, and ask them if they've hurt themselves to make sure they haven't / will not do it. Surely thats a good thing, right?   


Well... then why is it that everytime i look after someone who is at risk of selfharm/suicide, they get mad at me and end up blocking me/avoiding me. I'M ONLY TRYING TO HELP YOU STAY SAFE.  


Perhaps that's my purpose in life... to gatekeep the gates of suicide, protect people by pushing them away from the gates... while knowing that someday the gate will open, and pull me inside it with a warm embrace. I don't know anymore, maybe i'm just confused... maybe i'm not built for society... maybe i'm wrong... who knows. I wish i could know... but here we are, the thoughts of suicide are flooding back in, because of someone deeming their best course of action to remove me, AFTER ME TRYING TO HELP THEM...   


Fuck this, i'm out.
