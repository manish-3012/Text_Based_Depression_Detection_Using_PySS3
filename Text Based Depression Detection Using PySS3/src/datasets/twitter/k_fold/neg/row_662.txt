I have multiple mental illnesses and after an unlucky layoff, have been unemployed for 1.5 years so I will be choosing between suicide and ??? very soon. Open to unusual suggestions.**Just read the bold text as a TL/DR if you want.** 

&amp;#x200B;

**Background**: I graduated with a useless liberal arts degree - German - that I deeply regret in December 2014. The winter graduation date was a result of taking a semester off due to incapacitating mental health issues. I have a little OCD, some Borderline Personality Disorder traits, and am formally diagnosed as Bipolar Type II. I take a high dose of Lamictal but due to the nature of my diagnosis I am somewhat medication resistant and therapy has never helped much either. I fight intrusive thoughts and extreme depression on a daily basis. **I have spent 3 out of the 4 years since I graduated unemployed.** It took me a year to find a job. I was laid off from that job after only a year there because the company was doing poorly. That happened just eight months after I had left my parents' house. I didn't even make it a year on my own. That was a year and a half ago. I cannot find a fucking job. I have tried everything. 

&amp;#x200B;

*The reality is that someone with almost no experience and no connections and can only rely on the internet to find work is dealing with so much competition that it is almost impossible to find a job without a STEM degree. Over the past month, for example, I have applied to 185 jobs and only made it to a 2nd round in-person interview 4 times. So here we are...* 

&amp;#x200B;

**I'm ready to die. I have a note and a plan.** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- I have just one friend IRL who I rarely see or hear from. On my steam friends list there is one person who I game with sometimes, he is a great friend who I have known for a couple years but we have never met. My relationship with my parents is nonexistent even though I live with them. We have never been close and they have done some fucked up things in the past. **There is very little guilt associated with the thought of leaving the 4 people who are part of my life behind.** I have read enough of r/SuicideBereavement to know what it'd do to them and I don't care most of the time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **My suicide method of choice is irreversible. Guaranteed to kill me.** This will not be one of those impulsive acts where someone didn't take enough pills or jumped off of a building that wasn't high enough. I will be gone. Thus, I must be very certain about having no other options left. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Your life might be very different from mine and therefore you'll say "why not just find a retail or food service job and accept living with your parents?" *That is not something I can accept*. I didn't push through my terrible mental health issues to graduate with honors to live a life like this.** This house is full of traumatic memories and as depressed as I am now, there is no way I could work at Macy's or Applebees and be stuck in this house indefinitely without getting even worse and killing myself**. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- **I refuse to be hospitalized and will not do outpatient either.** I was too honest with my psychiatrist a couple weeks ago and almost got myself involuntarily committed. I have a very bad attitude about therapy and meds. Trapping me in a fucking looney bin with nothing but a smock would inevitably lead to me assaulting someone and having even more problems. I refuse to be doped up on meds to the point where I think this situation is fucking fine. 

&amp;#x200B;

**At this point, I don't know what the fuck I can do. Here are the things that occur to me at this point, in order from most reasonable to least:** 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Sign up for a temp agency and hope to find a "temp to permanent" role that actually pans out. The problem with those jobs is that they do not pay enough to get me out of this fucking house, even if it is full time. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept that my life has fallen apart and that I need to start over and go back to school for a degree that is actually useful. That plan would prevent waiting tables or something awful like that from bringing me to suicide.

&amp;#x200B;

\- Get a Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) certification and leave this country for somewhere with a low cost of living. It is going down in flames and I have almost nothing keeping me here anyway. I have a car that is worth around $10,000 that I could sell to get out of here and pay for the certification. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Accept my suicide as inevitable - living with all of these conditions is fucking terrible - and do something radical like selling the aforementioned car and blowing my money on some kind of cross country trip or even a one way ticket to somewhere else. $10k gets you a long way in a third world country. You may laugh at this but I'm actually kind serious about this one. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Kill myself. Send my note to everyone as a text before doing it. That's it. This miserable existence I never asked for would be over. I have had sex, fallen in love, been to Europe, enjoyed meaningful friendships, done psychedelics. Its been nice. But I can't take this shit anymore at the same time. Every day is the same. Sitting at this fucking desk. Miserable. Insane. Lonely. Hopeless. I think about suicide constantly. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Do you have any ideas for me? What would you do?**
