Null and void.Hi, for starters I'm female and I'm 20 years old. I've been battling depression since i was 12. I came from a broken home and a life of abuse. I begged my boyfriend to just touch me because i was not going to be okay. My job is draining me and the energy left goes to the war in my head. Im losing my grip and the act of suicide keeos replaying. These thoughts don't stop. The voices get louder. Telling me it would be easier. Im losing sleep. I havent been eating. Im so tired that i dont have the strength to pick up anything over 30 pounds.... i wake up dreading the day, my life and when i come home... but no one listens when i tell them i getting tired and dont want to be here. They just get upset and call me selfish... im single now... and live with a roommate whose gone 5/7 days of the week... i started cutting again... oh... i just love the red... please someone talk to me....
