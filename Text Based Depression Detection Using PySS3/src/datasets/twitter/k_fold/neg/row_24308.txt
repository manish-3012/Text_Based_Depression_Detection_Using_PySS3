I want to die. I wish someone would kill me. Thereâ€™s no hope for me to get better. I canâ€™t be fixed. I need to die.My life is ruined. I want to die. Iâ€™ve tried and failed at dying too many times now. Iâ€™m a nobody. I canâ€™t even succeed at dying. My marriage is ruined. Iâ€™ve hurt my kids feelings and guaranteed fucked them up for life. My wife refuses to be there for me unless lifeâ€™s perfect at that moment. My parents never cared. Always been the black sheep and different and never fit in.
Thatâ€™s my whole problems I donâ€™t have a god damn place in this world. I want to just fall asleep and never wake up. Iâ€™m so tired of having a â€œfamilyâ€ of a wife and three girls, when they all couldnâ€™t care less if Iâ€™m ok.

Iâ€™m not fucking ok. Iâ€™m not ok one fucking bit.
I hate myself.
I hate that I ruin and destroy everyone around me
I hate that I didnâ€™t die in the hospital when I ODâ€™ed on Tylenol. To think had I just waited 4 maybe 5 more hours before going to the hospital I would have actually died....fills me with such regret.
Nobody was there for me then. Why would anyone I love give a fuck about me now...

Fuck I wish I wasnâ€™t such a weak weak man. Iâ€™m pathetic. Useless. Unable to satisfy. Unable to be loved or cared about.

Fuck it all. I want to die so bad....
