I want to do it so badly.Throwaway obviously. My main account is too mean for anyone to take seriously. Plus, there'll always be the asshole who uses this against me.

I don't even know how it happened. I grew up with a loving family who look after me. I'm writing this on a Â£500 phone which I bought using money from a job I enjoy doing. So why the hell can't I stop thinking about killing myself, or someone just shooting me out of nowhere. Everyday my mind is torn between harming myself or hurting other people, just because I think it'll help make me smile for a bit. 

I can't keep going back to school, there isn't a point. I spend most of my days trying to walk outside. And when I do, I put on the smile. I can't let the kids I help see that I'm constantly hating myself. I can't let people see that when I'm up the mountains with them, I want to just walk off the edge of a cliff. Everyday as I leave my house for school a truck drives by. It's fast enough to kill me before he can even hit the brakes. But I can't let him get in trouble.

I've been planning to just go into the city and pick fights with assholes that'll just kick the shit out of me until I don't feel anything anymore. Or maybe I'll actually survive. I don't care anymore
