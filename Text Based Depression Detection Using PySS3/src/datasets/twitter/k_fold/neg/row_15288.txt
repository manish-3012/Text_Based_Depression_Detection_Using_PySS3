He's gone,and I'm having trouble seeing the point anymore...He was my love for 13 years,we were married 4. Just bought our first house a few months ago.
He always said he would never leave me or hurt me,but now he has. And I'm having a hard time getting out of bed in the morning. I just want to not have to wake up again. I don't want to try to build the life I don't want, the life without him.
