I want to end itRecently I just received news that my g/f is prego. Ever since she told me all I think about is pulling my gun out of my night stand and killing myself. I've had a lot of suicide thoughts starting last summer. I always seem happy, then I get these terrible thoughts to just end it and how happy it would make me. Then I think of my family and then I feel even worse. I'm worried I'm running out of time. I feel I might turn into an alcoholic if I don't shoot myself, which in my mind would still be killing myself. I can't talk to anyone, I'm not sure why either.
