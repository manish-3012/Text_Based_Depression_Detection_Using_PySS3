I experienced something terrible this afternoon.Please be warned, the following may not be appropriate for everyone on this sub to read. I was hiking around one of the canyons near home today for several hours and afterwards I drove to the summit to turn around and head home. At the top I encountered a young man who was completely distraught, speaking with a 911 operator. A bystander was trying to console him with little success. Apparently, minutes before, the kidâ€™s uncle climbed a nearby hill, just forty yards or so and used a weapon to take his own life. I wouldnâ€™t have believed it except for the kid falling apart. Pretty sure he witnessed the whole thing. A couple of bystanders and myself started climbing the hill to check on the man but the nephew yelled At us, saying 911 didnâ€™t want anyone going up there until Police And  EMS arrived. That fucking sucked, deciding to turn around. I know the oddS where low of making a difference but fuck. 

I never saw the victim. I didnâ€™t see or hear anything except this poor kidâ€™s reaction to his world being fucking shattered. I called my brother and told him what happened. Then I started losing it. I broke down. Started saying â€œfuck, fuck!â€ I couldnâ€™t help it. The cops were there by then with medics, so I just drove home. In retrospect I donâ€™t think it was real smart to drive just then. The whole drive down the canyon I was just a wreck. I okay now though. Anyway I just needed to lay it out. Not sure if this is even the most appropriate forum. Thanks for reading.
