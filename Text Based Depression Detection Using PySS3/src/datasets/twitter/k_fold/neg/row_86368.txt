There aren't any good optionsI either live until I die naturally or I kill myself. Neither makes any difference to me or the universe.

Living is hard. Circumstances don't matter, I just hate living. I used to think I felt bad because of external reasons but I've come to understand that I just hate existence itself.

Suicide is freedom. 

Suicide is easy.

Suicide is selfish.

It would destroy my father and my sister. I love them. I don't want to hurt them. 

But that in and of itself does not allow me to keep living. 

It's equally selfish to make them my reason to live. That implies that whenever I get hurt me it's their fault for forcing me to be alive. Eventually I'll come to hate them for forcing me to endure the pain of being alive. Sometimes I already do.

I can't die because of them, but I also can't live a life I hate just because of them. 

To go on living I need to make peace with myself and find my own motivation. Nobody else can do that for me, and I don't know how to do it myself. My only other options are suicide or killing myself with anti depressants. The part of me that hates being alive is me. Without it I'll just be an empty shell of a human.
