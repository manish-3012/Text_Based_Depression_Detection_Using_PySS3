Cry for helpI sit here in silence with just the sound of a refrigerator humming and car pasting outside my window. These few noises I hear, getting louder and louder. I try to drown out all the noise but all I here is my heart beating. Its differently then when I remembered. Its louder and heavier then usually. I want it to stop. I need it to stop. Why won't these noises stop. I'm trying to live. Even though I don't want to. My whole life I thought about ended it. I wanted to end it. I just didn't want to end my life in pain. I wanted to go off while I sleeping. I wanted to just close my eyes and never come back. Will I still suffer in my after life. Will I feel pain. I am so tired. I am so tired of this pain so familiar to me. The sad thing is I trying to be strong for my family. What will my grandma think. Will I end her life in the process of ending mines. Will she cry. Will my family cry when my body is being lowered into the ground. "Just end it" theses words in my head as I think about crushing up these muscle relaxers. Will 9 pills do the trick? Who will find my body?  Will these pills stop my heart. After all I have nothing. I have no one but myself.  I will in short time have no puppy, no home, and a life taken away by me. "Should I wait" I think to myself. Should I wait for a sign. Should I call but what can they say. What could calling the suicide hotline do? They can't fix anything in my life and they cant fix me. Because I was broken a long time ago.
