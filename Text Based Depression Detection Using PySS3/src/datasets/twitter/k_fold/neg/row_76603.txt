How do I help myself while I feel okay?I have been depressed for over 8-9 years now, but was never suicidal until January of this year. I've spent the past few months planning my hanging for the beginning of April, finally clear of all of the birthdays and celebrations...but I happened to have a very good week and the weather changed. The mixture picked me up...but any time my mood drops the thoughts come back. I'm still comfortable with the thought, and can still say I am okay with doing it. How do I get out of it while I am in this elated mood?

Every summer I have a repeated project at work that requires a lot of hours and always stresses me out. In that time I always lose track of myself and fall into a deep depression. I hate the job itself, but am tied to it due to debt. I don't want to do it. I was supposed to spend the rest of the year resetting to prepare for it...but instead this shit came up. Ugh, just typing that out... What can I do now before I end up dead in the middle of July? I've tried schedules, working out, eating well, sleeping well...blah blah, I always end up back here. I feel like nothing I do works. I always spiral out of control after a month or two, and end up locking myself up in my house for three to four months. I do not want to do this again. I cannot go through the summer shit again. I have NO OTHER WAY TO PAY OFF THE DEBT AND GET OUT OF THIS SHITHOLE.  I have no marketable skills, I cannot go to school to finish my degree due to time and financial constraints (debt), I am addicted to impulse with absolutely no social backing. I have no social support, none. I guess I have my mother, but as soon as I mention this fucking shit she spreads all of my problems to the entire family. WHAT THE FUCK AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?! I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THIS SYSTEM SHOULD BE IN PLACE. WHAT DOES THIS SHIT EVEN MEAN?! WHAT FUCKING FORCE MANDATED THAT I HAVE TO WORK A MINIMUM OF 40 HOURS A WEEK SO THAT I CAN AFFORD SOME BULLSHIT THAT WALMART THINKS I SHOULD OWN?!? I JUST WANT TO...I'm sorry. I would edit that shit out and, I don't know, it's just how things hit me. I guess it's more honest if I just leave it in. That's what I mean, if I dwell on issues I lose my fucking mind. Probably going without saying, I now feel the pressure in my mind. I don't know how to explain that, it's just a way to describe how the depression attacks me. I want help. I'm going to take a sleeping pill so that I am not up all night and tired at work in the morning...so I'll read any suggestions tomorrow morning.
