Anorexia recovery and tinnitus is making me a nervous wreckHey everyone.

I've been in anorexia recovery for two years now. I was eating less than 1,000 calories and was at a dangerous BMI for nearly eight years along with doing a lot of exercise, so it's not really a surprise I still haven't fully recovered yet. On a regular day to day basis i'm drained and I have to snack constantly just to function. I recently had to stop working because I would be in a brain fog constantly, sometimes even driving is scary because I'm so hungry and I can't think straight.

To add to this, three days ago I've started to notice this low pitched noise when it's quiet or when I cover my ears that goes on constantly. I think I've managed to get tinnitus from listening to music in my car and my headphones too loudly, so I've been stressed out and angry at myself for this.

Between these two, I'm horribly depressed. I don't know when I'm going to fully recover, despite trying hard and reaching out to my therapist and dietitian for help. Additionally, even though the tinnitus isn't severe, I don't want this buzzing for the rest of my life and I feel horrible that I could have prevented this. I feel like I'm never going to have my life back, let alone function like a regular person, and it has left me feeling suicidal. Part of me thinks that I should go to the hospital, but at the same time, I'm not sure what they'll be able to do for me other than put me on antidepressants. I'm just at a loss of what to do.
