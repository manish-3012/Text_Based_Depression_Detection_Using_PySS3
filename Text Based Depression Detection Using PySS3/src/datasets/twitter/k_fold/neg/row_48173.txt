I hate myself Iâ€™m a horrible person and I donâ€™t deserve to liveI manipulate my boyfriend constantly, I make him give up things that take him away from me, I get upset and make him worry if he doesnâ€™t do what I want. I donâ€™t mean to hurt him I adore him more than anything, I think I know whats best for him, I want him to never leave me.

I was molested as a child by multiple people, now I have violent sexual fantasies that make me feel like a monster. I want to be hit and tied up and used when I canâ€™t do anything to stop it, I want to say stop and be ignored. Itâ€™s so sick and I feel disgusting, I donâ€™t know whats wrong with me and the guilt of wanting to be raped and hurt when it happens to so many people including myself consumes me and I feel disgusting.

I feel like a horrible human being, Iâ€™m a waste of space and an insufferable attention whore who will never be satisfied and will always need more, I feel invisible if I donâ€™t feel desired, I want to be wanted more than anything but no amount of attention from a person will ever be enough.

I feel like a hole, taking what I can trying to feel full but it never being enough and ending up emptier and emptier.

I hate myself, I truly hate myself and I wish I didnt exist
