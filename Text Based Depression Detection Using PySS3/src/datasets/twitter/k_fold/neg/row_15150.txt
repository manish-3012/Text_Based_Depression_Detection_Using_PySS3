I want to dieEvery single day I think about dying, the ways in which I could kill myself and when. I donâ€™t see any sense in continuing on. My life has been full of so many traumas and obstacles and it never ends, I donâ€™t think I can keep enduring. Iâ€™m completely isolated right now, no friends, in an extremely rural area with no car, I have almost no money, pregnant, and see no end in sight. I donâ€™t know how I can improve my situation, I just want to die.
