I canâ€™t do this anymoreIâ€™m absolutely at the end of my tether. I donâ€™t feel like myself. Iâ€™ve completely lost touch with reality. I canâ€™t feel my body or connect to my surroundings. Everyone looks unfamiliar, my body feels like itâ€™s on fire, i feel like Iâ€™m dying, why cant it just happen? I donâ€™t want it to be an attempt I genuinely cannot cope
