There's no point of fightingToday I had one realization... And is that, there's no point about trying to defy fate.

My fate is to be someone who is going to keep losing, and losing, and losing, and nothing or no one shall change that.

I guess I'm going to need to accept what God gave me, and endure whatever life throws at me until I die, that's the point, right?

To endure things like a machine, to feign being truly happy, to ignore everything and just focus into survival, isn't that right?

No matter where I go, someone will hate me, or I'll make someone hate me with my attitude and stupid personality, so right now, I'm going to cherish those few friends I still have, alongside my family, and that's it. I won't try to make new friends, because... What's the point?

Also... This is going to be the last semester I'm going to send homework to people from my college. Next one, if they want to I could explain homework to them, but no more free homework for anyone.

I don't care if people start hating me in the future, I tried, I fucking tried to do things right, did that work? NOT AT ALL!

How can I help create a world where no one has to fake their smiles, when I fake mine every single day? That's the promise I made to a friend, someone whom I broke many promises I made to him, someone whom I stopped talking for a long time because I feared rejection, and now, I probably lost his friendship... One of many friendships I lost because of my stupidness, inmaturity and foolishness...

I know I'll probably regret this but... Who cares, when I tried to be careful things went wrong, maybe this time, if I'm not careful, the opposite would happen.
