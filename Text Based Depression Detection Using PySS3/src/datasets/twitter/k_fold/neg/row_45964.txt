Mandatory ReportersI live in California.

I frequently feel ready to die, and struggle with talking about my feelings and intent when with my therapist and psychiatrist because of mandatory reporting laws. I want to either live happy and free, or die free. I don't want to go back to the psych ward.

Who can I talk to, in person, that isn't mandated by law to report me? Are there any professionals?
