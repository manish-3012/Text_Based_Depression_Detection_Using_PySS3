I tried my first edible two days ago and all I want to do now is get completely fucked up.Thereâ€™s nothing in the world that brings me joy anymore. The only things that make me happy are getting as far away from it as possible. First video games and the internet and now I believe marijuana will become my next way of escape.

I donâ€™t know what to do it seems like there are no answers and nobody on this planet understands me. I canâ€™t communicate my true thoughts or have a real relationship. If this hadnâ€™t happened I was on my way to a really good college and I probably could have done something productive with my life. Now I feel like dropping out of highschool is my option and the only things that make me feel anything are the internet and heavy doses of marijuana.
