Im scared shitless for my friendHer texts were very short and to the point, they're normally not like the this. She recently made a post in r/vent apologizing about things that shouldnt be apologized for. Shes told me that shes had suicidal thoughts and stuff, so I have a feeling about whats going on here. She doesn't seem to want to talk. I told her that im always here for her if she wants to. And she didn't want to talk about anything. I'm really scared for her. I just want to help...
