just want to know that i once existedI think my upbringing is driving me crazy because I am nothing but a bundle of contradictions
I dont want to die but I dont want to continue living 
I want to kill myself but I'm afraid of pain
people say to live for the people you love but I want them to know that while I was here I was suffering.
I've told a few people these thoughts but I don't want to be a burden but at the same time if they become tired of me it would justify these thoughts to just finally get it over with. I like to think people care only when it is convenient because true friendship takes time that I don't have. I am a convenience to be around and if I'm not perhaps I'm a joke because I can't see why someone would want to be around someone as self loathing as I am. or maybe I'm great at hiding it

I set a date to disappear but I backtracked because I'm a coward but I'm also disgusted with myself that I can't bring myself to do it. I am an entitled prick because I have a roof and an education yet I can't help it but want to lose everything I have and leave this place. I know so many people in the world have it worse in every way possible yet here I am so maybe this is some sort of divine retribution that I don't deserve what I have. I'm set to go to college but I don't think I will make it past this school year

the school counselor I talked to basically told me that these were common thoughts and dismissed me in less than ten minutes which I find hilarious because all I want is antidepressants in case I actually go crazy

I have hotline numbers saved into my phone which I will never use because it has gotten to a point where I am content with wallowing in my self pity and going deeper into this spiral of what ever the fuck it is.

I just wanted to get this off my chest before I lose it. I was once a person with a heart and a clear mind
