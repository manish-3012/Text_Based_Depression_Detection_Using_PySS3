I took an overdose and now I'm scaredI don't know how much I took but I had 2400mg citalopram laid out and I got part way through and I chickened out. And I've called 999 and a doctor is going to call me back and maybe an ambulance at some point but I'm so scared. What have I done? My parents. I love them so much.
