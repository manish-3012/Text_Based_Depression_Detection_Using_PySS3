I need help, but I can't get it.I can't kill myself. The funeral costs would be too high for my family. I'd let down my mother, my best friend, my coach. I can't do that to them.

I can't go into therapy. My mother "doesn't believe in" depression. She says it's all in my head. She refuses to send me into therapy no matter how much I ask and beg for some kind of help.

I can't hospitalize myself. Too expensive. 

I can't hurt myself. I don't want to go down that dark path again.

I don't know what to do. I can't give up, but I can't keep going.
