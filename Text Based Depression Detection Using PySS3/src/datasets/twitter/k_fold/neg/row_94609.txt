here it comes againYes, I'm being treated. No, I don't have a plan. Chronic, not acute -- yellow alert, not red.

Almost certainly I'll dig myself out of this hole. I'll spend a few months more motionless and wishing I didn't exist, then I'll gradually find some way back towards normality. Then plod through, working and talking, and gradually make up for the time I wasn't there. But before I get close to actually _enjoying_ life, I'll tip back into depression, and go through the cycle all over again.

It's boring, and it's exhausting, and I can't see any way out other than death. I'm 33 now; I've been doing this for almost 20 years. In the past I could (sometimes) believe in the possibility of change. Now I've been round the block enough times that I can't. Even in my best states I can't see anything brighter than just-barely keeping my head above water until the next collapse.
