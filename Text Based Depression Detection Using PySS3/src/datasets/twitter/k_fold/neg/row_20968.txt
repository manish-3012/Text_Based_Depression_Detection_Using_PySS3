I'm in college, i'm problematic, i'm suicidal'm in my 5th year in college. I am getting C's on my Chemistry major that i hate.. I hate myself for not making the right decisions until it's too late. I've neglected many possible opportunities because of my stupid mindset. Now i might not graduate. I want to be a nurse but now it's gonna take more years to become one. Not only that I have so many loans waiting for me to repay them back. My family is blaming me for being poor and for being drowned in a financial crisis. I don't want to cry alone anymore, i'm tired of waking up and i'm tired of thinking about my problems. I just want to end my life. I want to die so badly. I feel like there is no escape to this situation. And it's only gonna get worse.
