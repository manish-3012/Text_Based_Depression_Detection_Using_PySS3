There's peace nowSo, here I am again. I feel a bit silly every time I swing around to the idea of suicide, because every time I do I get more and more comfortable with it. I used to be terrified of death, but now I feel nothing but a euphoric giddiness at the idea of going. There will be sadness and pain as I get closer to the deed over the next few days, but for now I feel good. At peace. Maybe, like the other times, I won't go through with it, but it's getting so easy, so, so easy to think about, plan, begin....

Why am I typing this. I don't know. Everything becomes and feels okay when suicide is on the table. I'm okay. I'm fine. I just need to stay calm and do it. I can't express these thoughts anywhere else, so there we go. I'm fine, I just need to make it to the finish line. Then I can be okay for pretty much forever. 

All that's left is to do a few things for the people around me. Clean, give that gift to Shawn, etc. I've still got some things to take care of. Tonight's a nice night to do it, though every night's a nice night for awhile ( I love the wintertime and stars). 

What am I looking for in typing this? I have no idea. Maybe I want someone to have this obscure, tiny trace of me after I'm gone. A little bit of me out in the world. It's comforting. Doesn't feel so lonely thinking about that. Something still here, on the earth, even though its just a comment in a thread all but a dozen people will see. It's still something. 

 I feel like I can really just die this time. Quietly. It feels nice.
