I'm sick of people claiming lesbians are horrible peopleMy god, lesbians are so horrible for not wanting to date trans women or bi women or whoever. We have preferences. Apparently lesbians are so horrible for having opnions and preferences. My sex and dating life isn't political, it isn't to make a statement. Fuck off and stop blaming lesbians for everything. We never get anything to ourselves without apparently being exclusionary. 

I'm sick of people thinking lesbians are such horrible, abusive, predatory and oppressive people. Fuck off. I'm sick of seeing it. I don't even know if it's just wankers on the internet arguing or if it's in real life too. 

But I'm done. Everything and everyone constantly tells me I'm a *horrible* person for being a lesbian. That lesbians are horrible and unsatisfied. No one cares about lesbians. No one sticks up for us or fights for us. No one. Not gay men. Not heterosexuals. Not bisexuals. No one. I'm sick of bisexuals generalizing lesbians and how shitty ans biphobic we all are. Fuck off. 

I want to fucking kill myself. I want to fucking die. I fucking hate myself and being a lesbian so much. Hopefully I'll pull the plug soon, I'll do Sjw's and conservatives a favour.
