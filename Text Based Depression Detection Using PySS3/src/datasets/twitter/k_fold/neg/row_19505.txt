Im probably gonna kill myself soon and nothing can stop meNo friends, really bad social anxiety, even if i was to some how magically get rid of my social anxiety and be a normie, as you get older you find most people already have established group of friends and its hard to fit in.
Im tired of wasting my youth alone while people my age are having fun with their lives. Good thing about it is,if i rope rn, noone would miss me or be sad.
