just stuff that makes me depressedparents that hate themselves, 
suffering in meat farm, 
child that never had a chance in life, 
human traficking, 
bosses that project their personal problem on the employee, 
people that are obviously suffering but silent,
your cat getting hit by a car,
the implied hierarchy of human value based on their location/genes,
parents that work to make 4 people live,
unarchived(forgotten) humans,
night jobs,
me,

this list is to be expended if you wish.
