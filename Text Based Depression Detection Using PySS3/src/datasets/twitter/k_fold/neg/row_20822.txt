Stop spamming bullshit hotlines.They donâ€™t help. Iâ€™ve never heard a single story of someone actually being helped by some random stranger trained to call the cops if you say youâ€™re suicidal and hang up on you if you say you arenâ€™t.

Fake bullshit. I want to talk to a real person, not some shitty volunteer. All you people spamming hotlines do is make me wanna die more.

And before you ask, yes Iâ€™ve called one before, and they told me I was wasting their time, because I said I wasnâ€™t suicidal atm.

Fuck your shit hotlines and fuck you.
