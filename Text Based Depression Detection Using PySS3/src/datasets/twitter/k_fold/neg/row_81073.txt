Life is great, wish my depression felt the same.Life is going well, I suppose. I've got a job, I'm with my human whom I love, and I have a somewhat social life now(which has never happened before). I was at a great high just a couple of minutes ago when my depression just hit out of nowhere. After going through this so many times over the years, I understand how to deal with it. Yet, every time it feels brand effing new, ya know? There is nothing more in the world that I want to do but slip into old habits right now. I just want to die. Now, usually I deal with it by talking it out with someone or doing something to "get my mind off of it" but right now I have no energy or drive to do anything. I literally just want to end it. I am s o sick and tired of being sick and tired. I hate it that I have nothing to be down over, that I literally cannot help it. But just going to attempt to sleep and see which side of the bed I wake up on tomorrow.
