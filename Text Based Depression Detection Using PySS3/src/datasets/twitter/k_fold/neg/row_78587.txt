All I want is to go to sleep in 2016 and not wake up in 2017I hope I'm not over-posting. It's New Year's Eve day and I am so tired. I can't handle another year like this one, filled with both personal sorrows and the disintegration of the world I love. I cannot bear the thought of living with the situation I'm in personally, or being forced to stand by helplessly as the world continues to crumble and my beloved, dear country falls apart. I've spent the last year as an activist despite my own personal issues. I can't do it anymore. I can't bear it that there are people with the power to change things for the better and they're all burying their heads in the sand. I can't seem to fix anything or even make a dent. Every time I try to fix my own life, three other things go wrong. If there is a deity, why won't he make it stop?
