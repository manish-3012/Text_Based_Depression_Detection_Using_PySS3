Anybody want to talk?Just kind of sick of it all. Itâ€™s hard to keep going, working a few jobs with chronic illness is tough. I just want to sleep and rest all day. But I have to make money to pay bills. All aspects of my life suck. I have nothing going for me. I know that things CAN get better, but that could take years. Just feel like breaking down right now.
