Everything has fallen apartI just canâ€™t do this anymore, my mental state has been getting constantly worse to the point where Iâ€™m almost constantly thinking about ending my own life, worst part is because my friends knew about it but I canâ€™t ask for help directly they cut contact for a month leaving me to suffer.

Today when I was already feeling more suicidal than normal my friend was getting into it but when I explained why I canâ€™t make myself ask for help he blocked me :)

He was one of my few friends, and since this is what happened last time, the others probably hate me too, theyâ€™d be better off without me anyway. I had promised myself that I wouldnâ€™t live to 20 and with my birthday coming up next month it seems that everything is coming together, any suggestions for writing a suicide note before I go?
