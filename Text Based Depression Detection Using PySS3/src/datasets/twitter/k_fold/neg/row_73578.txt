depressionsince i suffer from clinical depression and while i try to enjoy what life is, things that used to bring me any amount of joy does not anymore, wither that be sex, smoking weed, hanging with my girlfriend, or anything else that used to "give me joy". while from the last few days all i have been thinking about is death, wither that be suicide or going through doctor assisted suicide. what is left for me to enjoy, other than death, watching people getting killed, and my profound interest for metaphysics such as occult and understand how the government works and how to dismantle it.
