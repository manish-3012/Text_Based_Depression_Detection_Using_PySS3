Itâ€™s getting pretty hard to get everything out of my head.I want to end my life really bad, itâ€™s been getting a lot worse the last few months. I smoke a lot of weed, which is probably making me really depressed, or at least contributing. I had these feelings before I picked up the habit. 

Iâ€™m currently writing this in the bathroom at work, sobbing silently while someoneâ€™s dropping a massive deuce in the next stall over. Thatâ€™s pretty funny, but anyways hereâ€™s the point:

Ever since I was a young teenager (iâ€™m currently 18), Iâ€™ve had no more motivation. I donâ€™t do anything, I donâ€™t want to do anything, I want nothing. I feel worthless and hard to love, Iâ€™m lazy as hell because I never want to do anything, which turns into me calling into work. Iâ€™m lucky that I can do that at my full time job and not have to pay rent, but now I have no absences left to take. 

So Iâ€™m crying in here, all pathetic like, at work, because I canâ€™t call in anymore, and I canâ€™t take the stress of being here while Iâ€™m feeling these feelings. Iâ€™ve skipped school all through G10-12, and now I call into work any chance I get. How come Iâ€™m such a scumbag? How come I canâ€™t deal with a normal 9-5 Mon-Fri? Thatâ€™s a normal thing to do. People have jobs and donâ€™t complain. They donâ€™t call in. How come I absolutely must? Why donâ€™t I have the motivation to get through ONE DAY without doing this stupid shit. Thereâ€™s nothing left to me. Iâ€™m literally a husk, no more life in me. I canâ€™t stop myself, I have no control over my decisions. I want what I want, and I get what I want no matter what, and I feel like an absolute piece of shit, and a waste. I have for years. 

I used to think suicidal people just want attention and that theyâ€™re drama queens. Can you believe that? Now look at me lol. Iâ€™m an absolute mess. Maybe I deserve it for that. Iâ€™ve been to therapy. I have no identification to get prescribed anything right now, as I just moved in with my S/O not long ago from out-of-province. 

Iâ€™m literally in the bathroom pretending to be sick so I can go home. Iâ€™m pathetic. This is low. I donâ€™t want to be this person. Iâ€™m stuck, feels like I have no where to go. 

Iâ€™m not going to end my life, at least not any time soon. I just want to talk to someone about this. I need it out of my head. I hope someone can at least relate. I canâ€™t be alone. I donâ€™t know what I would do if I was alone in feeling this. 

Tldr; I have no control over my actions, although Iâ€™m completely aware of what Iâ€™m doing. I have no self control, no motivation, and because of that I think low of myself and want to end my life. Hope someone can relate. Iâ€™ve been reading posts here and have found lots to relate to. 

Sorry if thereâ€™s any typos. Sorry for the ramble, hope it makes sense.
