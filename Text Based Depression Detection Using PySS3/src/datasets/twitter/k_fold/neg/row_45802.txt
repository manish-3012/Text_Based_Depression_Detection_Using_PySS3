Marriage on the rocks, job uncertainty and car accident to top it offMy husband has been saying for a year that he wants to end it, but hasnâ€™t done anything yet. This has given me deeeep depression and I keep going back and forth between our apartment and my parents.

This Monday all of a sudden my manager is leaving and Iâ€™m placed in a new team, where I might not be needed soon and my job has no guarantee.

To top it off I get into a collision yesterday where everything was blamed on me even though the red lights were out due to the storm. Never had to go to court or get a lawyer but now I might have to. 

These things always stress me out and since last night Iâ€™ve been contemplating ways to end it. Iâ€™m too scared to cut, I donâ€™t know if pills and alcohol will do it for me. Hanging seems to be the way but Iâ€™m still scared. Itâ€™s become too painful for me to move on like this. I canâ€™t imagine living for another 40/50 years like this.
