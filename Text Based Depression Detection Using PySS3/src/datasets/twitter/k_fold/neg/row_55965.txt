I don't know anymoreTwo years ago was the last time I posted here and for a few months after my post I managed to keep my life together. However, I didn't keep it together. I was removed from university almost a year ago. My family doesn't know and thinks i'm graduating soon. This is the second time I have done this to my family. I thought I could fix it and I end up getting stuck inside my head without actually doing anything to make the situation better. I have suffered from major depression and have been off and on medication during that time. Sense I started high school, I have felt like a colossal disappointment. I have no interests, hobbies or passions left at this point. Everything I once was has been slowly eroded away. For the last few years I have toyed with the idea of suicide and currently would rather die then tell my family that I lied to them about school again. I can't bring myself to tell my family what I did and want to just fade away at this point. I haven't gotten out of bed in 3 days and have just been looking at a knife beside me just trying to figure out which path is best. I can count the list of people on one hand that would even notice I was gone. I hate what I am now and every time I have tried to change it in recent years it has completely blown up in my face and left me in a worse place than I was before I tried. I just don't know how to fix what I have done at this point. I don't know what i'm looking for here other than for someone to say something.
