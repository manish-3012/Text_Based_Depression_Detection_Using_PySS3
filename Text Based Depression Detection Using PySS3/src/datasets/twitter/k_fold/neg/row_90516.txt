How do you go on when no one around you understands?All my dad told me was â€œyouâ€™ve never had a fucking miserable day in your life. You donâ€™t realize it but youâ€™re fucking selfish and spoiled.â€ I think he got one thing right at least. I am pretty selfish. Iâ€™ve wanted to kill myself for years now but....he only makes it worse. I hate everyone around me. They donâ€™t understand. I donâ€™t even understand. My life isnâ€™t a hard one so why do I wish I was dead every second of the day?
