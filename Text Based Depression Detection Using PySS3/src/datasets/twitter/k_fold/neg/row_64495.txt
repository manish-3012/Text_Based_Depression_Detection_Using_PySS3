hate my lifeI once spent nearly 2 years without leaving my mothers basement. I have no self esteem. I cant get drunk because i turn into even more of an animal than i normally am. I cant relate to people. in purely social situations (outside of work) i am mute. I have everything wrong with me, from social anxiety, self abandonment, depression, personality disorder, trust issues, fear, identified with negative thought concepts/structure. the only thing i have is money. and thats because spending it on a phone, car and clothes would be utterly pointless because i would still be a freak.
