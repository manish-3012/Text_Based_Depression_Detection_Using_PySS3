I've had active suicidal thoughts for the past 171 days, every day.This doesn't count the prior hundreds of days that I've been passively suicidal. And this doesn't count the prior hundreds of days I've been in a major depressive "episode" without direct suicidality. 

How is talking to someone supposed to help? Everyone has the same things to say.

I try to have faith in the mental health system (medication-wise and talk therapy wise). But it's literally faith. Last time I was hospitalized I was told I should just be in residential mental health housing and just be watched indefinitely. 

Everytime I see a high-profile suicide or overdose, it gives me a sense of satisfaction. They got somewhere that I want to be. 

A lot of times I think people were right in committing suicide.
