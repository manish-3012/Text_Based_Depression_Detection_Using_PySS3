These are probably my last wordsI swallowed so much toxic medications and chemicals. Iâ€™m in the hospital but nobody knows that I did this. They only know that my heart rate is high. Iâ€™m going to die. I just know it and Iâ€™m actually not scared anymore of dying. I guess Iâ€™m posting this to yâ€™all as a sort of elegy or vent post. Iâ€™m so sorry for my family and friends, but I have no purpose here.
