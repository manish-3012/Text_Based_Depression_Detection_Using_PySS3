I have nothing left.My girlfriend of nearly three years just ended our relationship because she feels as though she isnâ€™t able to love me as well as i love her. I lost my mom in September of 2017, with my girlfriend holding my hand as it happened. I have nothing to live for, had planned my life after graduation around her, and now am left in shambles and alone. There is nothing left for me, no person to understand and love me, and no one to work for. I just want to crawl in a while and die.
