"i am i, and i wish i weren't"There are people in this world who are necessary and useful to humanity, I however am not one of them. I have been meditating on my place in this earth and have recently realized that it is not a place I want to be. I have no friends, no motivation, nothing to live for. I wake up, go to work, come home, self harm, go to sleep. Rinse, and repeat. Day in and day out. I am in my late twenties, and this is how I am spending my life. When not on this loop I daydream about what could have been, what I could have done and where I could be at in this life. Yet, I am not there so the darkness sets in and it all crashes down again. I am a verified loser, Iâ€™ve never even dated a dude because anxiety. I have done absolutely nothing with my life, because of this I think it is reasonable to end it. No loss. I played the game, it didnâ€™t work for me.
