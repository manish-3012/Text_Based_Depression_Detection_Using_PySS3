Loneliness is the worstI'm alone and lonely. I recently lost my only person in my life. I was left and immediately forgotten. "We weren't meant to be". I deserved the insults I got and I understand how It must feel like to be with someone like me. I don't blame them. I'm just really sorry that I had to ruin someone's life with my issues and instability. Strangely enough, I don't want to kill myself. I want to get into a coma and forget everyone and everything. I want to just restart everything and forget it happened. How do I give myself amnesia... how do I get into a coma. How do I forget everything. How do I restart. 
Thank you for reading.
