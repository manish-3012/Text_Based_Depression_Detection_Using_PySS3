People became mad at me for the trauma I put them through by my suicide attempt. does that make any sense?It was like I should feel bad for THEM ecause I was so distrought and tried to end it all.  So I ended up apologizing and just feeling worse about myself.  It solidified the notion that no one cares and it doesn't matter if I go or not.
