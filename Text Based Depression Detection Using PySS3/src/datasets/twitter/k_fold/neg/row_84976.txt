I just have no idea what to do nextI'm 16 male and trans I think. Everyday I'm anxious, some times I have panic attacks and it's driving me more and more depressed, if I get dysphoric I instantly go in to a depressed mood. Everyday it's constant suicidal ideation for me, there're trains going nearby and if something goes too bad i'll just go there and jump in front of a train. The worst part neither my parents care about my mental health neither they care about my emotions. At best I'd just probably get told to toughen up or ignored. I can't see a therapist or a psychiatrist cause they would react badly to me being trans and my mental issues being caused by it. That little joke I made a year ago that it's gonna get worse and worse everyday and i'll just kill myself is becoming more real every day. Cause the quarantine I sit at home and the lack of sunlight and social interactions makes me feel even worse. Everyday I find things which trigger me more and more and combined with my state I'll just rather go and jump in front of a train then have a panic attack on the floor and rip my hair out while crying feeling worse and more fucking worse. I can't really pass how bad my anxiety and emotions get, what I wrote here is a huge understatement.
