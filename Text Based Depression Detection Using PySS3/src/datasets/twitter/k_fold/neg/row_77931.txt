I posted here about a month back and things have changed...So I bought a gun last month. A used HK USP. I'm not depressed as I was when I was in university but the idea of having an life ejection button keeps my head level. Yesterday it dawned on me that I don't have anything in my life that keeps me going. I don't like talking. I have a major bipolar and anxiety disorder. I'm anxiety average redditor I guess, I have favourite subs and participate in discussions. I do have a steady job I think. I don't really have hobbies that I do regularly. I've never thought of suicide until I bought the gun. I did buy it for protection purposes. But now I feel like suicidal thoughts are crossing my mind constantly. If my day goes bad I feel that I could just head home and end it. It kind of feels like a weight in my head. Sorry my mind is all over the place as I'm typing. I'm starting to see all that's wrong in my life. What I'm basically asking is, "How can I stop this way of thinking?"
