Miss the Past, Hate the Present, Scared of the FutureI get so sad sometimes thinking about the past and how I used to be so close with some people and now we have no connection at all. I hate the present cause I'm so hung up in all the friends I've lost and good memories I don't have any more. I know people will say to move on, but it's so difficult when I've already invested so much time in a group of people who don't care about me anymore. I feel uninteresting and useless. I'm scared of the future because what if this is what my life is destined to be? A pattern of spending so much time on friendships then losing friends?
