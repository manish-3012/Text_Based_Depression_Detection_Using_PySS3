I quit taking my meds. If I die, I die.Right now I'm studying psychology after I realized I was too stupid to pursue my dream career in biology. I couldn't afford the further testing, but it's extremely likely I have dyscalculia, a math learning disorder. And the courses for a biology degree included lots of physics, organic chemistry, and life science calculus. So I thought maybe psychology would be a better route for me. Maybe then I could go to grad school and help people like me. Help in the ways that I've been helped.

But I just know I won't get into grad school. I just know. They're going to read my application and immediately tell how stupid and crazy I am. They're going to throw my application away and laugh in my face.

I was on Lexapro, Abilify, and Ativan and I quit them. I think the Abilify made me gain weight. Like, I gained a lot of weight in a short time span after I started the Abilify. I don't want to take drugs anymore, they don't really help. My psychiatrist has maxed out the dosage of every drug I've been on. I officially have severe. treatment resistant depression. And possibly some sort of psychotic disorder due to my past history of delusions and auditory and visual hallucinations. I used to be so bad I thought people were following me trying to kidnap me and that aliens were trying to abduct me and my cat. Balls to the wall insane.

Especially after I quit my meds, I can feel myself getting more suicidal and I can feel my death getting closer. I don't even have the energy to talk. I know my thoughts and words make no sense but I can't stop it. I'm scared I'm going to fully lose my shit and have a complete psychotic break and end up like, getting hog tied by the cops and put into a hospital for a long time. I'd rather die than go back to the hospital. So if I end up killing myself, so be it. I don't care. Fuck the world, fuck my family, fuck my friends, fuck my future. Just throw my dead body in the trash.
