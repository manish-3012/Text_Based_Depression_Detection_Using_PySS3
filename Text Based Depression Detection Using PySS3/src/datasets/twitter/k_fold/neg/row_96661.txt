It's getting easier every time...I've been suicidal since I was in high school. Every other day I think about it. I've tried once, but I wouldn't really call that an attempt. Just took a bunch of pills, and went into the ER. That was 4 years ago. I'm turning 23 this year. I've always thought about suicide. Not really to deep into it. It's just always been at the back of my mind. As life continues to go on, Im starting to give in to it. I don't really have any value in life. I've given up on religion. I've decided that religion was created for the weak minded. It keeps them distracted from what's really happening. Gives them a feeling of calm when they shouldn't be. I've already mastered that. Though my life I've learned to calm myself almost instantly. Block out all emotions. Yet there are times where it gets the best of me. I have years of suffering stuffed up inside me. It's slowly tearing my life apart. The only reason I haven't taken my gun to my head yet is because of one line I keep thinking to myself. "This will be one hell of a story to tell". The one thing I enjoy in this world, is a good story. I've wasted days, weeks, and months watching TV shows, movies, and anime. It takes me away from my life, and brings me into a new one. If only for a brief moment. Can my story just end already. I'm tired. I just want my suffering to stop...
