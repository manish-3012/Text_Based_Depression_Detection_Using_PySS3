My future is unravelingI've never felt this close to suicide before. I'm a freshman in college and I'm failing my Chem 102 class. I need to get an A because I want to be a computer science major and its so fucking competitive here. But I'm failing the class. Theres no way I can get my dream. I don't see a future for myself anymore.

I'm alone, I don't have any friends Idk how this happened. I'm not a stupid person. I swear I'm not. My girflriend left me months ago and I'm still not over it. I'm gonna be alone for the indefinite future and that horrifies me. I don't have a future... I'm never gonna get into my dream job. 

I've never felt this lost before. I just wanna end it.
