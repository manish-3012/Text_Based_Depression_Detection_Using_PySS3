I have only days left to live, I need help now or its all going to be overThe thoughts in my head are uncontrollable. The OCD used to be like a crazy dog on a leash, the dog kept pulling me, going everywhere, but i still had it on a leash. But last night i let that leash go, im crying right now i need help!! I'm 17 and my parents cant  know about the OCD, they don't use logic..you're either christian or asylum-like crazy. How can I get medication for the OCD by tomorrow or against my own will i'm going to overdose then jump. I have 50 bucks, no credit card. I can drive to the doctors but i need the ocd medication now and without the parents knowing!!
