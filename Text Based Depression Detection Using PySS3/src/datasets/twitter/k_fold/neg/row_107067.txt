I have been depressed and suicidal my whole life, I can't take it anymore.I think I am finally ready to just give up and kick the bucket. I don't even know what i'm trying to get out of this post. I've never been happy and I have finally come to terms with the fact I never will be. I guess I just needed someone to hear me before I go. I honestly wish I was never born, I just want to this constant pain and misery to end.
