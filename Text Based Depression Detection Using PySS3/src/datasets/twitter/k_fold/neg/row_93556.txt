Whatâ€™s the point if waking life is hell?I donâ€™t feel anything anymore. I suppose thatâ€™s not true. I feel nothing. I feel the chasm and the emptiness. 

When I think about how to make it better, the only thoughts in my head say it canâ€™t get better. Iâ€™ve tried a thousand things to stop that voice. I would murder that voice while it slept if I could. But it doesnâ€™t seem to sleep and my consciousness is in Hell. 

I donâ€™t have a plan, live until I die? But I feel dead everyday. So am I dead already? I feel dead. 

So what is the point? Why am I doing anything? Iâ€™m nothing and Iâ€™ve been nothing and I will remain nothing. Why doesnâ€™t everyone feel this way?
