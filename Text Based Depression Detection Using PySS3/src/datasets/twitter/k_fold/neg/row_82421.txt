I'm like everybody elseI feel like I've ruined everything. No, no, I HAVE ruined everything. When I find a person that seems to want to be a part of my life, I have to destroy it. Right? It's not like that's the goal. But the depression clouds your vision. It makes you think you're losing something you're not. It might even make you think you have something that you don't.

I'm so alone.

I'm looking into buying a gun. It seems the next easiest solution. Did you know that modern vehicles with their catalytic converters make it practically impossible to kill yourself via CO poisoning. I didn't know that the first time I attempted. Talk about embarrassing.

I'm not worthy of a second chance.

Somebody else can constantly push boundaries, but when I do it it's a sin. I'll never be good enough. I won't get the opportunities, the concern, care, help, that others get. I'm always too late, even when if you set aside the whole suicidal thing you get something that could be an amazing friendship.

To Erin, you were perhaps the first person ever that I felt like I could be myself. Where are you?

To Joy, first is worst, but second is best. Am I really so irredeemable?

I hate so much how I feel, but I can't get out of it. I've tried everything, but I lack the support needed. I'm going to buy a gun, and I am going to kill myself.
