I don't want to do this anymore...I am a 50 year old man and have been married for thirty years. Half way through my marriage my wife started having medical problems and has had multiple surgeries. She would lose a little part of herself with each surgery. Ten years ago, she lost part of her colon to colon cancer. We haven't been intimate since. Five years ago, she has a heart attack and heart surgery. She has had the mental capacity of a 12 to 14 year old ever since. I have a 30 year old son that is mildly autistic and my wife has mild dementia and cognitive disabilities as well as physical disabilities. I can't leave as she would likely wind up destitute and she doesn't deserve that. But almost every night when I'm driving home from work and I think about my life I start to cry....
