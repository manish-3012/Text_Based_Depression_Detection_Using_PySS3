Kind of not sure what to think anymore.  I keep telling myself that everything will get better.  I have a ton of opportunities sprawled out before me, I have friends who love me, I have family I'm close with.  I go to the gym, I have a steady job, I'm enrolled in 6 classes.  But I shouldn't feel so empty and alone.  I think worthless might be the best way to explain it.  I broke up with someone a few months ago, which eats at me constantly.  He treated me extremely poorly (made me pay for everything, turned me against my friends, lied to me constantly).  I don't have regrets breaking up with him, but he sort of made me hate myself.  We dated for about three years, but the last year, he made me feel like I was losing my mind.  He treated me like I was his mother, lying to me and doing drugs behind my back.  I wanted to make it work so badly, so I became controlling.  I hated the person I became with him.  We were long distance, and the last few months I stayed with him, I found myself crying every night after he fell asleep.  

I know this all sounds stupid.  And I broke up with him for a good reason, but I still absolutely hate myself.  I feel worthless, I feel like every path I'm going to take will lead me no where.  I know there's so much ahead for me, but I can't see myself happy.  At all.  I keep having anxiety attacks that I'm just going to become this terrible, bitter person and no one will want to be around me.  I don't want to be around me most of the time.  I don't really know what I'm typing.  Or why I'm typing it.  I just don't want to hate myself anymore.  Sorry if I'm wasting your time with my stupid problems.
