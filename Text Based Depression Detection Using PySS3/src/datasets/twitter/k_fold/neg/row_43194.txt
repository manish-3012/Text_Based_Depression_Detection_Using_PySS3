Thinking of trying to get myself committed.Although it might do more harm than good.  I don't know.  I really don't know what else to do for help.  I'm thinking of just getting drunk tonight and ending it.

I don't even feel depressed.  Life has just continually shit on me and I don't want to deal with that anymore.

So this is my shitty attempt at reaching out, I guess.
