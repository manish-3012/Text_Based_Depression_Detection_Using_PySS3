I just want to say thank you.Iâ€™m still going to kill myself today, in fact Iâ€™m about an hour away know as I skipped work, but I do want to say thank you to everyone who has reached out to me this week. You made my last few days that bit brighter. 

I always wish to address people who have PMed with good intentions but appealed to my fears of the afterlife in deterring me from my goal. I donâ€™t believe in God, Heaven or Hell or any such afterlife. I have read the oxford classics editions of the Bible, the Quran and the Torah, but I was never able to find solace in any concept of life after death. I know religion can be very helpful for some but, personally, it was a useless concept for me. When I die, I am going to decompose and thatâ€™s as far as I believe in terms of any spiritual awakening after death. 

Regardless of that, thank you. This subreddit has been very helpful to me, in fact, it stopped a suicide attempt of mine when I was twelve. 

Thank you, all of you, for trying to make a difference to people. You do more good than you know.
