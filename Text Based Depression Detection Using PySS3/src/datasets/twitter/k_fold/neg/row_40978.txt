How do you find the motivation to keep going?Just one simple question - how do you find the motivation to keep going? I am honestly looking for reasons that life is worth living. I'm having a very hard time finding any answers.

People always suggest to find hobbies. I play guitar, write music, create digital art, draw, design video games, and write short stories. These are all ok as distractions I guess, but doesn't really change how I feel about anything.

I have an amazing job. I have worked so hard and for so many years to be here. I have a strong sense of accomplishment about this. But, now that I have proved to myself I can do this - now what?

I know that there are people who have it worse than me. I volunteer and give basic computer training to developmentally disabled children and adults. I like being able to help when I can.. but I don't feel like this is the reason.

For a long time, my biggest motivation was to one day have a wife and kids. I'm 32 now and just seem to be having horrible luck with women. I will go on a few dates, and things go well at first, but as they get to know me, they either get bored, or don't like who I am? I don't know what it is exactly, but it doesn't take them very long for them to move on. When I'm dating, I don't act mopey or sad like I might be coming across in this post. They genuinely seem to be having fun when we're together. I know I'm not perfect, but I don't think I'm a bad person. I feel like the door is closing pretty quickly here for me.

I have no close friends. It's not from a lack of trying, but I find it very difficult to make any kind of meaningful friendships. I have no family left.

TL;DR - I'm having a hard time finding reasons why worth is life living. I'd love to hear the things that keep you going.
