Will increasing the amount of Zoloft I take help?I have been suffering from panic attacks/anxiety for almost 3 years now and 37.5 mg's of Zoloft has been working well until recently. I started having bad anxiety and suicidal thoughts and it's freaking me out. I know that I will never kill myself but I seriously have been thinking about it at least 3 times a day for the past week. Will increasing the amount of Zoloft help? I am aware that I need to talk to a doctor before I change my dose.
