Body dysmorphiaIâ€™ve been on medication that has made me feel like Iâ€™m on top of the world, today I remembered how ugly my skin is. Iâ€™m never going to be able to live a normal life. Iâ€™ll never get to wear normal clothes, I canâ€™t even go to school because I feel so ugly. This has ruined my life and itâ€™s finally going to kill me. I donâ€™t know what comes next and Iâ€™m scared. I just hope itâ€™s peaceful. Mom, if you end up seeing this Iâ€™m sorry, I love you and I hope I see you again some day.
