I really want to dieI'm 18 and I really want to commit suicide but im too afraid of the pain. I'm usually quite good at coping with suicidal thoughts but it's getting very overwhelming, to the point if someone had a gun against my head I would beg them to shoot me. I really don't want to live anymore.
