How do I help people going through the same stuff?I wrote a few poems about a suicide attempt I had a few years ago and published them on one of those poem sharing sites and someone said I should use my writing skills to help people. That got me thinking: how can I help people in general given the experiences I've had with anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts? I don't know what I can or should do, so anything helps.
