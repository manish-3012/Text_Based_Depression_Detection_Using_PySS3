Can somebody say hi to a very lonely person..I lack everything.. I miss human interaction so much..since the start of everything. Since my mental fucked up state took place. today i went alone and drunk as usual to this place and tried to made smalltalk to some billiard players, about their plays and saying like "well played" just for them to at least look at me, but no go..

So.. Hi to all :) i love you all who despair, who want to off themselfs, selfharm, etc. Its a struggle that nobody understands, just the ones passing through it. Goodnight
