Feels like a constant battle with my mind for a while and recently I've started losingHey, first time posting as I had to google a sub for this. I've been dealing with (what I assume is, I haven't been diagnosed or anything) depression for a few years now but for the most part I could push past the thoughts even if they did get me down for a day or a week. 

I recently graduated from uni and perhaps its the lack of social interaction bringing it on but I just have a lack of motivation to do anything, I forced myself to a careers event not long ago and touched up my CV with the advice I got but it still isn't complete because of the lack of motivation. While I'm very much familiar with depressive thoughts getting me down I've never dealt with *real* suicidal thoughts, in the past I've thought about doing it but it was more so in dark times with no real intent and then it all passed. 

Normally, taking a walk with my dog or some time with friends would clear the thoughts too, usually long-term, until recently. For the first time the other day I had a *real* suicidal thought with some intent while I was out with my dog and I just felt so defeated since he was usually what helps me clear my mind.

Yesterday was another step up from what was happening previously, I finally managed to get out of the house with a friend although for the hours leading up to it I really wanted to cancel. I was having fun but part way through I just wanted to go home and be on my own again, thankfully he convinced me to stay out for 1 more drink which turned into another few hours of fun and for the rest of yesterday my mind was clear.

Now on to today and why I'm writing here, I forced myself out of bed and had a shower, just to make myself do *something*, but upon sitting back down on my bed, I sat in silence for a while wondering what to do and I just imagined a scene where I'm on the top of a building and wanting to fall off.

It's weird talking about my mind and 'me' as 2 different entities but 'I' don't want to commit suicide, but my mind is making me think its a good idea. I'm constantly reminded of mistakes I've made and how useless/ugly/stupid etc I currently am. I'm scared it will get worse before it gets better because of the scene on the roof. I want a job, relationship and everything else normal but I just can't find the motivation to push forward and I don't know how to get it.

Sorry it turned out a bit long.
