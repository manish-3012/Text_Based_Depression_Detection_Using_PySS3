Itâ€™s not that I want to die, itâ€™s that I want to cease to exist.I donâ€™t want to die. I donâ€™t want to hurt my family and friends like that. I want to not have ever existed. I want to disappear leaving no trail, just to *poof* be gone. No one has memories, or pictures to post with sob stories of â€œshe was such a good personâ€ or â€œshe changed so many livesâ€ or â€œI wish I could talk to her one last timeâ€ because they fucking just shouldâ€™ve. I donâ€™t want people to remember me, I want everyone to not have anything to miss.
