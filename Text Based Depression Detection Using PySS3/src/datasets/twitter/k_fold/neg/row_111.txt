Sorry if this is rudePeople are vague about what is going on that's causing them to be suicidal like I get why but still I've never seen a full out explanation of why someone wanted to commit die I've always wondered what is so bad that goes on in one's life to lead them to it, this is probably weird sounding but I kind of want to hear a full account of what goes on that drives someone to their breaking point
