I just wish the high would last forverThere's no point to living my shit life when in the end im just going to cease to exist anyway without any benefit.

 Everything that involves real world skills im a fuck up at. I got fired from a job this week first day because i totally forgot what i was doing ALL DAY after i got back from break and I was completely sober which obviously shows how much of a fuck up i am.

 I have to take so many fucking drugs just to feel like a normal human being. I'm tired of swallowing xanax pills, molly and percs just to go out in public without being a pissed off trainwreck. I fucking hate myself and i only live for family and few people. The thing is, I know if i took a bar right now and smoked some weed id be the total opposite happy go lucky dude everyone likes. So my two options right now are walk around high as fuck everyday and feel great, or stay sober and continue to feel like a complete dick. I even notice my google searches get way more hateful and suicidal when im sober, but when im high its just like funny memes and shit. My homies don't like seeing me strung out 24/7 like that, but the point of getting clean when everyone hates the sober me? 

I'm honestly amazed that i even have friends because I feel like a cunt and deep down i know i am one. Sometimes it leaks out on other people even though it's ME and not them and i know this. I know my problems arent anyones elses and it really just makes me want to blow my skull out because its hard to keep living everyday with hate flowing through you.  Im pretty sure you're reading this rn and thinking "wow, this guys sounds like a complete a piece of shit" and that's exactly my point. I just got downvoted to shit on askreddit for my nihilistic rant i made while I was sober...i guarantee it wouldn't of crossed my mind on weed or xanax...
