23MIve been struggling with depression for some time now, I sometimes don't even understand why I get so low, and it hurts me. I can't tell if I love people too much, or not at all. It breaks my heart cause my mom cries over my well-being, and I honestly do want to get better. Life has been really rough these last couple years and the bipolar/depression medications always make the chemical balances in my head fluctuate so much I cause myself even more heartache and pain. I hurt the ones I love most and I don't understand why. 

At the end of the day, I just want to be happy. I get close, but can never grasp it. People say that's life, it has ups and downs, but sometimes peoples downs are a lot further than people realize in the moment. The other night I tried to leave this place and thank god my girlfriend cared enough to stop me, I feel like I'm going insane and I don't know how to feel half the time, even my poetry is trash now and that kills me inside more than I can even express, thus the reason I came back to this site.
