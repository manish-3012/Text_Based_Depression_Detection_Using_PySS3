I donâ€™t really have any reason left to live [19F]
Iâ€™ve been sad for so long now. But no matter how hard I try, I canâ€™t figure out why. I have a good home life. I donâ€™t get bullied. I donâ€™t have â€œstrugglesâ€. Iâ€™m just not happy. I started cutting when I was 13 and for a while, I was able to hide it.  Unfortunately, I wasnâ€™t careful enough and my parents found out. Needless to say, they were upset. My dad got mad and my mom got worried. They put me in therapy and all I can think about is the fact that theyâ€™re spending money on me all because Iâ€™m too weak to deal with problems like everyone else. Iâ€™m still on their insurance so all the medicine that Iâ€™m on, comes out of their paycheck. 

Iâ€™m such a burden to every single person around me. I lose friends because I isolate myself and eventually they give up trying to help me. Then, I have the nerve to feel sorry for myself. Im the reason Iâ€™m lonely. Iâ€™m the one whoâ€™s a burden to others. Why should I be allowed to wallow in my own self pity?

Iâ€™ve started talking to this guy whoâ€™s so fucking sweet and heâ€™s always there for me. He struggles with depression as well. The difference however, is that his dad passed away three years ago.  Heâ€™s actually dealt with bad shit and heâ€™s putting things aside to help me. 

Iâ€™m home from my first year in college and honestly I think that was the first time I realized how much it physically hurts to be lonely. I only made one friend the entire year and back in November, she tried to kill herself. I was so worried about her and I feel so selfish because I was scared that if I lost her, Iâ€™d lose my only friend. 

I donâ€™t understand why anybody cares for me. I donâ€™t get it. Iâ€™m not worth it and any time people put into me is really just a wast of their time. Iâ€™m selfish and worthless and needy. I just hate myself so much and I canâ€™t stand the thought of being a burden to people. 

I feel so selfish. I take peopleâ€™s time. I take their energy. Iâ€™m an absolute wast of space. I donâ€™t deserve to be alive. 

I donâ€™t know why I canâ€™t fix myself. I donâ€™t know what my purpose is. I donâ€™t even think I have one. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™m gonna kill myself because I donâ€™t have the guts to do it. But fuck. Sometimes I wish I would just keel over and die. No pain. No conflict about whether or not I should. No fear of doing it wrong. No one to be mad at me for being selfish. Iâ€™d just be gone. Not a burden to anyone. It would be so much easier that way.
