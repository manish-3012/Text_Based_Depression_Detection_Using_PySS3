My girlfriend broke up with me then tried to kill herselfMy girlfriend has had many problems in the past concerning her mental health and has attempted suicide many times before. However recently it has gotten worse we had an argument the day before where she claimed that all she wanted to do was hurt people and she didn't want to hurt me so she blocked almost all forms of communication I have with her however I convinced her how much she meant to me and i think she stopped and I diffused the argument. The next day she said some bullshit excuse and broke up with me and pleaded that I shouldn't do anything stupid as I have had mental health issues in the past aswell. I was pissed of but I didn't realise it so I acted very passive aggressive which I regret so much. Later on that day she tried to kill herself with a knife. However now she is in hospital receving treatment for depression which is always good.

I can't help but think that I almost killed somebody and if me being insensitive and not telling her to do anything stupid and checking up on her was this my fault?
