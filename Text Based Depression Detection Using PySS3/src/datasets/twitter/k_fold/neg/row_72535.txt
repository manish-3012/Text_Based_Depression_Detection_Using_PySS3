I work at a construction site. I am not much sad, but whenever i look down it feels like ground is calling me to jump does this count?I mean I feel like there is the end, to all the sorrows and pains and things that i have to go through. The solution is such near it feels tempting. But i am really not as sad as other suicidal people are and dying thoughts don't come on other times till i see the solution being so near to everything. 

A huge last leap splash and nothing is left. Its weird but beautiful.
