Can't really see the point anymore.I'm a 25-year-old male, professionally diagnosed with depression. I was a pretty well-adjusted kid from a good family, but as I approached adolescence, I saw less and less reason to keep going. I was shy and got bullied a lot, but I still had my fair share of close friends. Currently I'm living with my three best friends in an apartment together, working a factory job (which I like well enough), and am currently single.

It's not even that I want to kill myself, but rather that I don't fear dying at this point because I don't see any point in continuing to live. I don't have any real talents with which to pursue a career, and as such, I feel like I've seen the best my life has to offer. I'm never going to be in a position where I'm making enough money to improve things, so if the rest of my life is just going to be a copy-paste of what it is now, I'd say I'm ready to go.

Call me a nihilist or what have you, but everything dies eventually, so what's the harm in ending my life now if it's all just going to be downhill from here?
