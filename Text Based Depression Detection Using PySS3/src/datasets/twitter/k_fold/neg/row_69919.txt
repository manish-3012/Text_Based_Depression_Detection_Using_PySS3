Just almost starting to think Iâ€™m not meant for lifeI just feel so weak and useless and Iâ€™ve been wanting to commit suicide for over a year now. Everyone else around me is so strong and not pathetic like me, they donâ€™t breakdown like me, they donâ€™t cry like me, they arenâ€™t selfish like me, and Iâ€™m so tired of just being alive. Iâ€™m just starting to think maybe life isnâ€™t meant for everybody,maybe everyone doesnâ€™t have a happy ending in life. Maybe things wonâ€™t ever get better for me, and Iâ€™ll just live like this pathetic fuck forever. Will things ever get better? Am I going to live the next 17 years of my life like this? Hating every inch of my body? Using stupid addictions to ease the pain? Is this just all in my head, and Iâ€™m just going insane? I think Iâ€™m going to die soon, I just donâ€™t know when. Iâ€™m not supposed to be alive. I hate being alive.
