Need a distraction - any suggestions would be helpfulI have been struggling a lot of over the past 24 hours and need a distraction from the suicidal thoughts before they become overwhelming. Anyone have any suggestions? I keep taking pills and drinking but it's always worse when those things wear off... Does anyone have any self care things they do that have helped? It's not that bad for me yet but I can feel it getting worse again. Any browser games or comics? Cheesy exercise videos? YouTube channels? Podcasts?
