At a loss here...My belief is that everything is pure consciousness manifesting itself as something rather than nothing. I think consciousness precedes science, in fact it creates it.  I think consciousness is all there is.  So when my therapist asks me if I'm suicidal and I tell him no, I'm not lying.  Don't get me wrong, I want to die.  But I don't think suicide is the end all, be all.  Suicide isn't a tragedy, not compared to this.  This is a cosmic stalemate.  When I die, consciousness remains.  We come back again and again and again under the guise of a myriad of different egos, masquerading as different people, perhaps to feel a little less lonely.  But here's the kicker.  We're all the same entity.  We're all the same consciousness.  And so, in the words of Alan Watts, we're God playing hide and seek with itself; an endless suffering loop.  Suicide won't end this, nothing will.  It is eternal.  There is nothing we can do.  Nothing...nothing.
