The only thing keeping me alive is the fear of deathHi.
 
I have been depressed for the last 4 years, but never thought it would go this far. 

I feel like nothing is going my way. 
I am fat. I am ugly. I am a virgin. I am loosing my hair at age 21, and that is ruining my confidence. I have lost many relatives lately. My father (when I was 3), grandmother, aunt and uncle all left us not long ago.

I have social anxiety, and small tasks as shopping groceries is scary. 

I'm afraid of the future. I'm afraid of loosing more people I love. Especially my mother. I cant stand knowing that she will die one day and that I have to live without her.

I have tried many different psychologists, but it just doesnt work...


I'm thinking about suicide every day, and lately I have been thinking about different methods and where to do it. And it scares me that I have gotten this far. The only thing that is keeping me alive is the fear of death.

I don't really believe in any god - but if there was one - why would he treat anyone like this?


Sorry about my english, its not my native language.
