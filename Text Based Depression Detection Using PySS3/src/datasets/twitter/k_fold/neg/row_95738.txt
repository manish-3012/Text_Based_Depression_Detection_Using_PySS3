I'm not ready to be an adult yetHigh school in my life is coming to a final close. With only two weeks left, the stress seems insurmountable. It's a pain to get anything done. I've struggled with depression since 4th grade. I barely sleep at all anymore. And what the hell is it all for? So i can go to college and do the same thing? So I can get a job I never wanted and work day in day out? I really think it would be better to end it all here. Frankly, It'd be better then doing it twenty years down the road when monotony and failure catch up.
