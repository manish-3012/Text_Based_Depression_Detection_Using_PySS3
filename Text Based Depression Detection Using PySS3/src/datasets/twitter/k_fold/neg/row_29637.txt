I got out of the hospital almost two weeks ago and I still want to kill myself.After dealing with this for so long, I finally got the courage to try and kill myself, but obviously it failed, and landed me in the hospital for about a week. I'm starting to think I subconsciously lied to the nurses and the doctors there, because I obviously don't feel as "good" as I did then. 
I'm a junior in high school and the first was  eek I've been back has been really good. The guy that I liked asked me out, I was on top of all my classes, etc. The next week, he told me he didn't want to see me, I went back to fucking up all my classes and started smoking a shit ton of weed just to get me to sleep. 
I'm trying to convince my parents and counsellors to let me apply for my GED, because I know school is part of the reason why I want to end it. I so badly just want my planned date to come, but it's so far away. I just wanted to see if things would get better, but they didn't.
