Iâ€™m physically exhausted.17F. Throughout my entire life Iâ€™ve just felt like my birth was unnecessary. I constantly get reminded that my mom planned on aborting me and I hate it. High school is the definition of hell and Iâ€™m so, so tired of doing it. I plan on killing myself very soon. I need it to stop. I need everything to stop. I have no friends, and nobody who cares. Thereâ€™s nobody to talk to. My mind wonâ€™t stop racing.
