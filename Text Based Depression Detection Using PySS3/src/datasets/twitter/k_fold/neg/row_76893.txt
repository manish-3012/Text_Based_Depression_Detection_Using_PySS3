Do you need to be committed to get actual help?3rd subreddit, maybe y'all can give me an answer

I've tried for months to get some help with my issues. Atm I'm so disabled I can't even work and I'm on leave.

I've played the whole doctor game, even went to the ER when I had some chest pain. Nobody seems to get it that I need some help. Of course I know that if I tell them how I actually feel, I'll end up in a hospital for 3 days wasting my fucking life with people who barely know me. And by that point I'll be so traumatized by just being there, obviously I'll tell them whatever they want to hear to get out.

How are you supposed to get some help in this goddamn country? I have been trying for *months.*

It seems like it's some big joke unless you tell people you want to off yourself. You know what makes people want to off themselves? Abducting them for telling you how they feel and getting them fired for their "safety". You know what makes people wanna off themselves? Trying for months, years, and getting nowhere even though you want help and try your best to find it.

Like I literally do not know what to do. We're down to 2 options. 

Fix it or start making real plans
