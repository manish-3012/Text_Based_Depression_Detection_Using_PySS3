What does stop you from killing yourself?I couldn't kill myself yet because I'm afraid of both, death and surviving the suicide attempt.

We don't know what happens after we're dead and our bodys do decompose (yeah, it's nature but still disgusting) if buried in a casket/coffin. Plus everything is gone, even the good memories. 

If I'll survive my suicide attempt, I will loose my job, won't find a new good job, people might treat me differently (in a bad way) and staying in hospital for months sounds horrible for me.
