Tonight is the nightI canâ€™t live every day with the regret of what I did to my partner.

Itâ€™s been months since she left me after over 10 years of a loving and wonderful life together and itâ€™s all my fault. Alcohol, depression, and OCD all being unchecked for years caught up to me.

Iâ€™m going to down a fist full of Sleep Aids with some Vodka and drop myself into the lake with a backpack full of rocks. Hopefully I wait long enough to have the meds kick in so I can at least be hallucinating while I drown.
