A matter of perception and choice.This is something I have been living with for 12 years and I need perspective. 

When I was 17, I felt it for the first time... This feeling that nothing really matters in the end. And so I did my homework and found out how many of which pills I needed to fix it.

I woke up later in the hospital, my parents were bawling their eyes out and I felt like an ass. I did it wrong and felt twice as wrong for putting my family and friends through it.

Now, I am 29, own a nice bungalow, earn top dollar and still, it feels like I just stumbled through life because thats what people do. 

Is it really wrong to think I am done with it all? I feel absolutely terrible for those I would leave behind (99% of why I am here now) but there is nothing for me, every day is awful, nothing in the future is appealing, exciting or even remotely interesting.

My conscience wants me to ask for a second opinion.
