Is it something else?Contemplated suicide occasionally for the the past 5 years or so.  Im 20 now.  Whenever I'm in a "good" stage I will think of how ridiculous it is every time i do this.  However, every time I get in a "bad" stage it's unbearable.  I sometimes think I may have a psychological disorder or something but Im the kind of person to never see a therapist of even tell ANYONE about this.  I think I also may have a slight obsession problem/ currently it seems to be alcohol, it's been anything from drugs or substances to even being obsessed with feelings if that makes sense.  Anyways I'm NOT going to kill myself tonight and even writing this is kinda helping.  Not sure if even need advice at all but just FUCK.  I feel if people find this out they would be entirely surprised as I completely hide and it feel like people see me as super easy going.
