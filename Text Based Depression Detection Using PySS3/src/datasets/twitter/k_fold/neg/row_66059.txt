Struggling with thoughts and day dreamsI've felt little to nothing for a handfull of years now after having multiple close people commit suicide and witnessing one i stopped self harming a bit over a year ago but I'm having incredibly strong urges and worse every day i wake up makes me feel worse about myself that i have to continue and that i didnt die in my sleep ive been having graphic daydreams of my own death and ive been feeling incredibly isolated even when im around people i think they understand im not well but dont know how to bring it up or help but im not sure i dont want to die but every day is complete torture im not sure what to do
