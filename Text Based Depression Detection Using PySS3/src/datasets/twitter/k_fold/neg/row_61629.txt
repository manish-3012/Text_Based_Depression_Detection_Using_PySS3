How bad is it if you think about killing yourself ?So in the past few years I always had this tought of killing myself but not in a serious way. It was more humorous like when I dropped something  I would say "why don't I just fucking kill myself already" or something like that. I never made any specific plan on how I would kill myself, but the tought of it always was in the back of my mind.Well, I had toughts like these for the past few years almost every day. Is this bad and should I seek professional help or do normal people joke about this in their mind ?
