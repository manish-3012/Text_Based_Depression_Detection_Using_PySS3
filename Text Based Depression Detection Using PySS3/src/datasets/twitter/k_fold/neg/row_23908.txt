AngryIâ€™m so fed up with being alive and having to be apart of everyday society.
Under pressure, going day to day working so I can come home and suffer with my mental health issues.
I just want to cry, scream and cut my wrists so deep that the blood just gushes out of my arms.
I just want to sit there and stare at myself while I bleed.
