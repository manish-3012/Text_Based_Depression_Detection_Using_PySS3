Nothing matters anymoreI could do it right now and no one would notice.
No one would call an ambulance. 
Iâ€™d lay here dying, all alone.
I wouldâ€™ve already done it if I wasnâ€™t such a fucking pussy.
Why keep going? Thereâ€™s only pain and sadness for me.
Even though my life would seem pretty good to most.
Iâ€˜m such a piece of shit for even trying to let anyone know. Most have it way worse and hereâ€™s me thinking about ending my own life..
I donâ€™t even know.
Why am I even writing this?
It doesnâ€™t matter. 
No ones gonna care.
Nothing matters.
