I don't knowHello,
First time poster here.

We are all just fucking robots. Day in, day out. There is literally no point to any of this. 
I don't know how to help myself, and that's so scary to admit because I've always been able to. Up until recently, at least. 

I don't think my husband knows how deep this wave is. I'm terrified that I'm turning into my mother. I don't like who I am and yet, I can't change. 

Is there a way to make the childhood-engrained self destructive mind that occupies my skull turn into one that doesn't make me want to die every second of every single day.
