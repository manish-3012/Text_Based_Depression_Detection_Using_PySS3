I feel like I'm in a play and the only one without the scriptI never get social cues anymore, I don't read people's emotions from their faces anymore, and I've started to isolate myself from everybody tbh. I don't know why this happened to me. I used to be different and social and had many friends but I guess I must have caught something that makes me a complete socially awkward person now. The anxiety that I get as well makes life so fucking hard to live through and I have moments where I just want to turn off because my mind is increasingly reaching it's limit. I feel fucking retarded. Ive tried to get help many times, after so many occasions that were obvious. But each time I've been suppressed and I'm going to make sure that it won't be anymore. I might read this in a couple of weeks and think to myself "damn why would I fucking consider that.â€ But it all makes so much sense now and that's why I'm so conflicted on what to do.
