Friend suicidal. Don't know what to do.My friend who is bipolar is manic. He texted our friend that he "is going to kill him self". He disappeared and we found his laptop with history searching on how to kill your self with bleach. We found him fetal in the basement. Physically fine but still mentally gone. He would only say "get out". He then went into his room and has been in there since. We're making sure he doesn't leave.

Fairly certain he has no bleach in there.

I don't know what to do. Wait it out? Get authorities involved? He's been manic many times but I've never know him to be suicidal.
