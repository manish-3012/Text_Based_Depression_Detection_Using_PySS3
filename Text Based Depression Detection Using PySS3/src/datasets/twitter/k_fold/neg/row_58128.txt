I can't escapeI hate everything that  is going on, This all started when I thought moving in to a new place with new people would be better, I wish I never moved out to the city, I hate my job and I hate the people I live with, and how shitty people can be. Recently someone toxic have been living in the same house as me and I hate it...that person is in a relationship with one of my close friends, and it sucks to know that I can never be the same with them ever again because of how much negativity they talk about and I know it's about me...I hate it so much...this toxic person has called me selfish and horrible names...I want to move out so bad and go back home...but I can't leave until the contract ends for the house which is another year...or find a replacement because I share a room with an amazing person and I have no idea what to do with my life....I can't leave knowing I'm leaving them behind with that toxicity.....now that time has passed...I can never be myself anymore...anything I say pushes people away....and now all my roommates are more free to be with that toxic person...I have never cried more in my life  and felt so useless....I have never had someone to talk to about this.....so I started to recently cut myself hoping to leave this place.....that close friend said they would rather be together with that toxicity then to be friends....I have never felt more hurt.....it hurts so bad to know that I would never be that important or even just an impact on anyone's life....to be less of someone.....to be look down on....I haven't ate anything at home.....and I don't plan to....I want to leave so bad.....I hat this world....I want to just rest and end it all..........you can say, "life will get better...don't give up!" And so on....but I have been saying that since high school....nothing has changed and nothing will ever change..... I'm so tired......I thought maybe a hobby would help but nothing....I'm so tired....
