typical psychosishey reddit,
i heard taping a million times on a keyboard can make you lose about 0,01pound, so we're going for a weightloss.

my name's wyvh, obviously not my real name. i'm a 19 french winy person that apparently sees everything on the dark side.. or just seeing the things as they are.

i don't really need.. 'help'. you need help when you want to get out of this situation and have a greater life and move on. what i need to do here is to pass on a message before i pass away myself. there are two mysteries in life; humanity and.. humanity's bullshit. the difference ? humanity's mystery is about how such a nice species of love and mutual aidness became a society-system focused on ego and properties. i don't think i'm teaching anything new here.

saying my name and my age wasn't really an introduction, so.. well, as another broken man wandering on the internet seeking for some attention (not everyone is like this, i must admit), i guess i can tell more about myself without risking anything. i'll avoid the long-ass story of thousands words and do a quick list of it;

-i've been schizophrenic and bipolar for more than 8 years now, 5 years of depression if not more
-raped 30 times in the changing room of my middle school, by the same boys
-abused and raped by one of my brothers during my childhood
-abusive and violent father that now drinks quite a lot
-depressive mother that cries every evening in the kitchen, and trust me i'm doing my best to help her
-friendless, lost my only life best friend in middle school, he hang himself thanks to his wonderful shitty family

here's the hing. i wanted to die since the first time i've been raped in MS. and even more when i learned about my bf's death. i was still thinking, "move on, it's okay"; fuck this. but i don't have a life, seriously. life is something you enjoy and feel; i'd say it's more like hell; endless pain. i keep hearing voices, seeing things that drive me crazy every time. medicine ? doesn't work, i keep taking them and make my parents believe it works (after all we've tried), but eh, i love pretending to be fine, i'm good at acting apparently.

i'm tired. tired of seeing all these kids whining because they've got an untold exam tomorrow, tired of being judged in my back in class by some random kids because i'm "too white", "he never speaks", "vampire", "gayass", "he has no friend lol"; well, fuck you all. if those kids at least understood what the others went through, maybe they'd judge less and focus more on helping and loving, but that's how our generation is, isn't it ?
i'm starting to see that i'm reaching the million words ! no, seriously, sorry for being so long, but this might be the last time i'm writing something about my life.

i've told all this to a "friend" but all he's doing is 'Writing with a cap at the beginning, a beautiful dot at the end' with pointless tips, such as "go check a therapist" or "life isn't simple", "stop that sarcasm" in a mean way; well, you get the kind of "friend". that friend that thinks he's leader of everything, with his blonde head and beautiful face. i don't hate him, i just don't understand how someone can be blinded by such a naive perception of life and society.

all my life i've been helping the others, reassuring them, listening to the girlies complain about their "hard homework and life" with a "sent from my iphone X imsorichmarryme" at the end of each text. i hate you all, but i love you so much for having such a pretty face and a voice that could make me believe that i'm actually being appreciated by someone and that my active agoraphobia and foot travellings to the high school with extremely high anxiety and stress are worth it. i can't go outside if there are more than 3 people without feeling anxious, without hearing voices that tell me how beautiful i am -sarcasm, got it ?- and talking and talkAGAJN just talking, talking. and when i can hear the people around, all i hear is "ur my bae" or "omg i wake up at 8am tomorrow helpme i got 3 hours of class i can't take it anymore" well darling, maybe you have issues aswell and i can't judge you with just a few words and a look on your pretty face, but you at least have a chance to be able to go to school because i can't. i stopt going to high school because i couldn't handle it, not even a hour. now i'm writing on this average computer while trying to mod GTA V that my mom kindly offered and seeing that they can't fucking make a mod without bugs on it. sorry lol.

anyway. feels like a story you'd tell to yourself in your head, and i'm glad I could put words on it. now, a thought's going through my mind; how to make a death appear as an accident to make sure my mom's the least depressed about my death ?

tldr; 19 years old homosexual bipolar schizophrenic seeking attention trying to convince himself death is the only solution while he can't think about any other way out **and doesn't want to**
