I brought up being suicidal to my momIm 22 and still live with my mom, have been depressed for at least 10 years now and attempted it 3 times, after the last failed attempt i finally said something about it to my mom, she told me that i could drive head on into a bus or drive off a cliff those would work and that "whats the point if your not happy" what do i do, i can't afford to live on my own and she has turned everyone against me telling them all I'm a psychopath same to my friends. Im not and i need out, she goes to my job and tells them every bad thing i have every done and adds onto it. Today i heard her talking about how happy she was that she finally made me miserable. Big brother has been helping telling everyone at my job that im schizophrenic and bipolar so no one will talk to me. I am adhd and have depression those are the only ones i have ever been diagnosed with. Idk what to do i can't afford to live on my own and already have a hard time just getting out of bed to taking care of myself some days or go to work.
