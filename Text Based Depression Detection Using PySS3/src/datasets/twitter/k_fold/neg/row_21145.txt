So many cheating stories. I wanna fucking snap.I've never been in a relationship but the countless cheating stories I've encountered, even when I'm not purposely searching for them, are just too much for me to handle. There have been people who've found their dream girl only for her to cheat on them. I hate humanity sometimes. I want to find the love of my life and experience the joys of love but right now I think I wanna end myself to spare myself from the high possibility of being cheated on. I definitely won't handle the pain.
