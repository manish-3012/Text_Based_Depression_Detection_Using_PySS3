i want to gowhats keeping me? i dont know. maybe im scared? maybe i have some hope for the future? maybe its that one last person who cares about me. i feel like a coward. i just want to do it already. the voice in my head repeats "you need to kill yourself. you need to kill yourself." i need this to be over. im not helping anyone out. im not doing anything useful. so why am i obligated to stay? its unmanagable. i have no one to confide in. no one who is able to listen. people told me to get therapy. so i got therapy. it didnt help. people tell me "youre young, you have your whole life ahead of you." i do. but i dont care to live it. i know it will probably get better, im not stupid, but im done waiting. i dont care enough to wait. my parents yelling at me for my grades dropping and acting like i want to fail. i dont. ive always been a good student, but recently its been hard to find motivation. i try to explain it to them but they just accuse me of being lazy or a failure. i beg them to let me go on medication but they refuse. im searching for something that will help but nothing ever does. im so alone. i need to go.
