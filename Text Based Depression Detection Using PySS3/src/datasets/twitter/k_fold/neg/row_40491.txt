Does anyone else find it difficult to comprehend how everyone else functions?Everyone else just goes through life. They get up, go to work, go to school, hang out with friends. Meanwhile even the simplest tasks seem insurmountable to me right now. How is everyone doing it? People have goals and plans for the far future. Itâ€™s hard for me to comprehend. Right now it just feels like Iâ€™m working on surviving and waking up every morning.
