I wrote my notes. I know how. And it's tomorrowI've taken care of my will. All debts are in my name and will not go to my husband. I wrote a friend to check on my husband.

My friend will find me and he's good emotionally so he should eventually process it. I just can't let my husband find me.

I wrote my notes. I have a solid plan. Plenty enough pills of various categories. One that will put me to sleep and the rest will just slow my breathing so I'll fall asleep.

The main issue is the funeral costs. I just want cremated so that should help lessen it.

It's weird. I've never been so calm or prepared before. I guess it just means this is it.

I wish I were someone else though. Happier. Not as messed up. But I'm me and I'm tired.


I guess I just wanted some last words.
