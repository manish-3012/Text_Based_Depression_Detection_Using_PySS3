I want to go but I feel guilty for leaving my baby boyThe idea of just sleeping for the last time is so comforting to me. I had a not bad day where I biked for 40 km. Took my boy for a nice park then ice cream. I felt energized and calm... it took one single argument with my boyfriend to light a fire in me and the next thing I know is Iâ€™m grabbing the sharpest kitchen knife! Then I throw it on the floor. Iâ€™m tired of living... im really really tired.
