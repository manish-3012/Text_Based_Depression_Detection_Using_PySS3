Stupid RelapseJust last week I was making fun of myself and joking about my previous suicide attempts and self harm (almost 5 years). Here I am, living through the worst week of my life where my only thoughts are ways I could kill my self. I have no friends, my boyfriend is gone and I live hours from my family. I broke my foot yesterday and am stuck on bed rest for two weeks, iâ€™m going to fail all my college courses. Iâ€™d like to think venting on the internet will help but it wonâ€™t. Bon voyage.
