HiSorry if I don't make much sense in this post, English isn't my first language. But honestly I don't give a shit anymore. I'm just so tired of fighting. I recently just turned 16 but I feel like not going past that number. My mind, my spirit, everything inside of me is so worn down that I think I would just be happy if I died right here, right now. I used to be such a happy kid, I had so many friends, and made so many memories. I know things change and I know people drift apart, but why did everyone leave? Or was it me that left? All I'm asking for is one person who can truly understand how I feel, who's there for me when I fall on my knees beside my bed and cry out in pain, just anyone, someone. Everything is the same and I do the same things everyday, the same depressive thoughts just loop in my brain like a never-ending noise and I can't take it anymore. They say be yourself to be happy, but when I'm myself nobody wants me. Nobody likes who I am and I'm so tired of thinking that everything is gonna be alright but deep down I know it won't. I am just so exhausted, and the only thing on my mind is suicide.
