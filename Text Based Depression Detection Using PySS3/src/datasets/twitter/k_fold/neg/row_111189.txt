Why so much misinformation about suicide related stuff?I was researching methods and I thought "would I be able to get off multiple shots from a handgun to make my death even more certain?". Found this on "wikipedia"

"One particular case has been documented from [Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia). In February 1995, a man committed suicide on parkland in [Canberra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra). He took a [pump action shotgun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pump_action_shotgun) and shot himself in the chest. The load passed through the chest without hitting a [rib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rib), and went out the other side. He then walked fifteen meters, pulled out a pistol and shot himself in the head, once again surviving the shot. After reloading the shotgun, he leaned the shotgun against his [throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throat), and shot his throat and part of his [jaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaw). He then reloaded a final time, walked 200 meters to a hill, sat down on the slope, held the gun against his chest with his hands and operated the [trigger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigger_(firearms)) with his toes. This shot entered the [thoracic cavity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoracic_cavity) and demolished the heart, killing him.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide#cite_note-5)[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_gunshot_suicide#cite_note-6)"

Supposedly some guy did all this before he eventually died. It's total bullshit and just some loser making shit up on Wikipedia. Or that's a fucking murder that they said was a suicide. Just seeing that bullshit on Wikipedia and TONS of other things across the web that just seem like bs, how can you trust ANYTHING about how lethal something is?

It makes me afraid to use a gun because people say the killing chance of a gunshot would to the head is very high, yet people survive gunshot woulds all the time with grievous injuries. I do not want to be a fucking vegetable or shoot my eye sockets out. People get hit by fast moving trains, survive and lose limbs. The only sure way that I can see is to jump from an EXTREMELY high height onto solid ground. That will be my method I just hope it will be easy to get onto the roof and I hope I have the ability to jump when the time comes! I really don't think I'll be able to jump though...FUCK.
