Unsure if this belongs hereThe time has come for me to move on.  I am not writing this for sympathy or attention, more to leave some sort of note behind.  I am a 34-year-old from Birmingham, UK and I intend to leave this realm soon.  But in a manner where I intend for my body not to be found.  I know it may seem selfish but I have my own reasons for doing so which I won't go into.

Some of the people around me know I'm suicidal and a few of those know about my most recent attempt.  Before my first attempt, I was in the process of leaving individual notes and videos for those around me.  Unfortunately, I had a really bad day and attempted suicide before I was able to finish them all.  This time, however, I play to finish them all and have been up most the night making them.  Everyone important will get there own individual message and I will also leave a generic message on my person in the case that I am found.  Would not want to waste anyone's time in thinking suspicious behaviour was involved.

I'd also like to leave a message for the Redditor I've been speaking to the past few months who understands some of what I've been going through.  Sorry, I couldn't tell you this in private, but I know you'd try your best to convince me not to.  You delayed my first attempt with your encouragement and I always felt like I could confide in you.  Probably because of the anonymity of Reddit, but also maybe because we were quite similar.  Says a lot about my life aye, when the only real person who has been there for me is someone on the other end of a forum.  Anyway, thank you.  You gave me great advice, some that didn't work out so well but you gave me the encouragement to try.

To the rest of Reddit, thank you for being there when I needed you to make me smile, laugh, and awww at all the wonderful posts.
