I think Iâ€™m going to kill myself tonightActually writing it out feels odd. But for the last few months I feel like Iâ€™ve been drowning, I just feel overwhelmed constantly. Iâ€™m only 18 and have a job with unlimited earning potential, most kids would kill for this job but I just canâ€™t put in the effort to try. Iâ€™ve got bills no real way to pay them, Iâ€™ve felt this way for probably 4 years. Itâ€™s just been made worse seeing all of my coworkers making tons of money and living successful lives while Iâ€™m struggling to pay for gas to get here. I feel like Iâ€™m not built for this world. This is my only way out.

Sorry if this seems all over the place, Iâ€™m just sort of in a daze right now. Thanks for reading
