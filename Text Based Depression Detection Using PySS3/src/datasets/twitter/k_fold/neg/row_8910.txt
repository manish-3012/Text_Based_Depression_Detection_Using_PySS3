How to tell if it's time to do it?You know, when your life legitimately is falling apart and there's absolutely no reason for you to get out of bed in the morning? You're trying and fighting but it keeps backfiring. You give yourself some time, you reach a point where you feel somewhat stable... Then something bad happens once again to remind you that you're pretty much doomed to suffer. How would one be able to tell when it's time to just end the suffering altogether? I'm trying to get better but it isn't working. I want to die and those are my first words every time I wake up in the morning.
