I canâ€™t stop thinking about killing myselfIâ€™m a 17 year old male in my senior year. I donâ€™t really have a bad life in comparison to the others I read about here and thatâ€™s the most upsetting thing to me. My parents are nice and we are fine financially. I have friends but I feel like they are distancing themselves from me as I know they plan stuff without me. Overall itâ€™s not a horrible life. Despite this I just am constantly thinking that i should kill myself life would be better for everyone around me as sometimes i feel like a burden to hang around. But I feel like when I think this I come across and feel like a brat only looking for attention, even though I canâ€™t shake the thoughts. I keep trying to get over it but I canâ€™t. Sorry for ranting but this has been on my mind for years and has only been escalating. I might do something soon but at the same time Iâ€™m scared. I just needed to get this off my chest
