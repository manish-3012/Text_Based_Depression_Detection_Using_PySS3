Happy new year to all of youI love this community, we are all a bunch of misfits who are not afraid to talk about our problems, we are not afraid of judgement anymore and by anyone, there are also the other half of this community, the people that will go out of their way to help others, the unsung heroes of the world i might say.

Honestly this community feels like my second home

HAVE A JOLLY GOOD NEW YEAR EVERYONE

and let's all fight to make it a good one :)  â¤  â¤  â¤  â¤
