I'm so fucking stupid, it was futile from the beginning.There was no hope between us, I know everything about her and she knows everything about me.. Except the jealousy I feel for her, my best friend, the one I feel I would kill myself for. 

I'm so stupid to be jealous. I knew nothing more than a friendship would come out of this and I still kept holding on for some reason. 

Every time she messages me about someone other than myself all I want to do is die and I can't do that, not to my family, not to her, or my friends. So I'll resort to getting so inebriated I can't feel pain and cutting myself until the pain I my heart goes away.

Just let me die already.
