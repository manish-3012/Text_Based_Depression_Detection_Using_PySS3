Seven years.We were together for seven years.

Through all the crying, the lying, the break-ups, the hook-ups and the shakeups, we stayed together for seven years. We cheated on each other and still stayed. We had a child that she aborted. We still...STILL stayed together for seven years.

Now she's with someone else. She's proud to be fucking someone else. Everything that I used to do with her, is now some other guy's job. And yet she insisted that they aren't together. She insisted that she is a lesbian. She insisted that she only wanted to break it off after our lease was up this month. She lied. She hurt me. So now, I'll hurt myself. 

I'll always be alone. She told me that, and she was right. Now, her blood is on my hands. Her blood is on my wrists. At the risk of becoming too explicit in explaining my method, I'll just say that it will require a walk "down the street".

I had little to look forward to, but her.

Now I have even less.

I cannot live without her.

I have a knife and I will give myself two hours. I doubt it will change how I feel. I have enough booze to kill a person. Maybe I won't even need to make the first cut.
