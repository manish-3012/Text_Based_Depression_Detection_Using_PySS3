Giving upI slept all day. I went to bed around 12am on the 19th and didnâ€™t wake up until about the same time on the 20th. 

Now Iâ€™m sitting on the couch waiting for all of the pills I just took to kick in. I donâ€™t want to be awake anymore. If I had the means to do it Iâ€™d kill myself right now. Who cares about the housework. I donâ€™t even feel conflicted about leaving my cats or my family. 

The stress and mental illness has also made me sick again. I get hungry but I canâ€™t eat, Iâ€™m dizzy and nauseous. I have no energy. 

I think Iâ€™m just finally done.
