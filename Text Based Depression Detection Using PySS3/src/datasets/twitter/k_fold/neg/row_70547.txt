Every time I argue with my husband, I want to kill myselfMy husband and I argue about the stupidest shit almost every day. Today it was about the laundry. I have a massive exam in two days that I am in no way ready for, that I need to cram for. He told me that he would take care of our piles of laundry today which would have been so helpful. Right as I was about to study, he tried to put it all back on me by saying I was forcing him to do all of the household chores by himself. It seems so stupid and petty, but every time we argue about crap like that it makes me feel extremely unloved, unwanted, and not cared about. It makes me feel like he would probably be happier if I wasnâ€™t here anymore. He never apologizes, either. Heâ€™ll come and say â€œI love youâ€ a million times until I end up saying it back, but never â€œIâ€™m sorryâ€. So now Iâ€™m stuck doing mountains of laundry and probably wonâ€™t have enough brain power to focus on this stupid exam. Thanks for letting me rant all. Kind of just want to go die now.
