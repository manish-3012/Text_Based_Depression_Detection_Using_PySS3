Alright folks, can anyone actually give me a reason why my life has any real value?Didn't get the only job I was even interviewed for.

Have no significant other.

Have no fulfilling job. I ring groceries through, which literally anybody should be able to figure out how to do themselves.

Have no prospects for changing either of those things.

Can't fucking sleep a regular schedule.

Nothing is changing, and nothing is going to change. It isn't going to be any fucking different tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after that until I'm dead.

Where the fuck is the value in my life? And what the fuck is the point if there isn't any?

And don't just say something vague like "every life has inherent value" like that is some profound axiom. That is bullshit.

Where is the value in life?

Fuck it, I'm going to sleep. Maybe someone here will have an answer for me by the time I wake up...

EDIT; Alright, fine. You haven't convinced me, but I won't do anything stupid. Which is good, because I'm working with cyanide next week at school.
