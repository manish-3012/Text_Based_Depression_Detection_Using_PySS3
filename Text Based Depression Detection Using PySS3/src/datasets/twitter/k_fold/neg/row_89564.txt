Iâ€™m committing suicide really soon, earlier than I had plannedLong story short, going to repeat it once more so to those who are reading this, can really incapsulate this. I am 22Male, I have gone through 17 ECT Procedures (Shock Therapy) and 33 TMS sessions (itâ€™s like a jackhammer/woodpecker to the temple) I have since given up on both of my therapists, emotionally and mentally exhausted as fuck. People who say they care/theyâ€™ll be here for me, I can tell they are just straight up tired of hearing from me because Iâ€™m so mentally exhausting. Iâ€™ve got no passion, no sense of direction, I give up fast and get overwhelmed easily. The trial and error of prescription psychiatric medication along with the process of taking meds of 2-3weeks for it to be at a therapeutic level, just the thought of up makes me even more hopeless than I already am. Iâ€™m beyond depression, so beyond that Iâ€™m not committing suicide because of that, Iâ€™m committing suicide because I no longer wish to live anymore. My world is cold, grim, bleak, empty. There is no more of that warmth feeling of home. Iâ€™m a shell of what I used to be. Of that Shock Therapy procedures and TMS sessions, my conscious has depleted, and the conscious Iâ€™m left with is torturing me every single fucking day. Iâ€™m being reminded of every single bad thing that had happened to me, every single thing people had said to&amp;about me. The world would honestly be very much so a hell of a lot great,beater, and brighter WITHOUT ME! Committing suicide will be single handily the greatest decision and accomplishment I have ever done.
