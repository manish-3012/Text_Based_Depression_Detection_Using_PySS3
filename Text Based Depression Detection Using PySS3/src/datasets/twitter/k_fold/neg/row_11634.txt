Haunted by the ghost of you;How can a person not even be in your life anymore. But still effect you just as much as they were when they were in it? Why does it seem impossible to let you go... when in reality you probably already let me go.. I would normally sleep to block out the thoughts but I fucking end up dreaming about you waking up feeling worse then before. . I just miss you.
