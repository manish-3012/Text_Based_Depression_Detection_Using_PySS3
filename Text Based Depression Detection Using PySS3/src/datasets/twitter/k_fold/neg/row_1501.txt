please helpreddit, i'm not doing so good. i know my problems are typical but this time i'm having trouble dealing with them. i'm 27. my girlfriend of over a year is leaving me. a week ago she was begging for me to take her back. i didn't. i'm alienated from my family. i don't have any friends anymore. and i've quit my job to start a new one that is turning me inside out with anxiety. i don't have a lot and i feel now like i'm losing it all. today is very hard as exactly two year ago my best friend and roommate killed himself. earlier i tied a belt around the doorknob same as he did and sat down until i almost blacked out. the only real concern i have is that if i die there will be a funeral and i  don't want to inconvenience anyone but i don't want to start over again. i'm too old. i don't want to go on dates. i don't want to move home because i can't pay my bills anymore. i'm just counting the reasons to keep going through this shit on one hand and i'm runnning out. i just can't find any value in me anymore. i really need some kind of therapy but i don't have any health insurance. i shell out a bunch of money to pay for antidepressants every month to keep from getting like this but there's only so much they can do. just someone to listen who i don't feel bad about dumping all my problems onto. i'm living completely inside my head and i can't do it anymore. i just can't.
