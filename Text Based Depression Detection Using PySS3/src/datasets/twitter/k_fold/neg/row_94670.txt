I feel like I'm on the verge of a mental breakdownI am unravelling. There is no respite from all the pain I feel. It's like I am stuck in quicksand and I'm sinking. The news is depressing me, and I am slowly coming to terms with the reality of the society I am a part of. 

I truly wish I never existed. I hate it here, I hate being alive.
