I want nothing more than to die now. I walked out of my job. Dealt with pieces of shit last year. I have absolutely no one to care about me. I feel no feelings of love towards other people. There's nothing to look forward to. I will kill myself soon - I can't wait. One of my coworkers in a delivery car called out my name as I was crying when running home. I just can't deal with anything. I'm not normal. I need surgery. I spent four years in isolation and was ostracized my entire life. I plan to go in two weeks or less.
