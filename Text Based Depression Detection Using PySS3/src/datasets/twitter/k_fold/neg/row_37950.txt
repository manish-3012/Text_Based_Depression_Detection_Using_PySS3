I went to the hospital last week because I had thoughts should I go again?Last Friday I went because I was having thoughts of suicide. It hasn't reached planning state yet.

I was let out and asked to contact mental health services and schedule an appointment.

The appointment is weeks away too long too wait imo I'd like to return there and hopefully be appointed to an live in center until I'm medicated.

The only thing stopping me from seeking that help is that I was just there like Friday night or something like that...
