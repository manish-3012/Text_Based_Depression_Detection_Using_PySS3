My friend is killing themselves rt now. Please helpMy friend is on 20 bars of Xanax and 2g of coke. She has a super high tolerance but wants to die. She was clean for a year but a breakup and now this... What can I do? I don't think it will kill her but if she gets more it will eventually. I'm in Canada so if anyone know what I can do please let me know asap. Idk how long she has. Can I get her put in a drunk tank or something?
