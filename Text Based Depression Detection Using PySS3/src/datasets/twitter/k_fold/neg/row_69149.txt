death is mercyif i was to describe my depression it would be like a never ending winter. the sun never shines, no hope. its cold &amp; dark everyday. i feel all alone in this place. i feel like theres no way out. its been like for so long i hate waking up. i hate each morning. i hate repeating every single day. they're all the same. the only thing i can see ending this is suicide. but i've promised my family and closest friends i wouldn't. i wish and hope that one day i'm killed, by anything. i don't wanna live. death is mercy.
