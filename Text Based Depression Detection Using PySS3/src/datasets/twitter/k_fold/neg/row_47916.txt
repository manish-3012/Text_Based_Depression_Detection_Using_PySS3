I don't want to live anymore.I'm just a nuisance to everyone. I'm failing college. Even if I somehow miraculously graduate it will be pointless because I've never been able to keep a job very long. I mess everything up and embarrass myself constantly. I'm annoying and have no real friends. I feel like I'm just going numb inside. I can't keep living like this. I don't even have anyone to try and live for because no one gives a shit about me
