Just a ventAfter three suicide attempts,  I have been uninspired for a fourth time.  I haven't really changed for the better.  I still care less in life.  Due to my anger,  it feels like its an emotion that can last forever.  I tried many things like music,  positive thinking,  religion,  prayer,  processing out loud.  The problem with changing is the fact that my mind is naturally disconnected and often irrational. Change takes much hard work,  but I just don't have the inner will to change.  I'm not into society.  I sit in my car alot at vacant plazas.  I work a full time job that is incredibly easy.  Still I go through mental extremes.  I can't be in a relationship due to immature and mentally unstable I am.  My last breakup was the only reason why I became suicidal in the first place.  Deep emotional pain scares me because I loose myself when the ship sinks.  I'm not much into family.  I use to love reading but lost the passion.  I live with a person but I hardly talk to them.  They are a nice person but I don't find the need to be social anymore.  I am emotionally brittle and always have been.  Most of my thoughts don't help me with life.  I don't have natural mechanism that the average person does.  I think different.  I'm unconventional.  Bad things stick in my head.  I use to be wishfully optimistic as a kid.  I have a hard time adjusting to reality. I don't want to be alive anymore but I manage to stay alive.  The fear of dying is scary.  My heart was beating fast during all those suicide attempts.  It never works.  I came close my second time when I swallowed about sixty pills. Third time I took eight energy pills and my heart was beating for the whole night.  I tried dying.  I don't want to live but I have no choice right now. I hope I damaged my heart so I die early.  Goodnight and off to work.  I may research many suicides again like how I use to.  Can't help but wish I had a time machine so I could fix something's.
