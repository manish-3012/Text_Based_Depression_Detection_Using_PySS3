traped in my body and death looks like the only way outi hate my body. 100% of my thoughts are concerning me weight and appearance...i stress over how much i weigh and somehow end up gaining more. i actually have new strech marks. i want to die. i cant be in this body anymore. i research ways to kill myself but i still cant figure out which way is best. im trapped inside of what i hate. i cant understand how i let myself go so much. this depression is lasting months longer than the others and this time i have real reason to be insecure i gain 20 pounds!! I HAVE MORE STRETCH MARKS. DOES ANYONE KNOW HOW MUCH THIS SUCK???? SERIOIUSLY if i can just have one person tell me they understand or yeah that sucks or anything i dont know what im looking for but i have no where to turn to i am ashamed. i went to the hospital for an intake thing and theyre sending me into an alcohold drug abuse program when what i need is eating disorder therapy i am goign out of my fucking mind i cant leave the house or even go downstairs because im afraid of people seeing how fat i got i used to have a perfect body. my self worth is nothing i  wish i was dead
