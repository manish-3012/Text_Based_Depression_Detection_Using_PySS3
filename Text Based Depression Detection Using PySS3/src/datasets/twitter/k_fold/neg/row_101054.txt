Hopefully I end it in a week. Heres my noteIf you're reading this, it's too late. Who am I kidding? Nobody cares. Wether I tell people im suicidal, or I ask for therapy it gets brushed off. It's either "you're too young to be depressed" or "you don't need therapy". My life is nothing short of pathetic. No social life, No hobbies, No personality. 
Nothing. Whats the point in staying alive in a world that doesn't want you? I'm the person that's on a sports team but nobody likes, sure I'm on a team, but what is a team without support? I've given everything I have to try to want to live. I can't, I'm tired of putting on a mask to make those around me happy. Goodbye
