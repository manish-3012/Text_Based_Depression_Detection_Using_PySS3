Killing MyselfAfter a bunch of misdiagnosis, I think it's finally time to end it all. The only thing I've definitely been diagnosed with is depression and anxiety (and they won't give me meds because they worry I'll get dependant on them) but for a while there were others. First I had schizophrenia, then I didn't.  Then I had psychosis, then I didn't. Then I had bipolar, then I didn't. It's kinda left me fucked up and wondering what I have and what I don't. It's bs in my opinion and I'm sick of it. I wanna kill myself.

At this point I've racked up three attempts on my life - all by overdosing. The first time I (in a way) got too scared to take a full OD, and, while it was way over the recommended dose, it wasn't enough.

The second time I took more and it left me vomiting for days. Still not enough to kill me.

The third and most recent time I took a shit ton of tablets. No one really knows how I didn't die but I didn't. I was left vomiting blood so that was fun.

I think it's time to finally stop beating around the bush. To actually kill myself this time. I'm so worried about everything at the moment. I'm worried about hurting someone - I have in the past. I'm worried about how my family perceive me. They found out about my issues and they flipped, constantly asking my folks why I was so messed up, stopping me from seeing other family members and never really accepting me after that. Plus just so much more utter bullshit.

I'm sorry if this was long. This is more of a vent than anything else I guess. If you read it, thanks for taking the time to.
