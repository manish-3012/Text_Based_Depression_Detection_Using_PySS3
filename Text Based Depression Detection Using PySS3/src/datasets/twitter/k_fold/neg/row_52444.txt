Failed attempt 4 weeks ago killed my spirit.On April 7th I tried to take my life after a fight with an abusive ex. I spent 5 days in a psychiatric hospital in Denver, and was released to my father under the condition that I return with him to Florida. I found out that I was pregnant while in the hospital. (Yes, by the abusive ex) 

I've spent the last four weeks in bed, constantly nauseous and with zero energy. I have zero motivation to read, play video games I once loved even up until my attempt, go for walks, go to the beach... you know the drill. 

I feel more empty now than I did before my attempt and today is not going well. Luckily I don't have a set plan, and I don't have an easy way to attempt again. 

The people I call when I feel this way are either busy or not answering. I called my mom, my dad, my best friend. 

I'm scared and I'm alone and I don't want to be. 
Please help.
