Song for today: Wilco- Either WayMaybe the sun will shine today


The clouds will blow away


Maybe I won't feel so afraid


I will try to understand


Either way






Maybe you still love me


Maybe you don't


Either you will or you won't


Maybe you just need some time alone


I will try to understand


Everything has its plan


Either way


I am gonna stay


Right here for you







Maybe the sun will shine today


The clouds will roll away


Maybe I won't be so afraid


I will understand 


Everything has its plan


Either way
