I'm going to lose the love of my life, because I am a selfish, cowardly liar.Long story short, I made a terrible mistake about 9 months ago.  My girlfriend was moving away for a while and I didn't think we'd make it.  I went out with some friends and go incredibly drunk.  I went to a strip club and had a lap dance and the dancer offered me a blowjob for money.  Being in the state I was I accepted.  I freaked out for the next 3 weeks until I had an STD test the put me negative for everything.  Nevertheless, I had some nagging symptoms, itching, urinary burning etc. I shrugged it off as nothing, but the guilt of my infidelity lingered.  We had our one year anniversary and the only thing I could think of while we sat at dinner was how I didn't deserve to be celebrating with her. I've had multiple panic attacks recently, because I've learned that the test after three weeks probably wasn't accurate for some STDs, herpes, HIV, etc.  I got tested for HIV and was negative, but I'm waiting on herpes results.  I've scoured the internet and found out that one can have herpes without the traditional symptoms.  I got a blood test today and will know the results in 3-5 days.  If I have herpes, I'm fairly certain that I'm going to kill myself.  This girl deserves so much better than me.  I honestly can't believe I just shrugged off the risk to her.  I can't believe that I did this to the person I loved more than anything.  How did I end up the person that I am? How could I be so selfish?  How could I be such a coward?
