i duno what to do anymorei am 19 male, and i don't see the point in life at all most things people enjoy i don't and don't really care about anything life just seems boring. i am a virgin but i don't get really urges and have trouble talking to new people especially women i went to a all boy school and now a i work on a construction site 6days a week.

its easy for me to dislike people especially women. i always think about what happens after i leave and know i shouldn't for family and friends but im getting tired of it and end up crying myself to sleep a fair bit. i usually end up taking long walks at random times, listening to music and think. and the only really thing i think about is violent/depressing stuff, but i still try and think about what i want out of life or what would make it better.AMA
