Feeling lost at seaMy fiance of 2.5 years broke up with me a couple days ago. Tried to kill myself yesterday. Grabbed a kitchen knife, sharpened it, ran a bath and tried to make myself bleed out for 5-6 hours. Realised it wasn't going to work, I think the knife went too dull and I just wasnt bleeding enough at the end. Got out and stumbled to the phone, I was apparently centimetres off dying when I called 999. I now look like a badly repaired teddy bear and can't walk or use my arms properly.
The issue is she was always the one I could talk to about shit, she was always there when I got home for a kiss and a chat about our day. Emotions and memories are flying everywhere and even though I know I can be happy single I will be missing something. I'm not massively social so I see myself being a lonely boi for too long. Not only that but I have to deal with the next couple months whilst I try and get over it and become not so sad.
I'm also scared, I was depressed before meeting her and I don't want to go back there.
