Finally get to die.After all these months of tasting the peacefulness that comes during an attempt I can have that one last final time. I've got it set up. No one will miss me. No one will stop me, my body will even have to be buried by the city.

I was so alone my whole life and Friday I will die just as alone. The only downside is if I get mad enough to take off ahead of schedule. But that just comes down to preferences.

Good night everyone.
