I've messed it all upLet's start from the beginning. I met this girl in college, and we dated for two years. She had some issues, but I love her. The last year was long distance, and the entire time I was miserable. We broke up in April. I was destroyed. But I picked up the pieces of me, and tried to keep in touch with her, desperate to have her back. I finally met a girl, who makes me happy, who treats me so much better in September. It took me until almost December to commit. And when I did I was okay with leaving the old one behind. Then my ex came back and wanted to be back in my life. I told her I did want her, but I was happy already. I considered leaving my girlfriend. She came to visit me to talk about getting back together. We fucked. I tried to stop myself but didn't. That night I told her I didn't want to be with her and told my gf everything. She called me a two weeks ago. She's pregnant. I can't leave her by herself to raise my child and is determined to keep it, but I can't leave my gf either. So I think there's only one way out. I'm only 22. But I don't want this mess, I don't want any of it. I'm so much less than I thought I was
