Please Read and help me understand.The reason SO many people DO NOT go through with killing themselves is because of the unknown (where you go, what happens) itâ€™s the same with me. I want to DIE SO SO BAD I canâ€™t stand it. But Iâ€™m scared, not scared of initially killing myself but of what happens itâ€™s the unknown. Does anyone know how to surpass that threshold and not be afraid so I can just get it over with? MY LIFE IS AGONY.
