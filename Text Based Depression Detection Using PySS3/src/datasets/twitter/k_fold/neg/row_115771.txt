I can't fucking do this anymore. Long personal vent ahead, sorry. 

 My family cast me out a long time ago, before they even knew I was trans, or pansexual. My mom always told me that I was a mistake, and I know the story of how she tried to kill me when I was still inside her. Even with that, I still went to the hospital and fucking cried over her bed back in February. I sobbed while my brother and sister hugged me, because I thought my mom was fucking dying, even after all the horrible shit she did to me growing up. For a little context, she's diabetic, and her blood sugar was in the 700s when she was brought in.

 It seems like my girlfriend canâ€™t even stand to spend time with me anymore, always pushing me off of voice chat as soon as possible. Sure, there are times when sheâ€™s sweet, and affectionate, constantly cooing about how she loves me and giving me compliments. But that just makes it hurt worse when she goes back to being so cold to me. I donâ€™t even know what to say to her right now so Iâ€™ve kinda just not been talking to her today.  

My financial state is in the garbage. Sometimes, I just lay and cry over how I canâ€™t afford both food and bills. Yeah, I have my papa to lean on during those times, but I canâ€™t stand the fact that I have to do that at all. I just feel like Iâ€™m using him, and everyone around me.  

I feel like I just manipulate everyone into seeing someone thatâ€™s even worth loving or paying attention to. I donâ€™t feel worthy of anyoneâ€™s time, really. And I know people love me. I know. But that just makes me feel even guiltier for making them see me as worth their love. Iâ€™m a fucking lying sack of shit who deserves nothing except maybe a pair of cement shoes so that I can go drown and quit being such a fucking nuisance. Thatâ€™s all Iâ€™ll ever be to anyone in the end. Everyone I love leaves me, and i cant exactly say I blame them. I hold them back from everything, after all. They waste their time on me instead of someone else who could actually be good for them. 

Iâ€™m in so much fucking pain right now. Maybe tonight I'll have the courage to finally do it and put myself out of my pathetic misery after a few drinks. At least then people wouldn't have to deal with me anymore. I hope they just forget about me. My papa deserves a better son, my boyfriend and girlfriend deserve a better partner. Hell. I know a few people that will be happy to hear that I'm gone. So what's the point, anymore.
