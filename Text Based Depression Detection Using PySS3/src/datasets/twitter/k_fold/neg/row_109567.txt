I just keep putting it off.I keep waiting for the thoughts to go away. Over the last 10 years I've tried medication, therapy, everything to function like a normal person. Nothing helps in the long run. About a year ago it got to the point I couldn't function enough to work and got fired. The only reason I'm not homeless is because my boyfriend pays our rent and is too scared to break up with me. He's cheated on me multiple times and when girls ask why he doesn't just break up with me he says that he knows if he leaves I will kill myself (I've read the texts to other girls). He's not exactly wrong. I only try to live for the sake of others at this point. He stopped even trying to hide his cheating, so I know it's just a matter of time before he breaks up with me and I'm left with no one. I might as well go on and do it so at least he doesn't think it's just because of him. He's used me to get sympathy from girls before, I know he'd use my death to do the same. I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction. I'm so tired of trying and my reasons to live just keeps dwindling.
