I miss you, love.I miss you so much. I only want you. I just set up a date with a new guy and I feel fucking dead inside. I want to drink bleach. Then I'd wake up next to you like Mary wakes up next to Francis at the end of Reign. I don't want to live the rest of my life feeling this way. I want this feeling to end, it won't end as long as I'm alive. I love you. You have my whole heart.
