Cheers to the lost onesRaising a glass to you all. We are just a bunch of misfits fighting these painful feelings together. Anxiety. Depression. Putting on the fake smiles for friends and family. Wanting to just stay in bed all day, or not wake up at all. We lost some, and will lose plenty more, but for now we are all still here fighting it together. 

I salute you all, my fellow hurting brothers and sisters. To those we lose, I wish you peace, to the ones battling to get through the pain, know Iâ€™m here for you and I hope youâ€™re here for me.
