is it over yetim 19, I just lost my job, my girlfriend acts like she hates me, my family is constantly telling me im fat and have no future, and I donâ€™t even know what to do anymore.
ive been suicidal since i was 14, but the only thing stopping me was my animals, but specifically my cat.
now I have other cats and a puppy but I truly canâ€™t even imagine living until tomorrow.
i donâ€™t have a solid plan yet, but I wonder if theyâ€™ll miss me
