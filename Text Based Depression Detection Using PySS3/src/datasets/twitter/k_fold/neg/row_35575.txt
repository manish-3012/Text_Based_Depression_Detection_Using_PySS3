iâ€™m tirediâ€™m not gonna do anything stupid or hurt myself or anything. iâ€™m a 18 year old male and i know this is probably gonna sound stupid to most of yâ€™all but itâ€™s very real to me and i know i should talk to someone about it but iâ€™m the kinda person whose always concerned about others, never myself. iâ€™ve been with my girlfriend for almost a year now, and every time we have sex i can never get fully hard. iâ€™m able to get like 60% there but itâ€™s always still bendable and hard to use. this really frustrates me as iâ€™m VERY attracted to her and she is to me. idk but this has happened for the entirety of our relationship. at first i thought it was just a nervous stage, as she was my first, but it keeps happening. iâ€™ve gotten to the point where i donâ€™t even feel like a man. i mean if i canâ€™t please my woman then wtf am i doing here. i get fully erect no problem by myself looking at pictures of her (sheâ€™s 19) and i just donâ€™t know what the problem is. my doctor even tells me itâ€™s just nerves but i feel like thereâ€™s something wrong with me. i know it sounds stupid but iâ€™m a little sheltered bitch and i have been my whole life but this is making me feel worthless. i donâ€™t know what itâ€™s like to truly struggle yet this one thing is making me not want to live. at this point i just need someone to talk to but iâ€™m far too embarrassed to talk to my gf or any of my friends so i decided to post here to let everything go. i havenâ€™t slept in 3 days because i canâ€™t get over this. iâ€™ve reached a breaking point with myself. i donâ€™t know what is wrong with me and iâ€™m being a bitch and always wanting to take the easy way out but i just canâ€™t help myself. please someone help me. i donâ€™t know what to do anymore
