nothing gets better, it all goes down and down i want it to stop why doesnt it stopthis is my throwaway account, i had a breakdown in this sub earlier but right now, calmer and thinking about my life... im 20 years old and not one thing has gotten better ever since ive known myself and im not exaggerating  when i say this, i know a lot of people say this stuff and ignore the good in their lives but honestly looking back its just a fall from grace with no chance to work my way up again, today my fate is fucking sealed the only thing i wanted to do in life is permanently gone now... ive never had a girlfriend or desired one i was never interested in other people all that much, i have a couple of friends but no one extremely close to me i just fucked up my 2 chances between me and my goal and this time its permanent my family is not that rich we cant afford basically anything but food... with that theres only 1 possible future option left for me and its not who i am i dont want to walk into that path i would rather die than going for it I dont fucking want it i want to die instead this instant... would be so muuuch easier, all of the permanent problems ending with a permanent solution so fucking easy and way happier of a desicion for me to make rather than living at my current state it only fucking goes down why never up why everything keeps getting worse to the point of me having breakdowns daily i dont want to continue this, allthis fucking stress, not even for nothing it goes down it gets worse it doesnt stop why does it never stop every year i live it gets worse  why ther fuck wy deonst it get beteter eveer 

even if no one reads this it helps me calm down venting like this but honestly idek how long is this keep on happening... i dont want to take my life away because there are things i want to do but nothing..................nothing gets better, it keeps getting worse why does it never stop . i just want to have a year "wow this was a good year" or "wow this year nothing happened" it always gets worse i dont know what the fuck to do i feel like im in a game i can not win and give up, though... theres one way to give up and it seems like the best option atm
