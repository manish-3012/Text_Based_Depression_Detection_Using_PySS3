Ive (M/23) been dealing with depression for nearly 6 years. Tonight was the first night i have ever felt like seriously taking my own life.Tonight I was seriously worried about my life. I thought had I had a group of friends that supported me and would look after me. Tonight I realised they werenâ€™t. I am away on a boys trip away and after hours of drinking my so called mates began to laugh and make fun of my appearance and other things that seriously pushed me to breaking point. For the first time in my life I felt like giving my life up. I couldnâ€™t deal with it anymore. I called my girlfriend and cried for the first time in years about how I felt. As sad as it was, I felt better. Lucky enough I had my best mate with me not far away. And for the first time in my life I spoke my feelings to another guy. It was tough but relieving in a sense.

The point of this post is that no matter what, there is someone always there to talk to you and help you. I was literally minutes away from committing suicide. I wonâ€™t lie and say that I donâ€™t feel happier after all this. But I will say that without these two people in my life, tonight might of been my last. Baby steps, but with getting a lot of things of my chest tonight, maybe I can go forward in my life and begin my path to happiness.
