Does it ever get better?Its 2am and I just sat down with my third cup of coffee. Tried to sleep early tonight to get into some sort of routine but I ended up waking up 2 hours later because of nightmares. Flicked the light on checked my phone not a single message or anything from another living soul. Decide to get up to my computer sit down check my ex's steam profile for the 10th time since we broke up. Wonder to myself if I will ever find love or if im worth loving in the first place. Check my friends list and see a barren wasteland. It was never that I didn't meet and talk with people but I have never found someone that doesn't feel like a person destined to pass through my life.
I decide to watch youtube videos to get my mind off my borderline suicidal thoughts but low and behold I have watched every youtube video in my sub box for the last 3 days. I then realized its the weekend and no more videos are really going to come out because people generally spend the weekend with friends or family.
Atleast its dark outside and for a few hours it feels the entire world has stood still and people don't expect things from me. For a few hours its pure quietness. Thing is though when it gets quiet Im left with only my thoughts. I'm 20 years old and my body feels like it can't go on anymore. I'm so alone. Supposed to be the best years of my life and I'm just watching the lives of other people while I myself am standing still and letting time and loneliness erode away at my mind and body. I don't know whats worth living for anymore. 


I'm tired.
