Viable alternatives to nembutalI ask a similar question on another subreddit a fair while back and got no replies. Yes it is a new account but I'm sure you can understand anonymity is important here.

It seems to be the case that pentobarbital (nembutal) is the favoured option for assisted euthanasia and suicide. In my country however it is heavily restricted and near impossible to get. Are there any legal, or at least accessible, alternatives to it that are reliable?
