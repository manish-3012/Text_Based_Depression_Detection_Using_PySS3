Career Anxiety is going to end my lifeMy background is Iâ€™m 22, dropped out of college senior year due to social anxiety, major depression, and suicidal thoughts. I was studying accounting but lost all interest in it. I have no passion or hobbies besides video games. Every day I try to research interesting careers but Iâ€™m coming up empty. Whatâ€™s my next step? I canâ€™t keep living without a purpose and switching jobs every 6 months. 

Any advice would help. (This may belong in r/careerguidance but I thought it fit better here)
