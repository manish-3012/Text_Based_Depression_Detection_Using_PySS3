I just want to disappear.I have everything going for me, or so everyone thinks. Everyone says how great it must be to be 6â€™1. Like yeah, if you like standing out everywhere you go. Itâ€™d be nice if I was the guy that stands out because heâ€™s Chris Hemsworthâ€™s twin. Obviously, I wouldnâ€™t be posting if I was. My forehead slopes oddly. My nose is crooked and the bridge is oddly rounded. Itâ€™s not exactly a strong Roman nose, which is the only type of nose that I could conceivably pull off with the current state of my face (though itâ€™d be better if I had the same sort of straight Nordic nose that the rest of my family has). Itâ€™s sort of shaped like a rounded out Larry David sort of Jewish nose with a kind of normal tip. When I smile, my nose rounds itself out and turns down a little. My chin looks alright from the side, but obviously my profile is fucked. My chin is also kind of thin, so from the front or any non-perpendicular angle it looks weak. Iâ€™m skinny everywhere but parts of my face, causing my jawline to sort of disappear. I also have pectins excavatum, a condition that causes my ribs to turn in and become a divot in the center of my chest. Iâ€™m trying to fix it to some degree through constant chest exercise, but I donâ€™t know how much it can be helped. The worst part is, before the age of 10, I was easily the cutest kid in any setting. Then I slowly just got more grotesque over time. My parents and grandparents are all super attractive, so it kinda just stings more when we take family pictures and I stick out. My body is built like the most anorexic athlete out there, even though I eat over 5,000 calories regularly. Iâ€™m also that popular kid that isnâ€™t popular, if you know what I mean. Everyone at school acts like they like me, and I hang out with the jocks because they think Iâ€™m funny. I spent this entire year pretending to be dumb as fuck and cracking jokes just to get a girlâ€™s attention, and as soon as I was 100% sure she liked me back, she turned me down and her friend cried because she had a crush on me and I didnâ€™t really like her back. Then, my friend takes me out to cheer me up, and this girlâ€™s friend somehow manage to find and berate me for not dating her. Now one of my oldest friends is moving to Texas, another one of my best friends is becoming a full alcoholic and spent some time in a mental ward for trying to kill himself, and I literally havenâ€™t spoken to a person my age in like a week because Iâ€™m pretty sure that Iâ€™m just bothering everyone when I text them. I see them all hanging out together, and it just burns. Suicide is always in the back of my mind, but I donâ€™t want to make my parents/dog/sister sad. I also have this recurring daytime nightmare  of my mom crying while cleaning up my blood. The whole quarantine thing is just driving me a little bit crazier, and now Iâ€™m suicidal because Iâ€™m afraid of being suicidal. Sui-ception.
