Wake up to see the sunriseI was sitting at Starbucks today on my lunch break, studying. I almost always go this Starbucks on my lunch break and usually get the same thing - a vanilla sweet cream cold brew. Usually grande, but this time I got a venti. This random chick comes up to me and asks me something. I honestly forget what she was asking me, just heard something about going up to Seattle. She gave me this little sealed envelope, about 3" x 4", with "#29" written on it. I tell her thanks, gesturing that I would open and read it later, but she insists on me opening the card (I'm assuming to see my reaction). On the side with the flap, there's a little smiley face drawn in blue. Inside is a blue and grey card, with the word "Thanks" written and bordered in gold. I opened the card and written inside in pen, and highlighted in a light blue for a nice contrast is "Wake up to see the sunrise." I thought about it, and I knew she was waiting for me to smile. I just kind of bobbed my head and thought "ok..." I thought about it more, and thought, do I really want to? Do I really want to wake up again and see the sunrise? I start to frown, but then give this girl a little smirk, and she kind of points to me with both hands in that "there it is" manner.

I had just been turned down for a position at my work. Again. I've been trying to get out of this hell hole for a while now. I've applied for many different positions, all with no luck. I'm going to back to school to hopefully be admitted into a program to finally make something of my life, but for now I need something to get the bills paid and have health insurance.

My best friend, or who I considered my best friend, is refusing to talk to me. Calls, texts - all ignored. I had a sinking feeling this would happen after he left (we used to work together), and the last time I talked to him I begged him not to forget about me, and made sure we would still hang out. This is coming on two months ago. I was so close to this guy, my heart aches when I think about it.

One of my other close friends I felt I could always rely on hasn't talked to me in months either. She moved away quite a while ago, but we've always maintained a, what I though to be, a good relationship even only via text.

I've maintained very few friendships. I honestly don't know why. I've tried to keep in contact with people, hang out with them, build genuine relationships, but they always seem to fall apart. I have such a hard time trusting anybody now because of the most recent events in my life.

My sister is very abusive towards everyone in my family - me, my mom, my nephew (her son). She only cares about herself and no one else. She's seemingly always the victim, never at fault (can never accept any fault at all). I've given up on her completely. I don't know how many times I can keep thinking she'll change and that she's my sister, and I should try to care, but I always end up getting hurt.

My cousins, they used to be my pillars. They were my closest friends, and I did everything with them. I understand that they have lives of their own, families of their own, I just wish they would keep in touch with me more often. I started to hate going to them whenever I had any problems, and felt like a burden, and the last time I did that really reinforced that feeling. They always told me blood is thicker than water, but it seems this blood has thinned completely out.

My POS dad. His attitude screams, money can buy love. He'll buy his grandson, my nephew, my sister's son, all the toys in the world, but would not spend a moment playing with them with him. He cannot stand to be in the same room with his family. Last year on my 26th birthday, my mom reminded him that it was my birthday. All he had to say? "So? I don't care." He's commented numerous times on how I'm useless and that I can't do anything on my own and brags about his nieces and nephews halfway around the world. He can be proud of his brother's and sister's kids, but not his own. After a lifetime of essentially being ignored, and as I got older what an asshole he really is, I've pretty much cut him out of my life.

My mom. One of the main reasons I'm still here today. She would die from a broken heart if I were to leave her by herself. I love my mom to death, but I don't want to make her feel as if she failed me as a mother; I don't want to make her feel like she did a shitty job raising her kids. I try to do her proud by being decent with finances, and being pretty self-reliant. But sometimes she's just not there for me. I asked her to ask her boss if I could shadow her at work, and she refuses to even ask. She knows that it's would be so helpful to me in getting into this program, but still she refuses to even ask. She knows getting into this program would be life-changing for me, but still, she refuses to try to help me out.

I don't have enough money to move out on my own, or even with a roommate for that matter. So I'm banking on getting into this program so I can turn my life around. I've been studying non-stop day and night so I can get my mind off of things like work and home, but in lurks the thought of how much better life would be if I ended mine.

The other night, I put on some headphones, put on some sad songs, and poured myself some whiskey. And some more. And more. And more. With each drink, I thought "God, let me die, just let me die, I hate living." I crawled into bed thinking, "please, just let me die. Please. Just let me die."

I woke up to see the sunrise, disappointed.

I hope to get through this. I really do. I hope all of you do to. I haven't found what's worth living, but I'm trying to keep living so I can find out. And I hope everyone else who's struggling here does too. We'll all find it, it's just going to take some time. It's hard, now, but maintain hope, even the slightest glimmer of it, don't ever let that small glint of hope go out and let's all forge on.
