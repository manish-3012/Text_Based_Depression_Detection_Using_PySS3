14y/o, why the fuck do I have to deal with all of this now?A month ago my best and only friend killed himself because I didn't stop him. He jumped off a cliff and I was the last person he talked to. I haven't been able to tell a single person that I know about it, or what even happened. Most of them don't even know that he existed, let alone that he killed himself within 10 minutes of speaking to me. On top of all this I'm horrified of people, gay, unlikeable and unattractive - I'll go through my entire meaningless life alone and depressed waiting for it to finally end, why should I wait to play it out when I can just finish it now. Why do I have to face all this now, when anyone else my age lives a care-free life with their only problem being lack of internet connection to check Instagram. Why waste the rest of my life alone, depressed, and working until retirement when I can just end my pointless existence now
