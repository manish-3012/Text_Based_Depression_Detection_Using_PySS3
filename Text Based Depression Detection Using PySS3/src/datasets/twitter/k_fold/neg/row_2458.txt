I wish I could just do itI want this all to be over but the idea of causing grief to my family is the only thing keeping me going. If I could swap places with someone who is going to die due to a terminal illness I would swap in a heartbeat. At least that way they wouldnt blame themselves. I have had enough. My head hurts every single day, I just want to go.
