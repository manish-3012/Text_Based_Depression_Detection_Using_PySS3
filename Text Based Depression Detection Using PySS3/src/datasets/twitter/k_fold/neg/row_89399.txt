Feel completely helpless.I've been trying to organise an internship but my contact isn't responding to me anymore whatsoever. E-mail, text, call, e-mailing or calling other staff members, nothing. I need to contact her asap or i'm not going to graduate but i don't know what to do. I also have very little work experience so it's unlikely i'll get the placement even if i get in contact with her. I feel completely helpless. I feel like a failure. I've failed my family and friends who i've told i would be getting the placement (only because i felt pressured into saying so, since there's nothing else exciting or positive in my life). 

I've been depressed on and off for years and no one knows the full extent of it because I've never told them, mainly due to shame. 

I've stopped talking to anyone. I feel like I can't talk to anyone about my problems because I'm so ashamed. I never wanted to be this kind of person. If i don't graduate i'm going to be a complete failure.

I just want someone to talk to without the fear of being ashamed. I'm sorry for the rambling.


EDIT: I just heard back from another staff member and it turns out my contact is on FUCKING HOLIDAYS until the end of July (when the semester starts). She didn't even tell me this! I'm royally pissed.
