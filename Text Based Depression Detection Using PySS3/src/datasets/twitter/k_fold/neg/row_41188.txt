I'm Going to Kill Myself TomorrowI'll try to make this as short and sweet as I can. I'm 21, I've had anxiety and depression since I was 15 or 16 probably, when I was that young I just ignored it best I could and thought I was dumb for thinking about suicide so much, afterall I was just a kid, I didnt know what depression was. At 17 I got a gf, I noticed a lot of my pain was worth it, the pain was still there but having someone so close let me push back the suicidal thoughts. 3 years later she cheats on me after we had moved in together. 3 months of manipulation and being called an idiot/worthless/etc until I was finally able to move out. The suicidal thoughts started coming back, but for some reason it seems way more real now. I feel like I have nothing to live for, I have a year left of college but I cant honestly see myself doing what im going for. I love my job but I cant see a future. Honestly I cant see a future for anything. Everyday I go to work/school and I'm happy as can be and when i come home i immediately feel miserable. The past few months have been especially tough, I feel alone, worthless, and like I dont have a future. My ex is in my life again, for about 3 months, only to lead me on over and over to get my hopes up to crush me. "Being a bitch is fabulous, I love it" were her words after telling me it was all fake. I dont want people to think I'm killing myself because of a breakup because I'm not, I just have nothing to hold me back from these feelings anymore. Regardless, I'm tired of feeling sick to my stomach wanting to die. I'm tired of being alone. I'm tired of crying every single day of my life. I'm tired of living. Tomorrow is the day. I always thought I'd shoot myself but I'm gonna go with hanging probably instead, a little cleaner so my family can still have an open casket. I'm scared and I'm excited, thanks for reading.
