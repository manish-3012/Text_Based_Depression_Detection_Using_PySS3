Instead of committing suicide...Whenever the thought seriously enters my mind (and that happens a lot), I try to think of better ways to exhaust my life, such as donating my body to hardcore charity work, joining the Peace Corps, moving to a third world country and teaching the poor to read, etc. Your life may be hard/ unbearable, but you can at least accomplish some good with it, and if you are going to die anyway, why not better the planet with your sacrifice?
