Ive been so betrayed i cant take no moreMy familys betrayed me. My friends have betrayed me. Every girl ive ever dated had betrayed me. First one burning me in my groin area. Yes u heard me. Then i slap a wall in frustration and anger and sadness and a nail goes througj my hand leaves a nice scar and nerve damage. Then i meet a girl who i loved that at first helped me from the other situation and then betrayed me even worse. My life was good. Dated her for 7 years. 4 of them dealing with her heroin addiction and behavior. She went to prison. I waited for her the whole time gets out and sees me 3 times and starts messing with some weird old guy. So i just moved on. Saved money for school and to play football. Was hanging out with but not dating a new girl. My ex texted me for a year straight and i ignored her. Couldnt of been doing better then she hits me up with some bullshit. Says she messed up and wants to work stuff out offers sex. I go pick her up cause i still loved her. Stuff happened between me and her and she fucking gives me herpes. Fucking nasty ass i wanna die herpes! Call her and confront her to find out it was a setup and she told me to die. So i gave up. Couldnt deal with my reality. Began chewing 4 cans of chew a day. Messed my mouth up really bad laid in bed for a year and aix months not showering eating and hurting myself. More scars. Then she fucking overdoses on heroin. I cant believe this fucking shit. My life is ruined i cant go on like this
