Talk me out of itI am not going to do anything right now, maybe/hopefully not tonight but no promises as I am reaching my breaking point, and I am lost. Suicide honestly seems like a great option and you know how you guys say it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem? This problem feels permanent. 

Long story short I have grown up to more or less rely on myself and no one else. Being helped is almost like insulting me though I am working on this I guess. I noticed this when a friend tried to help me when I was drunk and I nearly broke his wrist. No one could hold me down sans one big dude and he had to get me home just because I hate being helped. This also leads to me being excellent in conversation as such I have very few people who dislike me, or who know my past at all, or whom I feel like I can trust... The biggest problem is I also judge myself by my actions, not by my intentions and the words "you screwed up" reoccur quite often. I feel like I have screwed up so much it would be a waste of time to continue. I just feel empty, the only feelings I have left are anxiety, sadness, anger, and lust. 

I am a 19 yr old virgin with a  2.0 GPA because I can't bring myself to do more than the minimum, and I know it is my fault because I did that. I am the one who can not summon the courage and willpower to talk to women or actually do work. I am the one who screwed up, has screwed up, and will continue to screw up.
