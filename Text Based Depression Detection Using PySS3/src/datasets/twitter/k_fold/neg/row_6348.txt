I took way too many pillsI've been trying to die for the longest time now. Today I took 35 Ibuprofen tablets and 10 Claritin before I got bored. I don't feel anything out of the ordinary so I'll probably just go about my day as usual unless something changes. My family won't know a thing until the day I die.
