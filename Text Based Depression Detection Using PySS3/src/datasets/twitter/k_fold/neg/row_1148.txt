â€œCollege freshman girl jumps to her death from campus construction craneâ€That will be me soon. That will Be whatâ€™s in the morning news. I will be gone. Iâ€™m scared, but Iâ€™m determined. I canâ€™t take another shitty day. I canâ€™t take the pain anymore. I canâ€™t go another night without sleeping. My 19th birthday was supposed to be next Tuesday, but I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll make it. Iâ€™m sorry. I donâ€™t know what the point of this post was supposed to be.
