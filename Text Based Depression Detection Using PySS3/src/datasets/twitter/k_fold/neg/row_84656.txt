Why are the so called "counselors" on the suicide hotlines always so shitty?I swear I've called them several times and every single time I have a bad experience. They're stone cold, unknowledgeable, sound bored and zoned out all the time with their robotic sounding voices and tones, and are just plain unhelpful. In fact most of the time it sounds like they're not even trying to help or at least don't want to be talking to me. Once I mentioned to one of them how I couldn't afford hospitalization and didn't expect any real help in my area, so she asked ME where I was supposed to get help. I don't know how it is with others but I've known nothing but shitty counselors on those lines.
