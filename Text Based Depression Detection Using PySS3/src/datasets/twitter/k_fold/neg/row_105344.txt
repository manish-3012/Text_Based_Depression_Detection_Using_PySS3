I don't even know what to write...I'm a transgender teen and I just don't know how people do it. My dad died when I was young and I've been depressed ever since. I'm so bad at expressing my thoughts and I have like 3 (if that) friends and I'm failing school and my mom is emotionally (sometimes physically) abusive and my sister doesn't care and I've just given up. Nothing makes me happy and I just hate myself. I don't know what to write and I don't know how and I don't understand and how people do things.  

Our house is being foreclosed and my mom doesn't have a job and all my friends just tell me "it'll get better" but I'm not seeing the point of waiting until it might get better cause luck is never on my side. I'll never be a lady and I'll never be good at anything. I feel damaged and broken and useless. I'm not good at being social and I'm not even good at being anti-social. I'm alone and no one cares and I don't get how people live. I don't want to be alone.
