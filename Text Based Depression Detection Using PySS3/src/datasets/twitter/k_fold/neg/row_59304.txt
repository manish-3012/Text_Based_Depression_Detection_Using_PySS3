haha i wanna d*e but literally nobody cares :-)i feel like such a burden and such a waste of life. i have a controlling mother who doesnâ€™t let me have a job, have money, or go to school. iâ€™m 21 years old and have nothing to live for because i feel so trapped. iâ€™m never going to get out of this situation so i donâ€™t want to bother suffering anymore or wasting anyones time. but iâ€™m also scared of death so much. or just not doing it correctly and ending up paralyzed or really sick. i would feel so embarrassed. i donâ€™t want to die, i just no longer want to exist. i just want to fall asleep and donâ€™t wake up. i want to go painlessly. but things donâ€™t work like that so now iâ€™m just sitting here rotting away until i inevitably die of natural causes. but i just cannot take this anymore. everyone i know has found someone who loves them and it kills me because i know i will never find that. idk sorry this is just rambling but i have nobody to vent to. people automatically get nervous when you say you want to kms and itâ€™s just so frustrating. i really donâ€™t think i would ever do it, but it is constantly on my mind. i just need to get it off my chest.
