Why canâ€™t people be suicidal in peace?I donâ€™t understand. Why is there so much stigma against suicide? Why does everyone think that a suicidal person needs help? When will they understand that suicide is a personal decision. If death is what it takes to make someone happy, why not let them have it? Iâ€™ve fantasized about various suicide methods since I was 13. Im now 25, and not a day has gone by where I believe Iâ€™m better off on this planet than dead. I look forward to death. I not only accept it, but invite it. The only thing that has stopped me so far is im scared of failure. If you fail to kill yourself you are treated like a criminal. You actually get charged. I am waiting for the right, painless opportunity then Iâ€™m jumping right on it. Nothing will stop me. I will never be happy in life. Good for those who can find happiness in this world but you need to understand we all donâ€™t feel that way. Just had to vent.
