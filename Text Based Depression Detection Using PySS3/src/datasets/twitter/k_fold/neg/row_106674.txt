Life keeps screwing me over and it will never end, until I end itMy sob story: Raised by two violent parents, parents divorced, physically abused, emotionally abused, sexually abused until I was 15, starved and neglected on a daily basis, extreme bullying within school. Was forced by a parent to promise that I would kill myself beginning at age 9. Forced to drink alcohol/take pills. Left that situation. Grew up. Got married. Was living the dream, until found out my spouse is a constant liar and has cheated on me/is cheating on me. I have no where to go. No savings. No career. No education. Career/education were put on hold because of this marriage and my spouse's insane amount of debt. 

Fuck it. Fuck it all. 

The thing that hurts the most is that nothing ever good happened for me. Each time I was so close to earning something great, something shitty happened and shut out every good thing/barred every good opportunity. 

This is where I give up trying. I've tried for so long to remain above water, to remain sane and capable of living a normal, healthy life. But it never stops. This is the straw to break the camel's back. 

For whoever reading this, know that people like me are out there. People who survive multiple forms of abuse, who make it out alive, who come out with nothing but their own desire to be the exception, rather than the rule. People who work fucking hard for everything they get. But people are shitty. Will always be shitty. Life will always be shitty. 

I'm exhausted. 

I'm done.
