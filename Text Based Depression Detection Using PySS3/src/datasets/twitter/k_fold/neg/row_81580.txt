please just listen, thats all i ever wanted, sometimes to just listen to my pain, a lending earim feeling suicidal, im feeling every emotion under god's night sky, even the emotions that only the higher conscious beings feel; ones that us humans aren't able to feel yet bc we r low frequency. when i have these breakdowns i don't feel like a human, i just feel like a silhouette but of emotions. im feeling pain that feels like a huge metal door slamming on my heart, it feels like cancer flowing in my veins. This pain and overwhelming i want to scratch it out of my soul like a chronic cocaine/meth fiend gnawing at their skin with their nails. Im itching stressing about my self worth, I just don't know anymore, this pain is so cold, its darker than a black hole, feels like an entity without an identity. i sometimes think about throwing myself off the 25th floor, sometimes i want to bang my head against the concrete floor till my neck snaps, sometimes i want to stab a steak knife into my eye but im aware of these thoughts and they go away, but this pain, it goes so much deeper than i what i know. please god im always talking to you, praying to you at all times of the day; walking, studying, in a lecture class, grocery shopping, all the time god., i say a prayer sometimes in the morning when i first wake up for that extra guidance and love for my failing mechanism of a spirit or body or whatever the fuck this is all coming from. god please why dont u answer my prayers? why cant i see an image of an answer? a voice?? why is it that people know ur love when they pray. i just dont understand why i feel so empty all the time, when i try so hard to socialize the awareness of the emptiness fucking makes my body sick, i physically feel sick and i have no fuckign clue why, i feel so fucking disconnected from people but how can that be when i feel emotions from a-z in a span of a second
