i don't even know how to begini'm just feeling way suicidal right now and i'm not really sure who to turn to anymore. i haven't even been on reddit in a year or so.. but i just need to know someone is at least trying to listen out there. even knowing someone read the first sentence is enough. 

i'm 22, almost 23 in a few days and i've never felt more helpless or alone than i do right now. i don't talk to my family or friends about my feelings or emotions, so that alone probably isn't helping. my anxiety has gotten so bad this past year that i'm even too afraid to go to an internet friend. my friends are all too busy for me. too busy to even noticed how fucked up i am. they all have husbands and kids or actual jobs and are doing things with their lives. even my fiance is leaving me behind. 

my fiance and i rented an apartment near the school we were going to and everything was fine.. but then most days i have trouble even getting out of bed, so i skipped class a lot. this was the third college i've failed out of. he must have felt bad for me or something because he didn't want to go back the next semester.  since we weren't going to school, we didn't see a need to live so close to it. so, he moved back in with his mom and i with my parents for the time being until we could find another apartment. then my parents opened a coffee shop and now i'm stuck working there. i hate it so much. i have regular anxiety attacks there and my parents refuse to even try to understand. i've tried to quit but they guilt trip me back in. 

i also hate living with them here, so i was relieved it was only temporary.. but i don't think it is anymore. my finace went back to school and has now decided he's going to go to a school hours away. i'm stuck here. like super stuck. i don't even have a car or license anymore because i totaled it 6 months ago.. so i mostly rely on my fiance to get me places i need to be. i can't stand being in a car for more than 5 minutes with either of my parents. they used to beat me as a kid and even now living here is in constant fear. being in a confined space with them would just trigger a panic attack. for the time being  he is still at his moms but i guess doesn't see the big deal with me staying here.. i've tried to explain myself numorus times but he still doesn't see it like i do. he told me to just not argue with them, and i'll be fine. if it were that easy my life wouldn't be as bad. i've asked him many times to please come pick me up and let me stay with him for a few days until i have to go back to work, but he refuses to make the hour drive up here. he said he's too busy with homework and could only take the time out of his life on thursday. thursday is too far away. that's too long.. 

so that's where i am right now. i feel so helpless.  i'm only seeing one way out right now. it's not even like.. "oh, just wait the two days." because what about when he leaves for the school that's hours away? i'm still stuck here. i feel like i always will be. only now am i realizing it.
