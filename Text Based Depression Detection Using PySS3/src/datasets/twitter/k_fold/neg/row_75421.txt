Nothing left to live forSo gonna keep it short no point really just want one last message...so basically I got accepted into some really amazing band at a regional music school and since then all my friends have abandoned me they graffitied my locker with words like slut, whore, useless, waste stuff like that....my family hasn't spoken to me since my grandfather died and have never really cared for me....my boyfriend who says he loves me went to university and has been spending all of his time with friends and blames me for wasting his time....there's no reason to stay anymore so anyone wanna talk me out of it give it a try but no promises.....
