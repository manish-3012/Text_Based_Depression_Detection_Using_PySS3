I'm exhausted. selfpityfueledrant.txtI hate my life, and I hate my body; every time I look in the mirror I see HIM, the way my body stores fat is suffocating.

I did fuck all in junior high, despite how desperately I want to move on to high school everyone in charge of my "education" is hell bent on keeping me in limbo. 

Every day is the same. I do nothing but look at a screen. I can't take it. 

This is far from new to me. I've come close to attempting it several times. The police have been to my house at least six times. I was even escorted to hospital once. My mum has said several times that she wouldn't be able to handle it happening again. 

The fuck am I supposed to do? It's totally free. I fee as if I am in genuine need of the resources provided.

If I do something soon I don't know what'll happen. I'm such a fucking weirdo.
