i dont know what to doso i decided to take a gap year before college, it seemed like a good idea then because i didn know what i wanted to study but i mean its just completely fucked me up. this year has been so bad, i have no friends left, i actually miss high school. that was one normal thing i had . my familys as dysfunctional as it gets ,just a bunch of narcissists. like they will just lash out on me if anything i say doesnt match with their opinions. (ive had my aunt told me to kill myself because i said i didn believe in god. more than one time) and you now what i might just because lately suicide is all i think about
