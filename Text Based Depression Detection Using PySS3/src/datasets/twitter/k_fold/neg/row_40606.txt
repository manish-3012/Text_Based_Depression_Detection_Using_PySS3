UnableI tired, but my body did not want to die. My face was red and my veins were budging when I got up. Why am I telling the internet this, its probably a bad idea. Later I beat myself with a belt to feel something. I'm so alone. I'm so empty.  Its been so long. I cried silently on the bus, some people laughed at me, called me "American Psycho". Went to a job interview, and pretend to be normal; I can pass for normal if I try, but it hurts. I Haven't worked since my old boss tired to sexual assault me last January, and I'm going to go broke soon; I'm not sure if I care. Interviews make the flash backs worse, but I manage. I wore this shirt when he first pushed the stall door open, I realize, but I try to stay focused. I hoped the pain would stop, but it did not. The interviewer was unusually condescending and rude; I apologized to her. Why am I apologizing to strangers who can't be civil? The interviewer wields the caustic sterility of professional language with such precision. Later I feel so empty, like I'm not even corporeal. My neighbors are made at me again. My neighbors hate me for crying at 3 am most nights; they're scared of me and pity me. I don't blame them. They always slam their door, and stomp on the floor when they walk by me, but they ever speak to me. They hear me begging to die in ragged whispers through the paper thin walls. I have no friends in the city. My old friends are all gone now. Most people are indifferent or hostile, but the homeless junkie sleeping in front of my building is always friendly, if he's conscious. I want to feel something so badly. I think about asking him where he buys his Fentanyl, but there are cheaper, faster ways to die. I don't recognize the city I grew up in anymore, I'm no longer a part of it. I feel so lost on streets I've walked a thousand times. Maybe tomorrow will be the day, I don't know.
