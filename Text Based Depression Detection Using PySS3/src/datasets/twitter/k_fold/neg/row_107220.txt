It never stopsI have been depressed and mentally fucked since I hit puberty, I'm now an adult and my life isn't any better. I still want to die constantly and am sick of hearing that it gets better. I've tricked my family and friends into thinking I'm happy and recovered and living a good fulfilling life.  In reality I spend every minute I'm alone fantasising about ending my life.  I think it's finally time to go through with it and end my misery.
