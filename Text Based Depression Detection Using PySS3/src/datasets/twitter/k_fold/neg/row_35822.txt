I don't know how to deal with this.I'm not sure how to go about talking about something like this, but here we go. 

Every while or so, I get in a certain mood that gives me thoughts. Those thoughts come up in many different ways. 

Sometimes it involves me dying by the hands of someone who's an evil character. Like a robber, or a thug, or a serial killer. More often it's me killing myself. I see myself eating pills, or jumping from a very high ledge and then i'm just gone. These thoughts used to get me highly upset, but over time it's just not as effective anymore. 

I sometimes will break down and cry my eyes out. Sometimes for no reason, sometimes because ill feel like nothing. Im always hearing how upset my mother is in regards of my actions, and that definitely makes it worse. It's not like I can talk to her about it because she'll just tell all the details of our conversation to her friends and our family and I don't like that kind of reputation. With her I feel unattractive. I feel like a pig and its all because of how she talks about me to her friends. I feel like a brat for even thinking like this. I know its my fault. I know im the reason to be talked about in that fashion, and honestly I've given up trying to prevent it. 

I know that no matter what I do I'll always upset someone. Im Bad at conversation, I can never give the Right advice  And I'm always trying to fit in with THR crowd. Even typing this J didn't wanna seem like I'm craving attention. 

I keep telling myself I'm Young and it'll get better, but keeping everything in seems to make this worse. 

Can someone tell me what to do?
