Unusual post, maybeI was diagnosed with schizophrenia ten years ago. I've been told that no one has plans to come torture me, as far as they know, by my family. Yet, I can't help but think that someone is. Considering killing myself so no one will torture me. Death seems..better..than torture to me. When will this end?
