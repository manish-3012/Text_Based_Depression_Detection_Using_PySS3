Dying dreamsEver since I was a little girl my dream in life was to be a legendary dog breeder and trainer I've spent almost my whole life studying and gathering knowledge to be a dog breeder and trainer but my dream is dying really fast I'm rapidly running out of time to realistically make my dream happen.... I feel completely crushed, the one thing that kept me fighting through my pain and kept me strong is fading away... without my dream life isn't worth all the pain
