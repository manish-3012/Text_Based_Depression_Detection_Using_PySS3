20 f. While dissociating I forgot my dog was in the car with me and I almost drove into a rail.Iâ€™ve never acted on my thoughts before but it was really intense this time. Then I heard the rattle of a cage and looked over in my seat to see her little sniffer poking out of the bars, snapped me out of it, but I did start crying pretty hard because I thought to myself, â€œif I just wasnâ€™t thinking and acted on my urges, she couldâ€™ve died, and I care about and love her so muchâ€ 

I feel like a shit person and a shit owner. Fuckinâ€™ hate myself.
