I'm not suicidal but...I do suffer from chronic depression that comes and goes and varies in intensity. I have suffered with it since I was about 15 years old due to things happening in my personal life. My biggest fear is that one day I'll be considering suicide, I'll reach out for help but nobody will be there to help me. 

This sub gives me hope that if I'm ever in that position, where my worst fear is happening, at least someone will have my back. 

Thanks for all the work you guys do. Y'all are quite literally lifesavers.
