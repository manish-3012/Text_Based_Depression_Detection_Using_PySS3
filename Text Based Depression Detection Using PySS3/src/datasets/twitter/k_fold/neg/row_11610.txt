What is hapiness.Other than serotonin and dopamine. If all that I hold near and dear solely depends on chemicals in my brain, what is hapiness really? And why would i keep on living knowing that the slightest stupid imbalance in these reactions can make it feel like my life is over. It's too unstable for me, I'm done. I'm done playing games. I don't want to be here.

p.s. I hope you all find hapiness and peace, whatever the hell it may actually be.
