I'm really considering this.There is a piece of paper sitting in my printer that says:

Just in case.

I'm not sure where I am right now, or how I feel.

If I go through with this, please know it isn't your fault.  I just can't take it anymore.

I thought I may as well leave a note.  May you all live happily.

::end of note::

I live alone.  I'm relatively successful.  Just went through a breakup that has me all fucked up.  Got drunk and sent stupid regretful texts.

Sounds familiar, right?  But I do this every time, after every breakup.  Feels like the end of the world.   

Am I broken?  A fucked up human being who just can't deal with this sort of stress and thinks that crawling into the closet with a gun is my best alternative?

EDIT:  moved the end of my note.  Fuck, I already wrote a note?
