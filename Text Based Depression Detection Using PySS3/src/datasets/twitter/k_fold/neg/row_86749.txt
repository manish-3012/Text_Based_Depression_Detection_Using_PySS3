I don't know what to doMale, soon 30 years old. It's been ~20 years since I met my first "girlfriend". She was 35-something.

Tbf, I understand now that she had some mental challanges. But nevertheless it really fucked me up.

I have never, ever, enjoyed sex. My previous (age appropriate) girlfriends ended our relationships because I didn't really want to have sex. We had sex, but I wasn't there.

I am now a month from turning 30. I've been with my current, absolutely amazing gf/live in partner, for about 11 years. I love her to death. But I still cannot commit to sex. I have never initiated it. When she does, I stare upon the ceiling trying to think about something else.

She believes I am asexual. If it wasn't for her I'd have no problem going years between orgasms.

Fuck all of this. I don't care if you think I'm overly-sensitive. Or if I should consider myself "lucky" because she may have been considered good looking.

I don't know why I wrote this. It has gone an hour and I still haven't finished this paragraph.

This isn't a plea for help. More like a.. I don't know. I sincerely hope the best of y'all. My mind is racing. Please be well.
