People who have not yet lived wanting to dieI have been alive for 50 plus years. When I look back all of my best years occured prior to turning 31. When I get depressed (we all do, its normal) I reflect on those earlier years. I accidently stumbled onto this reddit site and was astounded by the number of young people who wanted to die. I am not judging. I just want to tell you that you have everything to live for and maybe things might not get better right away as you want them too but trust me what ever you are going through makes you stronger to handle worse if and when it does. If that doesn't help. Make a deal with yourself and say im going to live to be middle age and then look back at my younger self and see what I've become. See if that old lady on Reddit was right.
