I have to do it. I have to die right now.I can't do it anymore. My entire life has been a colossal waste. I'm fucking pathetic. I don't have anything I'm thankful for. I don't have any reason to live. Some people are just meant to live pathetic lives and I'm one of them. I can't go on this way. I hate everyone and everything. I hate my entire life. I will never have the life I want. I'm tired of it all. I'm tired of my job, my friends, my family, dating. I'm tired of feeling like a fucking failure because I didn't go to college and I don't drive. I'm tired of knowing I'll never amount to anything because i'm stupid as fuck and lazy and worthless. I'm tired of this boring ass life. I can't fucking take it. Everyone in my life has just kicked me and kicked me until I fucking broke. Congrats to them, I'm fucking broken and irreparable. They've officially won. All that's left is for me to take these pills. Bye.
