Really struggling.I really wanted to feel better. I made this account 5 months ago when I was at a low point. I hoped things would improve. But I'm still at that low point. 

I can't find people to connect with. I constantly tell people they're young and they'll find someone. There are a lot of people out there. 

It's just not happening for me.  

I've been wasting my education and myself for years now.

And I just want it to stop and this is such a good way to make it stop.
