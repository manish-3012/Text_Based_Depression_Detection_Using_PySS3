Starting to think about taking actionI have been suicidal for a long time and planned once to go to a shooting range but when I called there I was told you need a license. So I didn't commit but a few years past by and I am an addict, have BPD and depression. I called my mom and told her I want to die. She Didnt say anything....She never cared about me. both of my parents never cared. And I want to accept them. but this pain I want it to end. And it is being used against me by both of my parents. They just hate that I exist. I thought about jumping on train tracks as I think it is pretty quick. My mom is devouring over protective and my dad is abusive. I am wasting my life and I can't deal with her she just wants to ruin me. Doesn't care about my feelings, doesn't take responsibility, manipulates me, uses my jealousy against me, attacks and belittles me. You will say: "Cut ties with her" I am trying but its not easy I need support from someone....I dont know who I am because of that...I was never accepted. I have no ground beneath my feet.
