Not sure how much longer I'll make itI got married young and it derailed my whole life. I turned down my dream job because I would have had to relocate across the country, I fucked up my college, I rarely talked to any of my friends and now I'm basically friendless. I gained 100 lbs. I've fucked up so many classes that now I can't graduate, and even if I could I'm in a degree I don't like at all. I'm so far in debt that even working two jobs for the last couple of months I'm barely making it. 

Why should I even try? Fuck. Even if I do try I'll be poor forever and man that's not fun. It's just been bothering me lately. I got married when I was 19 and she was 18 and got offered my dream job a few months later, but since I didn't want to be away from her (and she couldn't have handled it anyways) I turned it down, and now I regret it every goddamn day. I could have had the best job of my life and now I work two minimum wage jobs for between 10-30 hours a week each and all of my money goes into bills or debt. Just fuck me. I don't even know if I still love her anymore, I thought i always would then but she just spends like over 100 dollars every other week on one of her friends or something and we're literally missing bill payments and Holy shit Its so annoying. 

Okay sorry for ranting. I just don't know how much longer I can put up with this bullshit. Even if I leave I can't afford rent or anything by myself. Nor do I think it would make me happy.
