Itâ€™s HopelessI hate my life.

I hate everything about it, I hate being born into this god forsaken world and fight for everything. Fight to defend myself, fight so I have something to eat, fight so I have somewhere to live. All that effort, and Iâ€™m still a piece of trash, a piece of shit, a worthless person, a nobody, a common mook in this world. Replaceable. I canâ€™t help but feel envy of otherâ€™s life, much better than me, much productive and exciting and trilling... I wasnâ€™t even planned to be born, and the only thing I manage was to fuck over my motherâ€™s life.

I hate my life, and I want to die.
