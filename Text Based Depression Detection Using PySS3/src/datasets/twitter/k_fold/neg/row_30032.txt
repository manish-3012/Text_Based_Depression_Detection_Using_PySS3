A constant disappointment to everyone I love, a constant source of mistakes and fuckups and misfortune. Thereâ€™s no point anymore.I feel like a constant fuck up. I just fucked up again tonight, wrecked my SOâ€™s car, which is the 4th wreck this year. On top of all the other things Iâ€™ve done wrong, Iâ€™ve caused everyone I love money and frustration and lost time. Iâ€™m just a huge inconvenience to everyone. I some how manage to fuck something up. I canâ€™t even get out of bed to go to class anymore. My depression and anxiety have been slowly draining at me and my inability to just do simple adult things have all caused inconvenience and misfortune to the people I love. I constantly just fuck up no matter what I do. Iâ€™m just so tired of it. So tired of being the misfortune to those I want to give my best. 
And after a life of having an absent father, 2 abusive familial relationships of people I thought I was safe with, a 4 year abusive SO, and just all my fucking mistakes, Iâ€™m starting to think again that I am just not made for this world. That Iâ€™m too weak for it. That I would just save everyone so much time, money, and hurt to just leave it. Thereâ€™s just so many times a person can fuck up before just being a fuck up. Iâ€™m too much of a coward to take up a gun, but Iâ€™m considering other less violent means. 

I just feel like a fucking epitome of a pity party. I loath myself so much for making all the misfortune about me. I donâ€™t know how to deal with all this.
