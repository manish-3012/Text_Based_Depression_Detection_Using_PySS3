How do you cope with the fact that nobody really cares about youIâ€™ve thought this might be the case for a long time, but recently Iâ€™m pretty certain. Iâ€™m never invited to anything even if I ask, nobody ever responds to me, nobody ever reaches out to me and ever since I stopped having the energy to text people or call, I havenâ€™t spoken to some of them in months.... thatâ€™s how much they donâ€™t care about talking to me. I went through a rough time recently, I broke up with my partner of two years, I reached out to my friends for some support and all except one couldnâ€™t even pretend to care. Nobody has asked if im okay, if anything its just a general â€œoh it gets better dont worry youll find someone elseâ€ I dont want anyone else I just want someone to show me that they care about me, I just want support and love, itâ€™s not like Iâ€™m never there for them either, or that I never ask to hang out, they really just donâ€™t care to see me or hear from me. I donâ€™t really have any family either, I donâ€™t have my partner anymore, I have nothing, Iâ€™m usually okay with being alone but itâ€™s not fun being alone when you have no choice but to be alone because nobody wants to see you. I guess Iâ€™m just not a fun person like I used to be. Nothing is fun anymore, I have nothing, I think it would be better just to die sometimes. Maybe I wasnâ€™t a good enough friend to make them interested enough to stick around, maybe I expect too much from other people, I dont know but itâ€™s all become too terrible lately, havenâ€™t even gotten into my financial situation but that would be too much to type
