well still alive unfortunately.so last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time? still want to attempt again, but I found one thing to live for so I guess ill stay alive.  so yeah.  probably should be going to a hospital but my family has no health insurance and we wouldnt be able to pay. also im higher risk for COVID so i should be staying away from hospitals anyways.
