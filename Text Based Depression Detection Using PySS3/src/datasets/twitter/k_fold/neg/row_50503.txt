Sigh, Why does everyone have to like me, I want to be antisocial.My past life has been weird so im trying to start new. Lately I havent given a fuck, and ive been letting go. I dont care what I say to people (except at work, I have to see those people everyday and i need a job) but that seems to make people like me more. I joke around a lot, really cool chill toker, super smart (compared to many of the people I meet) kind, just a cool dude. But at the same time I dont want to be with people anymore. I use to be ENFJ, and I changed somehow to INTP, which Im really similar too. I think I switch between the two, which fucks up a lot of things. Im not depressed now, i might be going crazy though. I have no one to talk to, person to person. Ive tried to get peoples attention but it doesnt work. Anyway, Im just trying to sort things out and see what you guys think, your responses help clear my mind. Its like a huge bowl of words and I have to pick them just right.
