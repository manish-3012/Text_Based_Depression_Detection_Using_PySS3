I lost the only value in my life.My gf died from sudden exacerbation of her disease. She couldn't call ambulance and I've not even been near her when that happened. It all was so sudden. We talked to each other literally in hour before this happened. No one ever knew that our last meeting was THE last.

It's not only the matter of romance, love and tenderness between us. She was simply the best, the smartest and the most unique person I've ever knew. She was literally the only human in my life with whom I had so much pleasure talking to, to talk about absolutely anything, even before I fell in love with her. I was engaged in self-development, started learning foreign languages and red many books just to be in par with her. She was making me better.

Now she is gone. I did my best for her funeral and helping her parents, and now I'm contemplating the life and find no further purpose in it. It is bleak, boring and full of despair. I just can't do anything now. 

I went through reactive depression, and now I'm recovering, but I still can think of no reason to live further. I'm too weak for suicide, yet I'm thinking of it - even logic-wise, not only emotional-wise -  more and more frequently. Can there be any reason to live, except for "she would want you to live" that absolutely all my relatives told to me? 

Sorry for my English.
