it's fucked butI have been thinking about killing myself for literal years, probably jumping off a bridge it something. Hearing about Etika annoys me, not because of what he did or anything, but because I live in the same area. I could literally walk to the East River. but if I did something drastic, it would become a static about suicide rates increasing when it's reported about.

my heart goes out to him and his family and his fans, but it's screwed up my plans and I can't pretend to not be just a little annoyed about it....
