I've let go, but I feel too guilty to take myself away from my family...I've lost hope in myself, realized a few years ago that I'm hopelessly useless.  My parents still love me very much though and strongly resisted when I told them I am going to kill myself.

\*sigh\*

I feel like I've got one foot in the grave already... There's no hope for me; no point in going on.  I feel jealous when I hear about deaths in the family / on tv.  Why do I feel such guilt at leaving my parents behind?  At some point, shouldn't I have the right to just be at peace?
