Emptiness keeps filling meWhatever I'm doing, or wherever I am, this feeling keeps coming back to me. Every time. It feels as if these feelings of wanting to die and thinking low of myself are just following me and weighing me down. So close behind me it feels like breath coming upon my neck, reminding me what is behind.  


I need help, and I don't know what to do. I need friends...
