Maybe it's better for everyone that I'm gone.I plan to kill myself tonight. I'm giving up everything now. People tell me I'm still young, but is it really normal to feel horrible and have deep hatred towards myself? I tried everything, to be better, to give care but most of the times It gets worst. I hurt people unintentionally, I'm incapable of loving and giving care for others, all I think is about myself like what kind of face should I put today when I wake up, should I do this or that, forcing myself to live for others but at the same time being selfish, I've thought about myself more than others for them but it turns out that it just hurts them. Everything in my life is forced and I don't know what's right and what's wrong anymore. Fuck therapist and suicide hotlines. The world is fucked up and so am I.
