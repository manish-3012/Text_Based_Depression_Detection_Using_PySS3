I'm depressed. I'm worthless. Ending my life would be the only smart thing ive ever done.I'm an awful person. Ive been a burden on so many people through the years. Jumping job to job looking for something I didnt hate, only to find that doesnt exist. I gave up opportunities and jumped ship to a new exciting place that was exactly the same. And now here i am. My job is worthless. 20 hours a week that is all going to my dr bills. My dad is supporting me, sure I lifted him out of debt when he was about to lose everything, but ive taken so much more than what ive given. I have contributed nothing to this world. Ive only consumed. I dont want to try to get back to where i was in life, because i hated it when i was there. I want to die. I deserve to die. Its so beyond hopeless anymore. It feels like there is no tomorrow. I think its finally time to do what i shouldve done years ago.

I dont want to run away and start anew, because i dont like the way the world works. I just fucking cant accept that happiness needs to be fought for, not something we just have inside us. People tell me their worldviews, and I cant comprehend it. I hate this world. I love my family. I dont want to be around to lose them. I guess that makes me selfish and lazy. But that doesnt surprise me. I am a piece of shit after all. 

Like Bill Burr said, some people simply dont deserve to be here. Im one of them.
