I just want to kill myself with AnesthesiaGoing out by jumping off a building or by overdosing on drugs is just way too risky (Plus, I don't want to do drugs). The easiest way possible is to go out is by injecting Anesthesia in a hospital through supervision of doctors, but my mother does not respect my freedom and does not want me to end it and finally feel at peace, she thinks that I am this amazing guy with great qualities (lol). I hate life, I hate my body, three years of depression. I hate college, and I have no friends. I hate the Internet because I get called a retard by people even though they lose arguments against me, and the insults genuinely hurt, people are just vicious. Also, shadow banning is a thing, so even on the Internet I don't feel comfortable posting anything. I don't feel like I have accomplished my purpose in this pathetic life.
