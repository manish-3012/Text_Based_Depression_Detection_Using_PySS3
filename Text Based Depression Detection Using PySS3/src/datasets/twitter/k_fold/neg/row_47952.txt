Why the hell is it so hard to commit suicideWhy the hell is it so hard to commit suicide, even when its planned perfectly. I cannot believe it I am such a failure I cannot even kill myself after 4th try. I wanted to donate my organs, so started to inhale nitrogen and asked an asshole to call ER after 30 mins, instead he fucking saved me and got me admitted in the hospital. Why are humans so weakâ€¦I thought, though my life was useless atlease my death will bring some meaning to my fucked up life, I guess that is not going to happen. I really wish someone will just kill me. There is no use in living a worthless life. I will try try again until I succeed.
