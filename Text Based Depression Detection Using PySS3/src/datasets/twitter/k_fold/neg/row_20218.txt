ConfusedI hate how I think, Iâ€™m very negative, and itâ€™s as if I donâ€™t want to get better. I have someone to talk to but when they say you need to love yourself and accept things, for some reason I canâ€™t. The way I think is like Iâ€™m trapped in my own mind, my mind has convinced me Iâ€™m not even going to be successful in life. Sometimes I feel like Iâ€™m making myself feel the way I do but I donâ€™t know why anyone would want to do that. Itâ€™s more to hating my mind as well, I cannot even look at myself naked for a long period of time or I just feel disappointed. Thereâ€™s a lot more to it that I feel is wrong with me but I just want to know, Does anyone else feel this way?
