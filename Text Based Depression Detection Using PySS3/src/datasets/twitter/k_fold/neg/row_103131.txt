I cant wait to be doneEverything triggers my suicidal thoughts. I constantly imagine myself dead to the point where I have a pretty clear idea of how all the ppl in my life would find out. Every stressful situation makes my mind go straight to downing my meds. 5 years of this shit and it's not gonna stop anytime soon.

I dont see myself doing anything but damn does it get tempting sometimes and I'm really going through it rn ðŸ˜”âœŠ
