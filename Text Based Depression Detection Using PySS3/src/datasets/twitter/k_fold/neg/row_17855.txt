One more time...Hey there. I'm back again. And more suicidal than ever. I don't even know what's setting me off so bad I just.. I don't know anymore. 

Every night I open my window and remove the screen and sit on the windowsill with my legs dangling 2 stories over the wood deck. The temptation is so great I just don't know why I haven't done it already. My boyfriend I suppose but he's not very understanding about that and it's hard to talk about. 

My self harming has gotten much worse too. Again, not even sure why. I just feel absolutely useless and hopeless and worthless and just terrible all around. I've been off antidepressants for... 7 months. Things weren't different with them. Just as shitty and as much of a struggle. 

Anyways. I'm not too sure what to do with myself if these thoughts don't go away. I just keep thinking how simple it could be and how much happier everyone else would be. Please don't deny that. I know it's true. Anyways. 

Goodluck loves.
