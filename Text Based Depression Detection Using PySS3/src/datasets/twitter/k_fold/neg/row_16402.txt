Almost 40 and my life has no meaningI have all the pieces and yet I feel empty. I worked very hard and graduated college. I have a good job, husband, home, community, friends and family. I do charity work and volunteer. I have hobbies, children and pets. Yet my life feels numb and meaningless. I feel guilty because I have things people want and I should be happy. I am grateful but I still donâ€™t feel like Iâ€™m supposed to. I never feel like I fit in or belong anywhere. I think about suicide all the time. What is wrong with me?
