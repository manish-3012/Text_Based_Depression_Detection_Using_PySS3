I think I need helpI am unsure of the state of my mental stability but every few months I keep trying to think of ways to kill myself but something wont let me and I don't really know what it is. Honestly it feels embarrassing to go back and forth with emotions like this. Right now I am in a state of confusion and feel that my mood and emotions grow more and more unpredictable on a dangerous level. don't know what to do
