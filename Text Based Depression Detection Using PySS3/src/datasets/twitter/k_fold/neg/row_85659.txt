i got my drivers license on tuesday and am probably going to kill myself with iti think im a good driver. but when i drove home last night in the rain, i didnt go under 70 the whole ride. tonight i was doing a 80 down the dirt road, and i skidded and hit a sign. im okay. i was driving on the opposite side of the road. 

i really want to be dead. im scared now, because i have a dent in my car. but i got what i wanted. i got in a crash. i wish that i had rolled the car or something. or hadn't had a seat belt. i want to be dead so badly. im really lonely and shitty. im sorry, i just wanted to tell someone.
