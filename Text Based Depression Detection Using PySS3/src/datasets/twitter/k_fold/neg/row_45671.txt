I broke down last nightI'm so tired of feeling gross and worthless.

I'm tired of carrying the weight of rape, neglect, abuse and general feelings of worthlessness.

My bf talking to a beautiful woman shouldn't derail me so hard. But it does because she's so interesting.

She's so tall and long and thin and beautiful and WHITE
Why does she get to be white.

I sit here 300 pounds and he says he loves me and thinks I'm beautiful and he helped me through the breakdown but he lies probably.
I look in the mirror and how could anyone love what I see there.
Its so gross. I'm a vile and disgusting creature.

She looks so romantic.
Long brown hair, cute little face. Cute outfit. Nothing i could ever hope to look good in.

I want to disappear. I'm used up, molested and raped and disgusting and worthless. I'm this ugly brown pile of excrement.

I found an old razorblade in one of my storage boxes.

It smiled at me.

I wish I could just run away and die slowly.


So much guilt



I'm trying, I'm trying to curve my thoughts, to eat better.
But i still have to live in this decaying husk of a person.

I don't want to be ugly anymore
I just want to be dead
