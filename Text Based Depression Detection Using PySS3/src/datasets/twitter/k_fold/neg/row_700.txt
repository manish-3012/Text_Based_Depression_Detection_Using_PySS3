Is it worth itI donâ€™t remember a time in my life where Iâ€™ve ever been truly happy or content. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s worth fighting the battle anymore. I keep hearing things about why I should stay alive, but they all feel shallow and none of the reasons feel like theyâ€™re for myself. Iâ€™m just tired of it. Maybe self care is suicide.
