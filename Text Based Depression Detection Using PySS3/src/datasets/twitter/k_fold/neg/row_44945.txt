I'm going to kill myselfWell, this is it. This is my end. I really don't know what to say. I'm 15, intelligent, gay, and deeply depressed. I'm so desperate that I'm seeking solace on reddit, on the internet. I find no reason to live anymore. There is one path I am on, and I really don't see a way off it. Don't tell me the bullshit: "things get better". They never do! Every single time I've fallen into the same hole, and It's too painful to keep trying to build myself up just to get knocked down to where I started. Maybe someone will see this..... probably not.
