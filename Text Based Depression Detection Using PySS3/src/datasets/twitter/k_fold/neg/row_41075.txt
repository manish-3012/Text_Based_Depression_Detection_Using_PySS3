Fragile?I may sound ungrateful, but a part of me really wants to get it over with. I haven't been able to get in touch with any counselor or therapist because I don't think my parents believe in depression. I don't think my parents will be able to talk to me about it without scolding me. 
Since I was a child,  I was cultured and praised. They were overprotective to the point where I now realized I may have been robbed from a part of my life. I never had an identifiable "personality", I am afraid to admit my preferences (because of fearing rejection), and I am completely ignorant to the world. This made me feel powerless. I took a glance in the world around me and thought to myself that I am actually not what my parents think I supposed to be. It feels as if I don't own my life yet. But when will I start to live if I already want to die now? 
I have been contemplating. Some days feels like I am ready. Like I can just easily throw myself out the balcony. My body feels light and is not constantly in pain. But a part of myself is holding on to something. I don't really know what it is. As of this moment, I have that kind of feeling. I am so confused and I wish I could talk to someone. I guess this'll suffice for now...
