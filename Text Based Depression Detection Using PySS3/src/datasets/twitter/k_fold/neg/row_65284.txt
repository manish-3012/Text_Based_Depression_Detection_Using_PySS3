I don't know why..I don't know why every time I'm walking on the side of the road I hope for a car to hit me. I don't know why every time I'm cooking in the kitchen I think about slitting my wrists. I don't know why every time I'm alone I think about how awful I am. I think about how I'm not good at anything. I think about how I can't be myself with anyone. I don't know why I feel alone in a room full of people. I don't know why I feel sad when I am so lucky. I don't know why my heart pounds at the stupidest of situations. I don't know why I feel alone.
