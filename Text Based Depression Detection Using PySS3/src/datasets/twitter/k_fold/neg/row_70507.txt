Why can't I just die alreadyI'm 22, been depressed for most of the recent years and even though I have a decent career and keep moving forward, inside I'm a fucking lonely mess and want to die. When I think of how little keeps me from putting the knife in the kitchen to my veins inside of this empty apartment I get goosebumps.
