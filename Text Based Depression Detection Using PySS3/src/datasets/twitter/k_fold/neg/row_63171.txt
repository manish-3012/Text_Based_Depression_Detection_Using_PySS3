why bother living when i dont make a difference deadcurrently 1230am in singapore as im writing this, but my life is fucking horrible right now. i cant sleep because of all the thoughts im having. im in school, i have very little friends, and i dont even talk to them now. i cant make new friends, i literally just dont fit in. i went through a sort of an emo/depression for attention phase a few years ago, and now i see how much of a piece of shit i was. pretending to be in pain just to get attention, and now im actually in pain. i dont like venting to people irl because it just feels embarassing. i cant talk to anyone. everyones fucked up here. i had a friend who pretends to have depression, just like me except hes using it as an excuse for not doing homework, not paying me back, and other shit. i cant even work out anymore, and it was one of my favorite things to do. i used to go into the mirror to flex and just be proud of my progress but i cant even look at myself because i lost all that progress due to lack of motivation to work out or even play video games like i usually do. i would spend almost a whole day straight just on my pc but now i cant even be bothered to turn it on because it just feels so boring. i dont do what i used to love doing anymore. i used my hobbies as an excuse not to be depressed but now i dont even like my hobbies. i cant sleep at night anymore. my family hates me, my parents have never once said that they love me. the only real friends i have, i havent even met in real life. they probably wouldnt care if i just disappeared. all we do is play video games and one day we will all play our last game anyways. i dont know why i should live. if i dont matter alive then who cares if im dead. i cant even fucking cry properly anymore, just a few tears then thats done. if anyone just gives me a hug ill probably cry my lungs out. ive never had a hug for almost 7 years.
