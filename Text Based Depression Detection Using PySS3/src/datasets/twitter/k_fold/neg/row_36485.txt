Why is life so difficult?I dropped out of University several years ago and on Friday I got an e-mail from a legal company saying I owed the uni a years tuition of about Â£3,000. After dropping out of uni I had no friends and no job so I ended up at my dad's and have spent the last two years in a menial job that I can't stand and spend my days off without the energy to try and do anything to improve my situation and getting further into debt. The last few weeks I've been starting to consider suicide again and don't see any reason not to.

TL:DR In debt, suddenly owe more and don't make enough to pay it back. No life, no friends, all seems pointless.
