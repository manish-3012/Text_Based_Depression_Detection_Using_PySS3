Why bother...This will be the 2nd time I've brought up my thoughts of suicide anonymously... First time was on Omegle probably a week ago, now I'm posting here.

I've had the urge to kill myself for much longer, obviously, and it's just been this past week where it's almost getting too much to handle. Normally, I can just tell myself no, I'm not going to do it, but it's getting harder and harder.

My depression has been getting worse too. Lately I've been sleeping for more than 12 hours a day and eating maybe once a day. I've had problems caring about handing in projects for my classes, or even going to classes. Two weeks ago I just stayed home for the week. I told everyone that I was sick, but I guess that wasn't really a lie. 

My struggle with depression probably started in grade 8 or 9. The friends I was hanging out with before all went to gangs and were just general shitheads. I realized that, and moved away from them. But I didn't really make friends again until I was in grade 12 (for the 2nd time). After our first semester in university though, I started drifting away from them. Right now I can only call 4 people friends. Although, I never see them. I never see anyone. Almost every waking moment I have I spend it in front of the computer, because there's nothing else to do.

I've tried talking to therapists, I've tried taking antidepressants (Wellbutrin), and I've tried smoking pot hoping it would just make me happy. It didn't, nothing really has.

I'm not sure what I'm doing telling everyone here this, but I figure I'll try anything right now.
