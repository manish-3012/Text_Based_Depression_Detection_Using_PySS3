No phone service and need to talk to someone as soon as possible.To long to type about but stuff has changed in my dad recently and I don't know what. He's basically thrown me to the curb without saying why. He's started treating his other son like royalty whilst I'm getting burnt on the back burner. He's recently rejected my offer to see him on Father's Day. But spent the whole time with my brother at a dive bar. There's a lot more. But to make this shirt I have no cellular service because I pay through him. But he's said no to me meeting up with him to pay him the past four times I wanted to. Including Father's Day, he read my text but ignored it. Even though he went out to dinner with the rest of my siblings.
Basically, what is one suicide prevention service I can get in touch with right now? I have no service or computer but my god I'm so hurt right now and need one person. Just one. But I have no service and I'm breaking down. Please help me.
