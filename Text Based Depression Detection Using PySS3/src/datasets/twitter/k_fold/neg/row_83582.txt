SleepI dont like posting this stuff. I dont know you, none of you know me. But i have no one to talk to. I want to sleep more. Recently ive been sleeping more and more, but ive started dreaming a lot, and i dont like the things i dream about. I just want to sleep and have there be nothing. Nothing at all. Pure peace.
