i'm not sure how to cope anymoreAbout a month ago, My long time boyfriend killed himself. 

He had been my best friend since 8th grade and had helped me through so much dealing with my abusive and narcissistic grandmother that i grew up with. He didn't so any signs and when i was told by his mother that he was dead.

 It was like my world just froze and i couldn't breath. We were suppose to do some much together. move in together, 

get married and travel together and now we can't because he's gone. 

I've been having such a hard time without him around. I'm not even sure what to do anymore.
