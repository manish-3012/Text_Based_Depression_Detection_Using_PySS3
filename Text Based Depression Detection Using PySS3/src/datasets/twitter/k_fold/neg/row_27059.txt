I feel bad even saying anything hereWhat really pisses me off is the idea of being gone and everyone being so upset. Probably saying things like, "Why didn't she tell me?" Or, "We loved her so much."

None of you can even show me a miniscule amount of respect. You could really care less than I'm breathing. It infuriates me that I will have no dignity in death. That my body would become your property to dispose of. My life something you have a final say on. 

You don't give a shit about me, you have no right to be sad about me being gone.
