I can't live with being a disappointment anymoreTomorrow is my 21st birthday and I don't deserve to be alive or to live the life I have. I have had all the tools to succeed and do well in life but I've never accomplished anything. 

I'm tired of being a failure. I can't maintain relationships, I struggle in school. I can barely function and my parents don't deserve that. They are getting a cake for me tomorrow, but for what? I have done anything with my life and I never will. I'm an adult? Not even close. 

I don't deserve any of this. I don't deserve to be alive. I just want to stop existing.
