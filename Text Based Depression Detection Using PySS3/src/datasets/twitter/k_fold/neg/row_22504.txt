Dad is taking me to the hospital tomorrowWhat good will they do? I've been taken there once 3-4 weeks ago because I was considering taking my life that night, I was texting my mom who convinced me to call the crisis hotline, they sent two workers over, one became frustrated with me, cops and the ambulance came, I had to choose one, I went to the hospital, they left me in a room for two hours, then checked my vitals asked me how I felt then, I said ok and stable, they let me go at 6am, I forgot my bag at home, walked forty minutes in the cold in a tshirt, no key to my house, I broke in through my unlocked window, texted my mom I was home, went to sleep. 

I don't live with my parents but housemates, I see my momma about three times a year and my dad every other week. They're separated, Dad remarried so I have a stepmom. I have a younger sister who hates me because I'm not someone she wants as a sister. To my parents I'm quite honestly a mistake im not supposed to be here. That and a whole lotta shit I'm sick of is why I'm getting sent to the hospital and idk what I need in life. I'm tired. It would be easier for me if I was dead.
