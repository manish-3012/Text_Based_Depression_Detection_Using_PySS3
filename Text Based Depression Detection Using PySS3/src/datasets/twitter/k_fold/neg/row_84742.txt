Iâ€™m readyIâ€™ve isolated myself from all my online friends. They wonâ€™t even notice that Iâ€™m gone. Iâ€™m ready to do it and I have nothing other than my parents stopping me. I just wanna call the cops then hang myself while theyâ€™re off to work so they donâ€™t have to find my body. I donâ€™t wanna put them through that trauma.
