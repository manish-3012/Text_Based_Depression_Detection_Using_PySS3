Please help me feel better. (Dad issues)So my father clearly doesnt like me compared to my brothers and sister. They usually waste a bunch of money and cant really support themselves(they all live away from home) and the second i spend money my dad questions me and gets stressed and confused with me and he always becomes yelly amd raises his voice and when i say "please stop yelling" he gets angry and says hes not. the thing is this has been going on my hole life (i am 17) and i have never developed a strong social relationship woth my dad unless hes arguing with me. It makes my head hurt and sometimes it makes me hurt so much that i literally dont want to live amymore. I have tried to commit suicide 7 times and all were practically influenced by him. Here are some things that may be factors to why my relationship with my dad is bad.

Im not a crazy athlete like he was: sure i do sports i just am not incredibly great at them like he was. I feel like he really likes sports far more than i do as i am also involved in the arts.

I am more softspoken than he is: as i said he is a very yelly person coming from some annoying part of new jersey. I was raised in a very normal town in New York.

Half brothers: my dad divorced his other wife which left him apart from my two brothers. Because of this he spent more time with my brothers than with me as an infant and little kid. I love my brothers to death but its very noticeable how much stronger their relationship is with my dad.

I am not very confident: i have never been. My dad has always been. Something he may not understand

I know this all sounds pretty teen angsty and i try to tell myself that it could be worse but i still feel the same way. Maybe its me being an asshole i have no idea. Thanks for reading this and thanks for responses
