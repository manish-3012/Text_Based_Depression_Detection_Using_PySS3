Thinking about suicide. Alot.Hello.
Ive never posted on Reddit and rarely ever peruse the site. Im not particularly ugly or attractive. I have had several girlfreiends and im 24. I hangout with alot of friends and my family life is great. The problems im facing seem lesser to others that post here. Im sorry if this is a waste of time but i have nobody real to open up to. Several times in the past week ive been ready to end it all. I really have no articulate reason as to why. I just feel like i dont wanna live anymore. I understand its hard to help someone without any problems, but thats the problem. I feel this way even when my life is going great. I can only imagine what ill feel like when the tide shifts.
