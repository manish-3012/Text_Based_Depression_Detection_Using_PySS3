I don't knowI don't really know, I feel really empty. My thoughts are all about how everything ends. How nothing really matters. I just don't really care about anything  I do, how insignificant I am compared to anything. I see how everyone's lives are more lively and cheerful. Whilst I feel empty. I occupy myself with selfless thoughts, because most thoughts about myself just leads to a really deep morbid conclusion. 

I don't wanna do it, but sometimes I just feel like it. I don't want anyone to worry. If I disappear my parents, especially my mom would break her heart. I just wish that I was filled. Happy, but no the endless thoughts of end, and how nothing matters just occupies most of my thoughts through my daily life. What I will do in the future might not happen at all. I might die. Nothing really matters.

This feeling might just comedown to stress and unbalanced chemical composition of my brain. That's what I keep convincing myself, to keep going. But sometimes, it just doesn't help. I don't know anymore. I don't wanna be here at all, but I don't wanna hurt anyone, or break anyone.  I don't want to make people feel bad, I just don't know..
