Angry at the worldOff the bat, I know my username is odd for here, but for what I normally use it for, it gets straight to the point so if you donâ€™t want to see that stuff, donâ€™t go on my profile.

Iâ€™m a 23 year old living in the UK. On paper, my life is good. Educated to masters level, family are great and loving, and it all still feels pointless. Since I finished my education, Iâ€™ve been looking for work and getting rejected from absolutely anything relevant to my qualifications. Of course, everyone would feel â€˜downâ€™ from something like this, but it stems much deeper. I have no work experience, because I never expected to be alive past 20. I did a masters cause I didnâ€™t know what else to do in my life and now thatâ€™s finished, I have absolute no fucking clue.

This is just the final straw in my pointless fucking existent. All I want to do is either kill myself or move to the middle of absolutely no where I can In irrelevancy for the rest of my days. I am sick of living in this world where I have not had the tiniest bit of luck in my existence. The one person I truly love does not love me back, Iâ€™ve had fuck all fortune professionally or personally, itâ€™s past the point of a joke
