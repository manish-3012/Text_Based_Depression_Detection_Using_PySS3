I canâ€™t stop thinking about ending my life (story added)I really have no one to talk about this with because a lot of people are effected by it. Two of my best friends killed themselves in 2017, and although I feel incredibly selfish, all I have wanted to do is end my own life. I canâ€™t tell others because of how selfish it really is, and I know how badly it effects others. But at this point, they can get over it. Iâ€™m not a priority in anybodyâ€™s life. My boyfriend broke up with me, I fuck up everything good for me, and I live a life filled with misery due to my overthinking. For an entire year Iâ€™ve been suicidal and I have tried everything to try to cope with the unbearable depression and anxiety. For 7 years Iâ€™ve dealt with a somewhat bearable diagnosis of depression and anxiety. Iâ€™ve tried all different kinds of therapy and I know it takes time, but itâ€™s all been a complete waste of time even with a positive outlook. Iâ€™ve been on medicine for months, and the only thing it has helped with is my anger, and completely making me numb. I used to be a 4.0 student, and now Iâ€™m failing all my classes because I truly canâ€™t see a point to anything. We all die right? Either kill yourself or get killed. Nothing matters in the end. I canâ€™t even do things that used to make me happy because they do not make me happy anymore. So why live a life with no meaning and with no drive to create a meaning? I believe this life isnâ€™t for me, and maybe my soul can find its meaning somewhere in this universe. But here, on this earth, I have no meaning. I find myself drunk most nights to rid myself of fear, because of course Iâ€™m scared of dying. But wow there is not a single point in living anymore, so why prolong the inevitable? Iâ€™m just trying to vent because this is the only place I can, so any advice will surely help
