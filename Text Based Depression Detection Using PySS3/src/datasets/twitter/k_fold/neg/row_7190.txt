82,000 of us at peak sorrowMy Reddit family has been a strength when needed.  

We love and want love 

When at our peak, go to the hospital. 

After a while they are not effective. We are not stupid, if we want to do something and can wait. 

Pills are not perfect. Helpful not perfect. 

Support and understanding without judgement is what we want. 

Where is our haven to have us battle?

We have the answers and passion to help, where is our clubhouse?

Why does our pain get attention in our text and not global support?

Over 82,000 in distress
