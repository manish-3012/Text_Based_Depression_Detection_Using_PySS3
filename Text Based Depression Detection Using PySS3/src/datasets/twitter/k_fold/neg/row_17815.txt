I don't know how to feel any other wayI guess exactly what the title says. For a really, really long time all I've felt was misery or emptiness or anxiety and the constant overwhelming desire to end it all. I don't know how to talk to people, I always just brush things off as a joke or downplay how serious things are. I've attempted in the past and the only thing stopping me now if how it'll affect the people I care about (especially my family who lost another son a year ago today). But living for no reason besides feeling obligated to just makes everything feel worse. I don't know if I can take it much longer
