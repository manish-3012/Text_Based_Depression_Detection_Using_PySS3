I'm alive because I'm a useless idiotI used to have this elaborate suicide plan, because the only way I could go through with it is if it was painless and certain and wouldn't give me a chance to back out because I'm a coward.

I found a cheap one and I was going to buy it, but I moved to another state a while back and never got a new driver license. Apparently if the address on your license isn't accurate they want another government issued document like a vehicle title, registration, etc... all things that I've been putting off because of my fucking anxiety
