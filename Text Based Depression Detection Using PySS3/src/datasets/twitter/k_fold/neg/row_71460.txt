breaking up with my gf so she's not sadI feel like she deserves better and I dont wanna bring her down with me

I just want her to hate me and I dont want her to be sad if I kms. I'm considering doing it tmrw but I don't know how to say it. Part of me wants to be mean and harsh so she hates me but part of me also wants to tell her how much i love her. I don't want her to blame herself if I do die. I'm so confused does anyone have any advice
