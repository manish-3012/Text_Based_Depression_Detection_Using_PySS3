Please, I need help so badlyI have never used reddit a day in my life aside from looking at weird horror/creepy shit.

I am not going to give specifics but I have a chronic disease and am in pain very close to 24/7 ....... the level of pain varies. I am severely limited. I am s*x repulsed due to past traumatic experiences. I couldn't keep up with friends due to pain and mental illness, therefore losing them. Every ex has snapped and left me, they couldn't take it anymore. Don't you think I can't take it either? Especially now? Completely alone? Abused and neglected by family? Are you fucking serious? I don't even know if I'll live through the rest of this year. Just disgusting. I can't believe everyone has turned their back to let me die.

I'm in my mid 20s. Maybe I just need some fucking friends. I am very often bed bound or toilet bound. It is absolute misery. Sometimes I feel like I'm being s*xually assaulted with a knife. It's just downright horrible.

I dont want to be like this anymore. This isnt living. Its existing in agony. I'll take hell over this. Please. Let me die.
