I used to find comfort in suicide but now Iâ€™m scaredFor me it was always thought if life becomes too unbearable then thereâ€™s always a way out. Well life was indeed become unbearable and things are getting worse. What was just an idea is now becoming a real possibility. Iâ€™m scared that I feel this way but no matter what I do Iâ€™m always suffering and canâ€™t shake these thoughts in my head. Thereâ€™s just no light at the end of the tunnel and I feel like Iâ€™ll be stuck in this dark place forever
