Fighting a battle I can't winFighting clinical depression is like delaying the inevitable. I'm most likely going to commit suicide one day, it might be 20 years from now...but it's probably going to happen.

Noone even takes it seriously: "it's because you don't excercise enough", "it's because you're getting little and irregular sleep", "it's because you eat too unhealthy". I can't take care of my responsibilities, I'm barely interested in my personal hobbies and interests, and often need to force myself to do them.

Having ADHD makes all of this infinitely worse and hopeless.
