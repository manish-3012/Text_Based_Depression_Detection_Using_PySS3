Know for a fact she's sleeping with him. Tonight's a good a night as any.Decided tonight might be the night, I went in my ex's room looking for something yesterday and accidentally wound up finding her stash of condoms. I went ballistic, I cut myself everywhere, I drank myself into a blackout, and I called her at 4:00AM crying and I have no idea what I really said. What I want to know is, WHY is it not a good idea for me to die? What POSSIBLE thing do I give back to society? I'm a fucking ceramic major, she always told me how useless of a major that is. I've dropped out of college because of her, and I'm becoming an alcoholic because of her. I'm so happy for her that she can fuck, and go about her day without a care to me and I can't stop thinking about her and how much I want her back. She's told me some bullshit about how "If you kill yourself, then I would kill myself out of grief" Well fat fucking chance that's happening, what will happen is she'll maybe feel bad for a couple days, then go back to her guy and do what they've been doing. She'll forget about me, in fact this may make it easier for her, she want's to forget about me. I think I will tonight.
