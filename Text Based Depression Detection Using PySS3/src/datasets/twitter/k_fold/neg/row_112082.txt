I can't tell if I'm finally dying or not but I feel badI'm a 15 y/o female who has been struggling with depression and anxiety for around 4-3 years now. I was recently diagnosed with OCD and my psychiatrist has been thinking I might be developing bipolar but since I'm so young he isn't too sure about it yet. Last night-ish I decided to take my normal medicine prazosin, fluvoxamine and sertraline(more than I should have with that) and then took a lot of gaunfacine that I had left over from when I was prescribed it for anxiety but then taken off of it cause it cause my new one didn't want me on ADHD medicine. Sound has become really distorted, I feel like I'm in a weird outer body state, my vision seems awful and I don't know if I should tell my mom to take me to the hospital. Part of me wants to let myself die but the other part wants me to go to the hospital to make sure I don't leave my best friend/boyfriend.
