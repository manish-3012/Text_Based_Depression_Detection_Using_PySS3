add on from last posta bit ago, I cried hardcore about life and felt miserable but now iâ€™m listening to paramore and feel like nothing ever happened ?? I donâ€™t get how fast my emotions switch up.

Last night it was the same thing, crying and having negative thoughts but then idk what I did after and immediately felt okay after.

One mental breakdown, I was laying in my stuffed animals crying under my blankets to sad songs and â€œfreak the freak out - from victorious â€œ came on accidentally, then I started laughing and stopped crying????
