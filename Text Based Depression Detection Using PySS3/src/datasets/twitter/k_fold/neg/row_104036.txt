My Mother is unfair and is making me suicidalSo, for context, on my birthday last year, my mom completely forgot, I never brought it up, since she has a tendency of screaming at me. So, my brother brithday was a few days ago? Guess what he got? He is 11, he got a 1,300 dollar computer, how wonderful. And now, she is making me do airsoft, which, I am not a gun guy and tbh, I am a very sore loser, but, im not sure it matters anymore. I think ill have to stab my eyes out or break my legs for her to actually listen to me for once, since I've told her I dont want to do it for about 5 days now.
