Life just isn't worth living without herCall me dumb, whatever you want. I just don't see a point to living without my girl. And she left me. It's been two years. Constant drug abuse, whatever I could find. Opiates, alcohol, psychedelics, weed. I don't remember the last time I was sober. I've forgotten who I was, where I was, the people around me, forgotten everything except for her. She's always there. I dream about her every night so I quit sleeping, I get two hours every three days. She's not coming back and I don't want to keep living the way I do, but living the way I do keeps me numb. I hate life without her... I just can't do this anymore
