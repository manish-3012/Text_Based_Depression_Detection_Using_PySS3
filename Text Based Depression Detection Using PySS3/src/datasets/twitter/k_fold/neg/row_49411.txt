I think that having suicidal thoughts is your brain telling you that your lifestyle isnt compatible with your inner valuesReassessing my life and itâ€™s no wonder Iâ€™ve been in the state Iâ€™ve been. People struggle with depression because of extraordinarily complex situations that they canâ€™t control. (And society enforces). I plan on leading a simple lifestyle and building a tiny house somewhere close to nature, once Iâ€™ve saved up enough money. 

People have mental illness because they depend on a society that encourages materialism, short-term gratification, and consumerism. We are all part of a collectivist society that could care less about our individual needs. The only way to be content is to stop searching for fulfillment in this secular world.
