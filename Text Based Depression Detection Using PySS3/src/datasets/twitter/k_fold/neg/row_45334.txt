2nd time thinking about ending it all.I'm a freshman in highschool and this week I have finals and I'm overwhelmed with the work. I have ADHD, depression, and anxiety and my grades are falling apart. My parents are strict on grades and anything below an 80 is punishable. I now have been grounded for my grades and my psychiatrist refuses to up the dosage on my ADHD and Depression meds. My parents can barely afford my medicine as well. I'm just holding my family back and doing nothing but sitting here and existing.
