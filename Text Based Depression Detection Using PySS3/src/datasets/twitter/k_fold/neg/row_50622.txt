My friend is suicidal and I don't know what to do.So one of my Discord friends is extremely depressed and suicidal, he kinda got quiet at first, but recently his dog of 14 years passed away, and I think that pushed him over the edge.   


A few other friends of his and I are trying to figure out what to do, we want to try contacting one of his family members but his name is extremely common, so its hard to narrow it down. We thought about telling the police, but we live in different countries, I'm in Spain, my other friends are American, and he is French, and we don't have anyone else we know in France. One friend does know his address from paypal records, but he wasn't able to find any owner of the house or land. He is still talking so he's alive, but any moment he could end it and we want to stop him.
