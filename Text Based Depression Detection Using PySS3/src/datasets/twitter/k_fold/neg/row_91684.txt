breathe meHello, Iâ€™m turning 16 in less than a month and I feel so hopeless and suicidal. Iâ€™ve felt like this ever since I was 12 and I just realized that I feel no different than the last 4 years. What do I do now? I told myself every year that the next year would be better yet here I am. Itâ€™s getting harder and harder as the days pass by. Iâ€™m getting sick and tired of always wanting to die. I told myself on the night of my 15th birthday that things would be better next year but I feel the exact same. 

I donâ€™t know what to do with myself or my life. Itâ€™s frustrating to feel like this but not know what you need in order to be happy. What if Iâ€™m still â€˜depressedâ€™ even if I acquire what I think will make me happy. Iâ€™m clueless at this point. 

The only reason I havenâ€™t done anything to myself yet is because of my family. I love them too much. But in the meantime, Iâ€™m still trapped inside my emotions and insecurities. Iâ€™m in here. I need help. I need a friend.
