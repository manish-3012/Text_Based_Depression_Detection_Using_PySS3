how my life got flipped upside downthis is my first post so take it easy plz.

at the time i was almost thirteen just starting in year seven. my first day back was pretty good but then it started go to down hill from there as soon as i got home i got a phone call from my dad (my parents are divorced but i see my dad every weekend) i pick up the phone and my dad sounded a little angry which i had no idea why but he asked to talk to my mum so i passed the phone over and then they did some talking yelling cuss words. eventually she hangs up on him and says to me that my stepsister had accused me of sexual assualt which i had no idea what it was. but she said my dad wanted to kill me for "raping" his daughter which scared the fuck outta me becasue when my dad gets angry it gets pretty bad. i had the rest of the week off of school (becasue we went to the same school) which eventually ended up in me not seeing my dad for a month or so which i somewhat liked becasue he was a dick to me everytime a came over. it was somewhat calm but gave me really bad anxiety which then gave me some depression. ff to next year and i had just started high school and it was alot different than i had expected which made my anxiety a bit worse and then i started selfharming which someone at school told a teacher and it ended up getting back to my mum which turns out wasn't that bad but even with the help i had got i started to try and kill myself but make it look like an accident e.g. not looking when crossing obviously busy roads and taking a shit ton of painkillers but noting happened so i gave up with that and started cutting very bad almost had to go to the hospital for a few of them. Thanks for reading.
