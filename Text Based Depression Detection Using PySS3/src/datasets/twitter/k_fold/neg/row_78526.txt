Hi Iâ€™m 15 years old 2020 is the worst yearWell you know mexico is know by their culture and also for their cartels I used to live in Sinaloa one day my parents told me to pack up my things and I was like but why? They never told me the reason we lived in Jalisco a couple months and one day I heard a lot of gunshots I heard that my dad started leaving the house and couple hours ago my mom told me to turn off my cellphone and when I heard something about my uncle that he died the  cartel killed him , he wasnâ€™t a saint but his own friends betrayed him and killed him   
I was shocked but at the same time didnâ€™t fell nothing I donâ€™t know why in the same month I receive the news that my cousin my childhood cousin was killed by the cartel too I was shocked but again didnâ€™t fell nothing I started thinking about my self and my life a lot of things changed . My dad has always been a jerk literally he told me that he is not going to give me any money when he passed away, he told me that Iâ€™m worthless my life was meaningless etc then he started beating me up today I was eating and he randomly hits me in the stomach and told me that Iâ€™m a mistake I ran to my room I started punching my wall I broke my finger and I have a lot of cuts Iâ€™m my knuckles, my dad has a rifle with bullets in the garage I can easily take it and kill myself but the question of whatâ€™s in the other side of the life (heaven or hell) Iâ€™m Catholic but Iâ€™m really scared I donâ€™t know what to do with my life and also worst things had been happening to my but I can post it in Reddit.
