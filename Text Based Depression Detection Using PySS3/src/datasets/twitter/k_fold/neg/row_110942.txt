My mind is screaming and I want to shut it downI can't even think clearly because my thoughts are just screaming at me and everything is jumbled and chaos. I miss someone and how they used to pretend real well how they cared about me and how I was worth something to them and now I'm just disposal trash. I'll never be loved, I'll never know what it's like to be intimate with someone who actually cares about me. I'll never feel a real hug. I'll never know love but just be tormented by every fuck in a relationship.  
  
  
I just want to die but I'm too afraid of pain, but I just want to end it, please let me end it. Turn it off and let me die. Someone help me die, please.
