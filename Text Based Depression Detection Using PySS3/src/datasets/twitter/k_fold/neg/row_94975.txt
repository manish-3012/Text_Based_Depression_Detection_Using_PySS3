Suicide becomes more attractive everydayI know the signs, inability to focus on positive things, fixation with dying or other depressing things, and I see my self present them more and more.  Recently my suicidal thoughts have gotten much more vivid and real, and for the first time ever last week I began making plans on how I would do it.  This scares the crap out of me because I think that no matter how long I can hold on, I will eventually kill myself; whether its next week or next year.  The only things really stopping me are the pains it would bring to my friends and family, and the possibility of surviving and having to live with the consequences.  I'm not even sure why I posted this here...just had to let someone know I guess.
