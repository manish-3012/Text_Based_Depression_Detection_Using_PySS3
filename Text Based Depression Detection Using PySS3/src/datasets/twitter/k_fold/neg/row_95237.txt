Need some adviceI didn't really know where to go so I just typed in suicide on Reddit to see where I can get to. I have been suicidal for a little while now, I recently decided to go on the suicide prevention lifeline chat. Although I do not know exactly what to say, I have never been to therapy. The thought of it gives me a lot of anxiety. If anyone can help me on how to begin at least or just what to say in the chat in general I would greatly appreciate it.
