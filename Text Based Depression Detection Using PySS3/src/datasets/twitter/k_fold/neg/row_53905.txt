Back again, like alwaysNothing will ever end, and endless cycle. Failed attempt, then just coming back and back forever. Until one day a personâ€™s words on the internet is not enough. But I guess a corpse is fundamentally worth less then a breathing human, it would almost be like saying to the world that I am less than everybody. Less then people who are murderers and have no guilt, less than anyone whatsoever because they are alive and I am dead. But I start to not care, and the clock keeps ticking.
