Perpetually lonely and alienatedI'm not suicidal, but at the same time lately I've just been thinking to myself that I don't want to live. I feel lonely and alienated all the time. My entire childhood, my classmates and the people in my family made me feel like there was something wrong with me. I was made fun of and didn't have very many friends. Then finally from age 20-25 or so I found a good circle of friends and a boyfriend I loved and was happy. Then I fucked it all up by moving to a new country. Now I feel lonely and alienated all the time. I've found friends in this new place, but honestly a lot of the time I feel so much lonelier even after hanging out with them. There are certain types of connections I had with my friends back home that I haven't found with people here. There are also so many times when I try to connect with people and they don't seem like they care. I can't go on like this much longer. If this is all life has to offer me, and I'll never find the kinds of meaningful connections I'm looking for, then I just don't want to live anymore. If I lay in bed and didn't eat or drink anything and never got out again I wonder how long it would take me before I died.
