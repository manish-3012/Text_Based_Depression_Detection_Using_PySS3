Suicidality came back after years of peaceHello...I've struggled with suicidal thoughts since I was 12 years old (I'm 26 now) and self harm since I was as young as 5 or so. It comes back in different forms - sometimes spontaneous attempts, sometimes planned, sometimes just an unbearable need to die. 
But I wanted to ask a particular question: if we're supposed to have a survival instinct as humans, why on earth do I want to die all the time? My therapist tells me to say I want to disappear instead of die, or I want something to cease, or I need a break, etc. But it's always quite precisely wanting to die. I had a good 3 years of barely any self harm or suicidal urges after being in CBT, and I just moved countries and was recently diagnosed with PTSD after a huge breakdown and resurfacing suicidality...
I was just crossing the street and every bridge and rooftop was calling to me. Then there was a bus coming my way. I was on the sidewalk and I lost touch with reality. I had no control over my body and I genuinely had no idea if I moved my body in front of the bus so it runs me over or if I was still standing on the sidewalk. I opened my eyes and realized I was alive.
