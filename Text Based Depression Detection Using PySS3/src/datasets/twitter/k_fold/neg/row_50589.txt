Problem, After ProblemI guess I should start this off by saying that I have no friends. Thereâ€™s literally no one besides my Mother that I can count on. My Dad just calls me when heâ€™s having computer problems, and Iâ€™ve been â€œdisownedâ€ by the majority of the rest of my family for having â€œliberalâ€ views. There are a couple of people that I think feel sorry for me, but they wonâ€™t even hang out anymore.

I have a â€œfiancÃ©e.â€ However, she will occasionally tell me that she â€œdoesnâ€™t love meâ€, and â€œisnâ€™t interested anymore.â€ Sheâ€™s typically angry when she says these things. However, she does mean them, and is vocal about her feelings about them. She essentially bounces back and forth between â€œloving meâ€, and â€œnot having any interest.â€ Therefore I canâ€™t really depend on her either. She may care about me, but sheâ€™s certainly not going to pick me up or support me when â€œIâ€™m down.â€ 

I recently left a job at a horrible company (they told us that they were outsourcing all of our jobs, I was passed up for a raise that I had earned, etcâ€¦), for another job that I like with a company I like. However, Iâ€™m constantly being degraded by a few of my coworkers. Itâ€™s really turned into a nightmare. Iâ€™m making decent money. However, I pretty much want to cry after I leave everyday. Iâ€™ve been called â€œdumbassâ€, among other things. This seems to be a fairly accepted type of behavior there. 

Now youâ€™re going to tell me to keep â€œmy chin upâ€, and that I can always meet a new girl, and that I can make new friends. This isnâ€™t the case. I have very bad social anxiety (I think the jobâ€™s making it worse); therefore Iâ€™m not good in social situations. Which is likely why Iâ€™m in the situation Iâ€™m in at my current job. Iâ€™ve sought treatment. However, the guy I was seeing told me â€œthere was nothing wrong with me.â€ 

Iâ€™m really in a stage where I donâ€™t know what to do. Iâ€™m making money, but I pretty much literally have nothing besides that. 

Iâ€™ve been thinking about suicide pretty much everyday. As itâ€™s really the only way I can see myself ending the disaster my life has turned into.
