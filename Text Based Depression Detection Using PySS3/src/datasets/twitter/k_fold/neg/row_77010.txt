I feel emptyFirst off, I wanted to say how happy I can that something like reddit exists. Seriously, every time when I feel bad, I come here and read some comments. It often makes me feel better afterwards.
For months I know that I'm suffering from Ulcerative Colitis and currently on therapy. (cortisone) Howsoever, since cortisone my life just has been changed completely. I feel ever more depressed than then, all by mself and empty.
The doctor from the hospital told me to reduce the cortisone slowly as I'm getting better. (5 mg step) I've also visited to my gastroenterologist who told me to reduce it at 10 mg step. Because I trust him, I'm taking 30 mg cortisone since Monday now and tonight I just woke up all of a sudden and felt totally nervous. I barely could calm down myself, I was such panicked for no reason and couldn't sleep.
In the morning, it didn't get really much better, so I decided to take 35 mg instead of 30 mg. Not sure if it is pure imagination or not, but I feel somehow better now. Today I went to visit my doctor, but found out that he is on holiday. (so is my gastroenterologist)
Now, I don't know what to do. I'm not sure if I should take 35 mg again tomorrow or just go back to 30 mg. I'm kinda scared that it will start all over again when I go back to 30 mg. It feels like my psyche is wracked and I really really just want to feel a bit better.
I don't know if anyone will read this, I just wanted to share it and try to make myself feel better. I hate that feel, it's making me want to suicide just because of the stupid feeling that is putting me down pretty much. I just can't live with something like that :( I apologize if my English is bad since it's not my first language.

I just can't take it anymore.
