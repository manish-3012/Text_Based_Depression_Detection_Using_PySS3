feeling less every dayI guess my main problem is my borderline personality disorder, it pushes everyone I love away from me. I absolutely hate being alone, my thoughts will just continue in their usual negative spiral about how I am a bad person and hurt everyone around me. How my parents have stepped away and my ex-bf tells me a couple of fake soothing lines a day to help because that is all the sympathy and energy he can muster up for me anymore. I absolutely hate myself. Sure I can be nice but as soon as I feel rejected or unloved (which is usually not rational) I push people away and I do the most awful things. I hate hating myself all the time but lately I've gotten so depressed again that I don't even feel much anymore. The ex has been so cold and distant I can't feel much apart from sensing those feelings from him, making me feel unloved and worthless. And I think I deserve it anyway because I have been abusive to the people close to me in very bad ways. I've talked about suicide so much and attempted twice no one takes me serious anymore. I'm feeling so apathetic and I just don't see the point of failing any goals I set myself over and over again. I suck and even though I seem like oh so nice.. in the end people see me for what I really am and I've probably already ruined a good part of their life or made them miserable by then. I'm not a good person, and I'm just done with hating myself, the more alone I am the easier it seems to end it all. Obviously there is a lot of backstory to this and many of these situations have played themselves over and over. I know I can get help and have reached out in the past week, but it just doesn't seem cut out for me to be more happy than not and I don't see how it's worth it anymore.
