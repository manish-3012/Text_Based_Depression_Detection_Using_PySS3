I want supportI just want support. I want to put my life together. I want to fix my mind. I want to stop being in pain every single moment of my life. But it's just too tiring when you can't even get out of bed. I see some curtain tassels right now staring at me, begging me to pick them up. I could strangulate myself with them, they're pretty thick and strong. (sigh) Life sucks. I wanna die.
