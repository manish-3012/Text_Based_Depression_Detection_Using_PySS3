I can't stand these thoughts and this bodyHi, I'm trans but i have a disease that prevents me from medically transitioning, so I'm trapped in the wrong body for forever. Furthermore I have constant intrusive thoughts that i just can't take any more, I get very violent and sexual thoughts, I would never act on them and it disgusts me that they appear in my head at all, I just want it all to end.
