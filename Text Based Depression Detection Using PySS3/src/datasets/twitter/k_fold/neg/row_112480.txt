I've reached a point where Idk what to do.I've been mentally ill for over 3 years and lately had the courage to seek help and go to therapy. Everything was fine until certain events took place one night and nothing has been the same ever since. There was very little fault of mine for which I lost my girlfriend, she left me. A loving relationship destroyed because of my sickness.
My friends didn't bother to hear me out and assumed that I was the bad guy there. I don't have a single friend in the world as of now, my parents said they'd help me through this but all they do is gas light me. On top of all this, the lockdown is making things worse. 
There are days where I just don't want to wake up anymore, I edge really hard. I want to take my life, I don't see the point in getting better.
Idk if any of this is making sense.
