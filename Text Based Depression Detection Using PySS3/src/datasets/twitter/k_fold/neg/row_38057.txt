Might make a fourth attempt.I hate it here. I left the mental hospital like in the beginning of October for trying to overdose. My family would visit me and tell me they were going to change so I could feel better and actually enjoy my life. I was dumb enough to believe they'd actually change. The first three hours I got there and I was already crying. I was used to my parents fighting, but they had promised not to in front of me anymore. That was a fucking lie. 

Now they're back to calling me "lazy" and "useless". My mom also told me that I wasn't depressed and that it was just me being lazy. My dad tells me I'm a bum and have no future. I don't talk to my best friend about this, because they have a lot on their plate. 

I am 1 month clean, but that's going to change after i post this. I feel so hopeless. Everyday is the same. I just want to be at peace.
