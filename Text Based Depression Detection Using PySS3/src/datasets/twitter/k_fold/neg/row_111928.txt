It's easier to get better when I admit it.I am doing this so I can admit how I have been feeling and try to come to terms with it.

So, for the past two months, I have been battling depression. Some days I can't even get out of bed. It takes a lot of energy to brush my hair or shower. I have to take sleep pills to sleep, and lately I have been taking too many at bizarre parts of the day because sleep is better than real life for me. I have been self harming because that is the only thing that makes me feel less numb. I put on fake smiles and laugh like usual because I am afraid for someone to notice how I really feel. 
The thing that has been the worst for me is the intense suicidal thoughts I have been experiencing. I have experienced them in the past, but this time they have been different. Extremely worse. No matter what I do, that is all I think about. They are so frequent. Until one day they went away. The thoughts stopped for two days. But they came back today, the strongest they have ever been. I just- I don't think that I am strong enough to fight them anymore. It's like over the past two months they have been ripping me apart. Tearing down my will and my strength. Making me so weak that I can barely walk. I have been trying to hold onto the last bit of strength I have against the thoughts. But it just slipped past my fingertips. And now, they are so strong and I am so weak. I just can't keep fighting against. I am being tempted, teased. And I am a hair's length away from giving in to them. It's like if someone were running away from a serial killer. And they used all their stamina running. And the killer begins to get closer because they don't have enough strength to put one foot in front the other. So, they stop running. Because they know they wouldn't of been able to escape anyway, so they embraced that they were going to die and stopped running. I think I'm about to stop running. Because my legs won't even lift to continue to run. That is how weak I am.
