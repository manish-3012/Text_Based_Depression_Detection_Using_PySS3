I just want the pain to stopFor too long I've suffered from trauma and harassment. The memories flood and I can never escape them, and that drives me to the edge. People don't understand. I'm not selfish. It hurts when people say that, I just don't know what to do or where to go. People just don't understand. I don't expect them to. Ever since I was born I was abandoned, and got teased throughout my whole school life. Now that I'm about to graduate, the toll on my families neglect gets to me, and I almost have no energy or motivation to fight back anymore. I just want the pain to stop.
