Unconscious self harm.This is really scary. I basically self harmed myself without my conciousness knowing it.

I haven't drunken water for 2 days in a 30C warmth wearing hoodie and long jeans. Today when I woke up I almost puked, felt dizzy, shaked, migraine and feeling really shitty. All I could think about was water as well. I kinda crawled out to the kitchen and forced like 5dl of water into myself, took some ibuprofen and went to sleep again. Ukkh.
