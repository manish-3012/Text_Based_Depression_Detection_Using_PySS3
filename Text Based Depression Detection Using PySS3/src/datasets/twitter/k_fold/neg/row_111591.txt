why am i here?I can't stand It. I can't even use Instagram anymore. Everyone celebrating their anniversaries or an appreciation post for their s/o. I can't hold a Fucking relationship, job, or hobby. Hell, I'm turning 20 this coming fall and I haven't even attempted driving let alone getting a licence, or even a non drivers id. I've only looked into college. (And even that was short lived). I hoard things that I think I can fix or make better. I want to kill myself, ya know? Just make me non-existent. Cut every damn string from my body and be a memory. But that's selfish as hell. I don't even want to imagine what that would do to my friends and family.
