I don't want to kill myself but I'm in a situation in which most depressed people would've done it without a second thought.I sometimes think about suicide but I'd never want my parents and loved ones to feel sad after it, so I've never done it. Today I got into an extremely heated argument with them and it got to a point so that I couldn't care less if they felt sad or not. I was walking along the train track waiting for it to come, thinking "I should do it. But I don't want to. I have nothing to live for. I still wanna live. Life is fun. But I hate everyone. Noone loves me and I want my parents to feel sad because they made me feel like I'm not good enough to be alive."

I couldn't do it. I don't want to die. I don't want those small good things in life to disappear. I want to keep going to see what comes next. Not living is boring and stupid. My life is not constant sadness, but like 8:2 sadness/happiness and that happiness somehow keeps me going. Why is this happening? Why do I want to suffer? Why can't I just end this shit for good? Help?
