im afraid and lost and im scared of what i might doi just feel alone. im tired of watching everyone else be happy and having the life i wish i could have.  i want to die but im scared.  the only way ive managed to make it this far is my dependence on my meds. i just want to give up. i dont even know what else to say. i just want to die
