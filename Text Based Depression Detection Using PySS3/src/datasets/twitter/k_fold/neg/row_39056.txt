Iâ€™m the sort of person who should commit suicide.I have truly hurt and betrayed people in a way which is fairly unforgivable. I know everyone says that there is always a way out and people who care about you but it would honestly be wrong for me to be happy or productive. Some decisions you make are fixed, permanent and mean that you shouldnâ€™t get a second act in life, thatâ€™s the real world. Honestly the only morally viable thing for me to do would be to commit suicide.
