There is no treatmentI'm a guy diagnosed with ASPD/NPD. I know I hurt people, i am hurting everyone but i can't help it. I've been abused since a young age, BY EVERYONE. My dad used to beat me, choke me, he would cuff me and beat the shit out of me. One time, i shat myself at school, the teachers made me stand in front of the classroom and everyone laughed at me. When I was 9, someone's dad had beaten me at school because a classmate had pulled the kid's trousers down. When I was 14, depression and suicidal thoughts kicked in. I attempted suicide countless times, and i wish i had died. Then at 16, my dad had brought home a puppy, he was cute and i liked him. But my dad was abusing him and one day when I came home from school, the dog was gone. Depression came back, i got to the point where i was fat and my dad laughed at me all day. Then my girlfriend came, I lost weight and I felt powerful again. I love her, in my own way but I love her. I did things to her that wish I could take back. I have nothing, i am a broken soul and i feel like there's two people inside me. There's me, the one writing this right now, a broken soul who wants to do good and be a better person, and then there's the monster, who wants to hurt people. I have nothing left, and suicide is the best option, i'm tired of having to fight myself. 
I wish I could take everything back, i wish all the neighbors who saw me getting beaten by my dad wouldve reported him to the police. There's no life for me. I feel anger, frustration, sadness and that's all.
