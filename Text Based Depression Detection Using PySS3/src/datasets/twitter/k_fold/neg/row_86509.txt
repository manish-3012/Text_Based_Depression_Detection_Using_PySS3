I don't want to live to twenty.Only 22 days, thereabouts, until my 20th. That's my deadline, I guess. Maybe setting one will finally make me able to take the next step. It's not that I don't want to be twenty. It's that I don't want the idea that there's another year ahead. Another year of soul-crushing loneliness. Another year of self-hatred. Another year of wanting to die. I don't want there to be a future for me, because I know it won't ever be a good one. 
I'm the only person I've met in my entire life that I truly think is hopeless. I see nothing in myself. An ugly, toxic piece of shit dead set on the path to my inevitable empty funeral. And a few days ago, it finally set in. I'm just not getting the return on investment I need. I'm unloved--no family, no lover, and hardly any of what youd call friends--and honestly pretty unlovable (ugly face, ugly body, ugly personality: the trifecta) and considering love is one of the only things that keeps me going, I guess I just realized how meaningless it all is. I just can't keep living for the people I care about and love anymore. Its just not enough.
So thats where I'm at. I have 22 days to either man up and bite the literal bullet, or wimp out and keep living this hell I begrudgingly call my life. Here's hoping
