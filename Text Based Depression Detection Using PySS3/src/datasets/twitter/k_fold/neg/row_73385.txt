Just another person out of many who just doesn't see the point of livingTo start this off... I am not lonely. Never have been lonely. But even though I am surrounded by people who I know care about me most of the times I just _cannot_ care back. I am void of emotions and I'm afraid I'll just end up hurting everyone close to me by being an insensitive asshole

The only person I can care about most of the times lives a few countries away and I cannot be with them. And for the majority of my daily existence even caring about them is more than I am capable of. They're better off without me

I want them to be happy, move on and find someone to love but at the same time I know that it'll make me immensely sad cause I'm a pathetic cunt. Still you don't tell someone that you'd kill yourself if you cannot be with them, they do not deserve to hear that.

But I don't see much of a point to go on. Like really, what is the point? I cannot care about people. I have no motivation. No will to do anything except hope I exscape this nightmare of existence but never believe I will

Even so part of me also doesn't want to kill myself because I'm still holding on to that hope that I can function normally some day. But lately I've been considering suicide more.
