Suicidal thoughts kick inHello everyone, maybe some of you saw me on previous post or comments, I give a lot of support
But suicidal thoughts hit me aswell

I had very long hair, my mom cut it, now I have mid-longhair She said I looked like a homeless, a hobo

My dad said she was right
I wasnt Happy about it
It's not only about my hair, it's also because they shamed me a lot because I told them some lies about University in the beginning, I said time ago that I did an exam but It wasnt true, I lied because I was afraid of telling them that I didnt want to study

I can understand that they got angry but they shame me a lot, my mom said awful things about me, those words came from a moment of anger but they still affect me

The day after this shit, I receive a call for a job, what a coincidence, I accepted and I'm starting in June
Dont know if I'll continue studying
But I'm very tired of living and I fear I'm gonna be a wage slave
So I'm thinking about suicide because I'm so tired of being shamed for who I am, it's hell

Thanks for giving your time to reading this
