Girlfriend left me. I know it's stupid and I'll get over it and all that but it doesn't change that I feel this way.I don't know what I'm expecting anyone to say or do. My girlfriend left me because of my porn addiction. It is something I've been struggling with since I was a teenager. She thinks it means that I don't really love her and that I would be happier without her. I wish I could stop, I wish I wasn't an addict but I am. I don't know what to do. I feel so horrible and perverted. I feel like I'm fat and annoying and will never meet anyone I love as much as her again. I don't know if I'm a bad person for not being able to stop or if she's a bad person because she didn't support me.

She will text me talking about how much she loves me and how happy I make her. Then later that day talk about how much I hurt her by "wanting someone else". I can't stand it. I just want to end it. I know I'll never meet anyone like her again.

I've relapsed into my alcoholism and binge eating. I've been able to stop drinking for a few days but I know I will start up again soon. I attempted suicide as a teenager but failed. My parents found me. We never talked about it since it happened.

I don't know what to do, I don't know what I'm hoping anyone here will say. Idk I just have no one to open to because I'm a pathetic loser. All my friends are more like drinking/smoking buddies. No one loves me. I just want someone to tell me that they understand, that I'm not an idiot.

Thanks for reading this to anyone that does. It
