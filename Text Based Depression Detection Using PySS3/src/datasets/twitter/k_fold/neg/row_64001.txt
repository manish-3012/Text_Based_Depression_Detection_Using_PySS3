AFSP Out of the Darkness Community WalksHey everyone--I don't know if this is appropriate, so mods, please feel free to delete it if it is not. 

I just wanted to draw some attention to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP). Many of you probably already know about this organization, but if you don't, they do some amazing work. I am doing a walk in my city (Winston-Salem) very soon (on September 12th) and wanted to raise awareness, for those who don't know about it!  there are tons of activities all across the country. I know many of you here on SuicideWatch want to do something to help, so this is an easy and meaningful way to help to prevent suicide, in addition to all of the loving support that you all give on this site. 

The American Foundation for Suicide Prevention was founded in 1987 and works to raise awareness for suicide and fund projects related to research and prevention. From their website: 

* Supporting research that is improving our understanding of suicide and its prevention. Since 2000, AFSP has invested over $10 million in new studies, including research into treatments for people who are depressed and suicidal.
* Providing education and information about depression and suicide to professionals, the media and the public through workshops, trainings, the AFSP website, videos, publications, brochures and public service announcements. AFSP's PSA, "Suicide Shouldn't be a Secret," has reached 90 million television viewers.
* Publicizing the magnitude of the problems of depression and suicide, advocating for policies and legislation that can help prevent suicide and working to eliminate the stigma surrounding mental illness and suicide.
* Offering programs for survivors of suicide loss that can be of assistance and involving survivors in suicide prevention. AFSP survivor initiatives include the National Survivors of Suicide Day program, which was broadcast to over 175 communities and was simulcast on the AFSP website, the Survivor e-Network and trainings for survivor support group facilitators.

Anyway. For those of you looking for a way to help out/prevent suicide IRL, this a great way to do that. Their website:
