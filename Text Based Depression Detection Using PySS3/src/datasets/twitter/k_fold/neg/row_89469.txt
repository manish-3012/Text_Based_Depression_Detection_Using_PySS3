People only care about me when I offer them something. Now I need help and there's no oneMy life has gone to shit in the matter of like an hour. I've been working so hard this year to get into my dream industry that I've been losing hair and sleep. Come to find out I have a mark on my background check that doesn't make any kind of sense to me. I found it by pure chance. But with it being there, I can't get into the industry I want to be in.

I left my job today, literally this morning, so I'd be able to devote myself to full time school and finally get this done with. But with this, it's pointless. I have no future and I'm unemployed. And I don't know where to go from here.

Not only that, but a person in my family who I've gone so far as to change my name to avoid... now has my new name. I don't know how, and I don't know who in my circle of "friends" let this leak. But it's terrible. 

I spent so much effort into making sure I could get this semester done. So much effort into being safe from this person. All down the drain. In one hour. And I'm upset. And I want to be told things will be alright. And I can't get that. I have to *ask* for it directly. I feel like everything i've said to people today has been screaming out for help, for anything! And no one fucking bothers.

My future's fucked. No one gives a shit about me. Like what's the point.

Left friend group chat after saying only reason I haven't offed myself is because I couldn't handle another hospital bill. No one's said shit to me. No one's reached out. What's wrong with me? What's wrong with people? I'm just not fucking worth the effort? What's the fucking point to any of this? I'm done.
