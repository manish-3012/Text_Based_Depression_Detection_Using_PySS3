I feel alone with my problemsI have no one to talk to who will actually care about what I say. My friends have their own shit going on that they don't even bother reaching out to me. The meds I'm on aren't working and I havent been switched off even though I've told the doctor. While my roommates ten feet away, I've been choking myself in my bedroom until I see black. Rinse, repeat. I just want to stab myself in the arm so I can ask her to call an ambulance for me. At least then she'll care because she'll have to.
