Just need to put this outI'm 19y Old, been depressive since 13, but i always managed to be ok. In the last year or so living on my house was getting impossible, and since i lived in a small city it was hard to get a job good enough to move out. So, 2 months ago i taked a risk and moved to a bigger city, a have some friends and family here and my cousin invited to live with her until i was able to have my own place, i've come because bigger city = more oportunities. In this time things we're getting better, sadly i didn't get a job yet, but things we're working, i even have a girlfriend now. But this morning my cousin came to me and said she couldn't have me anymore because her fiancee doesn't accept another man living with her. I've considered suicide other moments of my life, but this time i'm leaning so much into this cause i just feel that i can't take to go back home and i have nowhere else to go.
