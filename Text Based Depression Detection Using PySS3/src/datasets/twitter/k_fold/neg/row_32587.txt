I cant stop thinking about what happenedSo as I have posted about, my mum slit her wrists infront of me on sunday and it wont get out of my head. I am being made to go back to school and I cant even talk to my friends about it cause I dont trust em enough. I am having difficulty sleeping and cant concentrate at school. I was told I could have therapy but no one has said anything more about that so it is probably a lie to make me feel better. Does anyone know if it gets better?
