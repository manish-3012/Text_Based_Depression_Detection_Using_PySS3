can i can overdose?i have 24 small pills of antidepressants and i dont know if they can let me overdose  


there is some expired medicine i can have but i would have to pass my parents to get it and they might try to stop or question me. i think my meds are 250 or so but im not sure if they can get the job done. maybe some day when im home alone i could see if the expired meds do anything?
