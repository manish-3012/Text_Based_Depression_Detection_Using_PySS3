sorry i have to vent today i feel super suicidal. (23/f/uk)

at work my colleagues were acting like i had already left, like i don't exist (I am leaving/moving soon).

nobody at work or in my ''friends'' circle truly asks me how i am. sometimes i feel like they really don't care.. it feels like i am always there for them and when i need somebody to talk to or vent about something, they quickly turn the conversation to them and i end up giving them my attention and care and ignoring my own feelings because i am a good friend.

the main thing that has been ''triggering'' me lately is my low self esteem. this week i have cried because i believe myself to be so ugly. my therapist and i discuss this on a regular basis but i cannot imagine myself getting to a place where i don't think of myself as being so ugly.

it makes me so mad that i wasn't born beautiful. all i want is for people to look at me and think that i am pretty enough. i want to be pretty enough that guys want me. i know that i am kind, patient, clever and extremely loving. but guys don't want those things. they want someone who is beautiful.
