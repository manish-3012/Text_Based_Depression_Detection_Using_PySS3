Do first responders/LEO have to inform family if suicide is the cause of death?If I were to go, obviously I'd want to limit the amount of suffering caused to friends &amp; family. If requested through a note or something, would law enforcement respect my wishes to keep the true cause of death hidden or would they have to divulge that information if it was asked for?
