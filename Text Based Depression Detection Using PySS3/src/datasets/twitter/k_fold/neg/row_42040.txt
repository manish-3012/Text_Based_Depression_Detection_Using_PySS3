the only way I can't express it is that I don't understandI just feel so much pain, I'm suffering so much right now that my head feels like it's burning
I think I failed another year, it's 2 with this one and I'm such a disappointment
I haven't done anything in my 17 years alive because I always feel like this
and I feel tied to living because of my family and not really knowing a secure and painless way to kill myself
I don't wanna hurt my family, I'm currently living with my single mother who works her ass off to give me and my brothers a better life, and I wasted it all
and yeah she may be a pain in the ass sometimes but I still lover
and I know how much it would hurt her if her son killed himself
I don't even tell her I love her because I feel weird
i honestly wish I had shitty parents so I could feel no remorse on commuting suicide
this some low level effort to try and explain how I feel
in reality it's just a big mess up there, I don't know that I'm thinking and I don't know why I'm feeling this way and if it's ever gonna stop
i try to reach out to people but remember that I don't really deserve them and I would only be bothering them, and even if they help me I know what they would really be thinking "this dude is so disgusting, but I guess it would be rude not to help him so I'll do it"
I'm not stupid, I know when people don't like me and I know when they care only because it's morally correct
fuck
I wish someone reads this
