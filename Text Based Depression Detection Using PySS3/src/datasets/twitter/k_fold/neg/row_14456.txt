I don't know what to do with myselfHave you ever been so upset that you just don't know what to do with your body? All I want to do is get blackout drunk, get high out of my mind or cut myself but I can't do any of those things right now. I hate this feeling of wanting to escape my mind and body. I've resorted to punching myself but it's only satisfying for a few seconds and I don't want to end up with bruises all over my body from doing it too much. Seriously what else can I do to get some fucking relief?
