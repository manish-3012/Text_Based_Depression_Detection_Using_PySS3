No longer happy unless on drugsI'm 18 and I've had a shitty life after seeing the doctor for a wreck I was passenger to a few months ago and being crippled temporarily I got a bunch of painkillers. I don't have an addictive personality and I only do these on the weekend, but I'm going to jump off a tower soon. These pills are all I have nothing matters when I'm in that state of mind. A normal life as a productive citizen no longer intrest me.
