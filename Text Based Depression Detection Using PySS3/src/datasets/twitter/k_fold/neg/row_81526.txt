The light in my life has gone outAll my fucks ups have finally gotten the best of me. Every chance i've had to be happy has been ruined by my fucked up brain telling me to do things that i shouldn't have done. I'm done with this life and want it to be over. There's nothing for me in this world, and it's time i left it behind.
