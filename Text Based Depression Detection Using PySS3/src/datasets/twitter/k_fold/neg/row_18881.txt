No longer a matter of if, but whenIâ€™m going to do it once Iâ€™ve got all of the finer details figured out. I am so tired of living like this. My hair is starting to fall out from my eating disorder. I have no energy and just zero interest in life outside of my child. 

Literally the only reason Iâ€™m even holding out so long is to figure out the rules of my life insurance policy, and to make sure I live to see her birthday. 

I am entirely, and completely alone. I have been crying out for help repeatedly and nobody cares. They go about their lives and expect you to do the same.  I can scream out that I havenâ€™t eaten more than 500 calories in two days and theyâ€™d go back to talking about their failed relationships. 

I am a dumping ground for men and women. I mean nothing to anybody. People feel comfortable projecting their feelings into me even though itâ€™s excruciating. My head hurts constantly. I can barely pay attention to anything. 

I am nothing. I have nothing. Iâ€™m worth nothing. I hate nothing more than the sight of my own face/body. Iâ€™m an idiot who doesnâ€™t deserve to live and once Iâ€™ve got the courage to not be a fucking shit stain Iâ€™ll do it. 

And it wonâ€™t mean anything to anybody beyond what meaning they derive that can be applied directly to their own lives. â€œOh, Iâ€™m so sad. Oh, this is so upsetting to meâ€ I hate them all. I hate myself the most but I hate all of them too. 

The only person in this that I donâ€™t hate is my child. Sheâ€™s the only time I feel love and like life has meaning. But I can see that my mental health is ruining her perfection. Sheâ€™s all love and joy and goodness and I donâ€™t deserve to be around her, let alone mother her. She deserves the entire world and the longer Iâ€™m around Iâ€™ll ruin her. 

And this is just me screaming into the void. Because Iâ€™m done.
