I'm trying to write my two goddaughters a letter they can read after they've grown up some more.I will end my life tonight but I feel especially bad for those two little balls of love.

It's just really hard, I want to leave something that matters to them. There's so much to say but I don't know what I should focus on, they might even resent me and just burn the letters but that's their own valid choice.

I just want to somehow summarize everything they mean to me and tell something about myself, how I'm so sorry that I failed them and everyone else.

I want to pour my heart and soul into these two letters but I'm afraid of saying something stupid/worthless or accidentally leaving something important unsaid.

So please, answer honestly. What would you've wanted to hear from a deceased person that wrote a letter specifically for you?
