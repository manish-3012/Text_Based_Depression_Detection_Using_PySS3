there is no future i would choose over death20F over the past few years i've lost everything i ever loved, i have no direction in life, no hope for improvement. life does not get better, it gets worse. i'm tortured by rumination and suicidal thoughts both when i am awake and asleep. i self sabotage everything, subconsciously i wanted to push everything away so i could die with fewest people affected. my personality is completely hollowed out, i am a shell of a human being. i have no goals or drive anymore. i am a walking ghost. the remainder of my time is spent thinking about dignified exits. if i speak out i am called manipulative or threatening by my family. 

there is no future i would choose over death. there is no medication i would take to preserve my life. i despise this planet, and i see no value in suffering for the remainder of my days to preserve my family from the pain of my passing. i have been suffering for many years and i continue to reach new breaking points. i have nothing left for me here.
