Not quite there yet, but I feel as though Iâ€™m getting close again [M20]I donâ€™t know what to do anymore. Iâ€™m a failure to my parents. Iâ€™m a burden to them. Iâ€™m ruining my relationship of a year and a half. Every little thing sets me off now due to my insecurities so weâ€™re constantly arguing. I get afraid of things that could or couldnâ€™t happen. When I was younger I had such an imaginative brain and used to dream of being a novelist or filmmaker, but now itâ€™s a curse. Iâ€™m constantly flooded with thoughts of all the bad things that happen or could happen to me. It sounds stupid, but I hear voices. They stopped for a long while but theyâ€™re back again. I know of so many people that have killed them selves and quite a few that want to/came close. Itâ€™s gotten to the point to where Iâ€™m desensitized to it and the idea of killing myself doesnâ€™t hurt anymore. Iâ€™m embarrassed of where my mental state is so I donâ€™t go to my parents for help. Iâ€™ve tried to do it at least four different times in the past couple months. Iâ€™m not afraid of killing myself but Iâ€™m afraid of what it will do to my family so I endure day-to-day. I donâ€™t know what to do anymore, which is why I came here I guess. Iâ€™m sorry for the rant.
