Doesn't matter the help I get, the stressful headaches and depressive episodes won't go away.I just want nothing more than not to feel like the way I do. I get constant pains in my head that brings me into suicidal thoughts and no matter what prescription I take or therepy I have it won't go away.

I've made it routine at work to hide away for 10, 15 or 20 mins to recollect myself because I cant cope with myself. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up. I constantly feel upset waking up on an afternoon because I'm alive. I just want to be dead.

I bought myself a backpack and filled it with equipment to kill myself when I head cross country by myself. I've gathered everything i own and treasure and I'll be dropping them off to others when I leave this weekend. I dont want to be here at all anymore.
