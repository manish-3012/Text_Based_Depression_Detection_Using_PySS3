First post hereHy, its my first ever post here but i think i want to do this.

I'm 16 years old with no reallife friends, I'm bad in school and my dad thinks I'm a disappointment due to me always being on my computer. I think my pet will die anytime because of me not taking good care of him.

I think only one jump, one cut or one step could end all this. The school would make a short announcement and then life would go on. Maybe even better than bevor.
