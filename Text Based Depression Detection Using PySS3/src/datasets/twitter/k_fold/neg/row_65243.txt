Future and friendsI really don't want this post to just end up being an over-emotional whinge binge, even though that's technically what it is, but fuck it. First off, I wouldn't say that I would ever kill myself, too many reasons that I wouldn't want to, though the reason I posted this here was because it was bothering me so much to points where I've actually thought about it, and I hate myself for that. I really can't see myself succeeding in the future, I'm not gonna say I see myself as homeless or anything but, I really don't feel like I'm gonna get anywhere in life. Truth is, I'm shit. I suck at subjects like Math and Physics, both of which are considered useful subjects. I have a math exam coming up on Monday, and I'm not stressed or confident, I can't actually describe it properly but I just think I'm going to do terribly and let my teacher and parents down, and I *really* don't want that to happen. It's my own fault though, I'm nowhere near as smart as all my friends who are actually good at math and science and tons of other subjects. I managed to make a fool out of myself when answering a physics question because I couldn't think about it properly because I was too busy stressing out over my teacher and a few other people looking at me like I was a fucking dipshit since It was simple when you actually think about it, which I felt like at the time. Fuck though, as for friends, I get on with them but at the same time I always feel awkward because In someways, I feel like I'm being too clingy most of the time and that they don't want me there. I actually left a different group of friends and I still feel fucking guilty about the fact that I'm not friends with them anymore, gues that's a different story though. At this point, I just don't know what to do, It's a case where I'm sick of myself but I don't wanna do anything drastic.
