I genuinely want to disappearIâ€™m diagnosed with anxiety depression and OCD.  Ive had these feelings for as long as I can remember. I donâ€™t want to go through the whole production of dying because I donâ€™t want to hurt anybody around me or attract myself any attention. I do want to disappear from this earth, though. I donâ€™t want to be living here. Maybe somewhere else in a different body, in a different world But not here, not in this body.
