I am full of so much guilt and want to dieI did a lot of fucked up things to someone really close to me. I never realized how wrong I was until they died. I blame myself for their death. Honestly I fucking hate everything about me and the only reason I stopped self harming is so I don't get kicked out. I feel like I deserve to die, but I just want these thoughts to go away. I can't afford help and everything hurts. Honestly, I don't know why I'm writing this. I kind of just want you guys to tell me fucked up shit so I feel even with what I did. If that makes any sense
