Always looking for suicide stories in my townI always look for the suicide stories in my town seeing if I could do what they did because if it worked for them it's gonna work for me 

I don't want to do it but I'm drawn to the stories and I am always considering copying anything I see 

Its only a matter of time before I do it I've walked halfway to a place where someone jumped before I realised what I was doing and I turned back 

Just wanted to get my feelings out to people who understand
