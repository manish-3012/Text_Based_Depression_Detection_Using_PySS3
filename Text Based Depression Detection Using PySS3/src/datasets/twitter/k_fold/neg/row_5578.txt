On the verge of giving up. I feel like I could take myself anytimeIt began when I was 20. Now I am 28, I am on the verge of giving up. I don't have anything left, and unless something magically happen, I think I will run out money for food in 1 or 2 weeks.

It's not that I don't try. I do my best over the years, but keep failing. It seems all things are there to bring me down. One by one, all important people left my life.

The urge to end my life is now stronger than ever. I literally think about it like 24/7. I keep questioning my sanity, and I think I could just suddenly end it all.

I am scared, and anxious. But I still wonder what to do next. Well, what now?
