Should I tell anyone I attempted to kill myself?About a month ago I attempted to kill myself by taking a handful of  flurazepam. The pills were too old and dissolved, so they had no effect. I mentioned this subtly to my mom, but she never mentioned it. I was going to mention it to a counselor at school, but she wanted to go put me in a program for a week, so I never ended up telling her. I have been dealing with a multitude of both mental health issues and person things as well. I canâ€™t afford to take any time of school, as Iâ€™m already struggling, and my GPA has dropped. Is it a big deal if I donâ€™t tell anyone about this?
