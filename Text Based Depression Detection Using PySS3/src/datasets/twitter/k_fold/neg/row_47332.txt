Does anyone else feel like dying just so that they don't have to have another shitty birthday?My birthday is next month and I am literally dreading it. Last year I was in a homeless shelter for my birthday--there was no celebration. This year is probably going to be the same. 

My abusive ex who put me in the shelter wanted to see me, I said no. Was I supposed to say yes because I was so desperate? Someone I met in the shelter wanted me to tell the staff. I said no because I only trusted her about 80% (which is pretty good for me since I have trust issues)--months later she proved my gut instincts right. 

Because it's not the shelter's job to celebrate an adult's birthday--they have limited resources as it is. They are nice enough to give me a bed &amp; that's plenty.

**I don't want to have another birthday. I hope I die before my birthday. Dying in my sleep would be the best birthday present ever.**

Only I'm not a child anymore. And the thought of my birthday only causes me fear. It's the day I feel fear.
