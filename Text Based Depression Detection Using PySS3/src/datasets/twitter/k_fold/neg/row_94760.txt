Stretched to my limitsI lost my job and now I'm about to lose everything else because I was only barely keeping up before. 
I have had really bad depression my whole life and sometimes go through weeks of fighting the urge to end it. This time it has all got to be too much, I can't see the light at the end of the tunnel. I don't know what I am doing but I know I don't want to be here.
