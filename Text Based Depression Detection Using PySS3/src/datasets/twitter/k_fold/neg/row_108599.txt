My mom just yelled at me after having one shit ass day at work.I donâ€™t mean to ramble here, but I recently pissed my mom off and she yelled at me. Very angrily.

 I have had such a shitty day at work and a shitty past few weeks, but itâ€™s not like that matters to her.

If I didnâ€™t have to deal with bullshit work all goddamn fucking day and then come home to more fucking yelling, it wouldnâ€™t be a big deal. But this is it. Iâ€™m so ready to fucking kill myself. Who cares anymore? I donâ€™t.

I mean, at the end of the day, she does care about me. I just donâ€™t understand why she would want to be so goddamn mean like this. But at the same time, I feel like I finally have the balls to kill myself. To get myself out of this stupid bullshit world.

I hope I do make my mom cry and feel guilty over what she did. She deserves it.

It makes me fucking laugh to think about how sad she would be to find my dead body hanging in our house.
