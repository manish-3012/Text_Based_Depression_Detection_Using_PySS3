Finally, the time for actionNo bullshit. Dying on monday. I am tired of living only to work, be scorned by the vast majority of persons around me, and generally be bored and unhappy. 

I know that I am not depressed because the soft siren call of death has always been a loyal companion. Sitting in second grade armed with a pencil to my head, I thought not "Goodbye cruel world!" but "I wonder what death is like." Maybe better than watching the seconds accumulate into minutes which snowball into long hours. Time spent wasting away. Physically? Mentally? Yes and yes. But that's not the important part. Just the perpetual seeking and chasing and ultimate failure at every turn. In the rare instance when things did not go so badly, a sense of anticlimax pervaded.
