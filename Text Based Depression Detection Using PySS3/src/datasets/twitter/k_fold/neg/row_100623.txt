Really need to talk to someone/get some feedback.I'm 18, almost 19 right now. When I was 17 I was severely suicidal and depressed for most of the year. I was in partial hospitalization programs, taken out of school for most of the year, and when my suicidal ideation became very bad, I was hospitalized in March of 2016. I have severe MDD, GAD, and PTSD. The PTSD, thank god, has gone into remission. 

Being hospitalized was probably one of the worst things I've ever been through. It was honestly horrible and it's now a big motivating factor against me wanting to kill myself, since I'd rather just suffer and be suicidal than have the chance of being hospitalized again. 

This past year though, I went off to college, and was successful! I did well in school, and was able to live on my own, make friends, and just exist as a not mentally ill human being.

However though, I started having suicidal thoughts about a week and a half ago. I don't consider myself depressed right now. They are so intense though, to the point where suicide is the only thing I think about for most of my day. It's so, so, so discouraging. I honestly thought that I was getting better but now I genuinely just want to end it all again. It came out of nowhere, and it came on so intensely. I am so afraid by that. 

I'm starting to think that because I'm suicidal again that I should just end it all because what's the point if I'm never going to be better no matter how much I try. I take my meds, I see my therapist, I literally try to do everything right and I'm still crippled by this disease. I hate it so much. I just want relief from it. Maybe I'm not cut out for existence. I probably have some fucked up genetic defect with my brain that shouldn't be passed down. 

I'm like, considering going to the emergency room right now, but I'm in this summer class and it's still going on for a week and a half and I'm terrified of losing money by basically failing it if I have to go do treatment stuff. 

I also emailed my therapist earlier today about being very suicidal, but he hasn't responded yet. 

I'm pretty sure that my medication is fucked up too. I've been on the same dosages of Lexapro and Abilify for almost a year now, but the Lexapro has completely killed my ability to orgasm and that in and of itself makes me so sad. I don't want to be on Lexapro. 

I'm just really scared right now. I feel like a massive failure for being suicidal again. I wish I wasn't in this summer class so I could go to the ER.
