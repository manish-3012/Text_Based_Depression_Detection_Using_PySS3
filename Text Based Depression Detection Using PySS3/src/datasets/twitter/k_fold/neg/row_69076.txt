I'm suicidal because I'm incompetent at everything.Ever since I was a child, I could always remember not having any personal strengths or hobbies. Some kids were gifted with intelligence or social skills but everyone had atleast one hobby that they enjoyed and excelled at. But not me. I didn't enjoy anything - in fact I hated everything. I tried piano, martial arts, swimming, and a variety of other things but I just ended up quiting all of them. I remember crying in front of my mom - pleading for her to unroll me in these activities that I just didn't want to do. I just naturally preferred to sit at home and laze around. I also have extremely poor social skills for a 17 year old. I can barely fucking talk to people and it fucking hurts me so bad. Like they'll say something and I just can't find a way to continue the discussion beyond a simple "uh-huh" type response. Because of this I have literally no friends. Nobody liked me growing up due to my social ineptitude and nobody likes me now. My dad, despite excelling academically, acts like a child and can barely speak himself - so I know why I am so retarded from a social standpoint. 

I'm also dealing with psychosis right now which makes my situation all the worse. It just doesn't seem worth continuing on this path of life. I feel like just injecting a load of Fentanyl into myself and dying. 

Sometimes people get bad hands in life - I was just unlucky to be one of the few that did. 

Nobody else has had to deal with this. I get weird looks from people that I don't know because of things I do when my psychosis flares up - and I fucking hate it. I'm been obtuse my entire life and it's not even my fault. I did nothing to deserve this. I don't deserve this. I feel like suicide is a compeltely rational thing to do in light of my circumstances and I've attempted before. 

Sorry for the wall of text but I'm looking for any shred of hope that might keep me alive.
