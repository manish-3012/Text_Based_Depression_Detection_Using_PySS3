Friend took their own life.I always thought I would be the first to go, but I never expected him to just do it.

I struggled with depression and suicide ever since I was 9 but all I had to go off of what he was going through was his lifestyle. He never spoke about it. He played games with us and made jokes. We had no idea. 5 years ago and the day before he did it there was nothing that changed. Cops flooded the house and my other friends told me what happened.

im going insane.
