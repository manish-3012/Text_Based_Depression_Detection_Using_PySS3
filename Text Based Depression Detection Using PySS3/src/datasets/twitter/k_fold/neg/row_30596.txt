Whatâ€™s the point.I hate my life. Iâ€™m a disappointment, and Iâ€™m a failure. Everyone hates, me, I have no friends. My family hates me because Iâ€™m not as good as my sister was. Iâ€™m being crushed under the weight of high school, expectations from my family, and a  job hour per week job. Iâ€™ve forgotten what it feels like to be happy.The only person who cares about me is my dog. Iâ€™ve thought about ending it, but it would make my dog sad. I know itâ€™s a bad way to go, but I know that life doesnâ€™t get any better from here. Give me a reason not to end it all.
