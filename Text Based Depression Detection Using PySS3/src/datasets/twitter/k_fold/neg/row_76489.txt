Sometimes I look up at the sky...Sometimes I look up at the sky on those days where the blue peeks out from behind the patches of towering, fluffy cumulus, with the sun illuminating the whole mosaic creating an image so beautiful that even the greatest artists desecrate it with their cheap imitations. On those days I look at the sky and think, if only I could die right now, in that last instant before the void, just for a moment, I could be the happiest person on earth.
