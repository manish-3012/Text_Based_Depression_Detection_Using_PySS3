My birthday is coming upAnd I'm not sure how to feel. I feel like ive been doing everything to get better, exercise, telling friends / family how I've been feeling, suicide hotlines, pretending to be happy. Nothing seems to work.

People usually say it gets better, just hold in there,  but how much longer do I have to hold on? It's been 8 years so far and I feel like I'm just steadily heading down hill. 

I don't know... when will people be ok with the fact that 20 years is plenty for me and now I want out? That i' d rather not live the rest of my life at some dead end job where I'll get little to nothing out of it.  

Who knows? Side note: if anyone has a truck and wants to hit me when I least expect it I would highly appreciate it thank you.
