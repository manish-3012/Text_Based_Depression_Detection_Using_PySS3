Don't You Just Love It (Rant. You can ignore)When you look for support, and all that happens is you get b*tched at by many different people? Like yes, I know Universe, for SOME reason it is wrong for me to want help and validation. Honestly, I came to reddit to find people who think like me, because I legit tried everywhere else, but instead, I just found more isolation and  shaming...because, YEAH THATS what I need right now. Not a med refill, nor enough money to afford therapy, just PLAIN OLD CYBERBULLYING should do the trick! While we're at it, why don't we make sure my anger issues towards myself come back?

I have cyberbullies. I am SO SICK of it. Just get a DAMN LIFE, already!
