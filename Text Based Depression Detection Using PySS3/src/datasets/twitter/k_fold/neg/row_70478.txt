I'm ending it tonightI was going to wait until the weekend but I just can't anymore. The last person who I hoped could help me get better never wants to see me again because of how sick I am, the closest friend I've ever had thinks I'm a monster and she's probably right. Once everybody goes to sleep I'm going to leave a note and hang myself. Goodbye everyone
