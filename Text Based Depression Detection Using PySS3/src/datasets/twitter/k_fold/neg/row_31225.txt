I'm going to do it. I'm sorryHey so. I am very calm right now. 
I think I have made the decision.

If I do it, this post will be a part of a series that I will leave behind for a dear friend of mine. I love her so much. 
Maybe for my boyfriend, too. To tell him I am sorry. 

I am a 20yr old college student near graduation. I can't find a decent internship. The only option I have will make me utterly misserable. 

I have tried. So. Hard. To find a job that I love. It seems that I am useless. It is hard to be surrounded by brilliant people while you are nothing compared to them. I got good grades, but the job market doesn't care about that. 

I failed getting an scholarship for an exchange program.

My boyfriend is utterly brilliant, and has a bright future. He feels overwhelmed by my depression, failure and suicidal tendencies. I feel worthless compared to him. He is one of the best things that has happened to me this year. The worst year of my life. I love him dearly. 

As for my family. They look at me with pity. They don't know what to do with me anymore. Therapy isn't working and the medication just makes me sleepy. If it is an accident it won't be that hard on them.

I don't have the will to fight. I will make it seem like an accident. Maybe after my birthday, or New Years. But everything is planned. 

Diana, I love you. If you are reading this, please do not meet me yet. You did not fail. It was me who did.  Take care of your nephew, he needs you even if you don't believe it.

As for my love. I'm sorry. Please have a wonderful life. You have a great heart and personality. You will find someone who is at your level someday. Please forget about me. It was a pleasure being yours after waiting for so long.
