Very very closeI've got schizophrenia and think everyone hates me, that I'm being watched all the time. Whether that's true or not doesn't really matter, every interaction I have reminds me how much I hate myself. The meds they give me also make me want to kill myself.

I'm thinking sodium nitrite, plus paracetamol OD, while partial hanging. After a bit to drink. 

I've got nothing to live for, honestly. Every day is agony.
