Every little problem makes me want to kill myself.Tiny useless shit gives me very much pain. I want to kill myself because my car is broken, i want to kill myself rather than clean my room, i want to kill myself whenever i have to do some hard shit or i lose or break something.

This is all simple shit that happens to everyone but all this kind of bullshit can cause very much pain to me. And there's no way to stop having this kind of shit since life is full of little problems for everyone.

I have other, bigger reasons for wanting to die which i might make better posts about but this was just a little thing that fucks me up very much.
