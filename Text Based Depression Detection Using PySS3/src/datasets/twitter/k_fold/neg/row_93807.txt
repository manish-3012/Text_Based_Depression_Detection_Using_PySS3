tv series death brought back suicidal feelingshi guys, im 14f and i have been battling depression and severe anxiety since i was about 9 years old. i recently finished watching 13 reasons why because i was finally in a good headspace and thought i could handle it. i was wrong. my favorite character died in the last episode. i felt such a close connection and loved a character who never even rlly existed, but his death felt so real and was jam packed with emotions strong enough to make anyone cry. im heartbroken, and everytime i think about it, burst into tears. i recently found myself thinking heavily on death, and how much i wish that i could just get sick and slowly die. its a shame, i was honestly doing so much better and everyone was so proud of me.. im hopeless right now. any and every piece of advice is highly appreciated ðŸ¤
