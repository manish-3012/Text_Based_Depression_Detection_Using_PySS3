What do you do?I want to beat this. It's been six years now, and the thoughts of kill yourself haven't left. I just told the first person ever since the thoughts have come, and he suggested I get help. I want to die but I don't know why. I have no reason to live? But I feel capable of giving myself a reason. However every time I get motivation to do something, anything, I lose it within the hour. Should I tell my parents and hope they don't react like I expect them too? How do I escape this hell that is only in my head?
