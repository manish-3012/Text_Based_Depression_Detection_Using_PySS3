How long until my cats eat my dead body?Iâ€™m planning on going out around Thanksgiving break, but I donâ€™t feel like doing my homework tonight so Iâ€™ll probably just do it now. 

I initially planned to put my cats in the bathroom or my sisters room so they donâ€™t devour my corpse because theyâ€™re both fat little shits and will literally eat out of the trash at 5am even if thereâ€™s tons of food left out for them. 

I searched Reddit and it says that cats will only eat you after a few days. Iâ€™m pretty sure my parents will find me within an hour or so, so do I need to move the cats out of my room? 

Idk, theyâ€™re the thing that Iâ€™ll miss the most so I wanted to be with them until the second I died, but now Iâ€™m reconsidering that because I donâ€™t want them to get sick from eating me. 

I know this sounds troll-y but itâ€™s a legit question. I care more than anything about those babies and I want to make sure Iâ€™m doing this right. 

Thanks in advance &lt;3
