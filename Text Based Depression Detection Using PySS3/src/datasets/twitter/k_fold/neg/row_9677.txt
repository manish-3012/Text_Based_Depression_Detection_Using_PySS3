I used to be so happy.I don't know what happened to fuck it up so bad but it did and now I feel like nothing matters. I want to kill myself more then anything. There is a full bottle of Potassium supplements that I could take right now but haven't. Does that make me weak? Does that make me cowardly? When I cut myself I barely ever go any deeper then the skin layer. Does that mean I'm a wimp? Does it mean my pain isn't real? The only reason I've made it this far is because of how many people would blame themselves. It's not their fault, it's mine, everything is my fault. I don't want my parents to find my body. I just need someone to hold and tell me things will be better but they are gone and don't care. I may not kill myself tonight but I don't know how much longer I'll last.
