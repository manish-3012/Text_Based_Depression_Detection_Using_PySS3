cannot decide when..My parents are visiting me right now, so I have to wait till Friday. And I want to be there for my husband. I love him and that the only thing that stops me from going through with it is thinking about how upset he'd be. But I can't hold on for longer. It's been more than a month or two now.. Every night I close my eyes I think about me hanging from a rope and that thought soothes me a lot. All the pain gone. I wish there were a way to reboot myself, but there isn't. I have no strength to live everyday. I force myself to wake up, to get ready, to go to work, to come back home and try to live a routine life. At work I think about not being alive anymore and that helps a lot.. The only solution I see is ceasing to exist.. I had begged for support but it is difficult to be taken seriously if you pretend that everything is fine externally.. All I yearned for is the feeling of being wanted, needed in his life.. I maybe oversensitive but all I wanted, only for a few months, only till the time was tough, was love, no 'jokes' about being happy when I am not around. Just a few words everyday about how much I mean to him. I fantasize about being in a fatal car accident, without hurting anyone else of course.. No one needs to know that I killed myself.. will be easier for everyone to get over it.. cannot be strong anymore.. not sure what to do.. and when to do it.. waiting till Friday seems impossible now..
