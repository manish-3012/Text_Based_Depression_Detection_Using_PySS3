I just want it to be overIâ€™ve been saying that I want to kill myself since senior year in high school. That was 3 years ago. Somehow Iâ€™m still trucking. These past 3 years have been really tough and itâ€™s not even something significant that has altered my life. Itâ€™s just rejection. Iâ€™ve been getting rejected a lot by women these past 3 years. At first it wasnâ€™t easy letting go of someone who didnâ€™t like you back, but now with the experience I have gotten over the years, itâ€™s quite easy to move on to a different girl. Iâ€™ve definitely missed some opportunities with women liking me and not realizing it. But now Iâ€™ll take any opportunity i can get as long as Iâ€™m attracted to them. Ive come along way being that shy, not confident kid who didnâ€™t know how to talk to girls. But still it hurts a lot. 

Iâ€™ve been left on read, ghosted, more recently I went on a date with a girl and she gave me a fake number afterwards. I donâ€™t understand what I did to deserve that and Iâ€™m not gonna lie it made me feel like complete shit. To make things worse, i went to a party this past weekend, got introduced to a cute girl. We talked for a bit. Asked to get coffee with her and got her number. The next morning i texted her â€œHey, it was nice meeting youâ€. She left me on read. That was Monday. Iâ€™m was talking to another girl that i met on tinder and have been casually texting this past week. We were supposed to go to a bar tonight but guess what? She cancelled on me. Probably done talking with her as well. Just my luck, same shit different day.  Now I matched with ANOTHER girl a couple days ago and we had coffee today. I thought it went well. Texted her that it was nice meeting her but havenâ€™t gotten anything back. I sent that 8 hours ago. Went on another bar date with some other chick. I thought it went well. She said she would text me today but I havenâ€™t heard anything from her and Iâ€™m expecting nothing at this point.

I donâ€™t know why I feel like I need a woman to feel happy about myself but I certainly feel alone. Itâ€™s not even the sex that I want. I just want someone to cuddle with in bed, talk to, and make laugh. The way Hollywood makes it, it seems so easy and achievable. But itâ€™s not. Every romantic scene that I see in TV just makes me feel shitty about myself and makes me think â€œwhy canâ€™t that be me?â€. Iâ€™ve tried tinder ever since it came out. Iâ€™ve maybe had a handful of successful dates? Maybe 3 or 4 first dates that went onto a second date? There was this one specific women that I connected with and I think she felt the same way. Too bad she moved across country, probably most likely wonâ€™t ever see her again. I felt the most compatible with her. But thatâ€™s just my luck I guess. I havenâ€™t had anything that felt like that since and that was in August. 

I know I should feel more appreciative because I know thereâ€™s a thousand guys out there that wish they could be in my position. But sometimes I wish i was in their position because honestly it doesnâ€™t feel any better maybe even worse. Iâ€™d like to think that Iâ€™m attractive, Iâ€™ve been told that Iâ€™m handsome. But I donâ€™t see it yet. Iâ€™m social, funny, approachable...i donâ€™t get what Iâ€™m doing wrong. People praise my humor and thatâ€™s the only thing i like about myself right now, the ability to make people laugh by being goofy. I go out, Iâ€™m trying to go out to more bars or just wherever to meet women. I have had so many failures in the dating game that i just feel hideous. I do have a crooked nose and i feel like thatâ€™s a big issue. Iâ€™ve gotten plastic surgery to fix it because people were making fun of me for in back in high school but itâ€™s still slightly fucked up. Who knows, maybe itâ€™s not as a big deal as Iâ€™m bringing it out to be. Maybe my standards are too high but Iâ€™ve always been told to never sell yourself short and always go for the best. And I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s gonna change. I may have fucked up early with being clingy as fuck to some women but I have definitely learned from my mistakes and rejections. Im adaptable. Iâ€™m always learning new things about the dating game but nothing seems to change. Same results. I think Iâ€™ve figured it out. Iâ€™m just used as a coping method for girls and thatâ€™s all. Whenever theyâ€™re down, they rely on me to cheer them up and I oblige. Iâ€™m like a gay best friend to them.

This year I have definitely gone out with more women than in previous years thanks to online apps. But nothing happens after the first date. I think Iâ€™m close to giving up. I dropped out of a huge university back in 2015 because I said some suicidal shit, mainly about my women problems. Iâ€™ve been at community college ever since and I am transferring to my cities university in the spring thatâ€™s about the same size as my old university, just a tad smaller. The girl to guy ratio is like 60:40 but I still donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll find anyone. People see me as this confident, funny guy on the outside , but they donâ€™t know how empty I feel on the inside. Talking to people wonâ€™t help as i already feel like my depression has consumed me and now Iâ€™m just waiting for the right time to kill myself. Iâ€™ve been exercising and focusing on school to see if it help me overcome this phase that Iâ€™m going through but I just find myself back to square one. I always expect the worst when a girl takes forever to reply back. I always think maybe I should have said something different. I always think that itâ€™s something that I did wrong. I always over analyze things. 

Im jealous of my sister. Sheâ€™s everything that Iâ€™m not. Sheâ€™s happy. Sheâ€™s married. Sheâ€™s living in a big city with a steady income. I donâ€™t see myself ever becoming like that. My parents always praise her and seem to favorite her more over me. Even more of a reason to kill myself.

I feel as if none of my friends care about me either. Whenever i to hang out with someone, ask for advice, or just want to talk i get left on read. I feel like i have no one. I thought maybe a change of scenery would help me but Iâ€™m starting to think that itâ€™s gonna make it worse. My goal is to move to Pittsburgh once I get my degree here in NC. Working for the major league team over there, the Pirates would be my dream job as Iâ€™m a huge baseball fan. But now, Im starting to think that it might not happen. I still live with my parents. I did terrible this semester in school, only got one A, Iâ€™m pretty sure i failed or got a D in my other two classes. Will probably be put on academic probation going into next semester.

I donâ€™t know what keeps me going. All i do now in my free time is drive around and listen to music that i enjoy in my car thinking about different things. What my life could have been if i didnâ€™t drop out my first university. Why i cant get a girlfriend. Why Iâ€™m such a fuck up. I do this every single damn day. I donâ€™t know if itâ€™s therapeutic but itâ€™s somewhat calming. Im such a fucking moron. I miss everything about my old university it but know that I will never ever go back to study there. I only go back up there to visit friends once a month or so because it is 6 hours away. I feel like they are the only friends I have left.

I just wish a loaded gun would drop right infront of me so I can just end it. Iâ€™ve started to look at gun permits and went to a gun store the other day and itâ€™s pretty expensive, looks like Iâ€™ll have to save up but Iâ€™m pretty bad at that too. Iâ€™ve started to look at the suicide success rate for guns and Iâ€™m guessing if I find the right gun, itâ€™s doable. Either itâ€™s that or Iâ€™ll just drive myself to my death but I know Iâ€™ll never have the courage to do that. Probably no one is gonna read all of this. Probably nobody cares but I feel like nothings gonna change. Iâ€™m starting to get that feeling about not giving a shit about anymore. I guess next semester will determine what i will do with my life. Hopefully I get rejected a bunch of times so i can get closer to finally killing myself. Can you blame me? I know Iâ€™m gonna keep trying because i have nothing to lose. Hopefully thereâ€™s gonna be a rejection that I will experience that will finally push me off the edge.
