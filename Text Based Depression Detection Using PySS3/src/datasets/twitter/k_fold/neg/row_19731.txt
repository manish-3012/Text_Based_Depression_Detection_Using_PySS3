I ran away from home right now and I donâ€™t know what to do.My mother is abusive so I stayed with my father and his parents for a little but they give me no space. He started yelling at me tonight too because he kept hounding me asking why Iâ€™m sad and what is wrong with me and I had enough so I walked about 2 and a half hours from their house and Iâ€™m holed up in a Kohlâ€™s bathroom. Theyâ€™ve been calling and texting me a lot but if I answer them theyâ€™re just going to scream at me a force me home and probably hospitalize me again. 

(Edit: When I say they give me no space I mean that my dad, mostly, doesnâ€™t listen to me when I say I need to be alone and blocks the door and corners me and refuses to listen when I try to tell him stuff, he things heâ€™s helping but just makes it worse and when he sees Iâ€™m not getting better he starts yelling at me asking why I never talk to him or why I wonâ€™t tell him anything)

Iâ€™ve tried calling my sister multiple times because she said sheâ€™d help me when I need it but she isnâ€™t answering and walking back to my motherâ€™s would take me probably until midnight or past because itâ€™s in the adjacent town and I donâ€™t know that Iâ€™d make the walk anyways. 

I just want to give up, I just wish they never had a second child, and I wish theyâ€™d let me talk instead of screaming at me every time I do something they donâ€™t like or just because they canâ€™t control their anger.
