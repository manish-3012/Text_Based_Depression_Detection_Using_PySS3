My life is a shit hole and I don't see way out of it.I'm 24 years old I have no friends (and I mean that, the only numbers that I have on my cellphone are my family and my therapist), I have no job, so I must move in with my parents, who were abusing me my whole life and I hate them, and this is a disaster for me, because
I have nowhere else to go, like I said, I have no friends. I'm just so hopeless on getting things done on my own, I'm like a child  and I hate myself for that. And I'm not only still a virgin, but I didn't even kissed a guy in my whole life, because I'm too ashamed of my body to get intimate with a man. I'm 24 years old and I have absolutely nothing, I'm not making any money and I don't have any job opportunities in the future, I don't a have a boyfriend and I will not have one because my body is too disgusting (it's not a weight issue,
I just have a lot of ugly stretch marks which can be removed only by very expensive medical treatment, and I don't have money for that), and no one even likes me, so I just sit at home all day, doing nothing. I have stomatch ache every morning, because I know I will waste another day. And it is not like this is just a rough path for me, I was like that my whole life, I was abused at school, and I didn't have friends then, I didn't have friends in high school and I didn't make any friends in college (which I spend alone in my room, how pathetic is that?). So I am alone my whole life, I mean like alienated and I just can't take it anymore, it is just too painful for me. My therapist is trying to help me, but she can't do that. And now I must move in with my parents, and since I have absolutely no job opportunities, I'm going to stay there until I finally die, after a life of alienation and each day suffering, as a friendless virgin. So why I should wait for that day and not finished it right now? It is just pointless.
