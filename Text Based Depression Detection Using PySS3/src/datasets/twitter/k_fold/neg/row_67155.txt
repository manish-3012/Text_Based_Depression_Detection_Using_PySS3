My friendMy friend wrote his first suicide note the other day. I found it in class and thought it was a joke till the school tracked it down to him. He has bipolar depression and talks about killing himself every once and awhile. What do I do to save him from suicide? His life at home sounds awful. His step dad tried to kidnap him as a kid. His family is low on money too. Iâ€™m at the time when kids my age start to get suicidal. This is one friend I want to keep! I have been praying for help. I need answers!
