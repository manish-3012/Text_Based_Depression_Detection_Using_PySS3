WhyLet me die, please. Let my pain end. I love you all, but please allow me to end my suffering. Itâ€™s unbearable. I hate myself. All of me. Every part. Iâ€™m broken. Iâ€™m Iâ€™ll. Please Lord.. what is my meaning..? I just want to be at peace in heaven with you. With my family members. Please. Life is not the same anymore. I need relief. 

I beg...

Let me free.
