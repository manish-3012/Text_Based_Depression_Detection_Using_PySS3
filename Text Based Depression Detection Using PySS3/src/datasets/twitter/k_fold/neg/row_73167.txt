I wish a previous attempt had succeededI'm at that point in my life where I wish one of my three suicide attempts had succeeded.

The first one would have been the most convenient to have succeeded. I jumped out of a moving car, but it wasn't going was enough. That was before college, before the suffering, the scars, the disappointment and disillusionment. It was before the two next attempts. It was before now.

I'm just getting to that breaking point again.
