so like, what nowso ive posted here before (a few times) when things have been shit n i felt like dying, but this is slightly different. 

last night i was 100% convinced i was going to kill myself. i had a plan, i had the means to do so and i was minutes away from doing it. i emailed a teacher that means a great deal to me, saying i was so sorry, that all the support given was such a privilege and i'm sorry i couldn't keep going. 

she emailed back almost instantly giving me the numbers of support lines, and of course forwarded my email onto higher members of staff who contacted my parents this morning. 

i didn't kill myself last night (obviously) my friend pretty much kept me in their car until i promised i wouldn't. 

i was asked to go into school today to see that teacher, who told me she had spent the entire night absolutely sobbing and did not sleep at all. my heart fucking broke. she begged me to go to the doctor for tablets and back to a counsellor. 

now previous experiences with a counsellor have gone as follows: 
'your life is perfect'
'you don't need counselling'
'why you even here?'

i feel like fucking shit still, and 100% are still suicidal, but im not going to kill myself today. i want to get better for her because it broke my fucking heart hearing her. 

do i go to the doctors? get kicked out of school like the senior members of staff are trying to do? what do i do? i can't keep living this life of purely survival with no enjoyment.
